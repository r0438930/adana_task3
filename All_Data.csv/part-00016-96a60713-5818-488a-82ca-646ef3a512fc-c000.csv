Jasper County is included in the [[Chicago]]-[[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]-[[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]], [[Illinois|IL]]-IN-[[Wisconsin|WI]] [[Chicago metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
The lands of present NW Indiana were explored by French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de LaSalle]]. At that time the area was inhabited by the [[Western Confederacy|Miami Confederation of Indians]]. Through White settlement, encroachment, and confrontation, the various indigenous groups were forced to cede their claim to the area. In October 1818, the Pottawattamies, Weas, and Delawares ceded their lands west of the [[Tippecanoe River]] to the government. In a treaty dated 23 October 1826, the Pottawattamies and Miamis ceded all their lands east of the Tippecanoe. A treaty dated 26 October 1832 with the Pottawattamies ceded control of the northwestern part of Indiana; on 27 October the Pottawattamies of Indiana and Michigan also relinquished all claim to any remaining land in those states.

Until the 1832 treaty of 1832, the future Jasper County area was not open to settlement; those who did come to Indiana before that time had flooded the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois through the [[Ohio Valley]]. Northwestern Indiana was also less desirable for initial settlement, the land being described as alternate swamps, sterile sand ridges and flat, wet prairies. It did proliferate in game, however, and eventually settlers found it. The first recorded settler was William Donahue, who located in present-day [[Gillam Township, Jasper County, Indiana|Gillam Township]]. He was a justice of the peace during the period prior to the county's establishment.

Although the settlers were sparse, the state legislature provided for two counties to be established in the area. An act dated 7 February 1835 described the boundaries of [[Newton County, Indiana|Newton]] and Jasper counties, although their governing structures were not established at that time. The area was attached to [[White County, Indiana|White County]] for political and civil purposes.

In 1836 all the area north of the [[Kankakee River]] was partitioned from Jasper as [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter County]]. By 1837 preparations were being made to create the Jasper County governing structure, with a county commission being elected that year. They first met in January 1838 at the house of Robert Alexander in [[Parish Grove Township, Benton County, Indiana|present-day Benton County]]. After that, the pro tem county seat was designated as the residence of George W. Spitler, in [[Iroquois Township, Newton County, Indiana|present-day Iroquois Township, Newton County]], where the first meeting was held in March 1839.<ref name=SHJC/> The official date of formation of the Jasper County government is given as 15 March 1838.<ref name=OICN/>

Jasper County was named for Sgt. [[William Jasper]], a famous scout for the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=Govt.

A state legislature act dated 29 January 1839 caused the consolidation of Jasper and Newton, with Jasper retaining the name, and Newton (for the time being) being erased, and the consolidated area being seated at the Falls of the Iroquois River, with the name of Newton (the community's name was changed to [[Rensselaer, Indiana|Rensselaer]] in 1844). In 1840 the [[Benton County, Indiana|county of Benton]] was formed from Jasper's area. In 1859 the county of Newton was revived but with smaller area than before, leaving Jasper in its present form.

===The Civil War===
As early as 1825, the majority of the population were against slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=Scudder, Horace E|publisher=Boston & New York: The Riverside Press, Cambridge|year=1888|location=Cambridge|title=Indiana: American Commonwealths|pages=235, 237, 438-400}}</ref> By the time of the [[American Civil War|War]], Jasper County was one of the few counties of Indiana that had a military organization under the law of 1855.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamilton Louis H. & William Darroch|publisher=Lewis Publishing Co.|year=1916|location=Chicago & New York|title=A Standard History of Jasper and Newton Counties Indiana, Vol. 1|page=159}}</ref> The war greatly affected Jasper County when 935 soldiers were enlisted on behalf of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. This was considered an impressive amount at the time with the average population around 5,000. Although there were several companies from Indiana, the [[9th Indiana Infantry Regiment]] produced [[Robert H. Milroy]], the \"Gray Eagle of the Army\". Milroy became famous for suppressing Confederate mountain rangers, which caused the [[Confederate Congress]] to declare a $100,000 bounty on his head. The 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment became known for its involvement in the [[Battle of Philippi (West Virginia)|Battle of Philippi]], one of the earliest battles of the Civil War at [[Laurel Mountain (West Virginia)|Laurel Hill]] (now known as Laurel Mountain).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamilton Louis H. & William Darroch|publisher=Lewis Publishing Co.|year=1916|location=Chicago & New York|title=A Standard History of Jasper and Newton Counties Indiana, Volume 1|page= 115,118}}</ref> In comparing the proportions of men able to fight, Indiana contributed more soldiers than any other state to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hoover Dwight W.|publisher=the Indiana University Press|year=1980|location=Bloomington|title=A Pictorial History of Indiana|page=93}}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|561.39|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|559.62|sqmi}} (or 99.68%) is land and {{convert|1.76|sqmi}} (or 0.31%) is water.<ref name=DC/> Until the middle of the 19th century when it was drained to make farmland, this county was part of the 2nd largest freshwater wetland in the US, with abundant flora and fauna.<ref>{{IMDb title|2522274|Everglades of the North}}</ref> This is caused by the [[Iroquois River]], one of the main tributaries of the [[Kankakee River]] that flows throughout Jasper County, a major water source for the area.<ref>{{cite book|author=Battle J.H.|publisher=F.A.

Jasper County is included in the [[Chicago]]-[[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]-[[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]], [[Illinois|IL]]-IN-[[Wisconsin|WI]] [[Chicago metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
The lands of present NW Indiana were explored by French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de LaSalle]]. At that time the area was inhabited by the [[Western Confederacy|Miami Confederation of Indians]]. Through White settlement, encroachment, and confrontation, the various indigenous groups were forced to cede their claim to the area. In October 1818, the Pottawattamies, Weas, and Delawares ceded their lands west of the [[Tippecanoe River]] to the government. In a treaty dated 23 October 1826, the Pottawattamies and Miamis ceded all their lands east of the Tippecanoe. A treaty dated 26 October 1832 with the Pottawattamies ceded control of the northwestern part of Indiana; on 27 October the Pottawattamies of Indiana and Michigan also relinquished all claim to any remaining land in those states.

Until the 1832 treaty of 1832, the future Jasper County area was not open to settlement; those who did come to Indiana before that time had flooded the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois through the [[Ohio Valley]]. Northwestern Indiana was also less desirable for initial settlement, the land being described as alternate swamps, sterile sand ridges and flat, wet prairies. It did proliferate in game, however, and eventually settlers found it. The first recorded settler was William Donahue, who located in present-day [[Gillam Township, Jasper County, Indiana|Gillam Township]]. He was a justice of the peace during the period prior to the county's establishment.

Although the settlers were sparse, the state legislature provided for two counties to be established in the area. An act dated 7 February 1835 described the boundaries of [[Newton County, Indiana|Newton]] and Jasper counties, although their governing structures were not established at that time. The area was attached to [[White County, Indiana|White County]] for political and civil purposes.

In 1836 all the area north of the [[Kankakee River]] was partitioned from Jasper as [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter County]]. By 1837 preparations were being made to create the Jasper County governing structure, with a county commission being elected that year. They first met in January 1838 at the house of Robert Alexander in [[Parish Grove Township, Benton County, Indiana|present-day Benton County]]. After that, the pro tem county seat was designated as the residence of George W. Spitler, in [[Iroquois Township, Newton County, Indiana|present-day Iroquois Township, Newton County]], where the first meeting was held in March 1839.<ref name=SHJC/> The official date of formation of the Jasper County government is given as 15 March 1838.<ref name=OICN/>

Jasper County was named for Sgt. [[William Jasper]], a famous scout for the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=Govt.

A state legislature act dated 29 January 1839 caused the consolidation of Jasper and Newton, with Jasper retaining the name, and Newton (for the time being) being erased, and the consolidated area being seated at the Falls of the Iroquois River, with the name of Newton (the community's name was changed to [[Rensselaer, Indiana|Rensselaer]] in 1844). In 1840 the [[Benton County, Indiana|county of Benton]] was formed from Jasper's area. In 1859 the county of Newton was revived but with smaller area than before, leaving Jasper in its present form.
 
===The Civil War===
As early as 1825, the majority of the population were against slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=Scudder, Horace E|publisher=Boston & New York: The Riverside Press, Cambridge|year=1888|location=Cambridge|title=Indiana: American Commonwealths|pages=235, 237, 438-400}}</ref> By the time of the [[American Civil War|War]], Jasper County was one of the few counties of Indiana that had a military organization under the law of 1855.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamilton Louis H. & William Darroch|publisher=Lewis Publishing Co.|year=1916|location=Chicago & New York|title=A Standard History of Jasper and Newton Counties Indiana, Vol. 1|page=159}}</ref> The war greatly affected Jasper County when 935 soldiers were enlisted on behalf of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. This was considered an impressive amount at the time with the average population around 5,000. Although there were several companies from Indiana, the [[9th Indiana Infantry Regiment]] produced [[Robert H. Milroy]], the \"Gray Eagle of the Army\". Milroy became famous for suppressing Confederate mountain rangers, which caused the [[Confederate Congress]] to declare a $100,000 bounty on his head. The 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment became known for its involvement in the [[Battle of Philippi (West Virginia)|Battle of Philippi]], one of the earliest battles of the Civil War at [[Laurel Mountain (West Virginia)|Laurel Hill]] (now known as Laurel Mountain).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamilton Louis H. & William Darroch|publisher=Lewis Publishing Co.|year=1916|location=Chicago & New York|title=A Standard History of Jasper and Newton Counties Indiana, Volume 1|page= 115,118}}</ref> In comparing the proportions of men able to fight, Indiana contributed more soldiers than any other state to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hoover Dwight W.|publisher=the Indiana University Press|year=1980|location=Bloomington|title=A Pictorial History of Indiana|page=93}}</ref>

According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|561.39|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|559.62|sqmi}} (or 99.68%) is land and {{convert|1.76|sqmi}} (or 0.31%) is water.<ref name=DC/> Until the middle of the 19th century when it was drained to make farmland, this county was part of the 2nd largest freshwater wetland in the US, with abundant flora and fauna.<ref>{{IMDb title|2522274|Everglades of the North}}</ref> This is caused by the [[Iroquois River]], one of the main tributaries of the [[Kankakee River]] that flows throughout Jasper County, a major water source for the area.<ref>{{cite book|author=Battle J.H.|publisher=F.A.

{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]] and the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title=Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name=inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]], elected to four-year terms. Members elected to any county government position are required to declare a [[political party]] affiliation and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>

Transformational leadership serves to enhance the motivation, morale, and [[job performance]] of followers through a variety of mechanisms; these include connecting the follower's sense of [[self-identity|identity]] and self to a [[project]] and to the [[collective identity]] of the organization; being a [[role model]] for followers in order to inspire them and to raise their interest in the project; challenging followers to take greater [[ownership]] for their work, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of followers, which allows the leader to align followers with tasks that enhance their performance. It is also important to understand the qualities a transformational leadership can bring to a work organization. Transformational leaders are strong in the abilities to adapt to different situations, share a collective consciousness, self-manage, and be inspirational while leading a group of employees.   

Transformational leadership  is when leader behaviors influence followers and inspire them to perform beyond their perceived capabilities. Transformational leadership inspires people to achieve unexpected or remarkable results. It gives workers autonomy over specific jobs, as well as the authority to make decisions once they have been trained. This induces a positive change in the followers attitudes and the organization as a whole. Transformational leaders typically perform four distinct behaviors, also known as the four I's. These behaviors are inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.   

Inspirational motivation is when the leader inspires their followers to achieve. This leader sets high and reasonable goals for their followers and their organization. They inspire commitment and they create a shared vision for their organization. Leaders that utilize inspirational motivation motivate followers extrinsically and intrinsically, and they are able to articulate their expectations clearly.   

Idealized influence is when the leader acts as a strong role model for their organization and leads by example. These types of leaders consider the needs of their followers and prioritize their needs. They typically have loads of charisma and are very ethical. Followers of these leaders typically try to emulate their leader as they tend to identify with them easily.

Intellectual stimulation is when the leader encourages their followers to think for themselves. These leaders are creative, innovative, and are very open to new ideas. They tend to be tolerant of their followers' mistakes, and even encourage them as they believe they promote growth and improvement within the organization. These leaders create learning opportunities for their followers and abandon obsolete practices.   

Individualized consideration is when the leader establishes a strong relationship with their followers. These leaders act as a caring supportive resource for their followers and their organization. They mentor their followers and allocate their time to developing their followers potential.

== Origins ==
The concept of transformational leadership was initially introduced by [[James V. Downton]], the first to coin the term \"Transformational leadership\", a concept further developed by leadership expert and presidential biographer [[James MacGregor Burns]]. According to Burns, transformational leadership can be seen when \"leaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=d5r6dul5Mv0C&pg=PA1|title = Transformational Leadership|accessdate = |website = |isbn = 9780802141187|last1 = Burns|first1 = James Macgregor|year = 2004}}</ref> Through the strength of their vision and personality, transformational leaders are able to inspire followers to change expectations, perceptions, and motivations to work towards common goals. Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's [[personality]], traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and challenging goals. Transforming leaders are idealized in the sense that they are a moral exemplar of working towards the benefit of the team, organization and/or community. Burns theorized that transforming and transactional leadership were mutually exclusive styles. Later, researcher [[Bernard M. Bass]] expanded upon Burns' original ideas to develop what is today referred to as Bass’ Transformational Leadership Theory. According to Bass, transformational leadership can be defined based on the impact that it has on followers. Transformational leaders, Bass suggested, garner trust, respect, and admiration from their followers.

Bernard M. Bass (1985), extended the work of Burns (1978) by explaining the [[psychological]] mechanisms that underlie transforming and transactional leadership. Bass introduced the term \"transformational\" in place of \"transforming.\" Bass added to the initial concepts of Burns (1978) to help explain how transformational leadership could be measured, as well as how it impacts follower motivation and performance. The extent to which a leader is transformational, is measured first, in terms of his influence on the followers. The followers of such a leader feel trust, admiration, [[loyalty]] and respect for the leader and because of the qualities of the transformational leader are willing to work harder than originally expected. These outcomes occur because the transformational leader offers followers something more than just working for self-gain; they provide followers with an inspiring mission and vision and give them an [[Identity (social science)|identity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision|accessdate = |doi=10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S |volume=18 |issue = 3|journal=Organizational Dynamics |pages=19–31|year = 1990|last1 = Bass|first1 = Bernard M.}}</ref> The leader transforms and motivates followers through their idealized influence (earlier referred to as charisma), intellectual stimulation and individual consideration. In addition, this leader encourages followers to come up with new and unique ways to challenge the status quo and to alter the environment to support being successful. Finally, in contrast to Burns, Bass suggested that leadership can simultaneously display both transformational and transactional leadership.

In 1985, transformational leadership had become more defined and developed whereby leaders known to use this style possessed the following traits: idealized influences, charisma, and inspirational motivation. Transformational leadership made transactional leadership more effective.<ref>Barling, J., & Cooper, C. L. (2008). ''The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior''. Vol. 1: Micro Approaches.

* Emphasizing intrinsic motivation and positive development of followers  
* Raising awareness of moral standards  
* Highlighting important priorities  
* Fostering higher moral maturity in followers  
* Creating an ethical climate (share values, high ethical standards)

* Promoting cooperation and harmony  
* Using authentic, consistent means  
* Using persuasive appeals based on reason  
* Providing individual coaching and mentoring for followers  
* Appealing to the ideals of followers  
* Allowing freedom of choice for followers
Transformational leaders are described to hold positive expectations for followers, believing that they can do their best. As a result, they inspire, empower, and stimulate followers to exceed normal levels of performance. Transformational leaders also focus on and care about followers and their personal needs and development.<ref name=\":1\" /> Transformational leaders fit well in leading and working with complex work groups and organizations, where beyond seeking an inspirational leader to help guide them through an uncertain environment, followers are also challenged and feel empowered; this nurtures them into becoming loyal, high performers.

There are 4 components to transformational leadership, sometimes referred to as the 4 I's:
* '''Idealized Influence (II)''' – the leader serves as an ideal role model for followers; the leader \"walks the talk,\" and is admired for this. A transformational leader embodies the qualities that he/she wants in his/her team. In this case, the followers see the leader as a model to emulate. For the followers, it is easy to believe and trust in a transformational leader.  
* '''Inspirational Motivation (IM)''' – Transformational leaders have the ability to inspire and motivate followers through having a vision and presenting that vision. Combined, these first two I's are what constitute the transformational leader's charisma. A transformational leader manages to inspire the followers easily with clarity. The transformational leader convinces the followers with simple and easy-to-understand words, as well as with their own image.
* '''Individualized Consideration (IC)''' – Transformational leaders demonstrate genuine concern for the needs and feelings of followers and help them self-actualize. This personal attention to each follower assists in developing trust among the organization's members and their authority figure(s). For example, the transformational leader can point out the problems of a  member working in a group. From this perspective, the leader can work towards training and developing a follower who is having difficulties in a job. This is an important element because teams are able to rely on and work together, so decisions can be made more quickly, while the transformational leader increases their buy-in.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smirl |first1=Paul |title=Becoming a Transformational Leader |url=https://wsb.wisc.edu/programs-degrees/mba/blog/2018/08/23/becoming-a-transformational-leader |website=Wisconsin School of Business |accessdate=November 22, 2018}}</ref>
* '''Intellectual Stimulation (IS)''' – the leader challenges followers to be innovative and creative, they encourage their followers to challenge the status quo. A common misunderstanding is that transformational leaders are \"soft,\" but the truth is that they constantly challenge followers to higher levels of performance.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Riggio|first1=Ronald E.|title=Are You a Transformational Leader?|date=2009-03-24|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/200903/are-you-transformational-leader|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>
Transformational leadership is said to have occurred when engagement in a group results in leaders and followers raising one another to increased levels of motivation and morality.<ref name=\":0\" />  It is not enough to make the correct choice, but to make the moral choice. In simple words, a transformational leader is not selfish and sees an opportunity of growth in others. Transformational leadership enhances intellectual stimulation through employee training and development.

Transformational leaders do one thing tranactional leaders don't, which is going beyond self-actualization. The importance of transcending self-interests is something lost sight of by those who see that the ultimate in maturity of development is self-actualization. Bass. (1999).

== Characteristics==

Five major [[personality traits]] have been identified as factors contributing to the likelihood of an individual displaying the characteristics of a transformational leader. Different emphasis on different elements of these traits point to inclination in personality to inspirational leadership, [[transactional leadership]], and transformational leadership. These five traits are as follows.<ref name=\"Bono\">{{cite journal | last1 = Joyce | first1 = E. | last2 = Judge | first2 = Timothy A. | year = 2004 | title = Personality and Transformational and Transactional Leadership: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 901–910 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.901 | pmid=15506869| citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.7909 }}</ref>
[[File:특징1.jpg|thumb|right|490px|Results of Meta Analysis finding correlation between personality traits and transformational leadership from data gathered by Joyce Bono and Timothy Judge.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>]]

=== Extraversion ===
The two main characteristics of extraverts are [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]] and [[Agency (sociology)|agency]],<ref name=\"Bono\"/> which relate to the social and leadership aspects of their personality, respectively. Extraversion is generally seen as an inspirational trait usually exhibited in transformational leadership.

=== Neuroticism ===
[[Neuroticism]] generally gives an individual an anxiety related to productivity which, in a group setting can be debilitating to a degree where they are unlikely to position themselves in a role of transformational leadership due to lower self-esteem and a tendency to shirk from leadership responsibilities.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>

=== Openness to experience ===
Creative expression and emotional responsiveness have been linked to a general tendency of openness to experience.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is also seen as a component of transformational leadership as it relates to the ability to give big-picture visionary leadership for an [[organization]].

=== Agreeableness ===
Although not a trait which specifically points to transformational leadership, leaders in general possess an agreeable nature stemming from a natural concern for others and high levels of individual consideration.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> [[Charisma]] and idealized influence is a classic ability of individuals who possess agreeability.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>

=== Conscientiousness ===
Strong sense of direction and the ability to put large amounts of productive work into tasks is the by-product of [[conscientious]] leaders.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is more linked to a transactional form of leadership given the management-based abilities of such individuals and the detail oriented nature of their personality. Results suggest that transformational leaders might give greater importance to values pertaining to others than to values concerning only themselves.<ref name=\"Krishnan\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Krishnan | first1 = Venkat | year = 2001 | title = Value Systems of Transformational Leaders | journal = Leadership & Organization Development Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 126–132 | doi = 10.1108/01437730110389274}}</ref>


Studies have shown that subordinates' and leaders' ratings of transformational leadership may not converge. According to leaders' self‐ratings, the extraverted, intuitive and perceiving preferences favour transformational leadership. On the contrary, subordinates' ratings indicated that leaders with sensing preference are associated with transformational leadership.<ref name=\"Hautala\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Hautala | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = The relationship between personality and transformational leadership | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 25 | issue = 8| pages = 777–794 | doi = 10.1108/02621710610684259}}</ref>

== Measurement ==
One of the ways in which transformational leadership is measured is through use of the [[Multifactor leadership questionnaire|Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire]] (MLQ), a survey which identifies different leadership characteristics based on examples and provides a basis for leadership training.  Early development was limited because the knowledge in this area was primitive, and as such, finding good examples for the items in the questionnaire was difficult.  Subsequent development on the MLQ led to the current version of the survey, the MLQ5X.

The current version of the MLQ5X includes 36 items that are broken down into 9 scales with 4 items measuring each scale. Subsequent validation work by [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues provided strong evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the MLQ5X.<ref name=\"Antonakis\">{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B. J. | last3 = Sivasubramaniam | first3 = N. | year = 2003 | title = Context and leadership: An examination of the nine-factor Full-Range Leadership Theory using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 261–295 | doi = 10.1016/S1048-9843(03)00030-4 }}</ref> Indeed, Antonakis went on to confirm the viability of the proposed nine-factor MLQ model, using two very large samples. Although other researchers have still been critical of the MLQ model, since 2003 no one has been able to provide dis-confirming evidence of the theorized nine-factor model with such large sample sizes as those published by Antonakis.

In regards to transformational leadership, the first 5 components – Idealized Attributes, Idealized Behaviors, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration – are considered to be transformational leadership behaviors.

== Effectiveness as compared to other leadership styles ==
Studies have shown that transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes in relation to other leadership styles.  It is suggested that transformational leadership augments transactional in predicating effects on follower satisfaction and performance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bass, Riggio |first1=Bernard, Ronald |title=Transformational Leadership |date=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |pages=10 |edition=Second }}</ref> According to studies performed by Lowe, Kroeck, and Sivasubramaniam, charisma (or Idealized Influence) was found to be a variable that was most strongly related to leader effectiveness among MLQ scales.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1048-9843(96)90027-2|url=https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/K_Lowe_Effectiveness_1996.pdf|title=Effectiveness correlates of transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic review of the MLQ literature|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385–425|year=1996|last1=Lowe|first1=Kevin B.|last2=Kroeck|first2=K.Galen|last3=Sivasubramaniam|first3=Nagaraj}}</ref>  Other studies show that transformational leadership is positively associated with employee outcomes including commitment, role clarity, and well-being.<ref name=\":3\"/> However, the effectiveness of transformational leadership varies by the situational contexts. For example, it can be more effective when applied to smaller, privately held firms than complex organizations based on its outreach effect with members of the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ling |first1=Y |last2=Simseck |first2=Z |last3=Lubatkin |first3=M.H. |last4=Veiga |first4=J.F. |title=The impact of transformational CEOs on the performance of small- to medium-sized firms: Does organizational context matter?  |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=923–34 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.93.4.923 |pmid=18642995 }}</ref> However, we can conclude that transformational leadership has a positive effect on organizational effectiveness. This is because transformational leaders can encourage and facilitate change in their subordinates and encourage their development and creativity. <ref>Chi, H., Lan, C. and Dorigotov, B. (2012) ’The moderating effect of transformational leadership on knowledge management and organizational effectiveness’, Social Behavior and Personality, 40(6), pp.1015–1023. </ref>

=== Transactional leadership ===
In contrast to transformational leadership, [[transactional leadership]] styles focus on the use of rewards and punishments in order to achieve compliance from followers. According to Burns, the transforming approach creates significant change
in the life of people and organizations. It redesigns perceptions and values, and changes expectations and aspirations
of employees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=J.M |title=Transformational Leadership |url=https://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/TransformationalLeadership.pdf |website=Langston |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref> Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's personality, traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and
challenging goals.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=J.M |title=Transformational Leadership |url=https://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/TransformationalLeadership.pdf |website=Langston |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>

Transformational leaders look towards changing the future to inspire followers and accomplish goals, whereas transactional leaders seek to maintain the ''status quo'', not aiming for progress. Transactional leaders frequently get results from employees by using authority, while transformational leaders have a true vision for their company, are able to inspire people, and are entirely committed to their work.

The MLQ does test for some transactional leadership elements – Contingent Reward and [[Management by exception|Management-by-Exception]] – and the results for these elements are often compared to those for the transformational elements tested by the MLQ.  Studies have shown transformational leadership practices lead to higher satisfaction with leader among followers and greater leader effectiveness, while transactional practices lead to higher follower job satisfaction and leader job performance.<ref name=\"piccolo\">{{cite journal|pmid=15506858|url=http://www.panglossinc.com/TA-TF%20Paper--JAP%20published.pdf|year=2004|last1=Judge|first1=T. A.|title=Transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic test of their relative validity|journal=The Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=89|issue=5|pages=755–68|last2=Piccolo|first2=R. F.|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.755}}</ref>

=== Laissez-faire leadership ===
In a laissez-faire leadership style, a person may be given a leadership position without providing leadership, which leaves followers to fend for themselves.  This leads to subordinates having a free hand in deciding policies and methods.

Studies have shown that while transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes, laissez-faire leadership is associated with negative outcomes, especially in terms of follower satisfaction with leader and leader effectiveness.<ref name=\"piccolo\" />  Also, other studies comparing the leadership styles of men and women have shown that female leaders tend to be more transformational with their leadership styles, whereas laissez-faire leadership is more prevalent in male leaders.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12848221|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/64ab/af52dd802cf569379cf52bbb9822d56857aa.pdf|year=2003|last1=Eagly|first1=A.

=== Comparison of Styles among Public and Private Companies ===
Lowe, Kroeck, and Sivasubramaniam (1996)<ref name=\":4\" /> conducted a meta-analysis combining data from studies in both the private and public sector. The results indicated a hierarchy of leadership styles and related subcomponents. Transformational Leadership characteristics were the most effective; in the following order of effectiveness from most to least: charisma-inspiration, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. Transactional Leadership was the next most effective; in the following order of effectiveness from most to least: contingent reward and managing-by-exception. Laissez Faire leadership does not intentionally intervene, and as such, is not measured, and has no effectiveness score.

Results of a meta-analysis of effectiveness of as adapted by Bass (2006) in Transformational Leadership.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transformational leadership|author=Bass, Bernard|date=2006|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|others=Riggio, Ronald E.|isbn=978-0805847611|edition= 2nd|location=Mahwah, N.J.|oclc=59360173}}</ref>

== Factors affecting use ==
Phipps suggests that the individual personality of a leader heavily affects their leadership style, specifically with regard to the following components of the [[Big Five personality traits|Five-factor model of personality]]: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion/introversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism/emotional stability (OCEAN).<ref name=\":2\" />

Phipps also proposed that all the Big Five dimensions would be positively related to transformational leadership. Openness to experience allows the leader to be more accepting of novel ideas and thus more likely to stimulate the follower intellectually. Conscientious leaders are achievement oriented and thus more likely to motivate their followers to achieve organizational goals. Extraverted and agreeable individuals are more outgoing and pleasant, respectively, and more likely to have successful interpersonal relationships. Thus, they are more likely to influence their followers and to be considerate towards them. Emotionally stable leaders would be better able to influence their followers because their stability would enable them to be better role models to followers and to thoroughly engage them in the goal fulfillment process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss3/7_Edited_Phipps%20Big5_pp430_447_jmDF.pdf|title = THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY FACTORS ON TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP: EXPLORING THE MODERATING ROLE OF POLITICAL SKILL|last = Phipps|first = Simone T.A.|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Leadership Studies|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>

A specific example of cultural background affecting the effectiveness of transformational leadership would be Indian culture, where a nurturant-task style of leadership has been shown to be an effective leadership style. Singh and Bhandarker (1990) demonstrated that effective transformational leaders in India are likes heads of Indian families taking personal interest in the welfare of their followers. Leaders in Indian organizations are therefore more likely to exhibit transformational behaviors if their followers are more self-effacing in approaching the leaders. It is also hypothesized in general that subordinates’ being socialized to be less assertive, self-confident, and independent would enhance superiors’ exhibition of transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://rkvenkat.org/varun.pdf|title = Impact of Socialization on Transformational Leadership: Role of Leader Member Exchange|last = Gupta|first = Varun|date = July–September 2004|journal = South Asian Journal of Management|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>

Follower characteristics, combined with their perceptions of the leader and their own situation, did appear to moderate the connection between transformational leadership and subordinates’ willingness to take charge and be good organizational citizens. For instance, if subordinates in a work group perceive their leader to be prototypical of them, then transformational leadership would have less of an impact on their willingness to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors. Likewise, if subordinates are goal oriented and possess a traditional view of the organizational hierarchy, they tend to be less affected by transformational leadership. Self-motivated employees are less likely to need transformational leaders to prod them into action, while “traditionalists” tend to see positive organizational citizenship as something expected given their roles as followers—not something they need to be “inspired” to do.

Evidence suggests that the above sets of factors act, in essence, as both inhibitors of and substitutes for transformational leadership. As inhibitors, the presence of any of these factors—either independently or especially collectively—could make the presence of a transformational leader “redundant” since followers’ positive behavior would instead be sparked by their own motivations or perceptions. On the other hand, when these factors are not present (e.g., employees in a work group do not see their leader as “one of us”), then transformational leadership is likely to have a much greater impact on subordinates. In essence, when such “favorable conditions” are not present, managers—and the organizations they work for—should see a better return on investment from transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|date = 2013|journal = Academy of Management Perspectives|doi = 10.5465/amp.2013.0064|pmid =|volume=27|issue = 2|last1 = Wyld|first1 = David|title = Transformation Leadership: When is It Redundant?}}</ref>

It was shown that leader continuity enhanced the effect of transformational leadership on role clarity and commitment, indicating that it takes time before transformational leaders actually have an effect on employees. Furthermore, co-worker support enhanced the effect on commitment, reflecting the role of followers in the transformational leadership process. However, there are also factors that would serve to hinder the exhibition of transformational leadership, including the organizational structure, ongoing change, the leaders’ working conditions,<ref name=\":3\">Tafvelin, Susanne (2013) [http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A640843&dswid=9907 ''The Transformational Leadership Process Antecedents, Mechanisms, and Outcomes in the Social Services''].

==Outcomes==
Bernard Bass in Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations states some leaders are only able to extract competent effort from their employees, while others inspire extraordinary effort.  Transformational leadership is the key (Bass, 1985).<ref>Bass, B. M. (1985). Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations. New York: Free Press.</ref>

Implementing transformational leadership has many positive outcomes not only in the workplace but in other situations as well. Evidence shows that each of the previously talked about four components of transformational leadership are significantly associated with positive emotions and outcomes in the workplace as well as in team projects performed online.<ref name=b1>{{cite journal|author= Brewer C.S., Kovner C.T., Djukic M., Fatehi F., Greene W., Chacko T.P. & Yang Y.|title=Impact of transformational leadership on nurse work outcomes|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|volume=72|issue=11|pages=2879–2893|pmid=27346330|year=2016|doi=10.1111/jan.13055}}</ref><ref name=\"Kahai\">{{cite journal|author= Kahai, S., Jestire, R., & Rui, H.|title=Effects of transformational and transactional leadership on cognitive effort and outcomes during collaborative learning within a virtual world|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=44|issue=6|pages=969–985|doi=10.1111/bjet.12105|year=2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Zineldin\">{{cite journal|author=Zineldin, M.|title=Transformational leadership behavior, emotions, and outcomes: Health psychology perspective in the workplace|journal=Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health|volume=32|pages=14–25|doi=10.1080/15555240.2016.1273782|year=2017}}</ref> One recent study indicates that these four components are significantly associated with higher job satisfaction and the effectiveness of the employees. Both intellectual stimulation and inspirational motivation are associated with a higher degree of positive emotions in the workplace such as enthusiasm, happiness, and a sense of pride in the follower's work.<ref name=\"Zineldin\" />

Companies seem to be transforming everywhere; growth and culture change are a focus within their core strategies. It is not necessarily about cost structure, but about finding new ways to grow. Models need to be produced to help leaders create the future. Kent Thirty, CEO of DaVita, chose the name DaVita, Italian for “giving life,” and settled on a list of core values that included
service excellence, teamwork, accountability, and fun. A transformational leader inspires and follows the employee's self-interests, while a transactional leader manages and reinforces generally without employee consideration. Aligning the organization into transformational leaders by committing, being involved, and developing with the employees will lead to higher job satisfaction and motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bass|title=Two Decades of Research and Development in Transformational Leadership|journal=European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology|volume=8|pages=9–32|doi=10.1080/135943299398410|url=http://techtied.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/bass_transforrmational_leadership.pdf|year=1999}}</ref> 

When transformational leadership was used in a nursing environment, researchers found that it led to an increase in organizational commitment.<ref name=b1/> A separate study examined that way that transformational leadership and transactional leadership compare when implemented into an online class.<ref name=\"Kahai\" /> The results of this study indicate that transformational leadership increases cognitive effort while transactional leadership decreases it.

==Examples==

===Nelson Mandela===
Nelson Mandela used transformational leadership principles while working to abolish apartheid and enforce change in South Africa.  In 1995, he visited [[Betsie Verwoerd]], the widow of the architect of apartheid Hendrik Verwoerd, at her home in Orania.  Orania was an Afrikaner homeland and a striking anachronistic symbol of racial separation, and Mandela's recurring emphasis on forgiveness contributed toward the healing the prejudices of South Africa and as vast influence as a leader.  In 2000, he was quoted as saying, \"For all people who have found themselves in the position of being in jail and trying to transform society, forgiveness is natural because you have no time to be retaliative.\"<ref name=\"schoemaker\">Schoemaker, Paul (2013-12-05). [https://www.inc.com/paul-schoemaker/what-made-mandela-a-transformational-leader.html \"Nelson Mandela, Transformational Leader.\"] Inc.com.</ref> This illustrates a common approach in the narratives of transformational leadership, of describing a collective or corporate effort in individualised terms, and pointing to the responsibility or opportunity for individuals to commit to making the effort a success. Such an approach is seen in [[Community organizing|community organising]].

He also set an example for others to follow in terms of sacrifice and philanthropy.  Schoemaker describes one such instance:
{{Quote|text=\"One such leader received a call from Mandela's office requesting that he accompany the President to the Eastern Cape.  This leader was less than enthusiastic and pleaded that he had an appointment around mid-day clashing with Mandela's request.  But there was no denying Mandela, so the leader agreed to go—but first consulted with his financial director to set a reasonable limit on the size of the anticipated donation request.  They settled on 500,000 Rand, or about $50,000 in those days...upon landing, about 80,000 black school children—all adorned in crisp white shirts—simultaneously bowed to acknowledge the great man's arrival.  As they were climbing down from the helicopter, Mandela planted his hand firmly in his guest's back and said, 'Now, I hope you are not going to disappoint me?'

== Future ==

The evolution of transformational leadership in the [[digital age]] is tied to the development of organizational leadership in an academic setting.<ref name=\"Bass\">{{cite journal|author=Bernard M.|title=The Future of Leadership in Learning Organizations|journal=Journal of Leadership Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=18–40|doi=10.1177/107179190000700302|year=2000}}</ref> As organizations move from position-based responsibilities to task-based responsibilities, transformational leadership is redefined to continue to develop individual commitment to organizational goals by aligning these goals with the interests of their leadership community. The academic community is a front-runner in this sense of redefining transformational leadership to suit these changes in job definition.

The future of transformational leadership is also related to [[political globalization]] and a more homogenous spectrum of economic systems under which organizations find themselves operating. Cultural and geographical dimensions of transformational leadership become blurred as globalization renders ethnically specific collectivist and individualistic effects of organizational behavior obsolete in a more diversified workplace.

The concept of transformational leadership further needs clarification, especially when a leader is declared as a transformational or transactional leader. While discussing Jinnah's leadership style, Yousaf (2015) argued that it is not the number of followers, but the nature of the change that indicates whether a leader is transformational or transactional.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yousaf|first=Nadeem|date=2015-01-01|title=Salient features of Jinnah's politics|journal=International Journal of Public Leadership|volume=11|issue=1|pages=46–64|doi=10.1108/IJPL-07-2014-0007|issn=2056-4929}}</ref>

Transformational leadership serves to enhance the motivation, morale, and [[job performance]] of followers through a variety of mechanisms; these include connecting the follower's sense of [[self-identity|identity]] and self to a [[project]] and to the [[collective identity]] of the organization; being a [[role model]] for followers in order to inspire them and to raise their interest in the project; challenging followers to take greater [[ownership]] for their work, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of followers, which allows the leader to align followers with tasks that enhance their performance. It is also important to understand the qualities a transformational leadership can bring to a work organization. Transformational leaders are strong in the abilities to adapt to different situations, share a collective consciousness, self-manage, and be inspirational while leading a group of employees.   

Transformational leadership  is when leader behaviors influence followers and inspire them to perform beyond their perceived capabilities. Transformational leadership inspires people to achieve unexpected or remarkable results. It gives workers autonomy over specific jobs, as well as the authority to make decisions once they have been trained. This induces a positive change in the followers attitudes and the organization as a whole. Transformational leaders typically perform four distinct behaviors, also known as the four I's. These behaviors are inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.   

Inspirational motivation is when the leader inspires their followers to achieve. This leader sets high and reasonable goals for their followers and their organization. They inspire commitment and they create a shared vision for their organization. Leaders that utilize inspirational motivation motivate followers extrinsically and intrinsically, and they are able to articulate their expectations clearly.   

Idealized influence is when the leader acts as a strong role model for their organization and leads by example. These types of leaders consider the needs of their followers and prioritize their needs. They typically have loads of charisma and are very ethical. Followers of these leaders typically try to emulate their leader as they tend to identify with them easily.

Intellectual stimulation is when the leader encourages their followers to think for themselves. These leaders are creative, innovative, and are very open to new ideas. They tend to be tolerant of their followers' mistakes, and even encourage them as they believe they promote growth and improvement within the organization. These leaders create learning opportunities for their followers and abandon obsolete practices.   

Individualized consideration is when the leader establishes a strong relationship with their followers. These leaders act as a caring supportive resource for their followers and their organization. They mentor their followers and allocate their time to developing their followers potential.

== Origins ==
The concept of transformational leadership was initially introduced by [[James V. Downton]], the first to coin the term \"Transformational leadership\", a concept further developed by leadership expert and presidential biographer [[James MacGregor Burns]]. According to Burns, transformational leadership can be seen when \"leaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=d5r6dul5Mv0C&pg=PA1|title = Transformational Leadership|accessdate = |website = |isbn = 9780802141187|last1 = Burns|first1 = James Macgregor|year = 2004}}</ref> Through the strength of their vision and personality, transformational leaders are able to inspire followers to change expectations, perceptions, and motivations to work towards common goals. Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's [[personality]], traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and challenging goals. Transforming leaders are idealized in the sense that they are a moral exemplar of working towards the benefit of the team, organization and/or community. Burns theorized that transforming and transactional leadership were mutually exclusive styles. Later, researcher [[Bernard M. Bass]] expanded upon Burns' original ideas to develop what is today referred to as Bass’ Transformational Leadership Theory. According to Bass, transformational leadership can be defined based on the impact that it has on followers. Transformational leaders, Bass suggested, garner trust, respect, and admiration from their followers.

Bernard M. Bass (1985), extended the work of Burns (1978) by explaining the [[psychological]] mechanisms that underlie transforming and transactional leadership. Bass introduced the term \"transformational\" in place of \"transforming.\" Bass added to the initial concepts of Burns (1978) to help explain how transformational leadership could be measured, as well as how it impacts follower motivation and performance. The extent to which a leader is transformational, is measured first, in terms of his influence on the followers. The followers of such a leader feel trust, admiration, [[loyalty]] and respect for the leader and because of the qualities of the transformational leader are willing to work harder than originally expected. These outcomes occur because the transformational leader offers followers something more than just working for self-gain; they provide followers with an inspiring mission and vision and give them an [[Identity (social science)|identity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision|accessdate = |doi=10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S |volume=18 |issue = 3|journal=Organizational Dynamics |pages=19–31|year = 1990|last1 = Bass|first1 = Bernard M.}}</ref> The leader transforms and motivates followers through their idealized influence (earlier referred to as charisma), intellectual stimulation and individual consideration. In addition, this leader encourages followers to come up with new and unique ways to challenge the status quo and to alter the environment to support being successful. Finally, in contrast to Burns, Bass suggested that leadership can simultaneously display both transformational and transactional leadership.

In 1985, transformational leadership had become more defined and developed whereby leaders known to use this style possessed the following traits: idealized influences, charisma, and inspirational motivation. Transformational leadership made transactional leadership more effective.<ref>Barling, J., & Cooper, C. L. (2008). ''The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior''. Vol. 1: Micro Approaches.

* Raising awareness of moral standards  
* Highlighting important priorities  
* Fostering higher moral maturity in followers

* Promoting cooperation and harmony  
* Using authentic, consistent means  
* Using persuasive appeals based on reason  
* Providing individual coaching and mentoring for followers

* Allowing freedom of choice for followers
Transformational leaders are described to hold positive expectations for followers, believing that they can do their best. As a result, they inspire, empower, and stimulate followers to exceed normal levels of performance. Transformational leaders also focus on and care about followers and their personal needs and development.<ref name=\":1\" /> Transformational leaders fit well in leading and working with complex work groups and organizations, where beyond seeking an inspirational leader to help guide them through an uncertain environment, followers are also challenged and feel empowered; this nurtures them into becoming loyal, high performers.

There are 4 components to transformational leadership, sometimes referred to as the 4 I's:
* '''Idealized Influence (II)''' – the leader serves as an ideal role model for followers; the leader \"walks the talk,\" and is admired for this. A transformational leader embodies the qualities that he/she wants in his/her team. In this case, the followers see the leader as a model to emulate. For the followers, it is easy to believe and trust in a transformational leader.  
* '''Inspirational Motivation (IM)''' – Transformational leaders have the ability to inspire and motivate followers through having a vision and presenting that vision. Combined, these first two I's are what constitute the transformational leader's charisma. A transformational leader manages to inspire the followers easily with clarity. The transformational leader convinces the followers with simple and easy-to-understand words, as well as with their own image.
* '''Individualized Consideration (IC)''' – Transformational leaders demonstrate genuine concern for the needs and feelings of followers and help them self-actualize. This personal attention to each follower assists in developing trust among the organization's members and their authority figure(s). For example, the transformational leader can point out the problems of a  member working in a group. From this perspective, the leader can work towards training and developing a follower who is having difficulties in a job. This is an important element because teams are able to rely on and work together, so decisions can be made more quickly, while the transformational leader increases their buy-in.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smirl |first1=Paul |title=Becoming a Transformational Leader |url=https://wsb.wisc.edu/programs-degrees/mba/blog/2018/08/23/becoming-a-transformational-leader |website=Wisconsin School of Business |accessdate=November 22, 2018}}</ref>
* '''Intellectual Stimulation (IS)''' – the leader challenges followers to be innovative and creative, they encourage their followers to challenge the status quo. A common misunderstanding is that transformational leaders are \"soft,\" but the truth is that they constantly challenge followers to higher levels of performance.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Riggio|first1=Ronald E.|title=Are You a Transformational Leader?|date=2009-03-24|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/200903/are-you-transformational-leader|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>
Transformational leadership is said to have occurred when engagement in a group results in leaders and followers raising one another to increased levels of motivation and morality.<ref name=\":0\" />  It is not enough to make the correct choice, but to make the moral choice. In simple words, a transformational leader is not selfish and sees an opportunity of growth in others. Transformational leadership enhances intellectual stimulation through employee training and development.

Transformational leaders do one thing tranactional leaders don't, which is going beyond self-actualization. The importance of transcending self-interests is something lost sight of by those who see that the ultimate in maturity of development is self-actualization. Bass. (1999).

== Characteristics==

Five major [[personality traits]] have been identified as factors contributing to the likelihood of an individual displaying the characteristics of a transformational leader. Different emphasis on different elements of these traits point to inclination in personality to inspirational leadership, [[transactional leadership]], and transformational leadership. These five traits are as follows.<ref name=\"Bono\">{{cite journal | last1 = Joyce | first1 = E. | last2 = Judge | first2 = Timothy A. | year = 2004 | title = Personality and Transformational and Transactional Leadership: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 901–910 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.901 | pmid=15506869| citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.7909 }}</ref>
[[File:특징1.jpg|thumb|right|490px|Results of Meta Analysis finding correlation between personality traits and transformational leadership from data gathered by Joyce Bono and Timothy Judge.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>]]

=== Extraversion ===
The two main characteristics of extraverts are [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]] and [[Agency (sociology)|agency]],<ref name=\"Bono\"/> which relate to the social and leadership aspects of their personality, respectively. Extraversion is generally seen as an inspirational trait usually exhibited in transformational leadership.

=== Neuroticism ===
[[Neuroticism]] generally gives an individual an anxiety related to productivity which, in a group setting can be debilitating to a degree where they are unlikely to position themselves in a role of transformational leadership due to lower self-esteem and a tendency to shirk from leadership responsibilities.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>

=== Openness to experience ===
Creative expression and emotional responsiveness have been linked to a general tendency of openness to experience.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is also seen as a component of transformational leadership as it relates to the ability to give big-picture visionary leadership for an [[organization]].

=== Agreeableness ===
Although not a trait which specifically points to transformational leadership, leaders in general possess an agreeable nature stemming from a natural concern for others and high levels of individual consideration.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> [[Charisma]] and idealized influence is a classic ability of individuals who possess agreeability.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>

=== Conscientiousness ===
Strong sense of direction and the ability to put large amounts of productive work into tasks is the by-product of [[conscientious]] leaders.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is more linked to a transactional form of leadership given the management-based abilities of such individuals and the detail oriented nature of their personality. Results suggest that transformational leaders might give greater importance to values pertaining to others than to values concerning only themselves.<ref name=\"Krishnan\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Krishnan | first1 = Venkat | year = 2001 | title = Value Systems of Transformational Leaders | journal = Leadership & Organization Development Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 126–132 | doi = 10.1108/01437730110389274}}</ref>


Studies have shown that subordinates' and leaders' ratings of transformational leadership may not converge. According to leaders' self‐ratings, the extraverted, intuitive and perceiving preferences favour transformational leadership. On the contrary, subordinates' ratings indicated that leaders with sensing preference are associated with transformational leadership.<ref name=\"Hautala\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Hautala | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = The relationship between personality and transformational leadership | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 25 | issue = 8| pages = 777–794 | doi = 10.1108/02621710610684259}}</ref>

== Measurement ==
One of the ways in which transformational leadership is measured is through use of the [[Multifactor leadership questionnaire|Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire]] (MLQ), a survey which identifies different leadership characteristics based on examples and provides a basis for leadership training.  Early development was limited because the knowledge in this area was primitive, and as such, finding good examples for the items in the questionnaire was difficult.  Subsequent development on the MLQ led to the current version of the survey, the MLQ5X.

The current version of the MLQ5X includes 36 items that are broken down into 9 scales with 4 items measuring each scale. Subsequent validation work by [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues provided strong evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the MLQ5X.<ref name=\"Antonakis\">{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B. J. | last3 = Sivasubramaniam | first3 = N. | year = 2003 | title = Context and leadership: An examination of the nine-factor Full-Range Leadership Theory using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 261–295 | doi = 10.1016/S1048-9843(03)00030-4 }}</ref> Indeed, Antonakis went on to confirm the viability of the proposed nine-factor MLQ model, using two very large samples. Although other researchers have still been critical of the MLQ model, since 2003 no one has been able to provide dis-confirming evidence of the theorized nine-factor model with such large sample sizes as those published by Antonakis.

In regards to transformational leadership, the first 5 components – Idealized Attributes, Idealized Behaviors, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration – are considered to be transformational leadership behaviors.

== Effectiveness as compared to other leadership styles ==
Studies have shown that transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes in relation to other leadership styles.  It is suggested that transformational leadership augments transactional in predicating effects on follower satisfaction and performance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bass, Riggio |first1=Bernard, Ronald |title=Transformational Leadership |date=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |pages=10 |edition=Second }}</ref> According to studies performed by Lowe, Kroeck, and Sivasubramaniam, charisma (or Idealized Influence) was found to be a variable that was most strongly related to leader effectiveness among MLQ scales.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1048-9843(96)90027-2|url=https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/K_Lowe_Effectiveness_1996.pdf|title=Effectiveness correlates of transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic review of the MLQ literature|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385–425|year=1996|last1=Lowe|first1=Kevin B.|last2=Kroeck|first2=K.Galen|last3=Sivasubramaniam|first3=Nagaraj}}</ref>  Other studies show that transformational leadership is positively associated with employee outcomes including commitment, role clarity, and well-being.<ref name=\":3\"/> However, the effectiveness of transformational leadership varies by the situational contexts. For example, it can be more effective when applied to smaller, privately held firms than complex organizations based on its outreach effect with members of the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ling |first1=Y |last2=Simseck |first2=Z |last3=Lubatkin |first3=M.H. |last4=Veiga |first4=J.F. |title=The impact of transformational CEOs on the performance of small- to medium-sized firms: Does organizational context matter?  |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=923–34 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.93.4.923 |pmid=18642995 }}</ref> However, we can conclude that transformational leadership has a positive effect on organizational effectiveness. This is because transformational leaders can encourage and facilitate change in their subordinates and encourage their development and creativity. <ref>Chi, H., Lan, C. and Dorigotov, B. (2012) ’The moderating effect of transformational leadership on knowledge management and organizational effectiveness’, Social Behavior and Personality, 40(6), pp.1015–1023. </ref>

=== Transactional leadership ===
In contrast to transformational leadership, [[transactional leadership]] styles focus on the use of rewards and punishments in order to achieve compliance from followers. According to Burns, the transforming approach creates significant change
in the life of people and organizations. It redesigns perceptions and values, and changes expectations and aspirations
of employees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=J.M |title=Transformational Leadership |url=https://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/TransformationalLeadership.pdf |website=Langston |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref> Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's personality, traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and
challenging goals.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=J.M |title=Transformational Leadership |url=https://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/TransformationalLeadership.pdf |website=Langston |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>

Transformational leaders look towards changing the future to inspire followers and accomplish goals, whereas transactional leaders seek to maintain the ''status quo'', not aiming for progress. Transactional leaders frequently get results from employees by using authority, while transformational leaders have a true vision for their company, are able to inspire people, and are entirely committed to their work.

The MLQ does test for some transactional leadership elements – Contingent Reward and [[Management by exception|Management-by-Exception]] – and the results for these elements are often compared to those for the transformational elements tested by the MLQ.  Studies have shown transformational leadership practices lead to higher satisfaction with leader among followers and greater leader effectiveness, while transactional practices lead to higher follower job satisfaction and leader job performance.<ref name=\"piccolo\">{{cite journal|pmid=15506858|url=http://www.panglossinc.com/TA-TF%20Paper--JAP%20published.pdf|year=2004|last1=Judge|first1=T. A.|title=Transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic test of their relative validity|journal=The Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=89|issue=5|pages=755–68|last2=Piccolo|first2=R. F.|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.755}}</ref>

=== Laissez-faire leadership ===
In a laissez-faire leadership style, a person may be given a leadership position without providing leadership, which leaves followers to fend for themselves.  This leads to subordinates having a free hand in deciding policies and methods.

Studies have shown that while transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes, laissez-faire leadership is associated with negative outcomes, especially in terms of follower satisfaction with leader and leader effectiveness.<ref name=\"piccolo\" />  Also, other studies comparing the leadership styles of men and women have shown that female leaders tend to be more transformational with their leadership styles, whereas laissez-faire leadership is more prevalent in male leaders.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12848221|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/64ab/af52dd802cf569379cf52bbb9822d56857aa.pdf|year=2003|last1=Eagly|first1=A.

=== Comparison of Styles among Public and Private Companies ===
Lowe, Kroeck, and Sivasubramaniam (1996)<ref name=\":4\" /> conducted a meta-analysis combining data from studies in both the private and public sector. The results indicated a hierarchy of leadership styles and related subcomponents. Transformational Leadership characteristics were the most effective; in the following order of effectiveness from most to least: charisma-inspiration, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. Transactional Leadership was the next most effective; in the following order of effectiveness from most to least: contingent reward and managing-by-exception. Laissez Faire leadership does not intentionally intervene, and as such, is not measured, and has no effectiveness score.

Results of a meta-analysis of effectiveness of as adapted by Bass (2006) in Transformational Leadership.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transformational leadership|author=Bass, Bernard|date=2006|publisher=L.

== Factors affecting use ==
Phipps suggests that the individual personality of a leader heavily affects their leadership style, specifically with regard to the following components of the [[Big Five personality traits|Five-factor model of personality]]: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion/introversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism/emotional stability (OCEAN).<ref name=\":2\" />

Phipps also proposed that all the Big Five dimensions would be positively related to transformational leadership. Openness to experience allows the leader to be more accepting of novel ideas and thus more likely to stimulate the follower intellectually. Conscientious leaders are achievement oriented and thus more likely to motivate their followers to achieve organizational goals. Extraverted and agreeable individuals are more outgoing and pleasant, respectively, and more likely to have successful interpersonal relationships. Thus, they are more likely to influence their followers and to be considerate towards them. Emotionally stable leaders would be better able to influence their followers because their stability would enable them to be better role models to followers and to thoroughly engage them in the goal fulfillment process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss3/7_Edited_Phipps%20Big5_pp430_447_jmDF.pdf|title = THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY FACTORS ON TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP: EXPLORING THE MODERATING ROLE OF POLITICAL SKILL|last = Phipps|first = Simone T.A.|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Leadership Studies|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>

A specific example of cultural background affecting the effectiveness of transformational leadership would be Indian culture, where a nurturant-task style of leadership has been shown to be an effective leadership style. Singh and Bhandarker (1990) demonstrated that effective transformational leaders in India are likes heads of Indian families taking personal interest in the welfare of their followers. Leaders in Indian organizations are therefore more likely to exhibit transformational behaviors if their followers are more self-effacing in approaching the leaders. It is also hypothesized in general that subordinates’ being socialized to be less assertive, self-confident, and independent would enhance superiors’ exhibition of transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://rkvenkat.org/varun.pdf|title = Impact of Socialization on Transformational Leadership: Role of Leader Member Exchange|last = Gupta|first = Varun|date = July–September 2004|journal = South Asian Journal of Management|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>

Follower characteristics, combined with their perceptions of the leader and their own situation, did appear to moderate the connection between transformational leadership and subordinates’ willingness to take charge and be good organizational citizens. For instance, if subordinates in a work group perceive their leader to be prototypical of them, then transformational leadership would have less of an impact on their willingness to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors. Likewise, if subordinates are goal oriented and possess a traditional view of the organizational hierarchy, they tend to be less affected by transformational leadership. Self-motivated employees are less likely to need transformational leaders to prod them into action, while “traditionalists” tend to see positive organizational citizenship as something expected given their roles as followers—not something they need to be “inspired” to do.

Evidence suggests that the above sets of factors act, in essence, as both inhibitors of and substitutes for transformational leadership. As inhibitors, the presence of any of these factors—either independently or especially collectively—could make the presence of a transformational leader “redundant” since followers’ positive behavior would instead be sparked by their own motivations or perceptions. On the other hand, when these factors are not present (e.g., employees in a work group do not see their leader as “one of us”), then transformational leadership is likely to have a much greater impact on subordinates. In essence, when such “favorable conditions” are not present, managers—and the organizations they work for—should see a better return on investment from transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|date = 2013|journal = Academy of Management Perspectives|doi = 10.5465/amp.2013.0064|pmid =|volume=27|issue = 2|last1 = Wyld|first1 = David|title = Transformation Leadership: When is It Redundant?}}</ref>

It was shown that leader continuity enhanced the effect of transformational leadership on role clarity and commitment, indicating that it takes time before transformational leaders actually have an effect on employees. Furthermore, co-worker support enhanced the effect on commitment, reflecting the role of followers in the transformational leadership process. However, there are also factors that would serve to hinder the exhibition of transformational leadership, including the organizational structure, ongoing change, the leaders’ working conditions,<ref name=\":3\">Tafvelin, Susanne (2013) [http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A640843&dswid=9907 ''The Transformational Leadership Process Antecedents, Mechanisms, and Outcomes in the Social Services''].

==Outcomes==
Bernard Bass in Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations states some leaders are only able to extract competent effort from their employees, while others inspire extraordinary effort.  Transformational leadership is the key (Bass, 1985).<ref>Bass, B. M. (1985). Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations. New York: Free Press.</ref>

Implementing transformational leadership has many positive outcomes not only in the workplace but in other situations as well. Evidence shows that each of the previously talked about four components of transformational leadership are significantly associated with positive emotions and outcomes in the workplace as well as in team projects performed online.<ref name=b1>{{cite journal|author= Brewer C.S., Kovner C.T., Djukic M., Fatehi F., Greene W., Chacko T.P. & Yang Y.|title=Impact of transformational leadership on nurse work outcomes|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|volume=72|issue=11|pages=2879–2893|pmid=27346330|year=2016|doi=10.1111/jan.13055}}</ref><ref name=\"Kahai\">{{cite journal|author= Kahai, S., Jestire, R., & Rui, H.|title=Effects of transformational and transactional leadership on cognitive effort and outcomes during collaborative learning within a virtual world|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=44|issue=6|pages=969–985|doi=10.1111/bjet.12105|year=2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Zineldin\">{{cite journal|author=Zineldin, M.|title=Transformational leadership behavior, emotions, and outcomes: Health psychology perspective in the workplace|journal=Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health|volume=32|pages=14–25|doi=10.1080/15555240.2016.1273782|year=2017}}</ref> One recent study indicates that these four components are significantly associated with higher job satisfaction and the effectiveness of the employees. Both intellectual stimulation and inspirational motivation are associated with a higher degree of positive emotions in the workplace such as enthusiasm, happiness, and a sense of pride in the follower's work.<ref name=\"Zineldin\" />

Companies seem to be transforming everywhere; growth and culture change are a focus within their core strategies. It is not necessarily about cost structure, but about finding new ways to grow. Models need to be produced to help leaders create the future. Kent Thirty, CEO of DaVita, chose the name DaVita, Italian for “giving life,” and settled on a list of core values that included
service excellence, teamwork, accountability, and fun. A transformational leader inspires and follows the employee's self-interests, while a transactional leader manages and reinforces generally without employee consideration. Aligning the organization into transformational leaders by committing, being involved, and developing with the employees will lead to higher job satisfaction and motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bass|title=Two Decades of Research and Development in Transformational Leadership|journal=European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology|volume=8|pages=9–32|doi=10.1080/135943299398410|url=http://techtied.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/bass_transforrmational_leadership.pdf|year=1999}}</ref> 

When transformational leadership was used in a nursing environment, researchers found that it led to an increase in organizational commitment.<ref name=b1/> A separate study examined that way that transformational leadership and transactional leadership compare when implemented into an online class.<ref name=\"Kahai\" /> The results of this study indicate that transformational leadership increases cognitive effort while transactional leadership decreases it.

==Examples==

===Nelson Mandela===
Nelson Mandela used transformational leadership principles while working to abolish apartheid and enforce change in South Africa.  In 1995, he visited [[Betsie Verwoerd]], the widow of the architect of apartheid Hendrik Verwoerd, at her home in Orania.  Orania was an Afrikaner homeland and a striking anachronistic symbol of racial separation, and Mandela's recurring emphasis on forgiveness contributed toward the healing the prejudices of South Africa and as vast influence as a leader.  In 2000, he was quoted as saying, \"For all people who have found themselves in the position of being in jail and trying to transform society, forgiveness is natural because you have no time to be retaliative.\"<ref name=\"schoemaker\">Schoemaker, Paul (2013-12-05). [https://www.inc.com/paul-schoemaker/what-made-mandela-a-transformational-leader.html \"Nelson Mandela, Transformational Leader.\"] Inc.com.</ref> This illustrates a common approach in the narratives of transformational leadership, of describing a collective or corporate effort in individualised terms, and pointing to the responsibility or opportunity for individuals to commit to making the effort a success. Such an approach is seen in [[Community organizing|community organising]].

He also set an example for others to follow in terms of sacrifice and philanthropy.  Schoemaker describes one such instance:
{{Quote|text=\"One such leader received a call from Mandela's office requesting that he accompany the President to the Eastern Cape.  This leader was less than enthusiastic and pleaded that he had an appointment around mid-day clashing with Mandela's request.  But there was no denying Mandela, so the leader agreed to go—but first consulted with his financial director to set a reasonable limit on the size of the anticipated donation request.  They settled on 500,000 Rand, or about $50,000 in those days...upon landing, about 80,000 black school children—all adorned in crisp white shirts—simultaneously bowed to acknowledge the great man's arrival.  As they were climbing down from the helicopter, Mandela planted his hand firmly in his guest's back and said, 'Now, I hope you are not going to disappoint me?' The business leader decided in that instance to double the donation...how could he tell a man who sacrificed as much as Mandela that he couldn't afford to be more generous?\"}}

== Future ==

The evolution of transformational leadership in the [[digital age]] is tied to the development of organizational leadership in an academic setting.<ref name=\"Bass\">{{cite journal|author=Bernard M.|title=The Future of Leadership in Learning Organizations|journal=Journal of Leadership Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=18–40|doi=10.1177/107179190000700302|year=2000}}</ref> As organizations move from position-based responsibilities to task-based responsibilities, transformational leadership is redefined to continue to develop individual commitment to organizational goals by aligning these goals with the interests of their leadership community. The academic community is a front-runner in this sense of redefining transformational leadership to suit these changes in job definition.

The future of transformational leadership is also related to [[political globalization]] and a more homogenous spectrum of economic systems under which organizations find themselves operating. Cultural and geographical dimensions of transformational leadership become blurred as globalization renders ethnically specific collectivist and individualistic effects of organizational behavior obsolete in a more diversified workplace.

The concept of transformational leadership further needs clarification, especially when a leader is declared as a transformational or transactional leader. While discussing Jinnah's leadership style, Yousaf (2015) argued that it is not the number of followers, but the nature of the change that indicates whether a leader is transformational or transactional.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yousaf|first=Nadeem|date=2015-01-01|title=Salient features of Jinnah's politics|journal=International Journal of Public Leadership|volume=11|issue=1|pages=46–64|doi=10.1108/IJPL-07-2014-0007|issn=2056-4929}}</ref>

'''Amending the Constitution of India''' is the process of making changes to the nation's fundamental law or supreme law. The procedure of amendment in the constitution is laid down in Part XX (Article 368)Anuradha mondal of the [[Constitution of India]]. This procedure  ensures the sanctity of the Constitution of India and keeps a check on arbitrary power of the [[Parliament of India]].

However, there is another limitation imposed on the amending power of the constitution of India, which developed during conflicts between the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] and Parliament, where Parliament wants to exercise discretionary use of power to amend the constitution while the Supreme Court wants to restrict that power.it is very important SHYAMASHREE ROY   
This has led to the laying down of various doctrines or rules in regard to checking the validity/legality of an amendment, the most famous among them is the [[Basic structure doctrine]] as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of [[Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala]] .

==Constituent Assembly debates==
The framers of the Constitution were neither in favour of the traditional theory of [[federalism]], which entrusts the task of constitutional amendment to a body other than the Legislature, nor did they favour a rigid special procedure for such amendments. They also never wanted to have a British-style system where [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is supreme. The framers, instead, adopted a combination of the \"theory of fundamental law\", which underlies the written [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] with the \"theory of parliamentary sovereignty\" as existing in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Constitution of India vests constituent power upon the Parliament subject to the special procedure laid down therein.<ref name=\"Nature and Scope\">{{cite web|title=Constitution Amendment: Nature and Scope of the Amending Process|url=http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|work=Lok Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013055/http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

During the discussion in the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] on this aspect, some members were in favour of adopting an easier mode of amending procedure for the initial five to ten years. Explaining why it was necessary to introduce an element of flexibility in the Constitution, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] observed in the Constituent Assembly on 8 November 1948, \"While we want this Constitution to be as solid and as permanent a structure as we can make it, nevertheless there is no permanence in Constitutions. There should be a certain flexibility. If you make anything rigid and permanent, you stop a nation’s growth, the growth of a living, vital, organic people. Therefore, it has to be flexible ... while we, who are assembled in this House, undoubtedly represent the people of India, nevertheless I think it can be said, and truthfully, that when a new House, by whatever name it goes, is elected in terms of this Constitution, and every adult in India has the right to vote - man and woman - the House that emerges then will certainly be fully representative of every section of the Indian people. It is right that House elected so - under this Constitution of course it will have the right to do anything - should have an easy opportunity to make such changes as it wants to. But in any event, we should not make a Constitution, such as some other great countries have, which are so rigid that they do not and cannot be adapted easily to changing conditions. Today especially, when the world is in turmoil and we are passing through a very swift period of transition, what we may do today may not be wholly applicable tomorrow. Therefore, while we make a Constitution which is sound and as basic as we can, it should also be flexible ...\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly of India Debates (Proceedings) - Vol. VII|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|pages=322–323|date=8 November 1948|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103153825/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|archive-date=3 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

Dr. P.S. Deshmukh believed that the amendment of the Constitution should be made easier as he felt there were contradictory provisions in some places which would be more and more apparent when the provisions were interpreted, and that the whole administration would suffer, if the amendment to the Constitution was not made easy. Brajeshwar Prasad also favoured a flexible Constitution so as to make it survive the test of time. He was of the opinion that rigidity tends to check progressive legislation or gradual innovation. On the other hand, H.V. Kamath favoured ensuring procedural safeguards to avoid the possibility of hasty amendment to the Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

{{quotation|\"It is said that the provisions contained in the Draft make amendment difficult. It is proposed that the Constitution should be amendable by a simple majority at least for some years. The argument is subtle and ingenious. It is said that this Constituent Assembly is not elected on adult suffrage while the future Parliament will be elected on adult suffrage and yet the former has been given the right to pass the Constitution by a simple majority while the latter has been denied the same right. It is paraded as one of the absurdities of the Draft Constitution. I must repudiate the charge because it is without foundation. To know how simple are the provisions of the Draft Constitution in respect of amending the Constitution one has only to study the provisions for amendment contained in the American and Australian Constitutions. Compared to them those contained in the Draft Constitution will be found to be the simplest. The Draft Constitution has eliminated the elaborate and difficult procedures such as a decision by a convention or a referendum ... It is only for amendments of specific matters—and they are only few—that the ratification of the State Legislatures is required. All other Articles of the Constitution are left to be amended by Parliament. The only limitation is that it shall be done by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of each House present and voting and a majority of the total membership of each House. It is difficult to conceive a simpler method of amending the Constitution.

What is said to be the absurdity of the amending provisions is founded upon a misconception of the position of the Constituent Assembly and of the future Parliament elected under the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly in making a Constitution has no partisan motive. Beyond securing a good and workable Constitution it has no axe to grind. In considering the Articles of the Constitution it has no eye on getting through a particular measure. The future Parliament if it met as Constituent Assembly, its members will be acting as partisans seeking to carry amendments to the Constitution to facilitate the passing of party measures which they have failed to get through Parliament by reason of some Article of the Constitution which has acted as an obstacle in their way. Parliament will have an axe to grind while the Constituent Assembly has none. That is the difference between the Constituent Assembly and the future Parliament. That explains why the Constituent Assembly though elected on limited franchise can be trusted to pass the Constitution by simple majority and why the Parliament though elected on adult suffrage cannot be trusted with the same power to amend it.\"

==Procedure==
The Constitution of India provides for a distinctive amendment process when compared to the Constitutions of other nations. This can be described as partly flexible and partly rigid. The Constitution provides for a variety in the amending process. This feature has been commended by Australian academic Sir [[Kenneth Wheare]] who felt that uniformity in the amending process imposed \"quite unnecessary restrictions\" upon the amendment of parts of a Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/> An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the introduction of a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] in either [[Parliament of India|House of Parliament]]. The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting.<ref>http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108220111/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm |date=8 November 2012 }} {{PD-notice}}</ref> This is known as special majority. There is no provision for a [[joint sitting]] in case of disagreement between the two Houses. The Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the provision to article 368, it must be [[Ratification|ratified]] by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. Although there is no prescribed time limit for ratification, it must be completed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

Every constitutional amendment is formulated as a statute. The first amendment is called the \"Constitution (First Amendment) Act\", the second, the \"Constitution (Second Amendment) Act\", and so forth. Each usually has the long title \"An Act further to amend the Constitution of India\".

===Types of amendments===
The original constitution provided for three categories of amendments. The first category of amendments are those contemplated in articles 4 (2), 169, 239A (2), 239AA (7b), 243M (4b), 243ZC (3), 244A (4), 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web|title=Full text of the Constitution of India|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621134720/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-21|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> These amendments can be effected by Parliament by a [[Plurality voting system|simple majority]] such as that required for the passing of any ordinary law. The amendments under this category are specifically excluded from the purview of article 368 which is the specific provision in the Constitution dealing with the power and the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 4]] provides that laws made by Parliament under article 2 (relating to admission or establishment of new States) and [[Part One of the Constitution of India|article 3]] (relating to formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States) effecting amendments in the First Schedule or the Fourth Schedule and supplemental, incidental and consequential matters, shall not be deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. For example, the ''[[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]'', which brought about the reorganization of the States in India, was passed by Parliament as an ordinary piece of legislation. In ''Mangal Singh v. Union of India'' (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 944), the Supreme Court held that power to reduce the total number of members of Legislative Assembly below the minimum prescribed under article 170 (1) is implicit in the authority to make laws under article 4. Article 169 empowers Parliament to provide by law for the abolition or creation of the [[Vidhan Parishad|Legislative Councils]] in States and specifies that though such law shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the Constitution as may be necessary, it shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. ''The Legislative Councils Act, 1957'', which provided for the creation of a Legislative Council in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and for increasing the strength of the Legislative Councils in certain other States, is an example of a law passed by Parliament in an exercise of its powers under article 169. The Fifth Schedule contains provisions as to the administration and control of the Schedule Areas and [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. Para 7 of the Schedule vests Parliament with plenary powers to enact laws amending the Schedule and lays down that no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. Under Para 21 of the Sixth Schedule, Parliament has full power to enact laws amending the Sixth Schedule which contains provisions for the administration of Tribal Areas in the States of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]]. No such law will be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368.

The second category includes amendments that can be effected by Parliament by a prescribed ‘[[Supermajority|special majority]]’; and the third category of amendments includes those that require, in addition to such \"special majority\", ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures. The last two categories are governed by article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

Ambedkar speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 17 September 1949, pointed out that there were \"innumerable articles in the Constitution\" which left matters subject to laws made by Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly Debates - Volume IX|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|work=India Kanoon|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=1660|date=17 September 1949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012448/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Under article 11, Parliament may make any provision relating to citizenship notwithstanding anything in article 5 to 10. Thus, by passing ordinary laws, Parliament may, in effect, provide, modify or annul the operation of certain provisions of the Constitution without actually amending them within the meaning of article 368. Since such laws do not, in fact, make any change whatsoever in the letter of the Constitution, they cannot be regarded as amendments of the Constitution nor categorized as such. Other examples include Part XXI of the Constitution—\"Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions\" whereby \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\" power is given to Parliament to make laws with respect to certain matters included in the State List (article 369); article 370 (1) (d) which empowers the President to modify, by order, provisions of the Constitution in their application to the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]; provisos to articles 83 (2) and 172 (1) empower Parliament to extend the lives of the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly of every State beyond a period of five years during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency; and articles 83(1) and 172 (2) provide that the Council of States/Legislative Council of a State shall not be subject to dissolution but as nearly as possible one-t

===Amendments under article 368===
Part-xx Article 368 (1) of the Constitution of India grants constituent power to make formal amendments and  empowers Parliament to amend the Constitution by way of addition, variation or repeal of any provision according to the procedure laid down therein, which is different from the procedure for ordinary legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|title= constituent power versus legislative power|accessdate= 23 August 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150826234901/http://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|archive-date= 26 August 2015|url-status= live}}</ref> Article 368 has been amended by the 24th and 42nd Amendments in 1971 and 1976 respectively. The following is the full text of Article 368 of the Constitution, which governs constitutional amendments. New clauses 368 (1) and '''368''' (3) were added by the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|24th Amendment]] in 1971, which also added a new clause (4) in article 13 which reads, \"Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under article 368.\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/> The provisions in ''italics'' were inserted by the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|42nd Amendment]] but were later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in ''[[Minerva Mills v.

The Supreme court ruled that the constituent power under article 368 must be exercised by the Parliament in the prescribed manner and cannot be exercised under the legislative powers of the Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/|title=Para 506e of Kesavananda Bharati v.

As per the procedure laid out by article 368 for amendment of the Constitution, an amendment can be initiated only by the introduction of a Bill in either House of Parliament. The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting. There is no provision for a joint sitting in case of disagreement between the two Houses. Total membership in this context has been defined to mean the total number of members comprising the House irrespective of any vacancies or absentees on any account vide Explanation to Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

The Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368, it must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in article 368. Ratification is done by a resolution passed by the State Legislatures. There is no specific time limit for the ratification of an amending Bill by the State Legislatures. However, the resolutions ratifying the proposed amendment must be passed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

===Rules of Procedure in Parliament===
{{further|Lawmaking procedure in India}}
Article 368 does not specify the legislative procedure to be followed at various stages of enacting an amendment. There are gaps in the procedure as to how and after what notice a Bill is to be introduced, how it is to be passed by each House and how the President's assent is to be obtained. This point was decided by the Supreme Court in ''Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India'' (AIR 1951 SC 458). Delivering the judgment, Patanjali Sastri J. observed, \"Having provided for the constitution of a Parliament and prescribed a certain procedure for the conduct of its ordinary legislative business to be supplemented by rules made by each House (article 118), the makers of the Constitution must be taken to have intended Parliament to follow that procedure, so far as it may be applicable consistently with the express provisions of article 368, when they entrusted to it power of amending the Constitution.\" Hence, barring the requirements of special majority, ratification by the State Legislatures in certain cases, and the mandatory assent by the President, a Bill for amending the Constitution is dealt with the Parliament following the same legislative process as applicable to an ordinary piece of legislation. The Rules of the House in the Rajya Sabha do not contain special provisions with regard to Bills for the amendment of the Constitution and the Rules relating to ordinary Bills apply, subject to the requirements of article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business make certain specific provisions regarding amendment bills in the Lok Sabha. They relate to the voting procedure in the House at various stages of such Bills, in the light of the requirements of article 368; and the procedure before introduction in the case of such Bills, if sponsored by Private Members. Although the \"special majority\", required by article 368 is prima facie applicable only to the voting at the final stage, the Lok Sabha Rules prescribe adherence to this constitutional requirement at all the effective stages of the Bill, i.e., for adoption of the motion that the Bill be taken into consideration; that the Bill as reported by the Select/Joint Committee be taken into consideration, in case a Bill has been referred to a Committee; for adoption of each clause or schedule or clause or schedule as amended, of a Bill; or that the Bill or the Bill as amended, as the case may be, be passed.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\">{{cite book|title=Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha|year=2004|publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat|location=New Delhi|page=67|edition=Eleventh|chapter=Rules 155 and 157}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

This provision was arrived at after consultation with the Attorney-General and detailed discussions in the Rules Committee. It has been described as \"evidently ''ex abundanti cautela''\", a Latin phrase, which in law, describes someone taking precautions against a very remote contingency.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>Gray, John (2006), ''\"Lawyer's Latin (a vade-mecum)\"'', Hale, London, {{ISBN|9780709082774}}.</ref> By strictly adhering to article 368, the provision is intended to ensure the validity of the procedure adopted, but also guard against the possibility of violation of the spirit and scheme of that article 29 by the consideration of a Bill seeking to amend the Constitution including its consideration clause by clause being concluded in the House with only the bare quorum present. Voting at all the above stages is by division. However, the Speaker may, with the concurrence of the House, put any group of clauses or schedules together to the vote of the House, provided that the Speaker will permit any of the clauses or schedules be put separately, if any member requests that. The Short Title, Enacting Formula and the Long Title are adopted by a simple majority. The adoption of amendments to clauses or schedules of the Bill, requires a majority of members present and voting in the same manner as in the case of any other Bill.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\"/>

====Private Members' Bills====
A Bill for amendment of the Constitution by a Private Member is governed by the rules applicable to Private Members' Bills in general. The period of one month's notice applies to such a Bill also. In addition, in Lok Sabha, such a Bill has to be examined and recommended by the Committee on Private Members’ Bills before it is included in the List of Business. The Committee has laid down the following principles as guiding criteria in making their recommendations in regard to these Bills:

{{quote|
\"(i) The Constitution should be considered as a sacred document — a document which should not be lightly interfered with and it should be amended only when it is found absolutely necessary to do so. Such amendments may generally be brought forward when it is found that the interpretation of the various articles and provisions of the Constitution has not been in accordance with the intention behind such provisions and cases of lacunae or glaring inconsistencies have come to light. Such amendments should, however, normally be brought by the Government after considering the matter in all its aspects and consulting experts, and taking such other advice as they may deem fit.<br />
(ii) Some time should elapse before a proper assessment of the working of the Constitution and its general effect is made so that any amendments that may be necessary are suggested as a result of sufficient experience.<br />
(iii) Generally speaking, notice of Bills from Private Members should be examined in the background of the proposal or measures which the Government may be considering at the time so that consolidated proposals are brought forward before the House by the Government after collecting sufficient material and taking expert advice.<br />
(iv) Whenever a Private Member’s Bill raises issues of far-reaching importance and public interest, the Bill might be allowed to be introduced so that public opinion is ascertained and gauged to enable the House to consider the matter further. In determining whether a matter is of sufficient public importance, it should be examined whether the particular provisions in the Constitution are adequate to satisfy the current ideas and public demand at the time. In other words, the Constitution should be adapted to the current needs and demands of the progressive society and any rigidity which may impede progress should be avoided.\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>}}

===Role of state legislatures===
The role of the states in constitutional amendment is limited. State legislatures cannot initiate any Bill or proposal for amendment of the Constitution. They are associated in the process of the amendment only through the ratification procedure laid down in article 368, in case the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368. The only other provision for constitutional changes by state legislatures is to initiate the process for creating or abolishing Legislative Councils in their respective legislatures, and to give their views on a proposed Parliamentary bill seeking to affect the area, boundaries or name of any State or States which has been referred to them under the proviso to [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 3]]. However, this referral does not restrict Parliament's power to make any further amendments of the Bill.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

Article 169 (1) reads, \"Notwithstanding anything in article 168, Parliament may by law provide for the abolition of the Legislative Council of a State having such a Council or for the creation of such a Council in a State having no such Council, if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a resolution to that effect by a majority of the total membership of the Assembly and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Assembly present and voting.\" The proviso of article 3 provides that no bill for the purpose shall be introduced in either House of Parliament except on the recommendation of the President and unless, where the proposal contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any of the States, the bill has been referred by the President to the Legislature of the State for expressing its views thereon within such period as may be specified in the reference or within such further period as the President may allow and the period so specified or allowed has expired.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

===Role of Union territories===
Union territories have no say in constitutional amendments, including the ratification process which is only open to States. [[Delhi]] and [[Puducherry]] are two union territories that are entitled, by special constitutional amendments, to have an elected Legislative Assembly and a Cabinet of ministers, thereby enjoying partial statehood powers. Both of these territories can participate in the ratification process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|title=Third non-BJP state Delhi ratifies 'big reform' GST bill {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=2016-08-24|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028145535/http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|archive-date=28 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

==Limitations==
{{Main|Basic structure doctrine}}
The Constitution can be amended any number of times by the Parliament; but only in the manner provided. There is no such limit provided in the constitution of India which allows it to enact only certain number of amendments in a year. In other words, Parliament is free to enact any number of constitutional amendment in any given year. Although Parliament must preserve the basic framework of the Constitution, there is no other limitation placed upon the amending power, meaning that there is no provision of the Constitution that cannot be amended. In ''Abdul Rahiman Jamaluddin v. Vithal Arjun (''AIR 1958 Bombay, 94, (1957)), the Bombay High Court held that any attempt to amend the Constitution by a Legislature other than Parliament, and in a manner different from that provided for, will be void and inoperative.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

The Supreme Court first struck down a constitutional amendment in 1967, ruling in the case of ''[[I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr.|I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr]]''. An amendment was struck down on the basis that it violated Article 13: \"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by [the charter of Fundamental Rights]\". The term \"law\" in this article was interpreted as including a constitutional amendment. Parliament responded by enacting the twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India which declared that \"nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution\".

The current limitation on amendments comes from ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala]]'', where the Supreme Court ruled that amendments of the constitution must respect the \"[[basic structure]]\" of the constitution, and certain fundamental features of the constitution cannot be altered by amendment. Parliament attempted to remove this limitation by enacting the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|Forty-second Amendment]], which declared, among other provisions, that \"there shall be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend ...this Constitution\". However, this change was itself later declared invalid by the Supreme Court in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]''.

The issue of whether an entire constitutional amendment is void for want of ratification or only an amended provision required to be ratified under proviso to clause (2) of article 368 was debated before the Supreme Court in ''Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu ''(AIR 1993 SC 412), in which the constitutional validity of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution inserted by the 52nd Amendment in 1985 was challenged.  The decisions of the Speakers/Chairmen on disqualification, which had been challenged in different High Courts through different petitions, were heard by a five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. The case, now popularly known as Anti-Defection case, was decided in 1992. The Constitution Bench in its majority judgement upheld the validity of the Tenth Schedule, but declared Paragraph 7 of the Schedule invalid because it was not ratified by the required number of the Legislatures of the States as it brought about in terms and effect, a change in articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution. While doing so, the majority treated Paragraph 7 as a severable part from the rest of the Schedule. However, in the [[dissenting opinion]], the minority of the Judges held that the entire Amendment is invalid for want of ratification.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

==Parts frequently amended==

Despite the [[super majority]] requirement in the Constitution, it is one of the most frequently amended governing documents in the world, and the most amended national constitution in the world;<ref name=\"Krishnamurthy2009\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |page=219 |title=Colonial Cousins: Explaining India and Canada’s Unwritten Constitutional Principles |last=Krishnamurthi |first=Vivek |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |journal=[[Yale Journal of International Law]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075730/http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> amendments have averaged about two a year. This is partly because the Constitution is so specific in spelling out government powers that amendments are often required to deal with matters that could be addressed by ordinary statutes in other democracies. As a result, it is the longest constitution of any sovereign nation in the world. It currently consists of over 117,000 words (450 articles plus 104 amendments). Another reason is that the Parliament of India is elected by means of single seat districts, under the [[plurality voting system]], used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. This means that, it is possible for a party to win two thirds of the seats in Parliament without securing two thirds of the vote. For example, in the first two [[Lok Sabha]] elections held under the Constitution, the [[Indian National Congress]] party won less than one half of the national vote but roughly two thirds of seats in the chamber.

===Fundamental Rights===
The most important and frequent reason for amendments to the Constitution is the curtailment of the [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Rights]] charter. This is achieved by inserting laws contrary to the fundamental rights provisions into Schedule 9 of the Constitution. Schedule 9 protects such laws from [[judicial review]]. The typical areas of restriction include laws relating to property rights, and affirmative action in favour of minority groups such as the \"scheduled castes\", \"scheduled tribes\", and other \"backward classes\" and also lower classes people.

In a [[landmark ruling]] in January 2007, a nine judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India confirmed that all laws (including those in Schedule 9) would be open to judicial review if they violate the \"basic structure of the constitution\".<ref name=\"Basic structure now ironcast\">{{cite news|title=Basic structure now ironcast|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=12 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402222003/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|archive-date=2 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal|Chief Justice Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal]] noted, \"If laws put in the Ninth Schedule abridge or abrogate fundamental rights resulting in violation of the basic structure of the constitution, such laws need to be invalidated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|title=India court opens laws to review|author=|date=4 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413031110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|archive-date=13 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Territorial changes===

Constitutional amendments have been made to facilitate changes in the territorial extent of the Republic of India due to the incorporation of the former French colony of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], the former Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], and a minor exchange of territory with [[Pakistan]]. Amendments are also necessary with regard to littoral rights over the exclusive economic zone of 200&nbsp;mi and the formation of new states and union territories by the reorganization of existing states. Constitutional amendment under article 368 allows peaceful division of the country provided [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental rights]] (Article 13) are ensured in all the resultant countries. The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 is an example which has ceded territory to old Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |title= The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 |accessdate= 23 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125225558/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |archive-date= 25 January 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref>

===Transitional provisions===

The constitution includes transitional provisions intended to remain in force only for a limited period. These need to be renewed periodically. For example, for continuing reservation in parliamentary seats for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes an constitutional amendment is enacted once in every ten years.

===Democratic reform===

Amendments have been made with the intent of reform the system of government and incorporating new \"checks and balances\" in the Constitution. These have included the following:

* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.
* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.
* Creation of mechanisms for ''[[Panchayati Raj]]'' (local self governance).
* Disqualification of members from changing party allegiance.
* Restrictions on the size of the cabinet.
* Restrictions on imposition of an internal emergency.

'''Amending the Constitution of India''' is the process of making changes to the nation's fundamental law or supreme law. The procedure of amendment in the constitution is laid down in Part XX (Article 368) of the [[Constitution of India]]. This procedure  ensures the sanctity of the Constitution of India and keeps a check on arbitrary power of the [[Parliament of India]].

However, there is another limitation imposed on the amending power of the constitution of India, which developed during conflicts between the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] and Parliament, where Parliament wants to exercise discretionary use of power to amend the constitution while the Supreme Court wants to restrict that power.
This has led to the laying down of various doctrines or rules in regard to checking the validity/legality of an amendment, the most famous among them is the [[Basic structure doctrine]] as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of [[Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala]] .

==Constituent Assembly debates==
The framers of the Constitution were neither in favour of the traditional theory of [[federalism]], which entrusts the task of constitutional amendment to a body other than the Legislature, nor did they favour a rigid special procedure for such amendments. They also never wanted to have a British-style system where [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is supreme. The framers, instead, adopted a combination of the \"theory of fundamental law\", which underlies the written [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] with the \"theory of parliamentary sovereignty\" as existing in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Constitution of India vests constituent power upon the Parliament subject to the special procedure laid down therein.<ref name=\"Nature and Scope\">{{cite web|title=Constitution Amendment: Nature and Scope of the Amending Process|url=http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|work=Lok Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013055/http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

During the discussion in the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] on this aspect, some members were in favour of adopting an easier mode of amending procedure for the initial five to ten years. Explaining why it was necessary to introduce an element of flexibility in the Constitution, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] observed in the Constituent Assembly on 8 November 1948, \"While we want this Constitution to be as solid and as permanent a structure as we can make it, nevertheless there is no permanence in Constitutions. There should be a certain flexibility. If you make anything rigid and permanent, you stop a nation’s growth, the growth of a living, vital, organic people. Therefore, it has to be flexible ... while we, who are assembled in this House, undoubtedly represent the people of India, nevertheless I think it can be said, and truthfully, that when a new House, by whatever name it goes, is elected in terms of this Constitution, and every adult in India has the right to vote - man and woman - the House that emerges then will certainly be fully representative of every section of the Indian people. It is right that House elected so - under this Constitution of course it will have the right to do anything - should have an easy opportunity to make such changes as it wants to. But in any event, we should not make a Constitution, such as some other great countries have, which are so rigid that they do not and cannot be adapted easily to changing conditions. Today especially, when the world is in turmoil and we are passing through a very swift period of transition, what we may do today may not be wholly applicable tomorrow. Therefore, while we make a Constitution which is sound and as basic as we can, it should also be flexible ...\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly of India Debates (Proceedings) - Vol. VII|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|pages=322–323|date=8 November 1948|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103153825/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|archive-date=3 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

Dr. P.S. Deshmukh believed that the amendment of the Constitution should be made easier as he felt there were contradictory provisions in some places which would be more and more apparent when the provisions were interpreted, and that the whole administration would suffer, if the amendment to the Constitution was not made easy. Brajeshwar Prasad also favoured a flexible Constitution so as to make it survive the test of time. He was of the opinion that rigidity tends to check progressive legislation or gradual innovation. On the other hand, H.V. Kamath favoured ensuring procedural safeguards to avoid the possibility of hasty amendment to the Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

{{quotation|\"It is said that the provisions contained in the Draft make amendment difficult. It is proposed that the Constitution should be amendable by a simple majority at least for some years. The argument is subtle and ingenious. It is said that this Constituent Assembly is not elected on adult suffrage while the future Parliament will be elected on adult suffrage and yet the former has been given the right to pass the Constitution by a simple majority while the latter has been denied the same right. It is paraded as one of the absurdities of the Draft Constitution. I must repudiate the charge because it is without foundation. To know how simple are the provisions of the Draft Constitution in respect of amending the Constitution one has only to study the provisions for amendment contained in the American and Australian Constitutions. Compared to them those contained in the Draft Constitution will be found to be the simplest. The Draft Constitution has eliminated the elaborate and difficult procedures such as a decision by a convention or a referendum ... It is only for amendments of specific matters—and they are only few—that the ratification of the State Legislatures is required. All other Articles of the Constitution are left to be amended by Parliament. The only limitation is that it shall be done by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of each House present and voting and a majority of the total membership of each House. It is difficult to conceive a simpler method of amending the Constitution.

What is said to be the absurdity of the amending provisions is founded upon a misconception of the position of the Constituent Assembly and of the future Parliament elected under the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly in making a Constitution has no partisan motive. Beyond securing a good and workable Constitution it has no axe to grind. In considering the Articles of the Constitution it has no eye on getting through a particular measure. The future Parliament if it met as Constituent Assembly, its members will be acting as partisans seeking to carry amendments to the Constitution to facilitate the passing of party measures which they have failed to get through Parliament by reason of some Article of the Constitution which has acted as an obstacle in their way. Parliament will have an axe to grind while the Constituent Assembly has none. That is the difference between the Constituent Assembly and the future Parliament. That explains why the Constituent Assembly though elected on limited franchise can be trusted to pass the Constitution by simple majority and why the Parliament though elected on adult suffrage cannot be trusted with the same power to amend it.\"

==Procedure==
The Constitution of India provides for a distinctive amendment process when compared to the Constitutions of other nations. This can be described as partly flexible and partly rigid. The Constitution provides for a variety in the amending process. This feature has been commended by Australian academic Sir [[Kenneth Wheare]] who felt that uniformity in the amending process imposed \"quite unnecessary restrictions\" upon the amendment of parts of a Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/> An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the introduction of a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] in either [[Parliament of India|House of Parliament]]. The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting.<ref>http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108220111/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm |date=8 November 2012 }} {{PD-notice}}</ref> This is known as special majority. There is no provision for a [[joint sitting]] in case of disagreement between the two Houses. The Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the provision to article 368, it must be [[Ratification|ratified]] by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. Although there is no prescribed time limit for ratification, it must be completed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

Every constitutional amendment is formulated as a statute. The first amendment is called the \"Constitution (First Amendment) Act\", the second, the \"Constitution (Second Amendment) Act\", and so forth. Each usually has the long title \"An Act further to amend the Constitution of India\".

===Types of amendments===
The original constitution provided for three categories of amendments. The first category of amendments are those contemplated in articles 4 (2), 169, 239A (2), 239AA (7b), 243M (4b), 243ZC (3), 244A (4), 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web|title=Full text of the Constitution of India|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621134720/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-21|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> These amendments can be effected by Parliament by a [[Plurality voting system|simple majority]] such as that required for the passing of any ordinary law. The amendments under this category are specifically excluded from the purview of article 368 which is the specific provision in the Constitution dealing with the power and the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 4]] provides that laws made by Parliament under article 2 (relating to admission or establishment of new States) and [[Part One of the Constitution of India|article 3]] (relating to formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States) effecting amendments in the First Schedule or the Fourth Schedule and supplemental, incidental and consequential matters, shall not be deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. For example, the ''[[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]'', which brought about the reorganization of the States in India, was passed by Parliament as an ordinary piece of legislation. In ''Mangal Singh v. Union of India'' (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 944), the Supreme Court held that power to reduce the total number of members of Legislative Assembly below the minimum prescribed under article 170 (1) is implicit in the authority to make laws under article 4. Article 169 empowers Parliament to provide by law for the abolition or creation of the [[Vidhan Parishad|Legislative Councils]] in States and specifies that though such law shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the Constitution as may be necessary, it shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. ''The Legislative Councils Act, 1957'', which provided for the creation of a Legislative Council in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and for increasing the strength of the Legislative Councils in certain other States, is an example of a law passed by Parliament in an exercise of its powers under article 169. The Fifth Schedule contains provisions as to the administration and control of the Schedule Areas and [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. Para 7 of the Schedule vests Parliament with plenary powers to enact laws amending the Schedule and lays down that no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. Under Para 21 of the Sixth Schedule, Parliament has full power to enact laws amending the Sixth Schedule which contains provisions for the administration of Tribal Areas in the States of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]]. No such law will be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368.

The second category includes amendments that can be effected by Parliament by a prescribed ‘[[Supermajority|special majority]]’; and the third category of amendments includes those that require, in addition to such \"special majority\", ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures. The last two categories are governed by article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

Ambedkar speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 17 September 1949, pointed out that there were \"innumerable articles in the Constitution\" which left matters subject to laws made by Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly Debates - Volume IX|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|work=India Kanoon|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=1660|date=17 September 1949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012448/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Under article 11, Parliament may make any provision relating to citizenship notwithstanding anything in article 5 to 10. Thus, by passing ordinary laws, Parliament may, in effect, provide, modify or annul the operation of certain provisions of the Constitution without actually amending them within the meaning of article 368. Since such laws do not, in fact, make any change whatsoever in the letter of the Constitution, they cannot be regarded as amendments of the Constitution nor categorized as such. Other examples include Part XXI of the Constitution—\"Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions\" whereby \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\" power is given to Parliament to make laws with respect to certain matters included in the State List (article 369); article 370 (1) (d) which empowers the President to modify, by order, provisions of the Constitution in their application to the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]; provisos to articles 83 (2) and 172 (1) empower Parliament to extend the lives of the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly of every State beyond a period of five years during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency; and articles 83(1) and 172 (2) provide that the Council of States/Legislative Council of a State shall not be subject to dissolution but as nearly as possible one-t

===Amendments under article 368===
Part-xx Article 368 (1) of the Constitution of India grants constituent power to make formal amendments and  empowers Parliament to amend the Constitution by way of addition, variation or repeal of any provision according to the procedure laid down therein, which is different from the procedure for ordinary legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|title= constituent power versus legislative power|accessdate= 23 August 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150826234901/http://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|archive-date= 26 August 2015|url-status= live}}</ref> Article 368 has been amended by the 24th and 42nd Amendments in 1971 and 1976 respectively.

As per the procedure laid out by article 368 for amendment of the Constitution, an amendment can be initiated only by the introduction of a Bill in either House of Parliament. The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting. There is no provision for a joint sitting in case of disagreement between the two Houses. Total membership in this context has been defined to mean the total number of members comprising the House irrespective of any vacancies or absentees on any account vide Explanation to Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

The Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368, it must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in article 368. Ratification is done by a resolution passed by the State Legislatures. There is no specific time limit for the ratification of an amending Bill by the State Legislatures. However, the resolutions ratifying the proposed amendment must be passed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

===Rules of Procedure in Parliament===
{{further|Lawmaking procedure in India}}
Article 368 does not specify the legislative procedure to be followed at various stages of enacting an amendment. There are gaps in the procedure as to how and after what notice a Bill is to be introduced, how it is to be passed by each House and how the President's assent is to be obtained. This point was decided by the Supreme Court in ''Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India'' (AIR 1951 SC 458). Delivering the judgment, Patanjali Sastri J. observed, \"Having provided for the constitution of a Parliament and prescribed a certain procedure for the conduct of its ordinary legislative business to be supplemented by rules made by each House (article 118), the makers of the Constitution must be taken to have intended Parliament to follow that procedure, so far as it may be applicable consistently with the express provisions of article 368, when they entrusted to it power of amending the Constitution.\" Hence, barring the requirements of special majority, ratification by the State Legislatures in certain cases, and the mandatory assent by the President, a Bill for amending the Constitution is dealt with the Parliament following the same legislative process as applicable to an ordinary piece of legislation. The Rules of the House in the Rajya Sabha do not contain special provisions with regard to Bills for the amendment of the Constitution and the Rules relating to ordinary Bills apply, subject to the requirements of article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business make certain specific provisions regarding amendment bills in the Lok Sabha. They relate to the voting procedure in the House at various stages of such Bills, in the light of the requirements of article 368; and the procedure before introduction in the case of such Bills, if sponsored by Private Members. Although the \"special majority\", required by article 368 is prima facie applicable only to the voting at the final stage, the Lok Sabha Rules prescribe adherence to this constitutional requirement at all the effective stages of the Bill, i.e., for adoption of the motion that the Bill be taken into consideration; that the Bill as reported by the Select/Joint Committee be taken into consideration, in case a Bill has been referred to a Committee; for adoption of each clause or schedule or clause or schedule as amended, of a Bill; or that the Bill or the Bill as amended, as the case may be, be passed.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\">{{cite book|title=Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha|year=2004|publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat|location=New Delhi|page=67|edition=Eleventh|chapter=Rules 155 and 157}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

This provision was arrived at after consultation with the Attorney-General and detailed discussions in the Rules Committee. It has been described as \"evidently ''ex abundanti cautela''\", a Latin phrase, which in law, describes someone taking precautions against a very remote contingency.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>Gray, John (2006), ''\"Lawyer's Latin (a vade-mecum)\"'', Hale, London, {{ISBN|9780709082774}}.</ref> By strictly adhering to article 368, the provision is intended to ensure the validity of the procedure adopted, but also guard against the possibility of violation of the spirit and scheme of that article 29 by the consideration of a Bill seeking to amend the Constitution including its consideration clause by clause being concluded in the House with only the bare quorum present. Voting at all the above stages is by division. However, the Speaker may, with the concurrence of the House, put any group of clauses or schedules together to the vote of the House, provided that the Speaker will permit any of the clauses or schedules be put separately, if any member requests that. The Short Title, Enacting Formula and the Long Title are adopted by a simple majority. The adoption of amendments to clauses or schedules of the Bill, requires a majority of members present and voting in the same manner as in the case of any other Bill.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\"/>

====Private Members' Bills====
A Bill for amendment of the Constitution by a Private Member is governed by the rules applicable to Private Members' Bills in general. The period of one month's notice applies to such a Bill also. In addition, in Lok Sabha, such a Bill has to be examined and recommended by the Committee on Private Members’ Bills before it is included in the List of Business. The Committee has laid down the following principles as guiding criteria in making their recommendations in regard to these Bills:

{{quote|
\"(i) The Constitution should be considered as a sacred document — a document which should not be lightly interfered with and it should be amended only when it is found absolutely necessary to do so. Such amendments may generally be brought forward when it is found that the interpretation of the various articles and provisions of the Constitution has not been in accordance with the intention behind such provisions and cases of lacunae or glaring inconsistencies have come to light. Such amendments should, however, normally be brought by the Government after considering the matter in all its aspects and consulting experts, and taking such other advice as they may deem fit.<br />
(ii) Some time should elapse before a proper assessment of the working of the Constitution and its general effect is made so that any amendments that may be necessary are suggested as a result of sufficient experience.<br />
(iii) Generally speaking, notice of Bills from Private Members should be examined in the background of the proposal or measures which the Government may be considering at the time so that consolidated proposals are brought forward before the House by the Government after collecting sufficient material and taking expert advice.<br />
(iv) Whenever a Private Member’s Bill raises issues of far-reaching importance and public interest, the Bill might be allowed to be introduced so that public opinion is ascertained and gauged to enable the House to consider the matter further. In determining whether a matter is of sufficient public importance, it should be examined whether the particular provisions in the Constitution are adequate to satisfy the current ideas and public demand at the time. In other words, the Constitution should be adapted to the current needs and demands of the progressive society and any rigidity which may impede progress should be avoided.\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>}}

===Role of state legislatures===
The role of the states in constitutional amendment is limited. State legislatures cannot initiate any Bill or proposal for amendment of the Constitution. They are associated in the process of the amendment only through the ratification procedure laid down in article 368, in case the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368. The only other provision for constitutional changes by state legislatures is to initiate the process for creating or abolishing Legislative Councils in their respective legislatures, and to give their views on a proposed Parliamentary bill seeking to affect the area, boundaries or name of any State or States which has been referred to them under the proviso to [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 3]]. However, this referral does not restrict Parliament's power to make any further amendments of the Bill.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

Article 169 (1) reads, \"Notwithstanding anything in article 168, Parliament may by law provide for the abolition of the Legislative Council of a State having such a Council or for the creation of such a Council in a State having no such Council, if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a resolution to that effect by a majority of the total membership of the Assembly and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Assembly present and voting.\" The proviso of article 3 provides that no bill for the purpose shall be introduced in either House of Parliament except on the recommendation of the President and unless, where the proposal contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any of the States, the bill has been referred by the President to the Legislature of the State for expressing its views thereon within such period as may be specified in the reference or within such further period as the President may allow and the period so specified or allowed has expired.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

===Role of Union territories===
Union territories have no say in constitutional amendments, including the ratification process which is only open to States. [[Delhi]] and [[Puducherry]] are two union territories that are entitled, by special constitutional amendments, to have an elected Legislative Assembly and a Cabinet of ministers, thereby enjoying partial statehood powers. Both of these territories can participate in the ratification process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|title=Third non-BJP state Delhi ratifies 'big reform' GST bill {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=2016-08-24|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028145535/http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|archive-date=28 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

==Limitations==
{{Main|Basic structure doctrine}}
The Constitution can be amended any number of times by the Parliament; but only in the manner provided. There is no such limit provided in the constitution of India which allows it to enact only certain number of amendments in a year. In other words, Parliament is free to enact any number of constitutional amendment in any given year. Although Parliament must preserve the basic framework of the Constitution, there is no other limitation placed upon the amending power, meaning that there is no provision of the Constitution that cannot be amended. In ''Abdul Rahiman Jamaluddin v. Vithal Arjun (''AIR 1958 Bombay, 94, (1957)), the Bombay High Court held that any attempt to amend the Constitution by a Legislature other than Parliament, and in a manner different from that provided for, will be void and inoperative.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

The Supreme Court first struck down a constitutional amendment in 1967, ruling in the case of ''[[I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr.|I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr]]''. An amendment was struck down on the basis that it violated Article 13: \"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by [the charter of Fundamental Rights]\". The term \"law\" in this article was interpreted as including a constitutional amendment. Parliament responded by enacting the twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India which declared that \"nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution\".

The current limitation on amendments comes from ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala]]'', where the Supreme Court ruled that amendments of the constitution must respect the \"[[basic structure]]\" of the constitution, and certain fundamental features of the constitution cannot be altered by amendment. Parliament attempted to remove this limitation by enacting the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|Forty-second Amendment]], which declared, among other provisions, that \"there shall be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend ...this Constitution\". However, this change was itself later declared invalid by the Supreme Court in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]''.

The issue of whether an entire constitutional amendment is void for want of ratification or only an amended provision required to be ratified under proviso to clause (2) of article 368 was debated before the Supreme Court in ''Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu ''(AIR 1993 SC 412), in which the constitutional validity of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution inserted by the 52nd Amendment in 1985 was challenged.  The decisions of the Speakers/Chairmen on disqualification, which had been challenged in different High Courts through different petitions, were heard by a five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. The case, now popularly known as Anti-Defection case, was decided in 1992. The Constitution Bench in its majority judgement upheld the validity of the Tenth Schedule, but declared Paragraph 7 of the Schedule invalid because it was not ratified by the required number of the Legislatures of the States as it brought about in terms and effect, a change in articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution. While doing so, the majority treated Paragraph 7 as a severable part from the rest of the Schedule. However, in the [[dissenting opinion]], the minority of the Judges held that the entire Amendment is invalid for want of ratification.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>

Despite the [[super majority]] requirement in the Constitution, it is one of the most frequently amended governing documents in the world, and the most amended national constitution in the world;<ref name=\"Krishnamurthy2009\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |page=219 |title=Colonial Cousins: Explaining India and Canada’s Unwritten Constitutional Principles |last=Krishnamurthi |first=Vivek |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |journal=[[Yale Journal of International Law]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075730/http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> amendments have averaged about two a year. This is partly because the Constitution is so specific in spelling out government powers that amendments are often required to deal with matters that could be addressed by ordinary statutes in other democracies. As a result, it is the longest constitution of any sovereign nation in the world. It currently consists of over 117,000 words (450 articles plus 104 amendments). Another reason is that the Parliament of India is elected by means of single seat districts, under the [[plurality voting system]], used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. This means that, it is possible for a party to win two thirds of the seats in Parliament without securing two thirds of the vote. For example, in the first two [[Lok Sabha]] elections held under the Constitution, the [[Indian National Congress]] party won less than one half of the national vote but roughly two thirds of seats in the chamber.

===Fundamental Rights===
The most important and frequent reason for amendments to the Constitution is the curtailment of the [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Rights]] charter. This is achieved by inserting laws contrary to the fundamental rights provisions into Schedule 9 of the Constitution. Schedule 9 protects such laws from [[judicial review]]. The typical areas of restriction include laws relating to property rights, and affirmative action in favour of minority groups such as the \"scheduled castes\", \"scheduled tribes\", and other \"backward classes\" and also lower classes people.

In a [[landmark ruling]] in January 2007, a nine judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India confirmed that all laws (including those in Schedule 9) would be open to judicial review if they violate the \"basic structure of the constitution\".<ref name=\"Basic structure now ironcast\">{{cite news|title=Basic structure now ironcast|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=12 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402222003/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|archive-date=2 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal|Chief Justice Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal]] noted, \"If laws put in the Ninth Schedule abridge or abrogate fundamental rights resulting in violation of the basic structure of the constitution, such laws need to be invalidated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|title=India court opens laws to review|author=|date=4 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413031110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|archive-date=13 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Territorial changes===

Constitutional amendments have been made to facilitate changes in the territorial extent of the Republic of India due to the incorporation of the former French colony of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], the former Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], and a minor exchange of territory with [[Pakistan]]. Amendments are also necessary with regard to littoral rights over the exclusive economic zone of 200&nbsp;mi and the formation of new states and union territories by the reorganization of existing states. Constitutional amendment under article 368 allows peaceful division of the country provided [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental rights]] (Article 13) are ensured in all the resultant countries. The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 is an example which has ceded territory to old Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |title= The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 |accessdate= 23 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125225558/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |archive-date= 25 January 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref>

===Transitional provisions===

The constitution includes transitional provisions intended to remain in force only for a limited period. These need to be renewed periodically. For example, for continuing reservation in parliamentary seats for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes an constitutional amendment is enacted once in every ten years.

===Democratic reform===

Amendments have been made with the intent of reform the system of government and incorporating new \"checks and balances\" in the Constitution. These have included the following:

* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.
* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.
* Creation of mechanisms for ''[[Panchayati Raj]]'' (local self governance).
* Disqualification of members from changing party allegiance.
* Restrictions on the size of the cabinet.
* Restrictions on imposition of an internal emergency.

The '''Sheffield Eagles''' are a professional [[rugby league]] club that play in the [[Championship (rugby league)|Betfred Championship]].<ref name=\"Operational Rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby-league.com/operational-rules/|title=Operational Rules|publisher=RFL|accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref> The club play their home games at the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] (OLP) on the former site of [[Don Valley Stadium]], their former ground. The original club was formed in 1984 and formerly competed in the [[Super League]]. The new, current club was formed in 2000 following a merger of the old club with [[Huddersfield Giants]]. The old club's biggest achievement was winning the [[Challenge Cup]] in 1998. The Eagles are the current holders of the 1895 Cup, after they beat Widnes Vikings at Wembley Stadium on 24 August.

== History ==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}

=== 1982–1984: Foundation of original Eagles ===
In 1982, [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] captain and chairman of the Players' Union, [[Gary Hetherington]], missed out on a coaching job at [[York F.C.]]. He decided to form his own club in Sheffield. The original plan to enter the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]] in 1983–84 fell apart when [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] pulled back from their promise to let the new team play its home games at [[Bramall Lane]].

The club eventually joined the Second Division in 1984, coached by [[Alan Rhodes (rugby league)|Alan Rhodes]], they played at the [[Owlerton Stadium]]. A competition was run in the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'' newspaper to find a name for the new club and \"Sheffield Eagles\" was the winner. The first Eagles league game was on 2 September 1984 when they beat [[Rochdale Hornets]], 29–10. The match took place the day after the club's sponsor went bust. Hetherington was both manager and player in the first season, building the team using experienced players from traditional areas. He also began signing up promising young players, one of whom was [[Mark Aston]], later to be a critical part of the Eagles' survival as a club and current head coach.

By November the club was close to folding because of financial problems. Sheffield beat [[Wakefield Trinity]] to set up a John Player Special Trophy first round tie against [[Leeds Rhinos]]. This lucrative game generated enough cash to see out the season.

===1985–1998: Progress and Challenge Cup win===
On the field the club progressed steadily, improving their league position until in 1988/89 they finished third in the league table and made it to the Second Division Premiership final at [[Old Trafford]]. In the final they outplayed [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], beating them by 43–18 and gaining promotion to the top flight of [[rugby league]]. Sheffield's record attendance at Owlerton was set at 3,636 for a third-round Challenge Cup game against [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] in 1989.

In the wake of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], stadium safety became an issue in British sport and Owlerton was declared unfit to stage professional rugby league. Eagles were forced to play their home games at seven different venues including [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] itself, [[Bramall Lane]], [[Recreation Ground (Chesterfield)|Recreation Ground]], [[Oakwell Stadium]] and [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. They survived one season in the top flight but were then relegated. This was a temporary decline as they immediately regained their place in the First Division, winning the Second Division title and Premiership. The Eagles slowly established themselves as a top flight club.

[[Don Valley Stadium]] became home for the club in September 1990, it had been built for the 1991 [[World Student Games]] held in Sheffield. In May 1991, Eagles signed their first local recruit, Jason Davidson. In 1992 they reached the Yorkshire Cup final, losing to [[Wakefield Trinity]].

Bill Gardner became coach in July 1993 season replacing Gary Hetherington who stood down from his coaching role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-broncos-man-to-coach-eagles-2321276.html|title=Rugby League: Broncos man to coach Eagles|author=|date=6 May 1993|work=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> In December following a run of five defeats, he was sacked and Hetherington took over as coach again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-gardner-takes-leave-of-sheffield-1466189.html|title=Rugby League: Gardner takes leave of Sheffield|author=|date=8 December 1993|work=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>

Sheffield was included on the schedule for a game against the [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] during their [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]] and were defeated, 80–2, in the first game following the first test match at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. This was the highest score by a Kangaroo touring team in England since they had defeated [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]], 92–7, on the [[1921–22 Kangaroo tour|1921–22 tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1921/game-16/bramley-vs-australia.html|title=Kangaroos Tour 1921 Series – Game 16 – Rugby League Project|first1=Shawn|last1=Dollin|first2=Andrew|last2=Ferguson|date=|work=RugbyLeagueProject.org|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> The Kangaroos ran in 14 tries to nil at Don Valley Stadium. However, because of the tie the club benefited from a significant financial gain.

In March 1995, Sheffield pulled out of a proposed merger with [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] following a \"breach of confidentiality\"; Sheffield were then set to take-over 'The Dons' in a deal with administrators, which fell through after the [[Rugby Football League|RFL]] declared Doncaster players to be free agents.

When a [[Rupert Murdoch]]-funded [[Super League]] competition was first proposed, part of the deal was that some traditional clubs would merge. Sheffield were again down to merge with [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] to form a ''South Yorkshire'' club that would compete in Super League. This, along with other proposed mergers, were strongly opposed by supporters and never materialised. As ''Sheffield Eagles'' the club became a founder member of Super League in 1996 and took part in the first game of the [[Super League]] era against [[Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League|Paris Saint-Germain]].

In November 1996, chief executive Gary Hetherington sold his controlling interest in Sheffield Eagles to take over [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]]. [[Phil Larder]] became head coach, Paul Thompson, Chairman of Sheffield-based Sanderson Group Plc, became the majority shareholder, and Eagles plc became the first rugby league club to be floated on the Stock Exchange.

[[John Kear]] took over the coaching reins at Sheffield Eagles in 1997, taking them to the Premiership Semi-final in that year. The club's record attendance was set in August 1997 when 10,603 spectators saw them play [[Bradford Bulls]].

On 2 May 1998, having beaten [[Leigh Centurions]], Egremont Rangers, [[Castleford Tigers]] and [[Salford Red Devils]], the Eagles faced [[Wigan Warriors]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the final of the Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]]. Wigan were overwhelming favourites with a side containing some of the best players of the modern era, including [[Andy Farrell]], [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]] and [[Henry Paul]]. Sheffield coach [[John Kear]] devised a game plan that was executed perfectly by the team on the day. Star of the show was [[Rugby league positions|scrum half]] [[Mark Aston]], who won the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] as man of the match. The Eagles led from start to finish, running out 17–8 winners in one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition.

===Huddersfield–Sheffield Giants ===

Just as the club seemed to be on the verge of its greatest period, following the win in the cup final, things began to go wrong. The expected increase in attendances did not happen and the team did not perform well, finishing close to the [[relegation]] zone only one year after the Wembley triumph. Finances plummeted and with little outside help it became apparent that the Eagles were not viable in their current state. Just a year after performing the greatest upset in Challenge Cup history, the Eagles announced that they were to fold at the end of the season should no investors come on board to save the club.

In late 1999 the [[Rugby Football League]] wanted to lower the number of clubs in Super League. One of the measures they put in place was the option for two clubs to merge for the sum of £1,000,000. Fearing this was the only way to keep rugby league alive in Sheffield, the club accepted an offer from the RFL to merge with another struggling team, the [[Huddersfield Giants]], making a new team Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants, who were scheduled to play games in both [[Sheffield]] and [[Huddersfield]] in [[Super League V]]. The Huddersfield-Sheffield side's away strip was in the Sheffield Eagles colours. The merged Huddersfield-Sheffield team did not last the season before reverting to the Huddersfield name. An immediately resurrected Sheffield Eagles would continue in the lower leagues.

===2000–2005: 'New' Sheffield Eagles===

The merger with Huddersfield was not accepted by Sheffield supporters {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and so former player [[Mark Aston]] formed a new Eagles phoenix club, earning a place in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]] for the 2000 season, taking [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]]'s vacated place.

From 1999 to the present the Eagles have played in the [[Rugby League Championships|semi-professional leagues]], first the Northern Ford Premiership and then the second division of the [[Rugby League Championships|LHF Healthplan National League]]. [[Mark Aston]] assumed the role of player manager, continuing on the field until 2004, when he officially retired from playing. After the 2004 season Mark replaced his father Brian as chief executive, bringing in a new head coach in [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] at the end of the following year. As soon as the new club was reformed, it vowed to never overstretch its finances to achieve success. This made life difficult as the Eagles were denied the money received by other clubs in the NFP for TV rights as part of the deal that allowed them to re-enter the professional leagues.

2003 brought two club records; Sheffield suffered their record defeat on 2 February 2003 0–88 to [[Hull F.C.]] However, on 3 August 2003, [[London Skolars]] were the victims as Sheffield Eagles won 98–4, a record league victory to this day. In 2003 the team finished top of National League Two and reached the Grand Final, agonisingly losing 13–11 to the [[Keighley Cougars]]. Victory would have sent the Eagles into National League One, but this was not to be and a second play-off against the [[Batley Bulldogs]] ended in failure for the demoralised squad.

===2006–2008: Promotion===
Until 2006 the team struggled to match this effort, with key players retiring or being signed by bigger clubs – young players [[Mitch Stringer|Mitchell Stringer]] and [[Andy Raleigh]] went on to sign for [[Super League]] clubs. At the start of the 2006 season [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] was brought in as coach and the team finished in second place, qualifying for the play-offs for the right to join champions [[Dewsbury Rams]] in National League One. On 22 September 2006 they beat the [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] at the [[Don Valley Stadium]] to qualify for the Grand Final for a second time. In the Grand Final on 8 October they beat [[Swinton Lions]] 35–10 to be promoted to National League One. To the surprise of many Wilkinson resigned as head coach on 15 October 2006, citing personal reasons. National League One was seen as a springboard to a potential return to Super League, although this would be dependent on the RFL's continuation of the [[franchising]] or [[licensing]] system.  As Sheffield Eagles' chairman Ian Swire, remarked, after the 2006 Grand Final victory, \"We showed on Sunday that we can compete, and that in the near- to not-too-distant future we will get back into Super League\".

Mark Aston returned as coach in 2007. The 2007 season started slowly for the promoted team but ended with the Eagles defying the bookmakers, who had them as favourites for relegation, by finishing 6th in the league table and qualifying for the play-offs, where they lost a close game to [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]].

===2009–2012: Move to Bramall Lane===
In 2009 National League 1 was renamed the Co-operative Championship. The 2009 season started unevenly with incoming International players delayed by visa problems. However, the Eagles rallied to progress to the 5th round of the Challenge Cup and produced consistent performances, gaining at least a losing bonus point from all their League games. Despite a number of long-term injuries, the team finished 3rd only narrowly missing out on 2nd place; their highest finish since the re-launch, and they again qualified for the play-offs. In the play-offs they were expected to easily beat [[Featherstone Rovers]] in the first match at [[Don Valley Stadium]]. However, Rovers surprised many by winning, ending Sheffield's season at the first play-off hurdle.

On 16 October 2009, the Eagles announced they would be moving their home games from the start of the 2010 season to [[Bramall Lane]], home of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in a bid to increase attendances and atmosphere at games which now take place on Sunday afternoons. The Eagles moved to Bramall Lane on 11 April 2010, losing by 40–16 to Featherstone Rovers. The attendance of 2,871 was 3 times the average the Eagles achieved at Don Valley Stadium and the club hope to push on from there to achieve a [[Super League]] licence. The 2010 season saw the club finish in 6th place, making the play-offs and surprising both [[Leigh Centurions]] and [[Barrow Raiders]] with away victories before falling to eventual champions [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]].

The 2012 season was the Eagles most successful to date, reaching the semi finals of the [[Northern Rail Cup]] for the first time and beating Featherstone Rovers 20–16 in the Grand Final to become Championship Champions. The final was a re-match of the 2011 fixture which was the Eagles 1st ever appearance at the final but were beaten soundly on that occasion 40–4. The Eagles defeated [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]], [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] to reach the Grand Final with [[Scott Turner (rugby league)|Scott Turner]], [[Misi Taulapapa]], [[Quentin Laulu-Togagae]] and [[Dane McDonald]] all scoring for the Eagles to bring the trophy back to Sheffield.

The Eagles played 3 home games at Bramall Lane in 2012 with the rest taking place at Don Valley including a crowd on 1,895 watching the opening league game against [[Swinton Lions]] at Don Valley, the Eagles' highest crowd there since the [[Super League]] era.

===2013–2017: Post Don Valley===
The 2013 season was equally if not more successful that the previous season, reaching the final of the Northern Rail Cup for the first time, losing to [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] at [[the Shay]], but more importantly becoming the first side to win back to back Championship Grand Finals by beating [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] 19–12 at [[Leigh Sports Village]] to retain the Championship title.

The Eagles moved back to [[Owlerton Stadium]] for the 2014 season as the Don Valley Stadium was scheduled for demolition. The Eagles planned to play at the new [[Sheffield Hallam University]] facility at Bawtry Road but unfortunately this was not possible and Owlerton Stadium stepped in at the last minute. Sheffield Eagles announced that they would leave Owlerton for the 2015 season due to new [[Rugby Football League]] ground regulations and played the season in nearby [[Doncaster]] at the [[Keepmoat Stadium]], home of [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]].

In 2016 it was announced the Eagles would play at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]'s Sports Park. The first league game played by the professional team there was against [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and they won 26–6.

In 2017, the club agreed a one-year ground share with [[Wakefield Trinity]] at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. The club also returned to being a semi-professional outfit after an unsuccessful time as professional.

===2018–present: Permanent return to Sheffield===
The Eagles made their long-awaited return to [[Sheffield|their home city]] at the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://olympiclegacypark.co.uk/news/2017/10/sheffield-eagles-return-home|title=Sheffield Eagles return home|date=5 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The new stadium has a 4G pitch and a capacity of 1,889, although this is expected to increase to meet [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) regulations. The first home game back in [[Sheffield]] was against [[Toronto Wolfpack]] on 11 March, they lost 10–44. Ahead of [[2018 RFL Championship|this season]] players [[Greg Burns (rugby league)|Greg Burns]], [[Matt James (rugby league)|Matt James]] and [[Ryan Millar (rugby league)|Ryan Millar]] agreed to sign on for a further two years. They struck a deal with [[Super League]] side [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] for players on [[Rugby League Dual registration|Dual registration]]; this helped bolster the squad throughout the season and was considered to be a huge contribution to keeping them in the division. After a seven game losing streak to open the season, the Eagles finally won, at home against [[Rochdale Hornets|Rochdale]] by 38 points to 20. The season, however, ended disappointingly as the Eagles finished eighth in the league with the greatest achievement being staying up.

In 2019, however, things were looking up for the side as they brought in 14 new signings, including ex-Eagles [[Jason Crookes]], [[James Davey (rugby 
league)|James Davey]] and [[Pat Walker (rugby league)|Pat Walker]], but lost key players in [[Joshua Toole]] (Forbes), [[Matty Fozard]] (London). They got off to a flying start as they overcame the challenges of [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], [[Barrow Raiders|Barrow]] and [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] in the first month of the new season. That year saw the Eagles return to [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] for the first time in more than 2 decades to claim the inaugural [[1895 Cup]] by defeating [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] 38–16.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49458365|title=Sheffield Eagles beat Widnes Vikings to win inaugural 1895 Cup|date=24 August 2019|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> However, their League season was less of a success as they finished in 7th place.

During the off-season, plans to build the Olympic Legacy Park were put into jeopardy as a court case to claim 100% ownership of [[Sheffield United F.C.]] found in favour of HRH Prince Abdullah bin Musa'ad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud over [[Kevin McCabe (businessman)|Kevin McCabe]] -one of the main investors to the OLP project for Sheffield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-united/prince-abdullah-wins-sheffield-united-ownership-battle-as-kevin-mccabe-considers-an-appeal-1-9997553|title=

However, these fears were quashed when it was revealed construction would go ahead as planned in early 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldeagles.com/club/new_stadium|title=

==Colours and badge==

===Colours===
The club adopted the colours of the original Sheffield Eagles, playing in red, gold and white. The club's shirts have been predominantly red with either a gold or white V across the front. Away shirts vary in colour with some being black or white. The 2020 home shirt is predominantly red, white and gold. The 2020 away kit is a gold and black strip, black shorts and black socks.

===Badge===
<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Sheffield-eagles.gif|right|150px]] -->
The original club's badge was an Eagles head inside a crest with ''The Eagles'' across the top and Sheffield Eagles in italics across the bottom. The inside of the crest was yellow with a red border. The new club chose to use a different more updated crest to replace the old dated one. The new more modern crest features an eagle with Sheffield Eagles written below it.

==Stadiums==
Sheffield originally played at [[Don Valley Stadium]]. In a bid to increase attendances, the Eagles left Don Valley in 2010 and moved to [[Bramall Lane]] where attendances rose to three times more than what they were at Don Valley. The Eagles returned to Don Valley midway through 2011 and stayed there until 2013. Don Valley was demolished in 2014.

After being left homeless the club moved to the city's greyhound track, [[Owlerton Stadium]] in [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] where they had previously played games between 1984–1989. The club experienced a dip in form at Owlerton, with there being temporary changing rooms and poor facilities.

The club moved out of Sheffield for the first time in 2015 when they made the temporary switch to the [[Keepmoat Stadium]], [[Doncaster]]. Here they ground shared with [[Doncaster Rovers]] and local rivals [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]], who were playing in the same division which meant the two clubs playing an extra home game when they faced each other. At the end of the [[RFL Championship|season]], during [[The Qualifiers]], the Eagles' were allowed to return to [[Bramall Lane]] for games against [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull K.R.]] and [[Wakefield Trinity]]. They also hosted [[Hull F.C.]] at the Lane, in a [[Challenge Cup]] fifth round tie.

The Eagles moved to Sheffield Hallam University's Sports Park on Bawtry Road, [[Brinsworth]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham|Rotherham]] in 2016, where the reserves played their home fixtures. Temporary seating was erected to bring the capacity to 3,000 to meet [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) regulations.

After finding themselves homeless again with work on the Sheffield Olympic Legacy Stadium delayed and unable to find a home in Sheffield, the Eagles played their home matches at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], the home of [[Wakefield Trinity]], for the duration of the 2017 season.

The club finally permanently returned to Sheffield and the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] in 2018. Work is due to start on the construction of a £5million stadium in the spring of 2019.<ref name=\"Work to get under way on £5 million stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/work-to-get-underway-on-5-million-stadium-which-will-give-sheffield-united-women-and-sheffield-eagles-a-home-1-9608903|title=Work to get under way on £5 million stadium which will give Sheffield United Women and Sheffield Eagles a home|publisher=Sheffield Star|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>

The '''Sheffield Eagles''' are a professional [[rugby league]] club that play in the [[Championship (rugby league)|Betfred Championship]].<ref name=\"Operational Rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby-league.com/operational-rules/|title=Operational Rules|publisher=RFL|accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref> The club play their home games at the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] (OLP) on the former site of [[Don Valley Stadium]], their former ground. The original club was formed in 1984 and formerly competed in the [[Super League]]. The new, current club was formed in 2000 following a merger of the old club with [[Huddersfield Giants]]. The old club's biggest achievement was winning the [[Challenge Cup]] in 1998. The Eagles are the current holders of the 1895 Cup, after they beat Widnes Vikings at Wembley Stadium on 24 August.

== History ==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}

=== 1982–1984: Foundation of original Eagles ===
In 1982, [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] captain and chairman of the Players' Union, [[Gary Hetherington]], missed out on a coaching job at [[York F.C.]]. He decided to form his own club in Sheffield. The original plan to enter the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]] in 1983–84 fell apart when [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] pulled back from their promise to let the new team play its home games at [[Bramall Lane]].

The club eventually joined the Second Division in 1984, coached by [[Alan Rhodes (rugby league)|Alan Rhodes]], they played at the [[Owlerton Stadium]]. A competition was run in the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'' newspaper to find a name for the new club and \"Sheffield Eagles\" was the winner. The first Eagles league game was on 2 September 1984 when they beat [[Rochdale Hornets]], 29–10. The match took place the day after the club's sponsor went bust. Hetherington was both manager and player in the first season, building the team using experienced players from traditional areas. He also began signing up promising young players, one of whom was [[Mark Aston]], later to be a critical part of the Eagles' survival as a club and current head coach.

By November the club was close to folding because of financial problems. Sheffield beat [[Wakefield Trinity]] to set up a John Player Special Trophy first round tie against [[Leeds Rhinos]]. This lucrative game generated enough cash to see out the season.

===1985–1998: Progress and Challenge Cup win===
On the field the club progressed steadily, improving their league position until in 1988/89 they finished third in the league table and made it to the Second Division Premiership final at [[Old Trafford]]. In the final they outplayed [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], beating them by 43–18 and gaining promotion to the top flight of [[rugby league]]. Sheffield's record attendance at Owlerton was set at 3,636 for a third-round Challenge Cup game against [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] in 1989.

In the wake of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], stadium safety became an issue in British sport and Owlerton was declared unfit to stage professional rugby league. Eagles were forced to play their home games at seven different venues including [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] itself, [[Bramall Lane]], [[Recreation Ground (Chesterfield)|Recreation Ground]], [[Oakwell Stadium]] and [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. They survived one season in the top flight but were then relegated. This was a temporary decline as they immediately regained their place in the First Division, winning the Second Division title and Premiership. The Eagles slowly established themselves as a top flight club.

[[Don Valley Stadium]] became home for the club in September 1990, it had been built for the 1991 [[World Student Games]] held in Sheffield. In May 1991, Eagles signed their first local recruit, Jason Davidson. In 1992 they reached the Yorkshire Cup final, losing to [[Wakefield Trinity]].

Bill Gardner became coach in July 1993 season replacing Gary Hetherington who stood down from his coaching role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-broncos-man-to-coach-eagles-2321276.html|title=Rugby League: Broncos man to coach Eagles|author=|date=6 May 1993|work=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> In December following a run of five defeats, he was sacked and Hetherington took over as coach again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-league-gardner-takes-leave-of-sheffield-1466189.html|title=Rugby League: Gardner takes leave of Sheffield|author=|date=8 December 1993|work=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>

Sheffield was included on the schedule for a game against the [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] during their [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]] and were defeated, 80–2, in the first game following the first test match at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. This was the highest score by a Kangaroo touring team in England since they had defeated [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]], 92–7, on the [[1921–22 Kangaroo tour|1921–22 tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1921/game-16/bramley-vs-australia.html|title=Kangaroos Tour 1921 Series – Game 16 – Rugby League Project|first1=Shawn|last1=Dollin|first2=Andrew|last2=Ferguson|date=|work=RugbyLeagueProject.org|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> The Kangaroos ran in 14 tries to nil at Don Valley Stadium. However, because of the tie the club benefited from a significant financial gain.

In March 1995, Sheffield pulled out of a proposed merger with [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] following a \"breach of confidentiality\"; Sheffield were then set to take-over 'The Dons' in a deal with administrators, which fell through after the [[Rugby Football League|RFL]] declared Doncaster players to be free agents.

When a [[Rupert Murdoch]]-funded [[Super League]] competition was first proposed, part of the deal was that some traditional clubs would merge. Sheffield were again down to merge with [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] to form a ''South Yorkshire'' club that would compete in Super League. This, along with other proposed mergers, were strongly opposed by supporters and never materialised. As ''Sheffield Eagles'' the club became a founder member of Super League in 1996 and took part in the first game of the [[Super League]] era against [[Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League|Paris Saint-Germain]].

In November 1996, chief executive Gary Hetherington sold his controlling interest in Sheffield Eagles to take over [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]]. [[Phil Larder]] became head coach, Paul Thompson, Chairman of Sheffield-based Sanderson Group Plc, became the majority shareholder, and Eagles plc became the first rugby league club to be floated on the Stock Exchange.

[[John Kear]] took over the coaching reins at Sheffield Eagles in 1997, taking them to the Premiership Semi-final in that year. The club's record attendance was set in August 1997 when 10,603 spectators saw them play [[Bradford Bulls]].

On 2 May 1998, having beaten [[Leigh Centurions]], Egremont Rangers, [[Castleford Tigers]] and [[Salford Red Devils]], the Eagles faced [[Wigan Warriors]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the final of the Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]]. Wigan were overwhelming favourites with a side containing some of the best players of the modern era, including [[Andy Farrell]], [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]] and [[Henry Paul]]. Sheffield coach [[John Kear]] devised a game plan that was executed perfectly by the team on the day. Star of the show was [[Rugby league positions|scrum half]] [[Mark Aston]], who won the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] as man of the match. The Eagles led from start to finish, running out 17–8 winners in one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition.

===Huddersfield–Sheffield Giants ===

Just as the club seemed to be on the verge of its greatest period, following the win in the cup final, things began to go wrong. The expected increase in attendances did not happen and the team did not perform well, finishing close to the [[relegation]] zone only one year after the Wembley triumph. Finances plummeted and with little outside help it became apparent that the Eagles were not viable in their current state. Just a year after performing the greatest upset in Challenge Cup history, the Eagles announced that they were to fold at the end of the season should no investors come on board to save the club.

In late 1999 the [[Rugby Football League]] wanted to lower the number of clubs in Super League. One of the measures they put in place was the option for two clubs to merge for the sum of £1,000,000. Fearing this was the only way to keep rugby league alive in Sheffield, the club accepted an offer from the RFL to merge with another struggling team, the [[Huddersfield Giants]], making a new team Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants, who were scheduled to play games in both [[Sheffield]] and [[Huddersfield]] in [[Super League V]]. The Huddersfield-Sheffield side's away strip was in the Sheffield Eagles colours. The merged Huddersfield-Sheffield team did not last the season before reverting to the Huddersfield name. An immediately resurrected Sheffield Eagles would continue in the lower leagues.

===2000–2005: 'New' Sheffield Eagles===

The merger with Huddersfield was not accepted by Sheffield supporters {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and so former player [[Mark Aston]] formed a new Eagles phoenix club, earning a place in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]] for the 2000 season, taking [[Bramley RLFC|Bramley]]'s vacated place.

From 1999 to the present the Eagles have played in the [[Rugby League Championships|semi-professional leagues]], first the Northern Ford Premiership and then the second division of the [[Rugby League Championships|LHF Healthplan National League]]. [[Mark Aston]] assumed the role of player manager, continuing on the field until 2004, when he officially retired from playing. After the 2004 season Mark replaced his father Brian as chief executive, bringing in a new head coach in [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] at the end of the following year. As soon as the new club was reformed, it vowed to never overstretch its finances to achieve success. This made life difficult as the Eagles were denied the money received by other clubs in the NFP for TV rights as part of the deal that allowed them to re-enter the professional leagues.

2003 brought two club records; Sheffield suffered their record defeat on 2 February 2003 0–88 to [[Hull F.C.]] However, on 3 August 2003, [[London Skolars]] were the victims as Sheffield Eagles won 98–4, a record league victory to this day. In 2003 the team finished top of National League Two and reached the Grand Final, agonisingly losing 13–11 to the [[Keighley Cougars]]. Victory would have sent the Eagles into National League One, but this was not to be and a second play-off against the [[Batley Bulldogs]] ended in failure for the demoralised squad.

===2006–2008: Promotion===
Until 2006 the team struggled to match this effort, with key players retiring or being signed by bigger clubs – young players [[Mitch Stringer|Mitchell Stringer]] and [[Andy Raleigh]] went on to sign for [[Super League]] clubs. At the start of the 2006 season [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] was brought in as coach and the team finished in second place, qualifying for the play-offs for the right to join champions [[Dewsbury Rams]] in National League One. On 22 September 2006 they beat the [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] at the [[Don Valley Stadium]] to qualify for the Grand Final for a second time. In the Grand Final on 8 October they beat [[Swinton Lions]] 35–10 to be promoted to National League One. To the surprise of many Wilkinson resigned as head coach on 15 October 2006, citing personal reasons. National League One was seen as a springboard to a potential return to Super League, although this would be dependent on the RFL's continuation of the [[franchising]] or [[licensing]] system.  As Sheffield Eagles' chairman Ian Swire, remarked, after the 2006 Grand Final victory, \"We showed on Sunday that we can compete, and that in the near- to not-too-distant future we will get back into Super League\".

Mark Aston returned as coach in 2007. The 2007 season started slowly for the promoted team but ended with the Eagles defying the bookmakers, who had them as favourites for relegation, by finishing 6th in the league table and qualifying for the play-offs, where they lost a close game to [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]].

===2009–2012: Move to Bramall Lane===
In 2009 National League 1 was renamed the Co-operative Championship. The 2009 season started unevenly with incoming International players delayed by visa problems. However, the Eagles rallied to progress to the 5th round of the Challenge Cup and produced consistent performances, gaining at least a losing bonus point from all their League games. Despite a number of long-term injuries, the team finished 3rd only narrowly missing out on 2nd place; their highest finish since the re-launch, and they again qualified for the play-offs. In the play-offs they were expected to easily beat [[Featherstone Rovers]] in the first match at [[Don Valley Stadium]]. However, Rovers surprised many by winning, ending Sheffield's season at the first play-off hurdle.

On 16 October 2009, the Eagles announced they would be moving their home games from the start of the 2010 season to [[Bramall Lane]], home of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in a bid to increase attendances and atmosphere at games which now take place on Sunday afternoons. The Eagles moved to Bramall Lane on 11 April 2010, losing by 40–16 to Featherstone Rovers. The attendance of 2,871 was 3 times the average the Eagles achieved at Don Valley Stadium and the club hope to push on from there to achieve a [[Super League]] licence. The 2010 season saw the club finish in 6th place, making the play-offs and surprising both [[Leigh Centurions]] and [[Barrow Raiders]] with away victories before falling to eventual champions [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]].

The 2012 season was the Eagles most successful to date, reaching the semi finals of the [[Northern Rail Cup]] for the first time and beating Featherstone Rovers 20–16 in the Grand Final to become Championship Champions. The final was a re-match of the 2011 fixture which was the Eagles 1st ever appearance at the final but were beaten soundly on that occasion 40–4. The Eagles defeated [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]], [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] to reach the Grand Final with [[Scott Turner (rugby league)|Scott Turner]], [[Misi Taulapapa]], [[Quentin Laulu-Togagae]] and [[Dane McDonald]] all scoring for the Eagles to bring the trophy back to Sheffield.

The Eagles played 3 home games at Bramall Lane in 2012 with the rest taking place at Don Valley including a crowd on 1,895 watching the opening league game against [[Swinton Lions]] at Don Valley, the Eagles' highest crowd there since the [[Super League]] era.

===2013–2017: Post Don Valley===
The 2013 season was equally if not more successful that the previous season, reaching the final of the Northern Rail Cup for the first time, losing to [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] at [[the Shay]], but more importantly becoming the first side to win back to back Championship Grand Finals by beating [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] 19–12 at [[Leigh Sports Village]] to retain the Championship title.

The Eagles moved back to [[Owlerton Stadium]] for the 2014 season as the Don Valley Stadium was scheduled for demolition. The Eagles planned to play at the new [[Sheffield Hallam University]] facility at Bawtry Road but unfortunately this was not possible and Owlerton Stadium stepped in at the last minute. Sheffield Eagles announced that they would leave Owlerton for the 2015 season due to new [[Rugby Football League]] ground regulations and played the season in nearby [[Doncaster]] at the [[Keepmoat Stadium]], home of [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]].

In 2016 it was announced the Eagles would play at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]'s Sports Park. The first league game played by the professional team there was against [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and they won 26–6.

In 2017, the club agreed a one-year ground share with [[Wakefield Trinity]] at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. The club also returned to being a semi-professional outfit after an unsuccessful time as professional.

===2018–present: Permanent return to Sheffield===
The Eagles made their long-awaited return to [[Sheffield|their home city]] at the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://olympiclegacypark.co.uk/news/2017/10/sheffield-eagles-return-home|title=Sheffield Eagles return home|date=5 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The new stadium has a 4G pitch and a capacity of 1,889, although this is expected to increase to meet [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) regulations. The first home game back in [[Sheffield]] was against [[Toronto Wolfpack]] on 11 March, they lost 10–44. Ahead of [[2018 RFL Championship|this season]] players [[Greg Burns (rugby league)|Greg Burns]], [[Matt James (rugby league)|Matt James]] and [[Ryan Millar (rugby league)|Ryan Millar]] agreed to sign on for a further two years. They struck a deal with [[Super League]] side [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] for players on [[Rugby League Dual registration|Dual registration]]; this helped bolster the squad throughout the season and was considered to be a huge contribution to keeping them in the division. After a seven game losing streak to open the season, the Eagles finally won, at home against [[Rochdale Hornets|Rochdale]] by 38 points to 20. The season, however, ended disappointingly as the Eagles finished eighth in the league with the greatest achievement being staying up.

In 2019, however, things were looking up for the side as they brought in 14 new signings, including ex-Eagles [[Jason Crookes]], [[James Davey (rugby 
league)|James Davey]] and [[Pat Walker (rugby league)|Pat Walker]], but lost key players in [[Joshua Toole]] (Forbes), [[Matty Fozard]] (London). They got off to a flying start as they overcame the challenges of [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]], [[Barrow Raiders|Barrow]] and [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] in the first month of the new season. That year saw the Eagles return to [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] for the first time in more than 2 decades to claim the inaugural [[1895 Cup]] by defeating [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] 38–16.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49458365|title=Sheffield Eagles beat Widnes Vikings to win inaugural 1895 Cup|date=24 August 2019|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> However, their League season was less of a success as they finished in 7th place.

During the off-season, plans to build the Olympic Legacy Park were put into jeopardy as a court case to claim 100% ownership of [[Sheffield United F.C.]] found in favour of HRH Prince Abdullah bin Musa'ad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud over [[Kevin McCabe (businessman)|Kevin McCabe]] -one of the main investors to the OLP project for Sheffield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-united/prince-abdullah-wins-sheffield-united-ownership-battle-as-kevin-mccabe-considers-an-appeal-1-9997553|title=
Prince Abdullah wins Sheffield United ownership battlel|date=16 September 2019|publisher=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> Because of this, there were fears that Mr McCabe would remove plans for his Scarborough Group LTD to head up construction of a new ground on the site at the OLP. However, these fears were quashed when it was revealed construction would go ahead as planned in early 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldeagles.com/club/new_stadium|title=

==Colours and badge==

===Colours===
The club adopted the colours of the original Sheffield Eagles, playing in red, yellow and white. The club's shirts have been predominantly red with either a yellow or white V across the front. Away shirts vary in colour with some being black or white. The 2020 home shirt is predominantly red, white and gold. The 2020 away kit is a gold and black strip, black shorts and black socks.

===Badge===
<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Sheffield-eagles.gif|right|150px]] -->
The original club's badge was an Eagles head inside a crest with ''The Eagles'' across the top and Sheffield Eagles in italics across the bottom. The inside of the crest was yellow with a red border. The new club chose to use a different more updated crest to replace the old dated one. The new more modern crest features an eagle with Sheffield Eagles written below it.

==Stadiums==
Sheffield originally played at [[Don Valley Stadium]]. In a bid to increase attendances, the Eagles left Don Valley in 2010 and moved to [[Bramall Lane]] where attendances rose to three times more than what they were at Don Valley. The Eagles returned to Don Valley midway through 2011 and stayed there until 2013. Don Valley was demolished in 2014.

After being left homeless the club moved to the city's greyhound track, [[Owlerton Stadium]] in [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] where they had previously played games between 1984–1989. The club experienced a dip in form at Owlerton, with there being temporary changing rooms and poor facilities.

The club moved out of Sheffield for the first time in 2015 when they made the temporary switch to the [[Keepmoat Stadium]], [[Doncaster]]. Here they ground shared with [[Doncaster Rovers]] and local rivals [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]], who were playing in the same division which meant the two clubs playing an extra home game when they faced each other. At the end of the [[RFL Championship|season]], during [[The Qualifiers]], the Eagles' were allowed to return to [[Bramall Lane]] for games against [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull K.R.]] and [[Wakefield Trinity]]. They also hosted [[Hull F.C.]] at the Lane, in a [[Challenge Cup]] fifth round tie.

The Eagles moved to Sheffield Hallam University's Sports Park on Bawtry Road, [[Brinsworth]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham|Rotherham]] in 2016, where the reserves played their home fixtures. Temporary seating was erected to bring the capacity to 3,000 to meet [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) regulations.

After finding themselves homeless again with work on the Sheffield Olympic Legacy Stadium delayed and unable to find a home in Sheffield, the Eagles played their home matches at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], the home of [[Wakefield Trinity]], for the duration of the 2017 season.

The club finally permanently returned to Sheffield and the [[Olympic Legacy Park]] in 2018. Work is due to start on the construction of a £5million stadium in the spring of 2019.<ref name=\"Work to get under way on £5 million stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/work-to-get-underway-on-5-million-stadium-which-will-give-sheffield-united-women-and-sheffield-eagles-a-home-1-9608903|title=Work to get under way on £5 million stadium which will give Sheffield United Women and Sheffield Eagles a home|publisher=Sheffield Star|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>

In 2013 under coach [[Andrew Henderson (rugby league)|Andrew Henderson]] they lifted the title, beating [[Nottingham Outlaws (rugby league team)|Nottingham Outlaws]], having lost just once all season.

'''Sherwood Anderson''' I miss you (September 13, 1876 – March 8, 1941) was an American novelist and short story writer, known for subjective and self-revealing works. Self-educated, he rose to become a successful copywriter and business owner in [[Cleveland]] and [[Elyria, Ohio]]. In 1912, Anderson had a nervous breakdown that led him to abandon his business and family to become a writer.

At the time, he moved to [[Chicago]] and was eventually married three additional times. His most enduring work is the short-story sequence ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]],''<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/anderson-sherwood-1876-1941-sjpc-01/ Anderson, Sherwood (1876–1941) | St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Summary]</ref> which launched his career. Throughout the 1920s, Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. Though his books sold reasonably well, ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925), a novel inspired by Anderson's time in [[New Orleans]] during the 1920s, was his only bestseller.

==Early life==
Sherwood Berton Anderson was born on September 13, 1876, in [[Camden, Ohio]], a farming town with a population of around 650 (according to the 1870 census).<ref name=\"Rideout16\">Rideout (2006), 16</ref> He was the third of seven children born to Emma Jane (née Smith) and former [[Union Army|Union]] soldier and harness-maker Irwin McLain Anderson. Considered reasonably well-off financially, Anderson's father was seen as an up-and-comer by his Camden contemporaries,<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> the family left town just before Sherwood's first birthday. Reasons for the departure are uncertain; most biographers note rumors of debts incurred by either Irwin<ref>Schevill (1951), 8</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 12</ref> or his brother Benjamin.<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> The Andersons headed north to [[Caledonia, Ohio|Caledonia]] by way of a brief stay in a village of a few hundred called Independence (now [[Butler, Ohio|Butler]]). Four<ref>Townsend (1987), 3</ref> or five<ref>Rideout (2006), 18</ref> years were spent in Caledonia, years which formed Anderson's earliest memories. This period later inspired his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Tar: A Midwest Childhood]]'' (1926).<ref name=\"Rideout20\">Rideout (2006), 20. For connection between ''Tar'' and Caledonia, also see Anderson (1942), 14-16</ref> In Caledonia Anderson's father began drinking excessively, which led to financial difficulties, eventually causing the family to leave the town.<ref name=\"Rideout20\" />

With each move, Irwin Anderson's prospects dimmed; while in Camden he was the proprietor of a successful shop and could employ an assistant, but by the time the Andersons finally settled down in [[Clyde, Ohio]] in 1884, a frontier town, Irwin could only get work as a hired man to harness manufacturers.<ref>Townsend (1987), 4</ref> That job was short-lived, and for the rest of Sherwood Anderson's childhood, his father barely supported the family as an occasional sign-painter and paperhanger, while his mother took in washing to make ends meet.<ref>Howe (1951), 13-14</ref> Partly as a result of these misfortunes, young Sherwood became adept at finding various odd jobs to help his family, earning the nickname \"Jobby.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 34</ref><ref name=\"Townsend14\">Townsend (1987), 14. The chapter about Anderson's early life is called \"Jobby.\"</ref>

Though he was a decent student, Anderson's attendance at school declined as he began picking up work, and he finally left school for good at age 14 after about nine months of high school.<ref name=\"Howe16\">Howe (1951), 16</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 39</ref> From the time he began to cut school to the time he left town, Anderson worked as a \"...newsboy, errand boy, waterboy, cow-driver, stable groom, and perhaps [[printer's devil]], not to mention assistant to Irwin Anderson, Sign Painter...\"<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> in addition to assembling bicycles for the [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore Manufacturing Company]].<ref>Townsend (1987), 25-26</ref> Even in his teens, Anderson's talent for selling was evident, a talent he would later draw on in a successful career in advertising. As a newsboy he was said to have convinced a tired farmer in a saloon to buy two copies of the same evening paper.<ref name=\"Townsend14\"/> With the exception of work, Anderson's childhood resembled that of other boys his age.

In addition to participating in local events and spending time with his friends, Anderson was a voracious reader. Though there were only a few books in the Anderson home (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and the ''Complete Poems'' of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] among them),<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> the youth read widely by borrowing from the school library (there was not a public library in Clyde until 1903), and the personal libraries of a school superintendent and John Tichenor, a local artist, who responded to Anderson's interest.<ref>Rideout (2006), 37-38. See Anderson (1924), 155-56 for list of authors enjoyed by young Anderson</ref>

By Anderson's 18th year in 1895, his family was on shaky ground. His father had started to disappear for weeks.<ref>Townsend (1987), 11</ref> Two years earlier, in 1893, Karl, Sherwood's elder brother, had left Clyde for [[Chicago]].<ref>Spanierman Gallery, LLC. [http://www.spanierman.com/Anderson,-Karl/bio/thumbs/biography KARL ANDERSON (1874 - 1956)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530064502/http://www.spanierman.com/Anderson,-Karl/bio/thumbs/biography |date=May 30, 2013 }}. Accessed 26 May 2013.</ref> On May 10, 1895, his mother succumbed to [[tuberculosis]]. Sherwood, now essentially on his own, boarded at the Harvey & Yetter's livery stable where he worked as a groom—an experience that would translate into several of his best-known stories.<ref>Townsend (1987), 28</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 59-61</ref> (Irwin Anderson died in 1919 after having been estranged from his son for two decades.)<ref name=\"Townsend30\">Townsend (1987), 30</ref> Two months before his mother's death, in March 1895, Anderson had signed up with the [[Ohio National Guard]] for a five-year hitch<ref>Rideout (2006), 50</ref> while he was going steady with Bertha Baynes, an attractive girl and possibly the inspiration for Helen White in ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'',<ref>Rideout (2006), 47</ref> and he was working a secure job at the bicycle factory. But his mother's death precipitated the young man's leaving Clyde.<ref name=\"Townsend30\"/> He settled in [[Chicago]] around late 1896<ref>Townsend (1987), 31</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 27</ref> or spring/summer 1897, having worked a few small-town factory jobs along the way.<ref>Rideout (2006), 69-71</ref>

==Chicago and war==
Anderson moved to a boardinghouse in Chicago owned by a former mayor of Clyde. His brother Karl lived in the city and was studying at the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]]. Anderson moved in with him and quickly found a job at a cold-storage plant.<ref>Townsend (1987), 33</ref> In late 1897, Karl moved away, and Anderson relocated to a two-room flat with his sister and two younger brothers newly come from Clyde.<ref>Townsend (1987), 34</ref> Money was tight—Anderson earned \"two dollars for a day of ten hours\"—<ref>Anderson (1942), 112</ref> but with occasional support from Karl, they got by. Following the example of his Clyde confederate and lifelong friend Cliff Paden (later to become known as [[John Emerson (filmmaker)|John Emerson]]) and Karl, Anderson took up the idea of furthering his education by enrolling in night school at the [[Lewis Institute#Lewis Institute|Lewis Institute]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\">Rideout (2006), 73–74</ref> He attended several classes regularly including \"New Business Arithmetic\" earning marks that placed him second in the class.<ref>Townsend (1987), 36</ref> It was also there that Anderson heard lectures on [[Robert Browning]], Alfred Tennyson, and was possibly first introduced to the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\" /> Soon, however, Anderson's first stint in Chicago would come to an end as the United States prepared to enter the [[Spanish–American War]].

Although he had limited resources while in Chicago, Anderson bought a new suit and returned to Clyde to join the military.<ref>Townsend (1987), 38</ref> Once home, the company he joined mustered into the army at Camp Bushnell, Ohio on May 12, 1898.<ref>Rideout (2006), 78</ref> Several months of training followed at various southern encampments until early in 1899, when his company was sent to [[Cuba]]. Fighting had ceased four months prior to their arrival. On April 21, 1899, they left Cuba having seen no combat.<ref>Townsend (1987), 39–41</ref> According to Irving Howe, \"Sherwood was popular among his army comrades, who remembered him as a fellow given to prolonged reading, mostly in dime westerns and historical romances, and talented at finding a girl when he wanted one. For the first of these traits he was frequently teased, but the second brought him the respect it usually does in armies.\"<ref>Howe (1951), 29</ref>

After the war, Anderson resided briefly in Clyde performing agricultural work before deciding to return to school.<ref>Townsend (1987), 41</ref> In September 1899 Anderson joined his siblings Karl and Stella in [[Springfield, Ohio]] where, at the age of twenty-three he enrolled for his senior year of preparatory school at the Wittenberg Academy, a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] located on the campus of the [[Wittenberg University]]. In his time there he performed well, earning good marks and participating in several extracurricular activities. In the spring of 1900 Anderson graduated from the Academy, offering a discourse on [[Zionism]] as one of the eight students chosen to give a commencement speech.<ref name=\"Howe3132\">Howe (1951), 31–32</ref>

==Business, marriage and family==
During his time in Springfield, Anderson stayed and worked as a \"chore boy\" in a boardinghouse called The Oaks among a group of businessmen, educators, and other creatives types many of whom became friendly with the young Anderson.<ref name=\"Howe3132\"/> In particular, a high school teacher named Trillena White and a businessman Harry Simmons played a role in the author's life. The former who was ten years Anderson's senior would walk—raising eyebrows among the other boarders—with the young man in the evenings. More importantly, according to Anderson, she \"first introduced me to fine literature\"<ref>Anderson (1984), 227–228</ref> and would later serve as inspiration for a number of his characters including the teacher Kate Swift in ''Winesburg, Ohio''.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\">Townsend (1987), 42–43</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 226</ref> The latter, who worked as the advertising manager for Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick (later Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, publishers of the ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'') and occasionally took meals at The Oaks, was so impressed by Anderson's commencement speech that he offered him a job on the spot as an advertising solicitor at his company's Chicago office.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\"/> Thus, in the summer of 1900, Anderson returned to Chicago where most of his siblings were now living, intent on achieving success in his new white-collar occupation.<ref>Rideout (2006), 92–93</ref>

Though he performed well, problems with his boss and a dislike for the office routine and for the style of correspondence, which caused the ultimate rift, caused Anderson to leave Crowell in mid-1901 for a position set up for him by Marco Marrow, another friend from The Oaks, at the Frank B. White Advertising Company (later the Long-Critchfield Agency).<ref>Daugherty (1948), 31</ref> There the author stayed until 1906, selling ads and writing advertising copy for manufacturers of farming implements and articles for the trade journal, ''Agricultural Advertising''.<ref>See Rideout (2006), 95–110 &amp; Anderson (1989) for analysis and the collected early work, respectively</ref> In this latter magazine Anderson published his first professional work, a February 1902 piece called \"The Farmer Wears Clothes.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 95</ref> What followed were approximately 29 articles and essays for his company's magazine, and two for a small literary magazine published by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] called ''The Reader''.<ref>Campbell, Hilbert H (Summer 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/early.html The Early non-Journal Writings]\". ''The Sherwood Anderson Review'' '''23''' (2).</ref> According to scholar Welford Dunaway Taylor, the two monthly columns (\"Rot and Reason\" and \"Business Types\") Anderson wrote for ''Agricultural Advertising'' exemplified the \"character writing\" (or [[character sketch]]es) that would later become a notable part of the author's approach in ''Winesburg, Ohio'' and other works.<ref>Taylor, Welford Dunaway (Winter 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/wd.html Remembered \"Characters\" in ''Winesburg, Ohio'']\".

Part of Anderson's job in those early years of his career was making trips to solicit potential clients. On one of these trips around May 1903 he stopped in the home of a friend from Clyde, Jane \"Jennie\" Bemis, then living in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It was there that he met Cornelia Pratt Lane (1877–1967), the daughter of wealthy Ohio businessman Robert Lane. The two were married a year later, on the 16th of May, in [[Lucas, Ohio]].<ref>Ohio,
 County Marriages, 1774-1993</ref> They would go on to have three children—Robert Lane (1907–1951), John Sherwood (1908–1995), and Marion (aka Mimi, 1911–1996).<ref>Rideout (2006), 112–114</ref> After a short honeymoon, the couple moved into an apartment on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side of Chicago]].<ref>A copy of Sherwood Anderson's honeymoon journal is available in the ''[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/98summer.html Sherwood Anderson Review]'' (Summer 1998)</ref> For two additional years, Anderson worked for Long-Critchfield until an opportunity came along from one of the accounts he managed and so on [[Labor Day]] 1906, Sherwood Anderson left Chicago for [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to become president of United Factories Company, a mail-order firm selling various items from surrounding firms.<ref>Rideout (2006), 122–123</ref>

While his new job, which amounted to the position of sales manager, could be stressful<ref name=\":0\">Townsend (1987), 59–60</ref> the happy home life Cornelia had fostered in Chicago continued in Cleveland; \"his wife and he entertained frequently. They went to church on Sundays, with Anderson decked out in morning clothes and top hat. On occasional Sunday afternoons Cornelia taught him French. She also helped with his advertising work.\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 45</ref> Unfortunately, his home life could not sustain him when one of the manufacturers United Factories marketed produced a large batch of defective [[Incubators (egg)|incubators]]. Soon, letters addressed to Anderson (who personally guaranteed all products sold) began to arrive from customers both desperate and angry. The strain from months of answering hundreds of these letters while continuing his demanding schedule at work and home led to a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1907 and eventually his departure from the company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 126–128</ref>

His failure in Cleveland did not delay him for long, however, because in September 1907, the Andersons moved to Elyria, Ohio, a town of approximately ten thousand residents, where he rented a warehouse within sight of the railroad and began a mail-order business selling (at a markup of 500%) a preservative paint called \"Roof-Fix.\"<ref>Daugherty (1948), 33</ref> The first years in Elyria went very well for Anderson and his family; two more children were added for a total of three in addition to a busy social life for their parents.<ref>Howe (1951), 41–42</ref> So well, in fact, did the Anderson Manufacturing Co. do that Anderson was able to purchase and absorb several similar businesses and expand his firm's product-lines under the name Anderson Paint Company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 134</ref> Carrying on that momentum, in late 1911 Anderson secured the financial backing to merge his companies into the American Merchants Company, a profit-sharing/investment firm operating in part on a scheme he developed around that time called \"Commercial Democracy.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 137–138</ref><ref>Sutton (1967), 9–12</ref>

==Nervous breakdown==
It was then, at what seemed the pinnacle of his business achievements, when the stresses of Anderson's professional life collided with his social responsibilities and his writing, that Anderson suffered the breakdown that has remained paramount in the \"myth\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 55</ref> or \"legend\"<ref name=\"Howe49\">Howe (1951), 49</ref><ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\">White (1972), xii–xiv</ref> of Sherwood Anderson's life.<ref>Rideout (2006), 149–155</ref>

On Thursday, November 28, 1912, Anderson came to his office in a slightly nervous state. According to his secretary, he opened some mail, and in the course of dictating a business letter became distracted. After writing a note to his wife, he murmured something along the lines of \"I feel as though my feet were wet, and they keep getting wetter.\"<ref group=\"note\">The quote above comes from the Frances Shute, Anderson's secretary at the time, as cited in Rideout (2006), 155. In Anderson (1924), it was remembered as \"I have been wading in a long river and my feet are wet. My feet are cold, wet and heavy from long wading in a river. Now I shall go walk on dry land,\" whereas in Anderson (1942), it was \"My feet are cold and wet. I have been walking too long on the bed of a river.\"</ref> and left the office. Four days later, on Sunday December 1, a disoriented Anderson entered a drug store on East 152nd Street in Cleveland and asked the pharmacist to help figure out his identity. Unable to make out what the incoherent Anderson was saying, the pharmacist discovered a phone book on his person and called the number of Edwin Baxter, a member of the Elyria Chamber of Commerce. Baxter came, recognized Anderson, and promptly had him checked into the Huron Road Hospital in downtown Cleveland, where Anderson's wife, who he would hardly recognize, went to meet him.<ref>Most Anderson's biographers agree on the events included here. For a general sense, see Rideout (2006), 155–156; Schevill (1951), 52–59; Townsend (1987), 76–82.</ref>

But even before returning home, Anderson began his lifelong practice of reinterpreting the story of his breakdown. Despite news reports in the ''Elyria Evening Telegram'' and the ''Cleveland Press'' following his admittance into the hospital that ascribed the cause of the breakdown to \"overwork\" and that mentioned Anderson's inability to remember what happened,<ref>See issues of December 2nd and 3rd for the former and December 3rd for the latter</ref> on December 6 the story changed. All of a sudden, the breakdown became voluntary. The ''Evening Telegram'' reported (possibly spuriously)<ref>Sutton (1967), 43–44</ref> that \"As soon as he recovers from the trance into which he placed himself, Sherwood Anderson ... will write a book of the sensations he experienced while he wandered over the country as a nomad.\"<ref>''Elyria Evening Telegram''(06 December 1912) as quoted in Schevill (1951), 59</ref> This same sense of personal agency is alluded to thirty years later in ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs'' (1942) where the author wrote of his thought process before walking out: \"I wanted to leave, get away from business. ... Again I resorted to slickness, to craftiness...The thought occurred to me that if men thought me a little insane they would forgive me if I lit out....\"<ref>Anderson (1942), 194</ref> This idea, however, that Anderson made a conscious decision on November 28 to make a clean break from family and business is unlikely.<ref name=\"Howe49\"/><ref>Sutton (1967), 12</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 157</ref> In the first place, contrary to what Anderson later claimed, his writing was no secret. It was known to his wife, secretary, and some business associates that for several years Anderson had been working on personal writing projects both at night and occasionally in his office at the factory.<ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\"/> Secondly, although some of the notes he wrote were to himself during his journey, notes he mailed to his wife on Saturday, addressing the envelope \"Cornelia L. Anderson, Pres., American Striving Co.,\" show that he had some semblance of memory. The general confusion and frequent incoherence the notes exhibit is unlikely to be deliberate.<ref>Sutton (1967), 36–39 offers the complete text of the notes with analysis, and several other biographers including Townsend (1987) and Rideout (2006) analyze and print selections.</ref> While diagnoses for the four days of Anderson's wanderings have ranged from \"[[amnesia]]\" to \"lost identity\" to \"[[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]],\" his condition is generally characterized today as a \"[[fugue state]].\"<ref>Townsend (1987), 81</ref><ref>Sperber, Michael (05 June 2013). \"[Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Fugue) and a Literary Masterpiece http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychogenic-fugue-literature]\" ''Psychiatric Times''. Accessed 11 November 2013.</ref><ref>Ridout (2006), 156–157</ref> Anderson himself described the episode as \"escaping from his materialistic existence,\"{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and was admired for his action by many young male writers who chose to be inspired by him. Herbert Gold wrote, \"He fled in order to find himself, then prayed to flee that disease of self, to become 'beautiful and clear.'\"<ref name=\"nona\">Balakian, Nona (10 July 1988). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/10/books/a-life-of-dark-laughter.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm A Life of Dark Laughter]\". ''NY Times''. Accessed 31 May 2013.</ref><ref>Gold (1957–1958), 548</ref>

After having moved back to Chicago, Anderson formally divorced Cornelia. Later, he married his mistress, the sculptor [[Tennessee Claflin Mitchell]] (1874–1929).<ref>Bassett (2005), p. 21</ref> Anderson divorced Mitchell in 1924 in [[Reno, Nevada]], and soon the same year married his third wife, Elizabeth Prall, a woman he was already involved with before the divorce.<ref>Anderson, Elizabeth and Gerald R. Kelly (1969). ''Miss Elizabeth''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.</ref>

==Novelist==
Anderson's first novel, ''[[Windy McPherson's Son]]'', was published in 1916 as part of a three-book deal with [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]]. This book, along with his second novel, ''[[Marching Men]]'' (1917), are usually considered his \"apprentice novels\" because they came before Anderson found fame with ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919) and are generally considered inferior in quality to works that followed.<ref>Howe (1951), 91</ref>

Anderson's most notable work is his collection of interrelated short stories, ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919). In his memoir, he wrote that \"Hands\", the opening story, was the first \"real\" story he ever wrote.<ref>Anderson, Sherwood. ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1942.</ref>
<blockquote>\"Instead of emphasizing plot and action, Anderson used a simple, precise, unsentimental style to reveal the frustration, loneliness, and longing in the lives of his characters. These characters are stunted by the narrowness of Midwestern small-town life and by their own limitations.\"<ref name=\"fogel\"/></blockquote>In addition, Anderson was one of the first American novelists to introduce new insights from psychology, including [[Freudian analysis]].<ref name=\"fogel\">[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/anderson.html Daniel Mark Fogel,\"Sherwood Anderson\"], ''The American Novel,'' PBS, 2007, accessed 2 June 2013</ref>

Although his short stories were very successful, Anderson wanted to write novels, which he felt allowed a larger scale. In 1920, he published ''[[Poor White (novel)|Poor White]]'', which was rather successful. In 1923, Anderson published ''[[Many Marriages]]''; in it he explored the new sexual freedom, a theme which he continued in ''Dark Laughter'' and later writing.<ref name=\"nona\"/> ''Dark Laughter'' had its detractors, but the reviews were, on the whole, positive. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] considered ''Many Marriages'' to be Anderson's finest novel.<ref>Howe, Irving. ''Sherwood Anderson''. New York: William Sloane Associates, 1951. (pg. 254)</ref>

Beginning in 1924, Sherwood and Elizabeth Prall Anderson moved to [[New Orleans]], where they lived in the historic Pontalba Apartments (540-B St. Peter Street) adjoining [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] in the heart of the [[French Quarter]]. For a time, they entertained [[William Faulkner]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and other writers, for whom Anderson was a major influence. Critics trying to define Anderson's significance have said he was more influential through this younger generation than through his own works.<ref name=\"fogel\"/>

Anderson referred to meeting Faulkner in his ambiguous and moving short story, \"A Meeting South.\" His novel ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925) drew from his New Orleans experiences and continued to explore the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Although the book was satirized by [[Ernest Hemingway]] in his novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'', it was a bestseller at the time, the only book of Anderson's to reach that status during his lifetime.

==Four marriages==
Anderson and Cornelia Lane married in 1904 and divorced in 1916 after having his only 3 children. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Editors |title=Sherwood Anderson's Biography |url=http://umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/anderson/biography.htm |website=umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=9 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>.  

Anderson quickly married Tennessee Claflin Mitchell in 1916 and obtained a divorce [[Reno, Nevada]] in 1924.

That year Anderson married Elizabeth Norma Prall (1884–1976), a friend of Faulkner's whom he had met in New York. After several years that marriage also failed. In 1928 Anderson became involved with [[Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver]] (1896–1985).

In 1933, Anderson and Copenhaver married.<ref>Anderson (1991), pp. 8–9</ref> They traveled and often studied together. They were both active in the [[trade union]] movement.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/G-0005/excerpts/excerpt_2841.html ''Documenting the American South:'' Oral Histories of the American South], University of North Carolina</ref> Anderson also became close to Copenhaver's mother, [[Laura Copenhaver|Laura]].<ref name=\"virginia.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2007/copenhaver.htm|title=Virginia Women in History 2007: Laura Lu Scherer Copenhaver|publisher=}}</ref>

==Later work==
Anderson frequently contributed articles to newspapers. In 1935, he was commissioned to go to [[Franklin County, Virginia]] to cover a major federal trial of bootleggers and gangsters, in what was called \"The Great [[Moonshine]] Conspiracy\". More than 30 men had been indicted for trial. In his article, he said Franklin was the \"wettest county in the world,\" a phrase used as a title for a 21st-century novel by [[Matt Bondurant]].<ref name =LJ>{{cite journal| last = Fisher| first = Ann H.| title = The Wettest Country in the World [Review]| journal = Library Journal| date = 7/1/2008| volume = 133| issue = 12| page = 58}}</ref>

In the 1930s, Anderson published ''[[Death in the Woods]]'' ([[Short story|short stories]]), ''Puzzled America'' (essays), and ''Kit Brandon: A Portrait'' (novel). In 1932, Anderson dedicated his novel ''Beyond Desire'' to Copenhaver. Although by this time he was considered to be less influential overall in American literature, some of what have become his most quoted passages were published in these later works. The books were otherwise considered inferior to his earlier ones.

''Beyond Desire'' built on his interest in the trade union movement and was set during the 1929 [[Loray Mill Strike]] in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Hemingway referred to it satirically in his novel, ''[[To Have and Have Not]]'' (1937), where he included as a minor character an author working on a novel of Gastonia.

In his later years, Anderson and Copenhaver lived on his [[Ripshin Farm]] in [[Troutdale, Virginia]], which he purchased in 1927 for use during summers.<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|title=Ripshin Farm|accessdate=2008-04-16|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606154607/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While living there, he contributed to a country newspaper, columns that were collected and published posthumously.<ref>''Return to Winesburg: Selections from Four Years of Writing for a Country Newspaper'', edited by Ray Lewis White (1967)</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Sherwood Anderson's grave marker.jpg|thumb|Anderson's grave marker at Round Hill Cemetery in Marion, Virginia. Designed by Wharton Esherick and executed in black granite by Victor Riu.]]Anderson died on March 8, 1941, at the age of 64, taken ill during a [[cruising (maritime)|cruise]] to South America. He had been feeling abdominal discomfort for a few days, which was later diagnosed as [[peritonitis]]. Anderson and his wife disembarked from the cruise liner ''Santa Lucia'' and went to the hospital in [[Colón, Panama]], where he died on March 8.<ref>\"Anderson Is Dead; Noted Author; 64\".

Anderson's body was returned to the United States, where he was buried at Round Hill Cemetery in [[Marion, Virginia]]. His epitaph reads, \"Life, Not Death, Is the Great Adventure\".<ref>\"Sherwood Anderson\". [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29 findagrave.com]. Accessed April 22, 2012.</ref>

==Legacy and honors==
* In 1971, Anderson's final home in [[Troutdale, Virginia]], known as [[Ripshin Farm]], was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]].
* In 2012, Anderson was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/sherwood-anderson |title=Sherwood Anderson |date=2012 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame |language=en |access-date=2017-10-08}}</ref>

'''Sherwood Anderson''' (September 13, 1876 – March 8, 1941) was an American novelist and short story writer, known for subjective and self-revealing works. Self-educated, he rose to become a successful copywriter and business owner in [[Cleveland]] and [[Elyria, Ohio]]. In 1912, Anderson had a nervous breakdown that led him to abandon his business and family to become a writer.

At the time, he moved to [[Chicago]] and was eventually married three additional times. His most enduring work is the short-story sequence ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]],''<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/anderson-sherwood-1876-1941-sjpc-01/ Anderson, Sherwood (1876–1941) | St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Summary]</ref> which launched his career. Throughout the 1920s, Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. Though his books sold reasonably well, ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925), a novel inspired by Anderson's time in [[New Orleans]] during the 1920s, was his only bestseller.

==Early life==
Sherwood Berton Anderson was born on September 13, 1876, in [[Camden, Ohio]], a farming town with a population of around 650 (according to the 1870 census).<ref name=\"Rideout16\">Rideout (2006), 16</ref> He was the third of seven children born to Emma Jane (née Smith) and former [[Union Army|Union]] soldier and harness-maker Irwin McLain Anderson. Considered reasonably well-off financially, Anderson's father was seen as an up-and-comer by his Camden contemporaries,<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> the family left town just before Sherwood's first birthday. Reasons for the departure are uncertain; most biographers note rumors of debts incurred by either Irwin<ref>Schevill (1951), 8</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 12</ref> or his brother Benjamin.<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> The Andersons headed north to [[Caledonia, Ohio|Caledonia]] by way of a brief stay in a village of a few hundred called Independence (now [[Butler, Ohio|Butler]]). Four<ref>Townsend (1987), 3</ref> or five<ref>Rideout (2006), 18</ref> years were spent in Caledonia, years which formed Anderson's earliest memories. This period later inspired his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Tar: A Midwest Childhood]]'' (1926).<ref name=\"Rideout20\">Rideout (2006), 20. For connection between ''Tar'' and Caledonia, also see Anderson (1942), 14-16</ref> In Caledonia Anderson's father began drinking excessively, which led to financial difficulties, eventually causing the family to leave the town.<ref name=\"Rideout20\" />

With each move, Irwin Anderson's prospects dimmed; while in Camden he was the proprietor of a successful shop and could employ an assistant, but by the time the Andersons finally settled down in [[Clyde, Ohio]] in 1884, a frontier town, Irwin could only get work as a hired man to harness manufacturers.<ref>Townsend (1987), 4</ref> That job was short-lived, and for the rest of Sherwood Anderson's childhood, his father barely supported the family as an occasional sign-painter and paperhanger, while his mother took in washing to make ends meet.<ref>Howe (1951), 13-14</ref> Partly as a result of these misfortunes, young Sherwood became adept at finding various odd jobs to help his family, earning the nickname \"Jobby.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 34</ref><ref name=\"Townsend14\">Townsend (1987), 14. The chapter about Anderson's early life is called \"Jobby.\"</ref>

Though he was a decent student, Anderson's attendance at school declined as he began picking up work, and he finally left school for good at age 14 after about nine months of high school.<ref name=\"Howe16\">Howe (1951), 16</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 39</ref> From the time he began to cut school to the time he left town, Anderson worked as a \"...newsboy, errand boy, waterboy, cow-driver, stable groom, and perhaps [[printer's devil]], not to mention assistant to Irwin Anderson, Sign Painter...\"<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> in addition to assembling bicycles for the [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore Manufacturing Company]].<ref>Townsend (1987), 25-26</ref> Even in his teens, Anderson's talent for selling was evident, a talent he would later draw on in a successful career in advertising. As a newsboy he was said to have convinced a tired farmer in a saloon to buy two copies of the same evening paper.<ref name=\"Townsend14\"/> With the exception of work, Anderson's childhood resembled that of other boys his age.

In addition to participating in local events and spending time with his friends, Anderson was a voracious reader. Though there were only a few books in the Anderson home (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and the ''Complete Poems'' of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] among them),<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> the youth read widely by borrowing from the school library (there was not a public library in Clyde until 1903), and the personal libraries of a school superintendent and John Tichenor, a local artist, who responded to Anderson's interest.<ref>Rideout (2006), 37-38. See Anderson (1924), 155-56 for list of authors enjoyed by young Anderson</ref>

By Anderson's 18th year in 1895, his family was on shaky ground. His father had started to disappear for weeks.<ref>Townsend (1987), 11</ref> Two years earlier, in 1893, Karl, Sherwood's elder brother, had left Clyde for [[Chicago]].<ref>Spanierman Gallery, LLC. [http://www.spanierman.com/Anderson,-Karl/bio/thumbs/biography KARL ANDERSON (1874 - 1956)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530064502/http://www.spanierman.com/Anderson,-Karl/bio/thumbs/biography |date=May 30, 2013 }}. Accessed 26 May 2013.</ref> On May 10, 1895, his mother succumbed to [[tuberculosis]]. Sherwood, now essentially on his own, boarded at the Harvey & Yetter's livery stable where he worked as a groom—an experience that would translate into several of his best-known stories.<ref>Townsend (1987), 28</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 59-61</ref> (Irwin Anderson died in 1919 after having been estranged from his son for two decades.)<ref name=\"Townsend30\">Townsend (1987), 30</ref> Two months before his mother's death, in March 1895, Anderson had signed up with the [[Ohio National Guard]] for a five-year hitch<ref>Rideout (2006), 50</ref> while he was going steady with Bertha Baynes, an attractive girl and possibly the inspiration for Helen White in ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'',<ref>Rideout (2006), 47</ref> and he was working a secure job at the bicycle factory. But his mother's death precipitated the young man's leaving Clyde.<ref name=\"Townsend30\"/> He settled in [[Chicago]] around late 1896<ref>Townsend (1987), 31</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 27</ref> or spring/summer 1897, having worked a few small-town factory jobs along the way.<ref>Rideout (2006), 69-71</ref>

==Chicago and war==
Anderson moved to a boardinghouse in Chicago owned by a former mayor of Clyde. His brother Karl lived in the city and was studying at the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]]. Anderson moved in with him and quickly found a job at a cold-storage plant.<ref>Townsend (1987), 33</ref> In late 1897, Karl moved away, and Anderson relocated to a two-room flat with his sister and two younger brothers newly come from Clyde.<ref>Townsend (1987), 34</ref> Money was tight—Anderson earned \"two dollars for a day of ten hours\"—<ref>Anderson (1942), 112</ref> but with occasional support from Karl, they got by. Following the example of his Clyde confederate and lifelong friend Cliff Paden (later to become known as [[John Emerson (filmmaker)|John Emerson]]) and Karl, Anderson took up the idea of furthering his education by enrolling in night school at the [[Lewis Institute#Lewis Institute|Lewis Institute]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\">Rideout (2006), 73–74</ref> He attended several classes regularly including \"New Business Arithmetic\" earning marks that placed him second in the class.<ref>Townsend (1987), 36</ref> It was also there that Anderson heard lectures on [[Robert Browning]], Alfred Tennyson, and was possibly first introduced to the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\" /> Soon, however, Anderson's first stint in Chicago would come to an end as the United States prepared to enter the [[Spanish–American War]].

Although he had limited resources while in Chicago, Anderson bought a new suit and returned to Clyde to join the military.<ref>Townsend (1987), 38</ref> Once home, the company he joined mustered into the army at Camp Bushnell, Ohio on May 12, 1898.<ref>Rideout (2006), 78</ref> Several months of training followed at various southern encampments until early in 1899, when his company was sent to [[Cuba]]. Fighting had ceased four months prior to their arrival. On April 21, 1899, they left Cuba having seen no combat.<ref>Townsend (1987), 39–41</ref> According to Irving Howe, \"Sherwood was popular among his army comrades, who remembered him as a fellow given to prolonged reading, mostly in dime westerns and historical romances, and talented at finding a girl when he wanted one. For the first of these traits he was frequently teased, but the second brought him the respect it usually does in armies.\"<ref>Howe (1951), 29</ref>

After the war, Anderson resided briefly in Clyde performing agricultural work before deciding to return to school.<ref>Townsend (1987), 41</ref> In September 1899 Anderson joined his siblings Karl and Stella in [[Springfield, Ohio]] where, at the age of twenty-three he enrolled for his senior year of preparatory school at the Wittenberg Academy, a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] located on the campus of the [[Wittenberg University]]. In his time there he performed well, earning good marks and participating in several extracurricular activities. In the spring of 1900 Anderson graduated from the Academy, offering a discourse on [[Zionism]] as one of the eight students chosen to give a commencement speech.<ref name=\"Howe3132\">Howe (1951), 31–32</ref>

==Business, marriage and family==
During his time in Springfield, Anderson stayed and worked as a \"chore boy\" in a boardinghouse called The Oaks among a group of businessmen, educators, and other creatives types many of whom became friendly with the young Anderson.<ref name=\"Howe3132\"/> In particular, a high school teacher named Trillena White and a businessman Harry Simmons played a role in the author's life. The former who was ten years Anderson's senior would walk—raising eyebrows among the other boarders—with the young man in the evenings. More importantly, according to Anderson, she \"first introduced me to fine literature\"<ref>Anderson (1984), 227–228</ref> and would later serve as inspiration for a number of his characters including the teacher Kate Swift in ''Winesburg, Ohio''.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\">Townsend (1987), 42–43</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 226</ref> The latter, who worked as the advertising manager for Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick (later Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, publishers of the ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'') and occasionally took meals at The Oaks, was so impressed by Anderson's commencement speech that he offered him a job on the spot as an advertising solicitor at his company's Chicago office.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\"/> Thus, in the summer of 1900, Anderson returned to Chicago where most of his siblings were now living, intent on achieving success in his new white-collar occupation.<ref>Rideout (2006), 92–93</ref>

Though he performed well, problems with his boss and a dislike for the office routine and for the style of correspondence, which caused the ultimate rift, caused Anderson to leave Crowell in mid-1901 for a position set up for him by Marco Marrow, another friend from The Oaks, at the Frank B. White Advertising Company (later the Long-Critchfield Agency).<ref>Daugherty (1948), 31</ref> There the author stayed until 1906, selling ads and writing advertising copy for manufacturers of farming implements and articles for the trade journal, ''Agricultural Advertising''.<ref>See Rideout (2006), 95–110 &amp; Anderson (1989) for analysis and the collected early work, respectively</ref> In this latter magazine Anderson published his first professional work, a February 1902 piece called \"The Farmer Wears Clothes.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 95</ref> What followed were approximately 29 articles and essays for his company's magazine, and two for a small literary magazine published by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] called ''The Reader''.<ref>Campbell, Hilbert H (Summer 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/early.html The Early non-Journal Writings]\". ''The Sherwood Anderson Review'' '''23''' (2).</ref> According to scholar Welford Dunaway Taylor, the two monthly columns (\"Rot and Reason\" and \"Business Types\") Anderson wrote for ''Agricultural Advertising'' exemplified the \"character writing\" (or [[character sketch]]es) that would later become a notable part of the author's approach in ''Winesburg, Ohio'' and other works.<ref>Taylor, Welford Dunaway (Winter 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/wd.html Remembered \"Characters\" in ''Winesburg, Ohio'']\". ''The Winesburg Eagle'' '''23''' (1).</ref>

Part of Anderson's job in those early years of his career was making trips to solicit potential clients. On one of these trips around May 1903 he stopped in the home of a friend from Clyde, Jane \"Jennie\" Bemis, then living in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It was there that he met Cornelia Pratt Lane (1877–1967), the daughter of wealthy Ohio businessman Robert Lane. The two were married a year later, on the 16th of May, in [[Lucas, Ohio]].<ref>Ohio,
 County Marriages, 1774-1993</ref> They would go on to have three children—Robert Lane (1907–1951), John Sherwood (1908–1995), and Marion (aka Mimi, 1911–1996).<ref>Rideout (2006), 112–114</ref> After a short honeymoon, the couple moved into an apartment on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side of Chicago]].<ref>A copy of Sherwood Anderson's honeymoon journal is available in the ''[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/98summer.html Sherwood Anderson Review]'' (Summer 1998)</ref> For two additional years, Anderson worked for Long-Critchfield until an opportunity came along from one of the accounts he managed and so on [[Labor Day]] 1906, Sherwood Anderson left Chicago for [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to become president of United Factories Company, a mail-order firm selling various items from surrounding firms.<ref>Rideout (2006), 122–123</ref>

While his new job, which amounted to the position of sales manager, could be stressful<ref name=\":0\">Townsend (1987), 59–60</ref> the happy home life Cornelia had fostered in Chicago continued in Cleveland; \"his wife and he entertained frequently. They went to church on Sundays, with Anderson decked out in morning clothes and top hat. On occasional Sunday afternoons Cornelia taught him French. She also helped with his advertising work.\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 45</ref> Unfortunately, his home life could not sustain him when one of the manufacturers United Factories marketed produced a large batch of defective [[Incubators (egg)|incubators]]. Soon, letters addressed to Anderson (who personally guaranteed all products sold) began to arrive from customers both desperate and angry. The strain from months of answering hundreds of these letters while continuing his demanding schedule at work and home led to a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1907 and eventually his departure from the company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 126–128</ref>

His failure in Cleveland did not delay him for long, however, because in September 1907, the Andersons moved to Elyria, Ohio, a town of approximately ten thousand residents, where he rented a warehouse within sight of the railroad and began a mail-order business selling (at a markup of 500%) a preservative paint called \"Roof-Fix.\"<ref>Daugherty (1948), 33</ref> The first years in Elyria went very well for Anderson and his family; two more children were added for a total of three in addition to a busy social life for their parents.<ref>Howe (1951), 41–42</ref> So well, in fact, did the Anderson Manufacturing Co. do that Anderson was able to purchase and absorb several similar businesses and expand his firm's product-lines under the name Anderson Paint Company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 134</ref> Carrying on that momentum, in late 1911 Anderson secured the financial backing to merge his companies into the American Merchants Company, a profit-sharing/investment firm operating in part on a scheme he developed around that time called \"Commercial Democracy.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 137–138</ref><ref>Sutton (1967), 9–12</ref>

==Nervous breakdown==
It was then, at what seemed the pinnacle of his business achievements, when the stresses of Anderson's professional life collided with his social responsibilities and his writing, that Anderson suffered the breakdown that has remained paramount in the \"myth\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 55</ref> or \"legend\"<ref name=\"Howe49\">Howe (1951), 49</ref><ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\">White (1972), xii–xiv</ref> of Sherwood Anderson's life.<ref>Rideout (2006), 149–155</ref>

On Thursday, November 28, 1912, Anderson came to his office in a slightly nervous state. According to his secretary, he opened some mail, and in the course of dictating a business letter became distracted. After writing a note to his wife, he murmured something along the lines of \"I feel as though my feet were wet, and they keep getting wetter.\"<ref group=\"note\">The quote above comes from the Frances Shute, Anderson's secretary at the time, as cited in Rideout (2006), 155. In Anderson (1924), it was remembered as \"I have been wading in a long river and my feet are wet. My feet are cold, wet and heavy from long wading in a river. Now I shall go walk on dry land,\" whereas in Anderson (1942), it was \"My feet are cold and wet. I have been walking too long on the bed of a river.\"</ref> and left the office. Four days later, on Sunday December 1, a disoriented Anderson entered a drug store on East 152nd Street in Cleveland and asked the pharmacist to help figure out his identity. Unable to make out what the incoherent Anderson was saying, the pharmacist discovered a phone book on his person and called the number of Edwin Baxter, a member of the Elyria Chamber of Commerce. Baxter came, recognized Anderson, and promptly had him checked into the Huron Road Hospital in downtown Cleveland, where Anderson's wife, who he would hardly recognize, went to meet him.<ref>Most Anderson's biographers agree on the events included here. For a general sense, see Rideout (2006), 155–156; Schevill (1951), 52–59; Townsend (1987), 76–82.</ref>

But even before returning home, Anderson began his lifelong practice of reinterpreting the story of his breakdown. Despite news reports in the ''Elyria Evening Telegram'' and the ''Cleveland Press'' following his admittance into the hospital that ascribed the cause of the breakdown to \"overwork\" and that mentioned Anderson's inability to remember what happened,<ref>See issues of December 2nd and 3rd for the former and December 3rd for the latter</ref> on December 6 the story changed. All of a sudden, the breakdown became voluntary. The ''Evening Telegram'' reported (possibly spuriously)<ref>Sutton (1967), 43–44</ref> that \"As soon as he recovers from the trance into which he placed himself, Sherwood Anderson ... will write a book of the sensations he experienced while he wandered over the country as a nomad.\"<ref>''Elyria Evening Telegram''(06 December 1912) as quoted in Schevill (1951), 59</ref> This same sense of personal agency is alluded to thirty years later in ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs'' (1942) where the author wrote of his thought process before walking out: \"I wanted to leave, get away from business. ... Again I resorted to slickness, to craftiness...The thought occurred to me that if men thought me a little insane they would forgive me if I lit out....\"<ref>Anderson (1942), 194</ref> This idea, however, that Anderson made a conscious decision on November 28 to make a clean break from family and business is unlikely.<ref name=\"Howe49\"/><ref>Sutton (1967), 12</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 157</ref> In the first place, contrary to what Anderson later claimed, his writing was no secret. It was known to his wife, secretary, and some business associates that for several years Anderson had been working on personal writing projects both at night and occasionally in his office at the factory.<ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\"/> Secondly, although some of the notes he wrote were to himself during his journey, notes he mailed to his wife on Saturday, addressing the envelope \"Cornelia L. Anderson, Pres., American Striving Co.,\" show that he had some semblance of memory. The general confusion and frequent incoherence the notes exhibit is unlikely to be deliberate.<ref>Sutton (1967), 36–39 offers the complete text of the notes with analysis, and several other biographers including Townsend (1987) and Rideout (2006) analyze and print selections.</ref> While diagnoses for the four days of Anderson's wanderings have ranged from \"[[amnesia]]\" to \"lost identity\" to \"[[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]],\" his condition is generally characterized today as a \"[[fugue state]].\"<ref>Townsend (1987), 81</ref><ref>Sperber, Michael (05 June 2013). \"[Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Fugue) and a Literary Masterpiece http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychogenic-fugue-literature]\" ''Psychiatric Times''. Accessed 11 November 2013.</ref><ref>Ridout (2006), 156–157</ref> Anderson himself described the episode as \"escaping from his materialistic existence,\"{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and was admired for his action by many young male writers who chose to be inspired by him. Herbert Gold wrote, \"He fled in order to find himself, then prayed to flee that disease of self, to become 'beautiful and clear.'\"<ref name=\"nona\">Balakian, Nona (10 July 1988). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/10/books/a-life-of-dark-laughter.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm A Life of Dark Laughter]\". ''NY Times''. Accessed 31 May 2013.</ref><ref>Gold (1957–1958), 548</ref>

After having moved back to Chicago, Anderson formally divorced Cornelia. Later, he married his mistress, the sculptor [[Tennessee Claflin Mitchell]] (1874–1929).<ref>Bassett (2005), p. 21</ref> Anderson divorced Mitchell in 1924 in [[Reno, Nevada]], and soon the same year married his third wife, Elizabeth Prall, a woman he was already involved with before the divorce.<ref>Anderson, Elizabeth and Gerald R. Kelly (1969). ''Miss Elizabeth''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.</ref>

==Novelist==
Anderson's first novel, ''[[Windy McPherson's Son]]'', was published in 1916 as part of a three-book deal with [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]]. This book, along with his second novel, ''[[Marching Men]]'' (1917), are usually considered his \"apprentice novels\" because they came before Anderson found fame with ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919) and are generally considered inferior in quality to works that followed.<ref>Howe (1951), 91</ref>

Anderson's most notable work is his collection of interrelated short stories, ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919). In his memoir, he wrote that \"Hands\", the opening story, was the first \"real\" story he ever wrote.<ref>Anderson, Sherwood. ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1942.</ref>
<blockquote>\"Instead of emphasizing plot and action, Anderson used a simple, precise, unsentimental style to reveal the frustration, loneliness, and longing in the lives of his characters. These characters are stunted by the narrowness of Midwestern small-town life and by their own limitations.\"<ref name=\"fogel\"/></blockquote>In addition, Anderson was one of the first American novelists to introduce new insights from psychology, including [[Freudian analysis]].<ref name=\"fogel\">[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/anderson.html Daniel Mark Fogel,\"Sherwood Anderson\"], ''The American Novel,'' PBS, 2007, accessed 2 June 2013</ref>

Although his short stories were very successful, Anderson wanted to write novels, which he felt allowed a larger scale. In 1920, he published ''[[Poor White (novel)|Poor White]]'', which was rather successful. In 1923, Anderson published ''[[Many Marriages]]''; in it he explored the new sexual freedom, a theme which he continued in ''Dark Laughter'' and later writing.<ref name=\"nona\"/> ''Dark Laughter'' had its detractors, but the reviews were, on the whole, positive. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] considered ''Many Marriages'' to be Anderson's finest novel.<ref>Howe, Irving. ''Sherwood Anderson''. New York: William Sloane Associates, 1951. (pg. 254)</ref>

Beginning in 1924, Sherwood and Elizabeth Prall Anderson moved to [[New Orleans]], where they lived in the historic Pontalba Apartments (540-B St. Peter Street) adjoining [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] in the heart of the [[French Quarter]]. For a time, they entertained [[William Faulkner]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and other writers, for whom Anderson was a major influence. Critics trying to define Anderson's significance have said he was more influential through this younger generation than through his own works.<ref name=\"fogel\"/>

Anderson referred to meeting Faulkner in his ambiguous and moving short story, \"A Meeting South.\" His novel ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925) drew from his New Orleans experiences and continued to explore the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Although the book was satirized by [[Ernest Hemingway]] in his novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'', it was a bestseller at the time, the only book of Anderson's to reach that status during his lifetime.

==Four marriages==
Anderson and Cornelia Lane married in 1904 and divorced in 1916 after having his only 3 children. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Editors |title=Sherwood Anderson's Biography |url=http://umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/anderson/biography.htm |website=umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=9 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>.  

Anderson quickly married Tennessee Claflin Mitchell in 1916 and obtained a divorce [[Reno, Nevada]] in 1924.

That year Anderson married Elizabeth Norma Prall (1884–1976), a friend of Faulkner's whom he had met in New York. After several years that marriage also failed. In 1928 Anderson became involved with [[Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver]] (1896–1985).

In 1933, Anderson and Copenhaver married.<ref>Anderson (1991), pp. 8–9</ref> They traveled and often studied together. They were both active in the [[trade union]] movement.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/G-0005/excerpts/excerpt_2841.html ''Documenting the American South:'' Oral Histories of the American South], University of North Carolina</ref> Anderson also became close to Copenhaver's mother, [[Laura Copenhaver|Laura]].<ref name=\"virginia.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2007/copenhaver.htm|title=Virginia Women in History 2007: Laura Lu Scherer Copenhaver|publisher=}}</ref>

==Later work==
Anderson frequently contributed articles to newspapers. In 1935, he was commissioned to go to [[Franklin County, Virginia]] to cover a major federal trial of bootleggers and gangsters, in what was called \"The Great [[Moonshine]] Conspiracy\". More than 30 men had been indicted for trial. In his article, he said Franklin was the \"wettest county in the world,\" a phrase used as a title for a 21st-century novel by [[Matt Bondurant]].<ref name =LJ>{{cite journal| last = Fisher| first = Ann H.| title = The Wettest Country in the World [Review]| journal = Library Journal| date = 7/1/2008| volume = 133| issue = 12| page = 58}}</ref>

In the 1930s, Anderson published ''[[Death in the Woods]]'' ([[Short story|short stories]]), ''Puzzled America'' (essays), and ''Kit Brandon: A Portrait'' (novel). In 1932, Anderson dedicated his novel ''Beyond Desire'' to Copenhaver. Although by this time he was considered to be less influential overall in American literature, some of what have become his most quoted passages were published in these later works. The books were otherwise considered inferior to his earlier ones.

''Beyond Desire'' built on his interest in the trade union movement and was set during the 1929 [[Loray Mill Strike]] in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Hemingway referred to it satirically in his novel, ''[[To Have and Have Not]]'' (1937), where he included as a minor character an author working on a novel of Gastonia.

In his later years, Anderson and Copenhaver lived on his [[Ripshin Farm]] in [[Troutdale, Virginia]], which he purchased in 1927 for use during summers.<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|title=Ripshin Farm|accessdate=2008-04-16|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606154607/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While living there, he contributed to a country newspaper, columns that were collected and published posthumously.<ref>''Return to Winesburg: Selections from Four Years of Writing for a Country Newspaper'', edited by Ray Lewis White (1967)</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Sherwood Anderson's grave marker.jpg|thumb|Anderson's grave marker at Round Hill Cemetery in Marion, Virginia. Designed by Wharton Esherick and executed in black granite by Victor Riu.]]Anderson died on March 8, 1941, at the age of 64, taken ill during a [[cruising (maritime)|cruise]] to South America. He had been feeling abdominal discomfort for a few days, which was later diagnosed as [[peritonitis]]. Anderson and his wife disembarked from the cruise liner ''Santa Lucia'' and went to the hospital in [[Colón, Panama]], where he died on March 8.<ref>\"Anderson Is Dead; Noted Author; 64\".

Anderson's body was returned to the United States, where he was buried at Round Hill Cemetery in [[Marion, Virginia]]. His epitaph reads, \"Life, Not Death, Is the Great Adventure\".<ref>\"Sherwood Anderson\". [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29 findagrave.com]. Accessed April 22, 2012.</ref>

Wheeler Dealers is a British television series originally produced by Attaboy TV for the [[Discovery Channel]] in the UK and [[Motor Trend]] in the U.S. The programme is fronted by car enthusiast [[Mike Brewer]].[[Edd China]] served as the programmes mechanic for series 1 to 13; he was replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.

The programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood the founding directors of Attaboy TV both long-time car enthusiasts.

There have so far been 15 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the [[Wideboys]]. The previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in autumn of 2009 on [[Discovery Real Time]].Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers On the Road in this series Brewer and China expanded their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. Beginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the [[United States]]. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.

In April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell, but not repair or restore, used cars in different countries on a set budget. He begins with $3,000 and trades his way through the series up to a [[Porsche 911]]. It was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second series where Brewer ends up buying a Ferrari.

== Format ==
In each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was £1,000, for series 2, £2,000, and for series 3, £3,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a £10,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari Dino 308 GT4]] in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to £20,000\".

The presentation for each project usually follows a similar [[TV format]]. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.

=== Summary ===
The programme was created with a [[Do-it-yourself|DIYer]] in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the [[Wage|labour costs]] of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.

Also addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory [[MOT test]].

=== Part one ===
* Brewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.
* Brewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.
* Brewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).
** (Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7)
* Brewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.
* The mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.
* Brewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.

=== Part two ===
* A quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).
* Brewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.
* Brewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving.
** (This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards.)
* The mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.
* Brewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.
* There is a final tally of expenditures.
* Brewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.
** (Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)
* Brewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling). The deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.
* Brewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.
** (Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are shown.)

== Cast ==
[[Mike Brewer (television presenter)|Mike Brewer]] uses his skills as a former car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit. He's also responsible for procuring replacement parts and sometimes specialists to refurbish expensive parts.

[[Edd China]] as the show's mechanic from series 1 to 13, doing much of the restoration and mechanical/servicing work, and giving viewers tips on how to sort out and solve various car problems, as well as estimating how much a garage would charge for such repairs. On 21 March 2017, Velocity announced that China had left the show \"to pursue other projects\" and that he would be replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. He explained that he chose to leave because he was disagreeing with the channel, which wanted to cut down his fixes in the workshop. As, since series 13 the programme is produced by [[Discovery Studios]] (instead of Attaboy TV for the 12 previous seasons for Velocity (now [[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]]), [[Discovery Communications]] has strengthened its control on ''Wheeler Dealers'' and according to China,<ref name=\"WantEdd\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IB15T1LYiY&list=PL1kPAxOddPS_4DNLIkRg5HT51KiFN_m8r/|title=Edd China on leaving Wheeler Dealers|date=21 March 2017|access-date=8 October 2017|website=youtube.com}}</ref> it would seem it found its production too expensive.

Paul Brackley, the series' technical advisor, made sporadic appearances to assist China in carrying heavy parts or equipment in the garage, when China needed additional assistance (such as when China was bleeding brake/clutch fluid or checking an exhaust while a vehicle was running), and helping Brewer tow non-running or non-MOT-compliant vehicles to the shop.

=== Guest appearances on other shows ===
While buying more American cars for the show, Brewer dropped in on [[Chip Foose]] during the 2 June 2013 episode of ''[[Overhaulin']]'', where Foose showed Brewer the 1972 [[Lotus Europa]] he was customising.

== Other vehicles ==
Brewer has used a variety of vehicles on ''Wheeler Dealers'' to travel to see prospective vehicles and/or tow them if they are not in running order or street legal.

Brewer has used a [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006–present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] to travel around England since series 9 (2012). Vehicles used prior to series 9 include a dark turquoise [[Nissan Primera#P12 (2002–2008)|Nissan Primera Estate]], a blue [[Subaru Legacy (fourth generation)|Subaru Legacy Estate]], a red [[Honda Accord (Japan and Europe seventh generation)|Honda Accord Tourer]], a black [[SsangYong Rexton#Second generation (2006–present)|SsangYong Rexton II]], a dark blue [[SsangYong Kyron]], a black [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 4 / LR4|Land Rover Discovery 4]], a blue [[Nissan X-Trail]] and a light blue [[Ford Kuga]]. For Series 8a, he used a black X-Trail. For Series 12b, he used a white [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter#Second generation|Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] to transport the [[Messerschmitt KR200]] back to the workshop.

When Brewer travelled to [[France]] in series 5 to purchase a Citroën DS, he rented a French-registered black [[Opel Zafira]]; he rented a [[Opel Zafira#Zafira B|newer version of the Zafira]] when he returned to France to buy the Renault Alpine A310 in series 9a. Brewer used a French-registered silver [[Toyota Corolla Verso#Third generation (2004-2009)|Toyota Corolla Verso]] when he returned to buy the Citroën 2CV in series 11a. When he returned to France in series 12b, he rented a French-registered grey [[Audi Q3]] to purchase the Citroën HY.

=== ''Trading Up'' ===
For ''Trading Up'', Brewer drove a white [[Toyota Fortuner]] owned by a used car dealer in India. In Dubai, Brewer's contact drove him around in a white [[Ferrari F430]]. In Texas, Brewer used a grey [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]]. Taxicabs featured in the series included a yellow Hindustan Ambassador Grand and a green and yellow [[Bajaj Auto|Bajaj]] RE in India, a black LTC TX4 in the UK, a black [[Toyota Crown Comfort]] in Japan, a yellow and red Volkswagen Sedan Type 1 in Mexico, a white [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] in Australia, a white Chevrolet Onix Sedan in Brazil, a yellow [[Dodge Charger]] in Texas, and a yellow [[Fiat 600 Multipla]] in Italy. For Hire Cars, he rented a Black [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006–present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] in the UK, a black [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] in Brazil, a dark red [[GMC Yukon]] in Texas, a grey [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 3 / LR3|Land Rover Discovery 3]] in Poland, and a white [[Fiat 500 (2007)|Fiat 500]] in Italy. In Poland, when Brewer is taking the Fiat 126p to get vinyl wrapped, he borrowed a grey [[Opel Movano]], to carry the car to the vinyl wrapping shop.

For the ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' US specials, Brewer stood in China's shop, in front of a red [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]].

=== Intro/segment vehicles ===
The opening sequences and filler segments from series 1 to 9 featured the cars that were worked on throughout their corresponding seasons:

*Series 1: All the vehicles done so far
*Series 2 and 3: MGB GT
*Series 4: Porsche 911 2.7S Targa
*Series 5: Mercedes-Benz R107 280SL
*Series 6: Ferrari Dino 308 GT4
*Series 7: Lotus Elan S3
*Series 8a: Jaguar E-Type Series 3
*Series 8b: Dodge Charger
*Series 9a: Fiat Dino
*Series 9b: Gardner Douglas Cobra

Series 10 did away with using cars on the opening and commercial break sequences, instead using a title card with the series logo and the colour(s) of the episode's car on the background. The filler segments, however, used the following cars:

*Series 10a: Aston Martin DB7
*Series 10b: Lamborghini Urraco P250S

Starting with series 11, ''Wheeler Dealers'' no longer uses cars on the filler segments.

==International productions==
The popularity of the original UK series led to a French-language spinoff titled '''''Wheeler Dealers France''''', which premiered on 10 October 2016 on [[RMC Découverte]]. The series is presented by Gerry Blyenberg and Aurélien Letheux. Brewer made a special guest appearance on season 2 episode 1 of the series.

Wheeler Dealers is a British television series originally produced by Attaboy TV for the [[Discovery Channel]] in the UK and [[Motor Trend]] in the U.S. The programme is fronted by car enthusiast [[Mike Brewer]].[[Edd China]] served as the programmes mechanic for series 1 to 13; he was replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.

The programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood the founding directors of Attaboy TV both long-time car enthusiasts.

There have so far been 15 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the [[Wideboys]]. The previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in autumn of 2009 on [[Discovery Real Time]].Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers On the Road in this series Brewer and China expanded their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. Beginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the [[United States]]. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.

In April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell, but not repair or restore, used cars in different countries on a set budget. He begins with $3,000 and trades his way through the series up to a [[Porsche 911]]. It was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second series where Brewer ends up buying a Ferrari.

== Format ==
In each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it on. For the first series, the budget was £1,000, for series 2, £2,000, and for series 3, £3,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a £10,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a [[Ferrari GT4|Ferrari Dino 308 GT4]] in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to £20,000\".

The presentation for each project usually follows a similar [[TV format]]. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.

=== Summary ===
The programme was created with a [[Do-it-yourself|DIYer]] in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the [[Wage|labour costs]] of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.

Also addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory [[MOT test]].

=== Part one ===
* Brewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.
* Brewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.
* Brewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).
** (Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7)
* Brewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.
* The mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.
* Brewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.

=== Part two ===
* A quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).
* Brewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.
* Brewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving.
** (This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards.)
* The mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.
* Brewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.
* There is a final tally of expenditures.
* Brewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.
** (Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)
* Brewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling). The deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.
* Brewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.
** (Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are shown.)

== Cast ==
[[Mike Brewer (television presenter)|Mike Brewer]] uses his skills as a former car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit. He's also responsible for procuring replacement parts and sometimes specialists to refurbish expensive parts.

[[Edd China]] as the show's mechanic from series 1 to 13, doing much of the restoration and mechanical/servicing work, and giving viewers tips on how to sort out and solve various car problems, as well as estimating how much a garage would charge for such repairs. On 21 March 2017, Velocity announced that China had left the show \"to pursue other projects\" and that he would be replaced by [[Ant Anstead]] in series 14. He explained that he chose to leave because he was disagreeing with the channel, which wanted to cut down his fixes in the workshop. As, since series 13 the programme is produced by [[Discovery Studios]] (instead of Attaboy TV for the 12 previous seasons for Velocity (now [[Motor Trend (TV network)|Motor Trend Network]]), [[Discovery Communications]] has strengthened its control on ''Wheeler Dealers'' and according to China,<ref name=\"WantEdd\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IB15T1LYiY&list=PL1kPAxOddPS_4DNLIkRg5HT51KiFN_m8r/|title=Edd China on leaving Wheeler Dealers|date=21 March 2017|access-date=8 October 2017|website=youtube.com}}</ref> it would seem it found its production too expensive.

Paul Brackley, the series' technical advisor, made sporadic appearances to assist China in carrying heavy parts or equipment in the garage, when China needed additional assistance (such as when China was bleeding brake/clutch fluid or checking an exhaust while a vehicle was running), and helping Brewer tow non-running or non-MOT-compliant vehicles to the shop.

=== Guest appearances on other shows ===
While buying more American cars for the show, Brewer dropped in on [[Chip Foose]] during the 2 June 2013 episode of ''[[Overhaulin']]'', where Foose showed Brewer the 1972 [[Lotus Europa]] he was customising.

== Other vehicles ==
Brewer has used a variety of vehicles on ''Wheeler Dealers'' to travel to see prospective vehicles and/or tow them if they are not in running order or street legal.

Brewer has used a [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006–present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] to travel around England since series 9 (2012). Vehicles used prior to series 9 include a dark turquoise [[Nissan Primera#P12 (2002–2008)|Nissan Primera Estate]], a blue [[Subaru Legacy (fourth generation)|Subaru Legacy Estate]], a red [[Honda Accord (Japan and Europe seventh generation)|Honda Accord Tourer]], a black [[SsangYong Rexton#Second generation (2006–present)|SsangYong Rexton II]], a dark blue [[SsangYong Kyron]], a black [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 4 / LR4|Land Rover Discovery 4]], a blue [[Nissan X-Trail]] and a light blue [[Ford Kuga]]. For Series 8a, he used a black X-Trail. For Series 12b, he used a white [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter#Second generation|Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] to transport the [[Messerschmitt KR200]] back to the workshop.

When Brewer travelled to [[France]] in series 5 to purchase a Citroën DS, he rented a French-registered black [[Opel Zafira]]; he rented a [[Opel Zafira#Zafira B|newer version of the Zafira]] when he returned to France to buy the Renault Alpine A310 in series 9a. Brewer used a French-registered silver [[Toyota Corolla Verso#Third generation (2004-2009)|Toyota Corolla Verso]] when he returned to buy the Citroën 2CV in series 11a. When he returned to France in series 12b, he rented a French-registered grey [[Audi Q3]] to purchase the Citroën HY.

=== ''Trading Up'' ===
For ''Trading Up'', Brewer drove a white [[Toyota Fortuner]] owned by a used car dealer in India. In Dubai, Brewer's contact drove him around in a white [[Ferrari F430]]. In Texas, Brewer used a grey [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]]. Taxicabs featured in the series included a yellow Hindustan Ambassador Grand and a green and yellow [[Bajaj Auto|Bajaj]] RE in India, a black LTC TX4 in the UK, a black [[Toyota Crown Comfort]] in Japan, a yellow and red Volkswagen Sedan Type 1 in Mexico, a white [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] in Australia, a white Chevrolet Onix Sedan in Brazil, a yellow [[Dodge Charger]] in Texas, and a yellow [[Fiat 600 Multipla]] in Italy. For Hire Cars, he rented a Black [[Mitsubishi Pajero#Fourth generation (2006–present)|Mitsubishi Shogun]] in the UK, a black [[Chrysler Grand Voyager]] in Brazil, a dark red [[GMC Yukon]] in Texas, a grey [[Land Rover Discovery#Discovery 3 / LR3|Land Rover Discovery 3]] in Poland, and a white [[Fiat 500 (2007)|Fiat 500]] in Italy. In Poland, when Brewer is taking the Fiat 126p to get vinyl wrapped, he borrowed a grey [[Opel Movano]], to carry the car to the vinyl wrapping shop.

For the ''Wheeler Dealers: Top 5'' US specials, Brewer stood in China's shop, in front of a red [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|C2 Corvette]].

=== Intro/segment vehicles ===
The opening sequences and filler segments from series 1 to 9 featured the cars that were worked on throughout their corresponding seasons:

*Series 1: All the vehicles done so far
*Series 2 and 3: MGB GT
*Series 4: Porsche 911 2.7S Targa
*Series 5: Mercedes-Benz R107 280SL
*Series 6: Ferrari Dino 308 GT4
*Series 7: Lotus Elan S3
*Series 8a: Jaguar E-Type Series 3
*Series 8b: Dodge Charger
*Series 9a: Fiat Dino
*Series 9b: Gardner Douglas Cobra

Series 10 did away with using cars on the opening and commercial break sequences, instead using a title card with the series logo and the colour(s) of the episode's car on the background. The filler segments, however, used the following cars:

*Series 10a: Aston Martin DB7
*Series 10b: Lamborghini Urraco P250S

Starting with series 11, ''Wheeler Dealers'' no longer uses cars on the filler segments.

==International productions==
The popularity of the original UK series led to a French-language spinoff titled '''''Wheeler Dealers France''''', which premiered on 10 October 2016 on [[RMC Découverte]]. The series is presented by Gerry Blyenberg and Aurélien Letheux. Brewer made a special guest appearance on season 2 episode 1 of the series.

The '''flag of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|Флаг России}}) is a [[tricolor (flag)|tricolour]] [[flag]] consisting of three equal horizontal fields: [[white]] on the top, [[blue]] in the middle, and [[red]] on the bottom. The flag was first used as an ensign for Russian merchant ships and became official as the flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1696. It remained in use until 1858, when the first official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] was decreed by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], which was a tricolor consisting of three horizontal fields: [[black]] on the top, [[yellow]] in the middle, and [[white]] on the bottom. A decree in 1896 made the original white, blue, and red tricolor the official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] until its eventual capitulation in 1917. Following the creation of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], the Russian tricolor was abolished, and its usage was preserved by the [[White Movement]] and the [[Russian state]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].

During the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence, the Russian SFSR (a constituent republic of the USSR), used a defaced variant of the State [[Flag of the Soviet Union]] with a vertical blue bar at the hoist, with a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and a golden bordered [[red star]] on top. Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on November 1st, 1991, the Russian SFSR adopted a new flag design that looked almost identical to the pre-revolutionary tricolour that was previously abolished in 1917. The ratio of the new flag was 1:2, and the flag colors consisted of [[white]] on the top, [[azure (color)|azure]] in the middle, and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] on the bottom. The Russian SFSR officially renamed itself as the \"Russian Federation\" after the dissolution of the USSR, and the flag design remained the same until 1993, when the original Russian tricolour was fully restored as the current flag after the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]].

== Origin ==
Two accounts of the flag's origin connect it to the [[Tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] used by the [[Dutch Republic]] (the [[flag of the Netherlands]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt450XgGd1kC|title=The Flags of the World: Their History, Blazonry and Associations|last=Hulme|first=Frederick Edward|date=1 January 1897|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465543110|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWdOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA228|title=Foreign Correspondent: A Memoir|last=Greenway|first=H. D. S.|date=2014|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-6132-9|page=228|language=en|via=}}</ref>

The earliest mention of the flag occurs during the reign of [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexis I]], in 1668, and is related to the construction of the first Russian naval ship, the [[Russian frigate Oryol|frigate Oryol]]. According to one source, the ship's Dutch lead engineer Butler faced the need for the flag, and issued a request to the [[Duma#In early Russian history|Boyar Duma]], to \"ask His Royal Majesty as to which (as is the custom among other nations) flag shall be raised on the ship\". The official response merely indicated that, as such issue is as yet unprecedented, even though the land forces do use (apparently different) flags, the tsar ordered that his (Butler's) opinion be sought about the matter, asking specifically as to the custom existing in his country.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=scHXHTkRmZcC&pg=PA21&dq=european+flag&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=hek3U5mTDcu7ygOF54D4Dg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dutch&f=false Flag T.H. Eriksen & R. Jenkins, Nation and Symbolism in Europe and America. Abingdon, 2007, p. 23]</ref>

A different account traces the origins of the Russian flag to tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great's]] visits to [[Arkhangelsk]] in 1693 and 1694. Peter was keenly interested in shipbuilding in the European style, different from the barges ordinarily used in Russia at the time. In 1693, Peter had ordered a Dutch-built frigate from [[Amsterdam]]. In 1694 when it arrived, the Dutch red-white-and-blue banner flew from its [[stern]].<ref>Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great, 160 (Modern Library Edition 2012)</ref> Peter decided to model Russia's naval flag after this banner by changing the sequence of colors.

A study on clarifying the [[national colours]] of [[Russia]] based on disquisition on documents of the Moscow Archive of [[Ministry of Justice of the Russian Empire]] was summarized by [[Dmitry Samokvasov]], a [[Russians|Russian]] archaeologist and legal historian, in an [[Edition (book)|edition]] of 16 pages called \"On the Question of National Colours of Ancient Russia\" published in [[Moscow]] in 1910.<ref>''[[Dmitry Samokvasov|Самоквасов Д.

===Flags of the Tsardom of Russia & the Russian Empire===
[[File:Znamya_Ivana_IV.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Banner of the \"Most Gracious Savior\" under Ivan the Terrible]]
In 1552, Russian regiments marched on the victorious assault of Kazan under [[Ivan the Terrible]] with the banner of the \"Most Gracious Savior\". For the next century and a half, the banner of [[Ivan the Terrible]] accompanied the Russian army. Under [[Sophia Alekseyevna of Russia|Tsarina Sophia Alekseevna]], it visited the Crimean campaigns, and under Peter the Great, the [[Azov campaigns (1695–96)|Azov campaigns]] and the [[Russo-Swedish War]].

In the [[Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible]], there is an image of the banner of Ivan the Terrible in the Kazan campaign – a bifurcated white one with the image of the Savior and an eight-pointed cross above it. According to other sources, the banner was red instead of white. A copy of this banner, which has been restored many times, is still kept in the [[Kremlin Armoury]].

In 1612, the [[Nizhny Novgorod]] militia raised the banner of Dmitry Pozharsky, it was crimson in color with the image of the Lord Almighty on one side and the archangel Michael on the other.

[[File:Гербовое знамя 1696.png|thumb|left|260px|The armorial flag of Peter the Great, 1696]]
In 1669, the Polish painters Stanislav Loputsky and Ivan Mirovsky invited by Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]], painted for the tsar's palace in Kolomenskoye \"the hallmarks (that is, the emblems) of the sovereigns and all the universal states of this world.\" Then Loputsky drew \"on the canvas, the coat of arms of the Moscow State and the arms of other neighboring countries, under every emblem of the planet under which they are.\" The coat of arms was a white rectangular banner with a \"slope\" and a wide red border, in the center of which was depicted a gold two-headed eagle and the emblems symbolizing the subject kingdoms, principalities and lands. In the inventory of the Kremlin Armoury, the coat of arms is described as the following: \"In the circle there is a two-headed eagle wearing two crowns, and in his chest, the king on horseback pricks a serpent with his spear\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://his.1september.ru/article.php?ID=200100204|script-title=ru:Государственная символика|language=russian|accessdate=29 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151346/http://his.1september.ru/article.php?ID=200100204|archivedate=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 6 August 1693, during Peter the Great's sailing in the [[White Sea]] with a detachment of warships built in [[Arkhangelsk]], the so-called \"Flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsar of Muscovy]]\"<ref>Central Naval Museum, St. Petersburg. List of exhibited artefacts. [http://www.museum.ru/C788 Flag of the Tsar of Muscovy].</ref> was raised for the first time on the 12-gun yacht \"Saint Peter\". The flag was a cross-stitch of 4.6x4.9 meters sewn from cloth, composed of three equal-sized horizontal stripes of white, blue and red, with a golden double-headed eagle in the middle.<ref>Белавенец П.

The armorial flag of [[Peter the Great]] was created in 1696. Made from red taffeta with a white border, the flag depicted a golden eagle hovering over the sea. On the chest of the eagle in the circle is the Savior, next to the Holy Spirit and the holy apostles Peter and Paul. The banner was likely made for the second Azov campaign.<ref>{{cite book |author=Н. А. Соболева, В. А.

In 1693, Franz Timmerman received the order to build merchant ships in Arkhangelsk and trade with Europe. He was told to display the two-headed eagle spread with wings, with three crowns over it. On the chest of the eagle, a warrior on horseback was to be displayed with a spear, in a military harness. The same eagle was also to hold a sceptre with the right leg and an apple with a crest with the left. The same instructions were given to other traders.<ref>Елагин С.

According to Dutch newspapers, in June 1694, a 44-gun frigate bought by Russia and built in Rotterdam stood in the Amsterdam roadstead under the white-blue-red flag.<ref>Басов А. Н. История военно-морских флагов. — М.: Аст, СПб.: Полигон, 2004, {{ISBN|5-17-022747-7}}, С.46</ref>

In 1696, at the mouth of the river Don, a Russian flotilla of armed rowboats blocked the supply of the Ottoman fortress of Azov. On the 1700 engraving by Adrian Shkhonebek, '''''Taking the fortress of Azov. 1696''''', depicts the ships carrying rectangular panels on the flagpoles, the heraldic shading of which shows that some of the flags are blue with a straight red cross, and the rest are white with a straight red cross. A number of researchers doubt the accuracy of Shkonebek's engraving because he was not a witness to the events.<ref>Оленин Р. М., Карманов В. В. От первого корабля до первого Устава.

Images of various white-blue-red Russian flags are present in the three later paintings of [[Abraham Storck]]'s workshop dedicated to the arrival in Amsterdam of Peter I. Peter I took part in a practice battle on the river [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] while on board the yacht of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>Uiterst links een jacht met de Russische vlag en tsaar Peter de Grote aan boord, gekleed in het rood (Слева – яхта под флагом России с царём Петром I на борту, одетым в красное).

In October 1699, Peter I, on the back of the sheet with instructions sent to the Russian envoy [[Yemelyan Ukraintsev]] in [[Istanbul]], drew a sketch of a three-band white-blue-red flag.<ref>Устрялов Н.

In December 1699, the Austrian ambassador Anton Paleyer gave a list of weapons and flags seen on the vessels of the [[Azov Flotilla]] in a letter. He described seeing three small flags of white-red-blue colors and two regimental colors of red and white mixed in with other colors.<ref>''Елагин С. И.'' История русского флота. Период Азовский.

In April 1700, Peter I ordered the Kremlin Armoury to build white-red-violet sea banners.<ref>{{cite book| author = Яковлев Л.П. | title = Древности Российскаго государства, изданныя по высочайшему повелению.

The Russian tricolour flag was adopted as a [[merchant flag]] at rivers in 1705. The choice of colors is significant in that they represent in order of priority, white for God, Blue for king, and Red for people and/or country. These colors of the flag of Russia inspired the choice of the \"[[Pan-Slavic colours]]\" by the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848]]. Two other Slavic countries, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official ''National flag'' before the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896.

The flag continued to be used by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] was toppled in the [[February Revolution]] and was not replaced until the [[October Revolution]] which established the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].

[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian SFSR (1954–91)]]

On 8 April 1918, the flag of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] was discussed at a meeting of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic''. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the color, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.

On 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR]] by the graphic artist [[Sergey Chekhonin]]. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription ''RSFSR'' in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.

On 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] to form the [[Soviet Union]]. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with a blue stripe along the mast.

Contrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).<ref>Собрание узаконений и распоряжений правительства РСФСР.&nbsp;— 1925, №&nbsp;20, цит. по: Вексиллологический справочник по флагам Российской Империи и СССР, Т.1/сост.

On 20 January 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR found it necessary to amend the national flags of the allied republics so that the flags reflected the idea of a Soviet Union state as well as the unique national identities of the republics. On each of the flags was placed the emblem of the USSR, a sickle and a hammer with a red five-pointed star, with the inclusion of national ornaments and new colors.<ref>Центральный Государственный архив Киргизской ССР, ф.1445, оп.3, д.29, л.2, цит. по: Вексиллологический справочник по флагам Российской Империи и СССР, Т.1/сост.

By the Law of the RSFSR of 2 June 1954, this flag was approved and the description of the flag was included in Article 149 of the Constitution of the RSFSR<ref>[[s:Закон РСФСР от 2 June 1954 О Государственном флаге РСФСР|Закон РСФСР от 2 июня 1954&nbsp;г. «О Государственном флаге РСФСР»]]</ref>

It was not until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 that the tricolor was brought back as the official flag of the new [[Russian Federation]]. Following the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt|events of the attempted coup in Moscow]], the supreme soviet of the Russian SFSR declared, by resolution dated 22 August 1991,<ref>per [http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102012339 Resolution No. 1627/1-I of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of 22 August 1991]</ref> that the old imperial tricolor flag serve as the national flag of the state.

==Symbolism==

There are varying interpretations as of to what the colors on the Russian flag mean. The most popular is as follows: The white color symbolizes nobility and frankness, the blue for faithfulness, honesty, impeccability and chastity, and red for courage, generosity and love.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111103115513/http://pkc.ru//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=97&Itemid=85 Государственный флаг России.

== Colour specifications ==
Federal constitutional law of the Russian Federation only says that the colours of the flag are \"white\", \"blue\", and \"red\". It does not specify the exact colours of the flag. In practice, however, federal authorities tend to use the following colors:

A variant of the flag was authorized [[Civil flag|for private use]] by Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] before [[World War I]], adding the large state eagle on a yellow field (imperial standard) in a [[canton (flag)|canton]] in the top left-hand corner. It was never made the official state flag.

When the [[Bolshevik]]s took power in 1917, the tricolor design was discarded, and a definitive new flag of the SFSR (one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]]) was introduced in 1954 (see [[flag of Russian SFSR]]), and this remained the republic's flag until the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. All of the Soviet Republics' flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the \"RSFSR\" abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].

The tricolor was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the [[White movement]]. It was continued to be used by [[White émigrés]] in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolor was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. It, as well as the naval ensign of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] was used by anticommunist Russian troops under German command during the [[Second World War]]. Both flags can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, this flag was used in films set in the prerevolutionary period and was seen as an historical flag, especially after the 1940s.

It, rather than the black-yellow-white color combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The [[President of Russia]] uses a Presidential Standard ({{lang-ru|Штандарт Президента}}), which, since 1994, is officially defined as the square tricolor with the coat of arms (in this case the two-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.<ref>per [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/5502 Decree No. 319 of 15 February 1994]</ref>

During the [[Victory Day (9 May)|annual Victory Day]] celebrations in Moscow, a variant of the Soviet flag that was used during the [[raising a flag over the Reichstag]] has the grey hammer and sickle, referred to as the [[Victory Banner]]. Under the presidency of [[Boris Yeltsin]], an earlier version of the Victory Banner was red with just a golden star on the top.

The '''flag of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|Флаг России}}) is a [[tricolor (flag)|tricolour]] [[flag]] consisting of three equal horizontal fields: [[white]] on the top, [[blue]] in the middle, and [[red]] on the bottom. The flag was first used as an ensign for Russian merchant ships and became official as the flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1696. It remained in use until 1858, when the first official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] was decreed by [[ Alexander II]], which was a tricolor consisting of three horizontal fields: [[black]] on the top, [[yellow]] in the middle, and [[white]] on the bottom. A decree in 1896 made the original white, blue, and red tricolor the official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] until its eventual capitulation in 1917. Following the creation of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], the Russian tricolor was abolished, and its usage was preserved by the [[White Movement]] and the [[Russian state]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].

During the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence, the Russian SFSR (a constituent republic of the USSR), used a defaced variant of the State [[Flag of the Soviet Union]] with a vertical blue bar at the hoist, with a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and a golden bordered [[red star]] on top. Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on November 1st, 1991, the Russian SFSR adopted a new flag design that looked almost identical to the pre-revolutionary tricolour that was previously abolished in 1917. The ratio of the new flag was 1:2, and the flag colors consisted of [[white]] on the top, [[azure (color)|azure]] in the middle, and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] on the bottom. The Russian SFSR officially renamed itself as the \"Russian Federation\" after the dissolution of the USSR, and the flag design remained the same until 1993, when the original Russian tricolour was fully restored as the current flag after the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]].

== Origin ==
Two accounts of the flag's origin connect it to the [[Tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] used by the [[Dutch Republic]] (the [[flag of the Netherlands]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt450XgGd1kC|title=The Flags of the World: Their History, Blazonry and Associations|last=Hulme|first=Frederick Edward|date=1 January 1897|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465543110|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWdOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA228|title=Foreign Correspondent: A Memoir|last=Greenway|first=H.

The earliest mention of the flag occurs during the reign of [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexis I]], in 1668, and is related to the construction of the first Russian naval ship, the [[Russian frigate Oryol|frigate Oryol]]. According to one source, the ship's Dutch lead engineer Butler faced the need for the flag, and issued a request to the [[Duma#In early Russian history|Boyar Duma]], to \"ask His Royal Majesty as to which (as is the custom among other nations) flag shall be raised on the ship\". The official response merely indicated that, as such issue is as yet unprecedented, even though the land forces do use (apparently different) flags, the tsar ordered that his (Butler's) opinion be sought about the matter, asking specifically as to the custom existing in his country.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=scHXHTkRmZcC&pg=PA21&dq=european+flag&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=hek3U5mTDcu7ygOF54D4Dg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dutch&f=false Flag T.H. Eriksen & R. Jenkins, Nation and Symbolism in Europe and America. Abingdon, 2007, p. 23]</ref>

A different account traces the origins of the Russian flag to tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great's]] visits to [[Arkhangelsk]] in 1693 and 1694. Peter was keenly interested in shipbuilding in the European style, different from the barges ordinarily used in Russia at the time. In 1693, Peter had ordered a Dutch-built frigate from [[Amsterdam]]. In 1694 when it arrived, the Dutch red-white-and-blue banner flew from its [[stern]].<ref>Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great, 160 (Modern Library Edition 2012)</ref> Peter decided to model Russia's naval flag after this banner by changing the sequence of colors.

A study on clarifying the [[national colours]] of [[Russia]] based on disquisition on documents of the Moscow Archive of [[Ministry of Justice of the Russian Empire]] was summarized by [[Dmitry Samokvasov]], a [[Russians|Russian]] archaeologist and legal historian, in an [[Edition (book)|edition]] of 16 pages called \"On the Question of National Colours of Ancient Russia\" published in [[Moscow]] in 1910.<ref>''[[Dmitry Samokvasov|Самоквасов Д.

[[File:Znamya_Ivana_IV.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Banner of the \"Most Gracious Savior\" under Ivan the Terrible]]
In 1552, Russian regiments marched on the victorious assault of Kazan under [[Ivan the Terrible]] with the banner of the \"Most Gracious Savior\". For the next century and a half, the banner of [[Ivan the Terrible]] accompanied the Russian army. Under [[Sophia Alekseyevna of Russia|Tsarina Sophia Alekseevna]], it visited the Crimean campaigns, and under Peter the Great, the [[Azov campaigns (1695–96)|Azov campaigns]] and the [[Russo-Swedish War]].

In the [[Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible]], there is an image of the banner of Ivan the Terrible in the Kazan campaign – a bifurcated white one with the image of the Savior and an eight-pointed cross above it. According to other sources, the banner was red instead of white. A copy of this banner, which has been restored many times, is still kept in the [[Kremlin Armoury]].

In 1612, the [[Nizhny Novgorod]] militia raised the banner of Dmitry Pozharsky, it was crimson in color with the image of the Lord Almighty on one side and the archangel Michael on the other.

In 1669, the Polish painters Stanislav Loputsky and Ivan Mirovsky invited by Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]], painted for the tsar's palace in Kolomenskoye \"the hallmarks (that is, the emblems) of the sovereigns and all the universal states of this world.\" Then Loputsky drew \"on the canvas, the coat of arms of the Moscow State and the arms of other neighboring countries, under every emblem of the planet under which they are.\" The coat of arms was a white rectangular banner with a \"slope\" and a wide red border, in the center of which was depicted a gold two-headed eagle and the emblems symbolizing the subject kingdoms, principalities and lands. In the inventory of the Kremlin Armoury, the coat of arms is described as the following: \"In the circle there is a two-headed eagle wearing two crowns, and in his chest, the king on horseback pricks a serpent with his spear\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://his.1september.ru/article.php?ID=200100204|script-title=ru:Государственная символика|language=russian|accessdate=29 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151346/http://his.1september.ru/article.php?ID=200100204|archivedate=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The armorial flag of [[Peter the Great]] was created in 1696. Made from red taffeta with a white border, the flag depicted a golden eagle hovering over the sea. On the chest of the eagle in the circle is the Savior, next to the Holy Spirit and the holy apostles Peter and Paul. The banner was likely made for the second Azov campaign.<ref>{{cite book |author=Н. А. Соболева, В. А.

In 1693, Franz Timmerman received the order to build merchant ships in Arkhangelsk and trade with Europe. He was told to display the two-headed eagle spread with wings, with three crowns over it. On the chest of the eagle, a warrior on horseback was to be displayed with a spear, in a military harness. The same eagle was also to hold a sceptre with the right leg and an apple with a crest with the left. The same instructions were given to other traders.<ref>Елагин С.

According to Dutch newspapers, in June 1694, a 44-gun frigate bought by Russia and built in Rotterdam stood in the Amsterdam roadstead under the white-blue-red flag.<ref>Басов А. Н. История военно-морских флагов. — М.: Аст, СПб.: Полигон, 2004, {{ISBN|5-17-022747-7}}, С.46</ref>

In 1696, at the mouth of the river Don, a Russian flotilla of armed rowboats blocked the supply of the Ottoman fortress of Azov. On the 1700 engraving by Adrian Shkhonebek, '''''Taking the fortress of Azov. 1696''''', depicts the ships carrying rectangular panels on the flagpoles, the heraldic shading of which shows that some of the flags are blue with a straight red cross, and the rest are white with a straight red cross. A number of researchers doubt the accuracy of Shkonebek's engraving because he was not a witness to the events.<ref>Оленин Р. М., Карманов В. В. От первого корабля до первого Устава.

Images of various white-blue-red Russian flags are present in the three later paintings of [[Abraham Storck]]'s workshop dedicated to the arrival in Amsterdam of Peter I. Peter I took part in a practice battle on the river [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] while on board the yacht of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>Uiterst links een jacht met de Russische vlag en tsaar Peter de Grote aan boord, gekleed in het rood (Слева – яхта под флагом России с царём Петром I на борту, одетым в красное).

In December 1699, the Austrian ambassador Anton Paleyer gave a list of weapons and flags seen on the vessels of the [[Azov Flotilla]] in a letter.

The Russian tricolour flag was adopted as a [[merchant flag]] at rivers in 1705. The choice of colors is significant in that they represent in order of priority, white for God, Blue for king, and Red for people and/or country. These colors of the flag of Russia inspired the choice of the \"[[Pan-Slavic colours]]\" by the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848]]. Two other Slavic countries, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official ''National flag'' before the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896.

The flag continued to be used by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] was toppled in the [[February Revolution]] and was not replaced until the [[October Revolution]] which established the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].

===Flags of the Russian SFSR===

[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1918–1937).svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (17 June 1918 – 21 January 1937)]]
[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian SFSR (1954–91)]]

On 8 April 1918, the flag of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] was discussed at a meeting of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic''. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the color, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.

On 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR]] by the graphic artist [[Sergey Chekhonin]]. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription ''RSFSR'' in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.

On 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] to form the [[Soviet Union]]. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with a blue stripe along the mast.

Contrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).<ref>Собрание узаконений и распоряжений правительства РСФСР.&nbsp;— 1925, №&nbsp;20, цит. по: Вексиллологический справочник по флагам Российской Империи и СССР, Т.1/сост.

During the [[Second World War]] the white-blue-red tricolor has been used by the collaborationist [[Anti-communism|anti-Stalinist]] troops of [[Andrey Vlasov]], who was allied with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Lilia Shevtsova: ''Putin's Russia.''

On 20 January 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR found it necessary to amend the national flags of the allied republics so that the flags reflected the idea of a Soviet Union state as well as the unique national identities of the republics. On each of the flags was placed the emblem of the USSR, a sickle and a hammer with a red five-pointed star, with the inclusion of national ornaments and new colors.<ref>Центральный Государственный архив Киргизской ССР, ф.1445, оп.3, д.29, л.2, цит. по: Вексиллологический справочник по флагам Российской Империи и СССР, Т.1/сост.

А.&nbsp;— М.: МГИУ, 2002, {{ISBN|5-276-00240-1}}, СС.399–400</ref> The new RSFSR flag was established in January 1954: a red rectangular panel with a light blue strip near the pole running the full width of the flag. In the upper left corner of the red canvas were depicted a golden sickle and a hammer and above them a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. By the Law of the RSFSR of 2 June 1954, this flag was approved and the description of the flag was included in Article 149 of the Constitution of the RSFSR<ref>[[s:Закон РСФСР от 2 June 1954 О Государственном флаге РСФСР|Закон РСФСР от 2 июня 1954&nbsp;г. «О Государственном флаге РСФСР»]]</ref>

===Flags of the Russian Federation===
[[File:Flag of Russia (1991–1993).svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Former Russian national flag, used from 1991 to 1993]]

It was not until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 that the tricolor was brought back as the official flag of the new [[Russian Federation]]. Following the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt|events of the attempted coup in Moscow]], the supreme soviet of the Russian SFSR declared, by resolution dated 22 August 1991,<ref>per [http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102012339 Resolution No. 1627/1-I of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of 22 August 1991]</ref> that the old imperial tricolor flag serve as the national flag of the state. The constitution was subsequently amended by Law No. 1827-1 1 November 1991.<ref>per [http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102012917 Law No. 1827-1 of the RSFSR of 1 November 1991]</ref> At the disintegration of the USSR on 25 December 1991, the Soviet flag was lowered from Kremlin and then replaced by the tricolor flag. 

The modern era flag underwent a proportion change from 1:2 to 2:3 in 1993 and has been most recently provided for by a 2000 law.<ref>per [http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102027590 Decree No. 2126 of 11 December 1993]</ref> On 11 December 1993, President of the Russian Federation [[Boris Yeltsin]] signed Decree No. 2126 \"On the State Flag of the Russian Federation\".<ref name=\"Указ1993годаОФлагеРФ\">[http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102027590&rdk=0 О Государственном флаге Российской Федерации] : Указ Президента РФ от 11 December 1993 №&nbsp;2126 // Собрание актов Президента и Правительства Российской Федерации. 1993. №&nbsp;51. Ст. 4928.</ref> In Article 1 of the decree, the flag was described as a \"rectangular panel of three equal horizontal stripes: the top – white, middle – blue, and bottom – red, with a width to length ratio of 2:3.\"

The National Flag Day is an official holiday in Russia, established in 1994. It is celebrated on 22 August, the day of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|victory over putschists in 1991]], but employees remain at work.

==Symbolism==

There are varying interpretations as of to what the colors on the Russian flag mean. The most popular is as follows: The white color symbolizes nobility and frankness, the blue for faithfulness, honesty, impeccability and chastity, and red for courage, generosity and love.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111103115513/http://pkc.ru//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=97&Itemid=85 Государственный флаг России. Статья на сайте Политического консультативного центра]</ref>

== Colour specifications ==
Federal constitutional law of the Russian Federation only says that the colours of the flag are \"white\", \"blue\", and \"red\". It does not specify the exact colours of the flag. In practice, however, federal authorities tend to use the following colors:

A variant of the flag was authorized [[Civil flag|for private use]] by Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] before [[World War I]], adding the large state eagle on a yellow field (imperial standard) in a [[canton (flag)|canton]] in the top left-hand corner. It was never made the official state flag.

When the [[Bolshevik]]s took power in 1917, the tricolor design was discarded, and a definitive new flag of the SFSR (one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]]) was introduced in 1954 (see [[flag of Russian SFSR]]), and this remained the republic's flag until the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. All of the Soviet Republics' flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the \"RSFSR\" abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].

The tricolor was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the [[White movement]]. It was continued to be used by [[White émigrés]] in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolor was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. It, as well as the naval ensign of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] was used by anticommunist Russian troops under German command during the [[Second World War]]. Both flags can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, this flag was used in films set in the prerevolutionary period and was seen as an historical flag, especially after the 1940s.

It, rather than the black-yellow-white color combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The [[President of Russia]] uses a Presidential Standard ({{lang-ru|Штандарт Президента}}), which, since 1994, is officially defined as the square tricolor with the coat of arms (in this case the two-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.<ref>per [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/5502 Decree No. 319 of 15 February 1994]</ref>

During the [[Victory Day (9 May)|annual Victory Day]] celebrations in Moscow, a variant of the Soviet flag that was used during the [[raising a flag over the Reichstag]] has the grey hammer and sickle, referred to as the [[Victory Banner]]. Under the presidency of [[Boris Yeltsin]], an earlier version of the Victory Banner was red with just a golden star on the top.

The Flag of Russia is represented as the [[Unicode]] [[emoji]] sequence {{unichar|1F1F7|REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER R}} and {{unichar|1F1FA|REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER U}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://emojipedia.org/flag-for-russia/|title=🇷🇺 Flag for Russia Emoji|access-date=2 January 2018|language=en}}</ref>

In 2010, [[Joey Comeau]]'s ''[[Overqualified (short story collection)|Overqualified]]'' was withdrawn, as the writer already published a debut work.  Only two books were shortlisted in 2010 (the fewest in the history of the award).  However, the 2010 judges called the winning work ''Wax Boats'' by Sarah Roberts \"truly remarkable,\" speaking of her versatility and her convincing writing in every conceivable voice, and likening her to Stephen Leacock's ''Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town'' for the modern age.

The '''Danuta Gleed Literary Award''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] national literary prize, awarded since 1998. It recognizes the best debut short fiction collection by a Canadian author in English language.<ref name=\"Official\">{{cite web |url=http://www.writersunion.ca/danuta-gleed#.UALX1JEbi4o |title=Danuta Gleed |publisher=The Writers' Union of Canada |accessdate=15 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930073607/http://www.writersunion.ca/danuta-gleed#.UALX1JEbi4o |archivedate=30 September 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> The annual prize was founded by John Gleed in honour of his late wife, the Canadian writer [[Danuta Gleed]], whose favourite literary genre was short fiction, and is presented by The [[Writers' Union of Canada]]. The incomes of her ''One for the Chosen'', a collection of short stories published posthumously in 1997 by BuschekBooks and released by [[Frances Itani]] and Susan Zettell, assist in funding the award.<ref name=\"Official\"/>

Initially [[C$]]5,000, the prize money increased to C$10,000 in 2004.<ref name=\"First\">{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/news/danuta-gleed-award-2003|title=Danuta Gleed Award 2003|publisher=The Writers' Union of Canada|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> The runners-up each receive C$500.<ref name=\"Official\"/>  The nominations must be submitted before the end of January.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/sites/all/files/attachments/2011_danutagleed_submission_guidelines_and_form.pdf|title=The Danuta Gleed Literary Award|format=PDF|publisher=The Writers' Union of Canada|accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> The year's [[shortlist]] is chosen by a jury.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/05/09/danuta-gleed-literary-award/ |author=Mark Medley |title=Danuta Gleed Literary Award reveals shortlist |newspaper=[[National Post]] |date=9 May 2012 |accessdate=13 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129120807/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/05/09/danuta-gleed-literary-award/ |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> The varying jury is composed of Canadian writers, literary critics and publishers, such as [[Gail Anderson-Dargatz]], Robin McGrath and [[Hal Niedzviecki]] in 2012 or [[Douglas Glover (writer)|Douglas Glover]], [[J.

The first winning work was Curtis Gillespie's ''The Progress of an Object in Motion''.

In 2010, [[Joey Comeau]]'s ''[[Overqualified (short story collection)|Overqualified]]'' was withdrawn, as the writer already published a debut work.  Only two books were shortlisted in 2010 (the fewest in the history of the award).  However, the 2010 judges called the winning work 'Wax Boats' by Sarah Roberts \"truly remarkable,\" speaking of her versatility and her convincing writing in every conceivable voice, and likening her to Stephen Leacock's Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town for the modern age.

[[File:AIR RAID DAMAGE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 1939-1945 - H 9476.jpg|thumb|270px|Rescue workers searching through rubble after an air raid on Belfast]]
The '''Belfast Blitz''' consisted of four German air raids on strategic targets in the city of [[Belfast]] in [[Northern Ireland]], in April and May 1941 during [[World War II]], causing high casualties. The first was on the night of 7{{ndash}}8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on [[Easter Tuesday]], 15 April 1941. Two hundred [[bombers]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on [[London]], this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref name=bbrem>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm|title=The Belfast blitz is remembered|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2001|publisher=BBC News|quote=On 16 April 1941 Belfast was devastated as it bore the worst air raid of any city outside London […] It was one of the largest German strike forces used to date in the war and the ''Luftwaffe'' was heading for a city later described as the most poorly defended in the United Kingdom.}}</ref><ref name=membb>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a7713966.shtml|title=Memories of the Belfast Blitz|accessdate=19 January 2015|author= [[Belfast Central Library]]|work= WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|quote=No city, save London, suffered more loss of life in one night’s raid on the United Kingdom.}}</ref>

The third raid on Belfast took place over the evening and morning of 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941; 150 were killed. Incendiary bombs predominated in this raid. The fourth and final Belfast raid took place on the following night, 5{{ndash}}6 May. In total over 1,300 houses were demolished, some 5,000 badly damaged, nearly 30,000 slightly damaged while 20,000 required \"first aid repairs\".<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' (2015) p. 397.</ref>

==Background==
As the UK was preparing for the conflict, the [[Factory|factories]] and [[shipyard]]s of Belfast were gearing up. Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the ''Luftwaffe''. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK.  Under the leadership of [[Éamon de Valera]], it had declared its [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations: the German Legation in [[Dublin]] remained open throughout the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keogh|first=Dermot|title=Eamon de Valera and Hitler: An Analysis of International Reaction to the Visit to the German Minister, May 1945|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/Article.pdf|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69–92|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

===Government===
The [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig, Lord Craigavon]], had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. [[Richard Dawson Bates]] was the Home Affairs Minister. [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]], the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to Britain in her time of need.<ref name=\"bardon\">{{cite web|title=Extracts from an article, \"The Belfast Blitz, 1941\"|author=Jonathan Bardon|url=http://www.joeoloughlin.co.uk/?p=65|work=BELFAST BLITZ|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>

[[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John Clarke MacDermott]], the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the \"Hiram Plan\" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible.<ref name=Hiram>{{cite web|title=Historical Topics Series 2 The Belfast Blitz |url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/historical_topics_series_-_02_-_the_belfast_blitz.pdf |work=BELFAST BLITZ |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> It was MacDermott who sent a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] to de Valera seeking assistance. There was unease with the complacent attitude of the government, which led to resignations:
* [[Edmond Warnock|John Edmond Warnock]], the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, resigned from the government on 25 May 1940. He said, \"I have heard speeches about Ulster pulling her weight but they have never carried conviction.\" and \"the government has been slack, dilatory and apathetic.\"<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|title=Your Place and Mine – The Belfast Blitz |author=BBC Radio Ulster |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz/context.shtml |work=The Belfast Blitz |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>
* [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Robert Gisborne Gordon|Alexander Gordon]], Parliamentary and Financial Secretary at the Ministry of Finance (i.e. [[Chief Whip]]), resigned on 13 June 1940,<ref>http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html</ref> explaining to the Commons that the government was \"quite unfitted to sustain the people in the ordeal we have to face.\"

Craigavon died on 24 November 1940. He was succeeded by [[John Miller Andrews]], then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He was replaced by 54-year-old [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]] on 1 May.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/02/archives/northern-ireland-gets-new-premier-sir-basil-brooke-54-named-to.html |title=NORTHERN IRELAND GETS NEW PREMIER |accessdate=23 January 2015|date=2 May 1943|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=resigned after criticism from his own Unionist party with regard to the government's unemployment policy.}}</ref>

===Manufacturing facilities===
* [[Harland and Wolff]] was one of the largest shipbuilding yards in the world.

===Preparation===
[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James Craig, Viscount Craigavon, <br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland until his death in 1940. ''[[HMSO]] image'']]

====Government preparation====
There was little preparation for the conflict with Germany.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years|last=Barton|first=Brian|year=1989|publisher=Blackstaff Press |location=Belfast|isbn=978-0-85640-426-9 |page=27|quote=Preparing for war ... ... Progress in Northern Ireland was minimal}}</ref> However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: \"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be.\" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: \"if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours'&nbsp;\". His reply was: \"We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|Empire]] to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the [[Ulster]] people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.\"

Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \"a very definite German objective\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' 2015, p. 41-2.</ref>

====Air-raid shelters====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Belfast, the city with the highest population density per area in Britain at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \"Belfast Blitz\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were [[Air raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]], constructed of sheets of [[corrugated galvanised iron]] covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. 

No searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some [[barrage balloon]]s positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti-aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and sixteen heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational.

====Children====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Few children had been successfully evacuated. The \"Hiram Plan\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.

====German preparation====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
From papers recovered after the war, we know of a ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:
* [[Harland and Wolff]]
* ''Die Tankstelle'' Conns Water
* Short and Harland aircraft factory
* The power station of Belfast
* Rank & Co mill
* Belfast waterworks
* [[Victoria Barracks, Belfast|Victoria Barracks]]

===Earlier raids===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]] or the cities of the [[North West England|northwest of England]].
On 24 March 1941, [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John MacDermott]], Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\" MacDermott would be proved right.

The first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, from ''Kampfgruppe 26'', flying at {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, dropped [[Incendiary bomb|incendiaries]], high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. Thirteen lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} factory floor for manufacturing the [[fuselage]]s of [[Short Stirling]] bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over [[Downpatrick]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' crews returned to their base in Northern [[France]] and reported that Belfast's defences were, \"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences.

==Easter Tuesday Blitz==
[[William Joyce]] (known as \"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \"Easter eggs for Belfast\". {{fact|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Junkers Ju88.jpg|right|thumb|Junkers Ju-88]]
On [[Easter]] Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match at [[Windsor Park]] noticed a lone [[Luftwaffe#World War I|Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz//personal_peter.shtml|title=The most unprotected city in the UK|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=Peter Hughes|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

That evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] and headed for [[Belfast]]. There were [[Heinkel He 111]]s, [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dorniers]]. At 10:40&nbsp;pm the [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens sounded]]. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.

Public buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, the LMS railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the [[Antrim Road]]; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt).

Streets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed.<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\"/>

There was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the [[anti-aircraft]] batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5{{nbsp}}am.

Fifty-five thousand houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref>Wills, (2007). ''That Neutral Island'', page 213.</ref> A stray bomber attacked [[Derry]], killing 15. Another attacked [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15{{nbsp}}am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary ''\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\"''. Since 1:45{{nbsp}}am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the [[Rail transport|railway]] telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35{{nbsp}}am,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} asking the Irish [[Taoiseach]], Éamon de Valera for assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0413/646678-radio-documentary-ww2-hidden-heroes-belfast-blitz-republic-firemen|title=Hidden Heroes of the Belfast Blitz|date=16 April 2011|website=rte.ie|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

==Human cost==
Over 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. Fifty-thousand houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. Eleven churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other [[primary source]]s, such as:-<br>
Jimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz;<br>
Emma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the [[World War I|Great War]]), who kept a [[diary]]; <br> 
and Major Seán O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of [[Queen's University, Belfast]], has written most on this topic.<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713203032/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}</ref>

===Instructions===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes.

Major O'Sullivan reported that \"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\"

That night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant [[Shankill Road, Belfast|Shankill area]], took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.

===Mortuary===
The mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. Two hundred and fifty-five corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/46 Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 46.]</ref> Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the [[Milltown Cemetery|Milltown]] and [[Belfast City Cemetery|Belfast City Cemeteries]].

===Nurse Emma Duffin===
Nurse Emma Duffin, who had served in [[World War I]], contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:{{quote|(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.}}

==Major Seán O'Sullivan==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Major Seán O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the [[Mater Infirmorum Hospital|Mater Hospital]] at 2&nbsp;pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, ([[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor [[Errol Flynn]]), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\" O'Sullivan reported: \"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead&nbsp;– heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\". His report concluded with: \"a second Belfast <!-- word(s) missing? --> would be too horrible to contemplate\".<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\"/>

===Refugees===
Two hundred and twenty thousand people fled from the city. Many \"arrived in [[Fermanagh]] having nothing with them only night shirts\". Ten thousand \"officially\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of [[Dromara]] saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In [[Newtownards]], Bangor, Larne, [[Carrickfergus]], Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Major O'Sullivan reported on a:{{quote|continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference.

Train after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.}}

Moya Woodside<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 20750128|title = Woman in Wartime: The Mass-Observation Diary of Moya Woodside|journal = The Irish Review (1986–)|issue = 42|pages = 58–71|last1 = Muldowney|first1 = Mary|year = 2010}}</ref> noted in her diary: \"Evacuation is taking on panic proportions. Roads out of town are still one stream of cars, with mattresses and bedding tied on top. Everything on wheels is being pressed into service. People are leaving from all parts of town and not only from the bombed areas. Where they are going, what they will find to eat when they get there, nobody knows.\"

Dawson Bates informed the Cabinet of rack-renting of barns, and over thirty people per house in some areas.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/49 <!-- quote=rack. --> Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 49.]</ref>

===Newspaper reaction===
''[[The Irish Times]]'' editorial on 17 April:
{{quote|Humanity knows no borders, no politics, no differences of religious belief. Yesterday for once the people of Ireland were united under the shadow of a national blow. Has it taken bursting bombs to remind the people of this little country that they have common tradition, a common genius and a common home? Yesterday the hand of good-fellowship was reached across the Border. Men from the South worked with men from the North in the universal cause of the relief of suffering.}}

==Aftermath==

===Southern reaction===
By 6{{nbsp}}am, within two hours of the request for assistance, 71 [[Firefighter|firemen]] with 13 [[Fire apparatus|fire tenders]] from [[Dundalk]], [[Drogheda]], Dublin, and [[Dún Laoghaire]] were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived.

[[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] formally protested to Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |title=The Dublin Bombing |work=Dáil Debates, Volume 83 |publisher=Dáil Éireann |date=5 June 1941 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922035553/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}</ref> He followed up with his \"they are our people\" speech, made in [[Castlebar]], County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the ''Dundalk Democrat'' dated Saturday 26 April 1941):
{{quote|In the past, and probably in the present, too, a number of them did not see eye to eye with us politically, but they are our people{{spaced ndash}}we are one and the same people{{spaced ndash}}and their sorrows in the present instance are also our sorrows; and I want to say to them that any help we can give to them in the present time we will give to them whole-heartedly, believing that were the circumstances reversed they would also give us their help whole-heartedly ...}}
[[Frank Aiken]], the [[Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures|Irish Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures]] was in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] at the time. He gave an interview saying: \"the people of Belfast are Irish people too\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tom Geraghty|author2=Trevor Whitehead|title=The Dublin Fire Brigade|date=2004|publisher=Dublin City Council|location=Dublin|isbn=978-0946841714|page=229}}<!--|accessdate=15 April 2015--></ref>

===German response===
Initial German radio broadcasts celebrated the raid. A ''Luftwaffe'' pilot gave this description \"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]] or [[Glasgow]].\" [[William Joyce]] \"Lord Haw-Haw\" announced that \"The Führer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from [[Joseph Goebbels]] were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that [[Adolf Hitler]], in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and [[Irish American]] politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Eduard Hempel]], the German Minister to Ireland, visited the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Ministry for External Affairs]] to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\" He stated that \"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\".

===Recriminations===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
The government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. [[Tommy Henderson]], an Independent Unionist MP in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\"

[[File:Belfast-Lough-2.png|thumb|left|A map showing the location of Belfast Lough]]
US journalist [[Ben Robertson (journalist)|Ben Robertson]] reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.<ref name=\"ingersoll1940\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n213/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=194}}</ref> One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In ''The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years'', Brian Barton wrote: \"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \"too far north\" to use radio guidance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Other writers, such as Tony Gray in ''The Lost Years'' state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of [[Belfast Lough]], would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\", \"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the [[IRA Army Council]] to [[IRA Abwehr World War II|support Germany]]. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However on 20 October 1941 the Garda captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and Sydenham aerodrome, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p397</ref><ref>Report by the Garda 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722</ref>

===Firemen return south===
After three days, sometime after 6{{nbsp}}pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in [[Banbridge]]; others were entertained in the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] hall in [[Newry]]. In 1995. on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. an invitation was received by the [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] for any survivors of that time to attend a function at [[Hillsborough Castle]] and meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Only four were known still to be alive; one, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Second major raid===
[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H9464.jpg|thumb|Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid]]
There was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1{{nbsp}}am, ''Luftwaffe'' bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\"<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\">''Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941'', Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011)</ref> were dropped. Over 150 people lost their lives in what became known as the 'Fire Blitz'.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

Casualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45{{nbsp}}pm while the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked more cautiously from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

[[File:AIR RAID DAMAGE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 1939-1945 - H 9476.jpg|thumb|270px|Rescue workers searching through rubble after an air raid on Belfast]]
The '''Belfast Blitz''' consisted of four German air raids on strategic targets in the city of [[Belfast]] in [[Northern Ireland]], in April and May 1941 during [[World War II]], causing high casualties. The first was on the night of 7{{ndash}}8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on [[Easter Tuesday]], 15 April 1941. Two hundred [[bombers]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on [[London]], this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref name=bbrem>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm|title=The Belfast blitz is remembered|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2001|publisher=BBC News|quote=On 16 April 1941 Belfast was devastated as it bore the worst air raid of any city outside London […] It was one of the largest German strike forces used to date in the war and the ''Luftwaffe'' was heading for a city later described as the most poorly defended in the United Kingdom.}}</ref><ref name=membb>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a7713966.shtml|title=Memories of the Belfast Blitz|accessdate=19 January 2015|author= [[Belfast Central Library]]|work= WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|quote=No city, save London, suffered more loss of life in one night’s raid on the United Kingdom.}}</ref>

The third raid on Belfast took place over the evening and morning of 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941; 150 were killed. Incendiary bombs predominated in this raid. The fourth and final Belfast raid took place on the following night, 5{{ndash}}6 May. In total over 1,300 houses were demolished, some 5,000 badly damaged, nearly 30,000 slightly damaged while 20,000 required \"first aid repairs\".<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' (2015) p. 397.</ref>

==Background==
As the UK was preparing for the conflict, the [[Factory|factories]] and [[shipyard]]s of Belfast were gearing up. Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the ''Luftwaffe''. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK.  Under the leadership of [[Éamon de Valera]], it had declared its [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations: the German Legation in [[Dublin]] remained open throughout the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keogh|first=Dermot|title=Eamon de Valera and Hitler: An Analysis of International Reaction to the Visit to the German Minister, May 1945|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/Article.pdf|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69–92|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

===Government===
The [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig, Lord Craigavon]], had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. [[Richard Dawson Bates]] was the Home Affairs Minister. [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]], the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to Britain in her time of need.<ref name=\"bardon\">{{cite web|title=Extracts from an article, \"The Belfast Blitz, 1941\"|author=Jonathan Bardon|url=http://www.joeoloughlin.co.uk/?p=65|work=BELFAST BLITZ|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>

[[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John Clarke MacDermott]], the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the \"Hiram Plan\" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible.<ref name=Hiram>{{cite web|title=Historical Topics Series 2 The Belfast Blitz |url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/historical_topics_series_-_02_-_the_belfast_blitz.pdf |work=BELFAST BLITZ |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> It was MacDermott who sent a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] to de Valera seeking assistance. There was unease with the complacent attitude of the government, which led to resignations:
* [[Edmond Warnock|John Edmond Warnock]], the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, resigned from the government on 25 May 1940. He said, \"I have heard speeches about Ulster pulling her weight but they have never carried conviction.\" and \"the government has been slack, dilatory and apathetic.\"<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|title=Your Place and Mine – The Belfast Blitz |author=BBC Radio Ulster |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz/context.shtml |work=The Belfast Blitz |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>
* [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Robert Gisborne Gordon|Alexander Gordon]], Parliamentary and Financial Secretary at the Ministry of Finance (i.e. [[Chief Whip]]), resigned on 13 June 1940,<ref>http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html</ref> explaining to the Commons that the government was \"quite unfitted to sustain the people in the ordeal we have to face.\"

Craigavon died on 24 November 1940. He was succeeded by [[John Miller Andrews]], then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He was replaced by 54-year-old [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]] on 1 May.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/02/archives/northern-ireland-gets-new-premier-sir-basil-brooke-54-named-to.html |title=NORTHERN IRELAND GETS NEW PREMIER |accessdate=23 January 2015|date=2 May 1943|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=resigned after criticism from his own Unionist party with regard to the government's unemployment policy.}}</ref>

===Manufacturing facilities===
* [[Harland and Wolff]] was one of the largest shipbuilding yards in the world. It had constructed many ships for the [[White Star Line]] like {{RMS|Titanic}} and {{RMS|Olympic}} and for the [[Royal Navy]], including [[aircraft carrier]]s such as {{HMS|Formidable|R67|6}} and {{HMS|Unicorn|I72|2}}; the [[Battlecruiser|cruisers]], {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}} and {{HMS|Penelope|97|2}} as well as 131 other naval vessels. Up to 35,000 people were employed.<ref>http://navalhistory.flixco.info/H/63949/8330/a0.htm</ref>
* During the war years, Belfast shipyards built or converted over 3,000 navy vessels, repaired more than 22,000 others and launched over half a million tons of merchant shipping&nbsp;– over 140 merchantmen.<ref name=BTelegraph>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/belfast-blitz-the-night-death-and-destruction-rained-down-on-city-28607780.html |title=Belfast Blitz: The night death and destruction rained down on city |accessdate=3 February 2015|date=15 April 2011|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|quote=Belfast shipyards also built or converted at least 3,000 naval vessels, repaired more than 22,000 and launched 140 merchant ships}}</ref>
* [[Short Brothers]] manufactured aircraft. They are best known for the [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] and the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]] long-range [[heavy bomber]]. Up to 20,000 people were employed. The factory was re-equipping as early as 1936 for the manufacture of 189 [[Handley Page Hereford]] [[bomber]]s
* [[Mackie International|James Mackie & Sons]] were re-equipped in 1938. They were the primary supplier of [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] anti-aircraft shells.
* Harland's Engineering works built [[tank]]s. They designed the [[Churchill tank|Churchill]].
* Aero [[linen]] for covering aircraft, such as the [[Hawker Hurricane]], and [[military glider]] frames was manufactured by a number of Belfast [[flax]] spinning mills, such as The York Street Flax Spinning Co.; Brookfield Spinning Co.; Wm. Ewart's Rosebank Weaving Co.; and the Linen Thread Co.
* Other Belfast factories manufactured gun mountings, [[Artillery|ordnance]] pieces, aircraft parts and [[ammunition]].

War materials and food were sent by sea from Belfast to Britain, some under the protection of the [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]. The M.V. ''Munster'', for example, operated by the [[Belfast Steamship Company]], plied between Belfast and [[Liverpool]] under the tricolour, until she hit a [[Naval mine|mine]] and was sunk outside Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|title=Munster|url=http://lugnad.ie/remember-munster/|work=Commemorative Brochure|publisher=[[Maritime Institute of Ireland]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>

===Preparation===
[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James Craig, Viscount Craigavon, <br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland until his death in 1940. ''[[HMSO]] image'']]

====Government preparation====
There was little preparation for the conflict with Germany.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years|last=Barton|first=Brian|year=1989|publisher=Blackstaff Press |location=Belfast|isbn=978-0-85640-426-9 |page=27|quote=Preparing for war ... ... Progress in Northern Ireland was minimal}}</ref> However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: \"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be.\" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: \"if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours'&nbsp;\". His reply was: \"We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|Empire]] to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the [[Ulster]] people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.\"

Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \"a very definite German objective\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' 2015, p. 41-2.</ref>

====Air-raid shelters====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Belfast, the city with the highest population density per area in Britain at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \"Belfast Blitz\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were [[Air raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]], constructed of sheets of [[corrugated galvanised iron]] covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. 

No searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some [[barrage balloon]]s positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti-aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and sixteen heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational.

====Children====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Few children had been successfully evacuated. The \"Hiram Plan\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.

====German preparation====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
From papers recovered after the war, we know of a ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:
* [[Harland and Wolff]]
* ''Die Tankstelle'' Conns Water
* Short and Harland aircraft factory
* The power station of Belfast
* Rank & Co mill
* Belfast waterworks
* [[Victoria Barracks, Belfast|Victoria Barracks]]

[[File:Johnmillerandrews.jpg|thumb|left|John Miller Andrews<br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1940–43. ''HMSO image'']]

===Earlier raids===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]] or the cities of the [[North West England|northwest of England]].
On 24 March 1941, [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John MacDermott]], Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\" MacDermott would be proved right.

The first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, from ''Kampfgruppe 26'', flying at {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, dropped [[Incendiary bomb|incendiaries]], high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. Thirteen lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} factory floor for manufacturing the [[fuselage]]s of [[Short Stirling]] bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over [[Downpatrick]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' crews returned to their base in Northern [[France]] and reported that Belfast's defences were, \"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences.

==Easter Tuesday Blitz==
[[William Joyce]] (known as \"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \"Easter eggs for Belfast\". {{fact|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Junkers Ju88.jpg|right|thumb|Junkers Ju-88]]
On [[Easter]] Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match at [[Windsor Park]] noticed a lone [[Luftwaffe#World War I|Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz//personal_peter.shtml|title=The most unprotected city in the UK|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=Peter Hughes|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

That evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] and headed for [[Belfast]]. There were [[Heinkel He 111]]s, [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dorniers]]. At 10:40&nbsp;pm the [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens sounded]]. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.

Public buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, the LMS railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the [[Antrim Road]]; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt).

Streets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed.<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\"/>

There was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the [[anti-aircraft]] batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5{{nbsp}}am.

Fifty-five thousand houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref>Wills, (2007). ''That Neutral Island'', page 213.</ref> A stray bomber attacked [[Derry]], killing 15. Another attacked [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15{{nbsp}}am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary ''\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\"''. Since 1:45{{nbsp}}am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the [[Rail transport|railway]] telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35{{nbsp}}am,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} asking the Irish [[Taoiseach]], Éamon de Valera for assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0413/646678-radio-documentary-ww2-hidden-heroes-belfast-blitz-republic-firemen|title=Hidden Heroes of the Belfast Blitz|date=16 April 2011|website=rte.ie|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

==Human cost==
Over 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. Fifty-thousand houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. Eleven churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other [[primary source]]s, such as:-<br>
Jimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz;<br>
Emma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the [[World War I|Great War]]), who kept a [[diary]]; <br> 
and Major Seán O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of [[Queen's University, Belfast]], has written most on this topic.<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713203032/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}</ref>

===Instructions===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes.

Major O'Sullivan reported that \"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\"

That night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant [[Shankill Road, Belfast|Shankill area]], took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.

===Mortuary===
The mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. Two hundred and fifty-five corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/46 Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 46.]</ref> Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the [[Milltown Cemetery|Milltown]] and [[Belfast City Cemetery|Belfast City Cemeteries]].

===Nurse Emma Duffin===
Nurse Emma Duffin, who had served in [[World War I]], contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:{{quote|(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.}}

==Major Seán O'Sullivan==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Major Seán O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the [[Mater Infirmorum Hospital|Mater Hospital]] at 2&nbsp;pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, ([[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor [[Errol Flynn]]), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\" O'Sullivan reported: \"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead&nbsp;– heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\". His report concluded with: \"a second Belfast <!-- word(s) missing? --> would be too horrible to contemplate\".<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\"/>

===Refugees===
Two hundred and twenty thousand people fled from the city. Many \"arrived in [[Fermanagh]] having nothing with them only night shirts\". Ten thousand \"officially\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of [[Dromara]] saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In [[Newtownards]], Bangor, Larne, [[Carrickfergus]], Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Major O'Sullivan reported on a:{{quote|continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference.

Train after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.}}

Roads out of town are still one stream of cars, with mattresses and bedding tied on top. Everything on wheels is being pressed into service. People are leaving from all parts of town and not only from the bombed areas. Where they are going, what they will find to eat when they get there, nobody knows.\"

Dawson Bates informed the Cabinet of rack-renting of barns, and over thirty people per house in some areas.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/49 <!-- quote=rack. --> Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 49.]</ref>

===Newspaper reaction===
''[[The Irish Times]]'' editorial on 17 April:
{{quote|Humanity knows no borders, no politics, no differences of religious belief. Yesterday for once the people of Ireland were united under the shadow of a national blow. Has it taken bursting bombs to remind the people of this little country that they have common tradition, a common genius and a common home? Yesterday the hand of good-fellowship was reached across the Border. Men from the South worked with men from the North in the universal cause of the relief of suffering.}}

==Aftermath==

===Southern reaction===
By 6{{nbsp}}am, within two hours of the request for assistance, 71 [[Firefighter|firemen]] with 13 [[Fire apparatus|fire tenders]] from [[Dundalk]], [[Drogheda]], Dublin, and [[Dún Laoghaire]] were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived.

[[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] formally protested to Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |title=The Dublin Bombing |work=Dáil Debates, Volume 83 |publisher=Dáil Éireann |date=5 June 1941 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922035553/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}</ref> He followed up with his \"they are our people\" speech, made in [[Castlebar]], County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the ''Dundalk Democrat'' dated Saturday 26 April 1941):

[[Frank Aiken]], the [[Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures|Irish Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures]] was in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] at the time.

===German response===
Initial German radio broadcasts celebrated the raid. A ''Luftwaffe'' pilot gave this description \"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]] or [[Glasgow]].\" [[William Joyce]] \"Lord Haw-Haw\" announced that \"The Führer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from [[Joseph Goebbels]] were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that [[Adolf Hitler]], in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and [[Irish American]] politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Eduard Hempel]], the German Minister to Ireland, visited the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Ministry for External Affairs]] to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\" He stated that \"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\".

===Recriminations===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
The government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. [[Tommy Henderson]], an Independent Unionist MP in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\"

[[File:Belfast-Lough-2.png|thumb|left|A map showing the location of Belfast Lough]]
US journalist [[Ben Robertson (journalist)|Ben Robertson]] reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.<ref name=\"ingersoll1940\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n213/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=194}}</ref> One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In ''The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years'', Brian Barton wrote: \"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \"too far north\" to use radio guidance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Other writers, such as Tony Gray in ''The Lost Years'' state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of [[Belfast Lough]], would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\", \"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the [[IRA Army Council]] to [[IRA Abwehr World War II|support Germany]]. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However on 20 October 1941 the Garda captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and Sydenham aerodrome, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p397</ref><ref>Report by the Garda 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722</ref>

===Firemen return south===
After three days, sometime after 6{{nbsp}}pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in [[Banbridge]]; others were entertained in the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] hall in [[Newry]]. In 1995 on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War an invitation was received by the [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] for any survivors of that time to attend a function at [[Hillsborough Castle]] and meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Only four were known still to be alive; one, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Second major raid===
[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H9464.jpg|thumb|Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid]]
There was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1{{nbsp}}am, ''Luftwaffe'' bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\"<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\">''Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941'', Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011)</ref> were dropped. Over 150 people lost their lives in what became known as the 'Fire Blitz'.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

Casualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45{{nbsp}}pm while the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked more cautiously from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

[[File:AIR RAID DAMAGE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 1939-1945 - H 9476.jpg|thumb|270px|Rescue workers searching through rubble after an air raid on Belfast]]
The '''Belfast Blitz''' consisted of four German air raids on strategic targets in the city of [[Belfast]] in [[Northern Ireland]], in April and May 1941 during [[World War II]], causing high casualties. The first was on the night of 7{{ndash}}8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on [[Easter Tuesday]], 15 April 1941. Two hundred [[bombers]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on [[London]], this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref name=bbrem>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm|title=The Belfast blitz is remembered|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2001|publisher=BBC News|quote=On 16 April 1941 Belfast was devastated as it bore the worst air raid of any city outside London […] It was one of the largest German strike forces used to date in the war and the ''Luftwaffe'' was heading for a city later described as the most poorly defended in the United Kingdom.}}</ref><ref name=membb>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a7713966.shtml|title=Memories of the Belfast Blitz|accessdate=19 January 2015|author= [[Belfast Central Library]]|work= WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|quote=No city, save London, suffered more loss of life in one night’s raid on the United Kingdom.}}</ref>

The third raid on Belfast took place over the evening and morning of 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941; 150 were killed. Incendiary bombs predominated in this raid. The fourth and final Belfast raid took place on the following night, 5{{ndash}}6 May. In total over 1,300 houses were demolished, some 5,000 badly damaged, nearly 30,000 slightly damaged while 20,000 required \"first aid repairs\".<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' (2015) p. 397.</ref>

==Background==
As the UK was preparing for the conflict, the [[Factory|factories]] and [[shipyard]]s of Belfast were gearing up. Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the ''Luftwaffe''. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK.  Under the leadership of [[Éamon de Valera]], it had declared its [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations: the German Legation in [[Dublin]] remained open throughout the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keogh|first=Dermot|title=Eamon de Valera and Hitler: An Analysis of International Reaction to the Visit to the German Minister, May 1945|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/Article.pdf|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69–92|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

===Government===
The [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig, Lord Craigavon]], had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. [[Richard Dawson Bates]] was the Home Affairs Minister. [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]], the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to Britain in her time of need.<ref name=\"bardon\">{{cite web|title=Extracts from an article, \"The Belfast Blitz, 1941\"|author=Jonathan Bardon|url=http://www.joeoloughlin.co.uk/?p=65|work=BELFAST BLITZ|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>

[[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John Clarke MacDermott]], the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the \"Hiram Plan\" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible.<ref name=Hiram>{{cite web|title=Historical Topics Series 2 The Belfast Blitz |url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/historical_topics_series_-_02_-_the_belfast_blitz.pdf |work=BELFAST BLITZ |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> It was MacDermott who sent a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] to de Valera seeking assistance. There was unease with the complacent attitude of the government, which led to resignations:
* [[Edmond Warnock|John Edmond Warnock]], the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, resigned from the government on 25 May 1940. He said, \"I have heard speeches about Ulster pulling her weight but they have never carried conviction.\" and \"the government has been slack, dilatory and apathetic.\"<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|title=Your Place and Mine – The Belfast Blitz |author=BBC Radio Ulster |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz/context.shtml |work=The Belfast Blitz |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>
* [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Robert Gisborne Gordon|Alexander Gordon]], Parliamentary and Financial Secretary at the Ministry of Finance (i.e. [[Chief Whip]]), resigned on 13 June 1940,<ref>http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html</ref> explaining to the Commons that the government was \"quite unfitted to sustain the people in the ordeal we have to face.\"

Craigavon died on 24 November 1940. He was succeeded by [[John Miller Andrews]], then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He was replaced by 54-year-old [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]] on 1 May.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/02/archives/northern-ireland-gets-new-premier-sir-basil-brooke-54-named-to.html |title=NORTHERN IRELAND GETS NEW PREMIER |accessdate=23 January 2015|date=2 May 1943|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=resigned after criticism from his own Unionist party with regard to the government's unemployment policy.}}</ref>

===Manufacturing facilities===
* [[Harland and Wolff]] was one of the largest shipbuilding yards in the world. It had constructed many ships for the [[White Star Line]] like {{RMS|Titanic}} and {{RMS|Olympic}} and for the [[Royal Navy]], including [[aircraft carrier]]s such as {{HMS|Formidable|R67|6}} and {{HMS|Unicorn|I72|2}}; the [[Battlecruiser|cruisers]], {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}} and {{HMS|Penelope|97|2}} as well as 131 other naval vessels. Up to 35,000 people were employed.<ref>http://navalhistory.flixco.info/H/63949/8330/a0.htm</ref>
* During the war years, Belfast shipyards built or converted over 3,000 navy vessels, repaired more than 22,000 others and launched over half a million tons of merchant shipping&nbsp;– over 140 merchantmen.<ref name=BTelegraph>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/belfast-blitz-the-night-death-and-destruction-rained-down-on-city-28607780.html |title=Belfast Blitz: The night death and destruction rained down on city |accessdate=3 February 2015|date=15 April 2011|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|quote=Belfast shipyards also built or converted at least 3,000 naval vessels, repaired more than 22,000 and launched 140 merchant ships}}</ref>
* [[Short Brothers]] manufactured aircraft. They are best known for the [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] and the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]] long-range [[heavy bomber]]. Up to 20,000 people were employed. The factory was re-equipping as early as 1936 for the manufacture of 189 [[Handley Page Hereford]] [[bomber]]s
* [[Mackie International|James Mackie & Sons]] were re-equipped in 1938. They were the primary supplier of [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] anti-aircraft shells.
* Harland's Engineering works built [[tank]]s. They designed the [[Churchill tank|Churchill]].
* Aero [[linen]] for covering aircraft, such as the [[Hawker Hurricane]], and [[military glider]] frames was manufactured by a number of Belfast [[flax]] spinning mills, such as The York Street Flax Spinning Co.; Brookfield Spinning Co.; Wm. Ewart's Rosebank Weaving Co.; and the Linen Thread Co.
* Other Belfast factories manufactured gun mountings, [[Artillery|ordnance]] pieces, aircraft parts and [[ammunition]].

War materials and food were sent by sea from Belfast to Britain, some under the protection of the [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]. The M.V. ''Munster'', for example, operated by the [[Belfast Steamship Company]], plied between Belfast and [[Liverpool]] under the tricolour, until she hit a [[Naval mine|mine]] and was sunk outside Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|title=Munster|url=http://lugnad.ie/remember-munster/|work=Commemorative Brochure|publisher=[[Maritime Institute of Ireland]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>

===Preparation===
[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James Craig, Viscount Craigavon, <br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland until his death in 1940. ''[[HMSO]] image'']]

====Government preparation====
There was little preparation for the conflict with Germany.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years|last=Barton|first=Brian|year=1989|publisher=Blackstaff Press |location=Belfast|isbn=978-0-85640-426-9 |page=27|quote=Preparing for war ... ... Progress in Northern Ireland was minimal}}</ref> However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: \"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be.\" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: \"if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours'&nbsp;\". His reply was: \"We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|Empire]] to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the [[Ulster]] people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.\"

Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \"a very definite German objective\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' 2015, p. 41-2.</ref>

====Air-raid shelters====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Belfast, the city with the highest population density per area in Britain at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \"Belfast Blitz\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were [[Air raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]], constructed of sheets of [[corrugated galvanised iron]] covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. 

No searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some [[barrage balloon]]s positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti-aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and sixteen heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational.

====Children====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Few children had been successfully evacuated. The \"Hiram Plan\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.

====German preparation====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
From papers recovered after the war, we know of a ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:
* [[Harland and Wolff]]
* ''Die Tankstelle'' Conns Water
* Short and Harland aircraft factory
* The power station of Belfast
* Rank & Co mill
* Belfast waterworks
* [[Victoria Barracks, Belfast|Victoria Barracks]]

[[File:Johnmillerandrews.jpg|thumb|left|John Miller Andrews<br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1940–43. ''HMSO image'']]

===Earlier raids===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]] or the cities of the [[North West England|northwest of England]].
On 24 March 1941, [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John MacDermott]], Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\" MacDermott would be proved right.

The first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, from ''Kampfgruppe 26'', flying at {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, dropped [[Incendiary bomb|incendiaries]], high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. Thirteen lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} factory floor for manufacturing the [[fuselage]]s of [[Short Stirling]] bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over [[Downpatrick]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' crews returned to their base in Northern [[France]] and reported that Belfast's defences were, \"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences.

==Easter Tuesday Blitz==
[[William Joyce]] (known as \"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \"Easter eggs for Belfast\". {{fact|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Junkers Ju88.jpg|right|thumb|Junkers Ju-88]]
On [[Easter]] Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match at [[Windsor Park]] noticed a lone [[Luftwaffe#World War I|Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz//personal_peter.shtml|title=The most unprotected city in the UK|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=Peter Hughes|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

That evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] and headed for [[Belfast]]. There were [[Heinkel He 111]]s, [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dorniers]]. At 10:40&nbsp;pm the [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens sounded]]. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.

Public buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, the LMS railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the [[Antrim Road]]; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt).

Streets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed.<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\"/>

There was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the [[anti-aircraft]] batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5{{nbsp}}am.

Fifty-five thousand houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref>Wills, (2007). ''That Neutral Island'', page 213.</ref> A stray bomber attacked [[Derry]], killing 15. Another attacked [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15{{nbsp}}am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary ''\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\"''. Since 1:45{{nbsp}}am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the [[Rail transport|railway]] telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35{{nbsp}}am,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} asking the Irish [[Taoiseach]], Éamon de Valera for assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0413/646678-radio-documentary-ww2-hidden-heroes-belfast-blitz-republic-firemen|title=Hidden Heroes of the Belfast Blitz|date=16 April 2011|website=rte.ie|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

==Human cost==
Over 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. Fifty-thousand houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. Eleven churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other [[primary source]]s, such as:-<br>
Jimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz;<br>
Emma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the [[World War I|Great War]]), who kept a [[diary]]; <br> 
and Major Seán O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of [[Queen's University, Belfast]], has written most on this topic.<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713203032/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}</ref>

===Instructions===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes.

Major O'Sullivan reported that \"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\"

That night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant [[Shankill Road, Belfast|Shankill area]], took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.

===Mortuary===
The mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. Two hundred and fifty-five corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/46 Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 46.]</ref> Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the [[Milltown Cemetery|Milltown]] and [[Belfast City Cemetery|Belfast City Cemeteries]].

===Nurse Emma Duffin===
Nurse Emma Duffin, who had served in [[World War I]], contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:{{quote|(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.}}

==Major Seán O'Sullivan==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Major Seán O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the [[Mater Infirmorum Hospital|Mater Hospital]] at 2&nbsp;pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, ([[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor [[Errol Flynn]]), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\" O'Sullivan reported: \"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead&nbsp;– heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\". His report concluded with: \"a second Belfast <!-- word(s) missing? --> would be too horrible to contemplate\".<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\"/>

===Refugees===
Two hundred and twenty thousand people fled from the city. Many \"arrived in [[Fermanagh]] having nothing with them only night shirts\". Ten thousand \"officially\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of [[Dromara]] saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In [[Newtownards]], Bangor, Larne, [[Carrickfergus]], Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Major O'Sullivan reported on a:{{quote|continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference.

Train after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.}}

Moya Woodside<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 20750128|title = Woman in Wartime: The Mass-Observation Diary of Moya Woodside|journal = The Irish Review (1986–)|issue = 42|pages = 58–71|last1 = Muldowney|first1 = Mary|year = 2010}}</ref> noted in her diary: \"Evacuation is taking on panic proportions. Roads out of town are still one stream of cars, with mattresses and bedding tied on top. Everything on wheels is being pressed into service. People are leaving from all parts of town and not only from the bombed areas. Where they are going, what they will find to eat when they get there, nobody knows.\"

Dawson Bates informed the Cabinet of rack-renting of barns, and over thirty people per house in some areas.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/49 <!-- quote=rack. --> Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 49.]</ref>

===Newspaper reaction===
''[[The Irish Times]]'' editorial on 17 April:
{{quote|Humanity knows no borders, no politics, no differences of religious belief. Yesterday for once the people of Ireland were united under the shadow of a national blow. Has it taken bursting bombs to remind the people of this little country that they have common tradition, a common genius and a common home? Yesterday the hand of good-fellowship was reached across the Border. Men from the South worked with men from the North in the universal cause of the relief of suffering.}}

==Aftermath==

===Southern reaction===
By 6{{nbsp}}am, within two hours of the request for assistance, 71 [[Firefighter|firemen]] with 13 [[Fire apparatus|fire tenders]] from [[Dundalk]], [[Drogheda]], Dublin, and [[Dún Laoghaire]] were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived.

[[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] formally protested to Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |title=The Dublin Bombing |work=Dáil Debates, Volume 83 |publisher=Dáil Éireann |date=5 June 1941 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922035553/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}</ref> He followed up with his \"they are our people\" speech, made in [[Castlebar]], County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the Dundalk Democrat dated Saturday 26 April 1941):
{{quote|In the past, and probably in the present, too, a number of them did not see eye to eye with us politically, but they are our people{{spaced ndash}}we are one and the same people{{spaced ndash}}and their sorrows in the present instance are also our sorrows; and I want to say to them that any help we can give to them in the present time we will give to them whole-heartedly, believing that were the circumstances reversed they would also give us their help whole-heartedly ...}}
[[Frank Aiken]], the [[Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures|Irish Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures]] was in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] at the time. He gave an interview saying: \"the people of Belfast are Irish people too\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tom Geraghty|author2=Trevor Whitehead|title=The Dublin Fire Brigade|date=2004|publisher=Dublin City Council|location=Dublin|isbn=978-0946841714|page=229}}<!--|accessdate=15 April 2015--></ref>

===German response===
Initial German radio broadcasts celebrated the raid. A ''Luftwaffe'' pilot gave this description \"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]] or [[Glasgow]].\" [[William Joyce]] \"Lord Haw-Haw\" announced that \"The Führer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from [[Joseph Goebbels]] were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that [[Adolf Hitler]], in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and [[Irish American]] politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Eduard Hempel]], the German Minister to Ireland, visited the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Ministry for External Affairs]] to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\" He stated that \"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\".

===Recriminations===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
The government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. [[Tommy Henderson]], an Independent Unionist MP in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\"

[[File:Belfast-Lough-2.png|thumb|left|A map showing the location of Belfast Lough]]
US journalist [[Ben Robertson (journalist)|Ben Robertson]] reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.<ref name=\"ingersoll1940\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n213/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=194}}</ref> One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In ''The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years'', Brian Barton wrote: \"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \"too far north\" to use radio guidance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Other writers, such as Tony Gray in ''The Lost Years'' state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of [[Belfast Lough]], would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\", \"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the [[IRA Army Council]] to [[IRA Abwehr World War II|support Germany]]. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However on 20 October 1941 the Garda captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and Sydenham aerodrome, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p397</ref><ref>Report by the Garda 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722</ref>

===Firemen return south===
After three days, sometime after 6{{nbsp}}pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in [[Banbridge]]; others were entertained in the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] hall in [[Newry]]. In 1995 on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War an invitation was received by the [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] for any survivors of that time to attend a function at [[Hillsborough Castle]] and meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Only four were known still to be alive; one, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Second major raid===
[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H9464.jpg|thumb|Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid]]
There was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1{{nbsp}}am, ''Luftwaffe'' bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\"<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\">''Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941'', Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011)</ref> were dropped. Over 150 people lost their lives in what became known as the 'Fire Blitz'.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

Casualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45{{nbsp}}pm while the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked more cautiously from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

[[File:AIR RAID DAMAGE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 1939-1945 - H 9476.jpg|thumb|270px|Rescue workers searching through rubble after an air raid on Belfast]]
The '''Belfast Blitz''' consisted of four German air raids on strategic targets in the city of [[Belfast]] in [[Northern Ireland]], in April and May 1941 during [[World War II]], causing high casualties. The first was on the night of 7{{ndash}}8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on [[Easter Tuesday]], 15 April 1941. Two hundred [[bombers]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on [[London]], this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref name=bbrem>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm|title=The Belfast blitz is remembered|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2001|publisher=BBC News|quote=On 16 April 1941 Belfast was devastated as it bore the worst air raid of any city outside London […] It was one of the largest German strike forces used to date in the war and the ''Luftwaffe'' was heading for a city later described as the most poorly defended in the United Kingdom.}}</ref><ref name=membb>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a7713966.shtml|title=Memories of the Belfast Blitz|accessdate=19 January 2015|author= [[Belfast Central Library]]|work= WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|quote=No city, save London, suffered more loss of life in one night’s raid on the United Kingdom.}}</ref>

The third raid on Belfast took place over the evening and morning of 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941; 150 were killed. Incendiary bombs predominated in this raid. The fourth and final Belfast raid took place on the following night, 5{{ndash}}6 May. In total over 1,300 houses were demolished, some 5,000 badly damaged, nearly 30,000 slightly damaged while 20,000 required \"first aid repairs\".<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' (2015) p. 397.</ref>

==Background==
As the UK was preparing for the conflict, the [[Factory|factories]] and [[shipyard]]s of Belfast were gearing up. Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the ''Luftwaffe''. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK.  Under the leadership of [[Éamon de Valera]], it had declared its [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations: the German Legation in [[Dublin]] remained open throughout the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keogh|first=Dermot|title=Eamon de Valera and Hitler: An Analysis of International Reaction to the Visit to the German Minister, May 1945|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/Article.pdf|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69–92|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

===Government===
The [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig, Lord Craigavon]], had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. [[Richard Dawson Bates]], was the Home Affairs Minister. [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]], the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to Britain in her time of need.<ref name=\"bardon\">{{cite web|title=Extracts from an article, \"The Belfast Blitz, 1941\"|author=Jonathan Bardon|url=http://www.joeoloughlin.co.uk/?p=65|work=BELFAST BLITZ|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>

[[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John Clarke MacDermott]], the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the \"Hiram Plan\" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible.<ref name=Hiram>{{cite web|title=Historical Topics Series 2 The Belfast Blitz |url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/historical_topics_series_-_02_-_the_belfast_blitz.pdf |work=BELFAST BLITZ |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> It was MacDermott who sent a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] to de Valera seeking assistance. There was unease with the complacent attitude of the government, which led to resignations:
* [[Edmond Warnock|John Edmond Warnock]], the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, resigned from the government on 25 May 1940. He said, \"I have heard speeches about Ulster pulling her weight but they have never carried conviction.\" and \"the government has been slack, dilatory and apathetic.\"<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|title=Your Place and Mine – The Belfast Blitz |author=BBC Radio Ulster |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz/context.shtml |work=The Belfast Blitz |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>
* [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Robert Gisborne Gordon|Alexander Gordon]], Parliamentary and Financial Secretary at the Ministry of Finance (i.e. [[Chief Whip]]), resigned on 13 June 1940,<ref>http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html</ref> explaining to the Commons that the government was \"quite unfitted to sustain the people in the ordeal we have to face.\"

Craigavon died on 24 November 1940. He was succeeded by [[John Miller Andrews]], then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He was replaced by 54-year-old [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]] on 1 May.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/02/archives/northern-ireland-gets-new-premier-sir-basil-brooke-54-named-to.html |title=NORTHERN IRELAND GETS NEW PREMIER |accessdate=23 January 2015|date=2 May 1943|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=resigned after criticism from his own Unionist party with regard to the government's unemployment policy.}}</ref>

===Manufacturing facilities===
* [[Harland and Wolff]] was one of the largest shipbuilding yards in the world. It had constructed many ships for the [[White Star Line]] like {{RMS|Titanic}} and {{RMS|Olympic}} and for the [[Royal Navy]], including [[aircraft carrier]]s such as {{HMS|Formidable|R67|6}} and {{HMS|Unicorn|I72|2}}; the [[Battlecruiser|cruisers]], {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}} and {{HMS|Penelope|97|2}} as well as 131 other naval vessels. Up to 35,000 people were employed.<ref>http://navalhistory.flixco.info/H/63949/8330/a0.htm</ref>
* During the war years, Belfast shipyards built or converted over 3,000 navy vessels, repaired more than 22,000 others and launched over half a million tons of merchant shipping&nbsp;– over 140 merchantmen.<ref name=BTelegraph>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/belfast-blitz-the-night-death-and-destruction-rained-down-on-city-28607780.html |title=Belfast Blitz: The night death and destruction rained down on city |accessdate=3 February 2015|date=15 April 2011|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|quote=Belfast shipyards also built or converted at least 3,000 naval vessels, repaired more than 22,000 and launched 140 merchant ships}}</ref>
* [[Short Brothers]] manufactured aircraft. They are best known for the [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] and the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]] long-range [[heavy bomber]]. Up to 20,000 people were employed. The factory was re-equipping as early as 1936 for the manufacture of 189 [[Handley Page Hereford]] [[bomber]]s
* [[Mackie International|James Mackie & Sons]] were re-equipped in 1938. They were the primary supplier of [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] anti-aircraft shells.
* Harland's Engineering works built [[tank]]s. They designed the [[Churchill tank|Churchill]].
* Aero [[linen]] for covering aircraft, such as the [[Hawker Hurricane]], and [[military glider]] frames was manufactured by a number of Belfast [[flax]] spinning mills, such as The York Street Flax Spinning Co.; Brookfield Spinning Co.; Wm. Ewart's Rosebank Weaving Co.; and the Linen Thread Co.
* Other Belfast factories manufactured gun mountings, [[Artillery|ordnance]] pieces, aircraft parts and [[ammunition]].

War materials and food were sent by sea from Belfast to Britain, some under the protection of the [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]. The M.V. ''Munster'', for example, operated by the [[Belfast Steamship Company]], plied between Belfast and [[Liverpool]] under the tricolour, until she hit a [[Naval mine|mine]] and was sunk outside Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|title=Munster|url=http://lugnad.ie/remember-munster/|work=Commemorative Brochure|publisher=[[Maritime Institute of Ireland]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>

===Preparation===
[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James Craig, Viscount Craigavon, <br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland until his death in 1940. ''[[HMSO]] image'']]

====Government preparation====
There was little preparation for the conflict with Germany.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years|last=Barton|first=Brian|year=1989|publisher=Blackstaff Press |location=Belfast|isbn=978-0-85640-426-9 |page=27|quote=Preparing for war ... ... Progress in Northern Ireland was minimal}}</ref> However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: \"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be.\" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: \"if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours'&nbsp;\". His reply was: \"We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|Empire]] to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the [[Ulster]] people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.\"

Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \"a very definite German objective\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' 2015, p. 41-2.</ref>

====Air-raid shelters====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Belfast, the city with the highest population density per area in Britain at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \"Belfast Blitz\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were [[Air raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]], constructed of sheets of [[corrugated galvanised iron]] covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. 

No searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some [[barrage balloon]]s positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti-aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and sixteen heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational.

====Children====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Few children had been successfully evacuated. The \"Hiram Plan\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.

====German preparation====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
From papers recovered after the war, we know of a ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:
* [[Harland and Wolff]]
* ''Die Tankstelle'' Conns Water
* Short and Harland aircraft factory
* The power station of Belfast
* Rank & Co mill
* Belfast waterworks
* [[Victoria Barracks, Belfast|Victoria Barracks]]

[[File:Johnmillerandrews.jpg|thumb|left|John Miller Andrews<br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1940–43. ''HMSO image'']]

===Earlier raids===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]] or the cities of the [[North West England|northwest of England]].
On 24 March 1941, [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John MacDermott]], Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\" MacDermott would be proved right.

The first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, from ''Kampfgruppe 26'', flying at {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, dropped [[Incendiary bomb|incendiaries]], high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. Thirteen lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} factory floor for manufacturing the [[fuselage]]s of [[Short Stirling]] bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over [[Downpatrick]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' crews returned to their base in Northern [[France]] and reported that Belfast's defences were, \"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences.

==Easter Tuesday Blitz==
[[William Joyce]] (known as \"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \"Easter eggs for Belfast\". {{fact|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Junkers Ju88.jpg|right|thumb|Junkers Ju-88]]
On [[Easter]] Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match at [[Windsor Park]] noticed a lone [[Luftwaffe#World War I|Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz//personal_peter.shtml|title=The most unprotected city in the UK|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=Peter Hughes|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

That evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] and headed for [[Belfast]]. There were [[Heinkel He 111]]s, [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dorniers]]. At 10:40&nbsp;pm the [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens sounded]]. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.

Public buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, the LMS railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the [[Antrim Road]]; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt).

Streets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed.<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\"/>

There was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the [[anti-aircraft]] batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5{{nbsp}}am.

Fifty-five thousand houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref>Wills, (2007). ''That Neutral Island'', page 213.</ref> A stray bomber attacked [[Derry]], killing 15. Another attacked [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15{{nbsp}}am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary ''\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\"''. Since 1:45{{nbsp}}am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the [[Rail transport|railway]] telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35{{nbsp}}am,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} asking the Irish [[Taoiseach]], Éamon de Valera for assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0413/646678-radio-documentary-ww2-hidden-heroes-belfast-blitz-republic-firemen|title=Hidden Heroes of the Belfast Blitz|date=16 April 2011|website=rte.ie|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

==Human cost==
Over 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. Fifty-thousand houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. Eleven churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other [[primary source]]s, such as:-<br>
Jimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz;<br>
Emma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the [[World War I|Great War]]), who kept a [[diary]]; <br> 
and Major Seán O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of [[Queen's University, Belfast]], has written most on this topic.<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713203032/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}</ref>

===Instructions===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
There were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes.

Major O'Sullivan reported that \"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\"

That night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant [[Shankill Road, Belfast|Shankill area]], took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.

===Mortuary===
The mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. Two hundred and fifty-five corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/46 Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 46.]</ref> Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the [[Milltown Cemetery|Milltown]] and [[Belfast City Cemetery|Belfast City Cemeteries]].

===Nurse Emma Duffin===
Nurse Emma Duffin, who had served in [[World War I]], contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:{{quote|(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.}}

==Major Seán O'Sullivan==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Major Seán O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the [[Mater Infirmorum Hospital|Mater Hospital]] at 2&nbsp;pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, ([[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor [[Errol Flynn]]), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\" O'Sullivan reported: \"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead&nbsp;– heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\". His report concluded with: \"a second Belfast <!-- word(s) missing? --> would be too horrible to contemplate\".<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\"/>

===Refugees===
Two hundred and twenty thousand people fled from the city. Many \"arrived in [[Fermanagh]] having nothing with them only night shirts\". Ten thousand \"officially\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of [[Dromara]] saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In [[Newtownards]], Bangor, Larne, [[Carrickfergus]], Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Major O'Sullivan reported on a:{{quote|continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference.

Train after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.}}

Roads out of town are still one stream of cars, with mattresses and bedding tied on top. Everything on wheels is being pressed into service. People are leaving from all parts of town and not only from the bombed areas. Where they are going, what they will find to eat when they get there, nobody knows.\"

Dawson Bates informed the Cabinet of rack-renting of barns, and over thirty people per house in some areas.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/49 <!-- quote=rack. --> Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 49.]</ref>

===Newspaper reaction===
''[[The Irish Times]]'' editorial on 17 April:
{{quote|Humanity knows no borders, no politics, no differences of religious belief. Yesterday for once the people of Ireland were united under the shadow of a national blow. Has it taken bursting bombs to remind the people of this little country that they have common tradition, a common genius and a common home? Yesterday the hand of good-fellowship was reached across the Border. Men from the South worked with men from the North in the universal cause of the relief of suffering.}}

==Aftermath==

===Southern reaction===
By 6{{nbsp}}am, within two hours of the request for assistance, 71 [[Firefighter|firemen]] with 13 [[Fire apparatus|fire tenders]] from [[Dundalk]], [[Drogheda]], Dublin, and [[Dún Laoghaire]] were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived.

[[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] formally protested to Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |title=The Dublin Bombing |work=Dáil Debates, Volume 83 |publisher=Dáil Éireann |date=5 June 1941 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922035553/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}</ref> He followed up with his \"they are our people\" speech, made in [[Castlebar]], County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the Dundalk Democrat dated Saturday 26 April 1941):

===German response===
Initial German radio broadcasts celebrated the raid. A ''Luftwaffe'' pilot gave this description \"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]] or [[Glasgow]].\" [[William Joyce]] \"Lord Haw-Haw\" announced that \"The Führer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from [[Joseph Goebbels]] were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that [[Adolf Hitler]], in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and [[Irish American]] politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Eduard Hempel]], the German Minister to Ireland, visited the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Ministry for External Affairs]] to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\" He stated that \"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\".

===Recriminations===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
The government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. [[Tommy Henderson]], an Independent Unionist MP in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\"

[[File:Belfast-Lough-2.png|thumb|left|A map showing the location of Belfast Lough]]
US journalist [[Ben Robertson (journalist)|Ben Robertson]] reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.<ref name=\"ingersoll1940\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n213/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=194}}</ref> One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In ''The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years'', Brian Barton wrote: \"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \"too far north\" to use radio guidance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Other writers, such as Tony Gray in ''The Lost Years'' state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of [[Belfast Lough]], would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\", \"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the [[IRA Army Council]] to [[IRA Abwehr World War II|support Germany]]. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However on 20 October 1941 the Garda captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and Sydenham aerodrome, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p397</ref><ref>Report by the Garda 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722</ref>

===Firemen return south===
After three days, sometime after 6{{nbsp}}pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in [[Banbridge]]; others were entertained in the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] hall in [[Newry]]. In 1995 on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War an invitation was received by the [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] for any survivors of that time to attend a function at [[Hillsborough Castle]] and meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Only four were known still to be alive; one, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Second major raid===
[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H9464.jpg|thumb|Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid]]
There was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1{{nbsp}}am, ''Luftwaffe'' bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\"<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\">''Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941'', Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011)</ref> were dropped. Over 150 people lost their lives in what became known as the 'Fire Blitz'.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

Casualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45{{nbsp}}pm while the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked more cautiously from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

'''''House of 1000 Corpses''''' is a 2003 American [[horror film]] written, co-scored, and directed by [[Rob Zombie]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], and the first film in the [[List of Firefly (film series) characters|''Firefly'' film series]]. It stars [[Sid Haig]], [[Bill Moseley]], [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri Moon]]<!--At the time of filming, she was yet to be married and is billed as simply \"Sheri Moon\" in the credits.-->, [[Karen Black]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Chris Hardwick]], and [[Dennis Fimple]] in his final role. The plot centers on a group of teenagers who are kidnapped and tortured by a psychotic family during [[Halloween]], after traveling across the country to write a book.

Inspired by 1970s horror films such as ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/videos/house-of-1000-corpses |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012031522/http://www.ifc.com/videos/house-of-1000-corpses |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |work=IFC (The Independent Film Channel) |title=House of 1000 Corpses |accessdate=2012-07-08 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Zombie conceived the film while designing a haunted house attraction for [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], where filming took place in 2000 on the backlots and [[Valencia, California]]. When the studio shelved the film fearing that it would receive an NC-17 rating,<ref name=\"fangoria\">{{cite journal|work=Fangoria|issue=199|pages=20–25|title=Death to False Horror|author=Szulkin, David}}</ref> Zombie re-acquired the rights and were eventually sold to [[Lions Gate Entertainment]], who released the film in April 2003. Despite receiving an unfavorable response from critics, it went on to gross $16 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has achieved a [[cult following]], was developed into a haunted house attraction by Zombie for Universal Studios, and was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005) and ''[[3 from Hell]]'' (2019).

==Plot==
On October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station, but are killed by the owner, [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]], and his assistant, Ravelli. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat [[roadside attraction]]s. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of \"The Museum of Monsters & Madmen\", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young free-spirited [[hitchhiker]] named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts (in what is later seen to be a trap) and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.

There they meet Baby's family: her adopted brother [[Otis Driftwood]], her deformed giant half-brother [[Tiny Firefly|Tiny]], Mother Firefly, and Grandpa Hugo. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house, after he suffered a psychotic breakdown. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As the couples leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as [[scarecrow]]s, attack them in the driveway and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially [[Scalping|scalped]] for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star.

When Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk. Don, a former policeman, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him; Don and Steve are then killed by Otis when they find more bodies of missing cheerleaders in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later.

Meanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of [[Intellectual disability|mental patients]]; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being [[Vivisection|vivisected]] and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Mother Firefly's ex-husband Earl, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface as he is crushed by falling debris. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the back seat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan's operating table, and she screams in horror.

The idea for ''House of 1000 Corpses'' came to Zombie while designing a haunted house attraction with that title for the studio,<ref name=cdinterview /> and Universal responded positively to his pitch.<ref name=cdinterview /> Zombie later stated \"I was in the office of the head of production or something and he asked me if I had any movie ideas and I pitched him Corpses, which was very rough at the time, because I wasn't ready and I made it up on the spot. He liked it, I went home, wrote a 12-page treatment and met up with them. Two months later, we were shooting.\"<ref name=theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/19/popandrock|title=Interview: Rob Zombie|website=theguardian.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> Production on the film began in May 2000<ref name=\"fangoria\" /> and was finished by Halloween of 2000.<ref name=cdinterview /> The house was launched the following year, although the title was changed to \"American Nightmare\" due to the film's shelving.<ref name=cdinterview /> Despite the name change, the house still featured numerous references to the film, and the theatrical trailer played while customers waited.<ref name=cdinterview />

The film's starting budget was $3–4 million, though its final budget is debatable.<ref name=\"fangoria\" /> Zombie first claimed that the film was made solely with the initial $4 million but later described a budget between $7 million and $14 million.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVffEFtxKhM|title=Rob Zombie explains why House of 1000 Corpses cost so much to make.|date=28 February 2014|work=YouTube}}</ref> Zombie later admitted that he initially knew he didn't have the funding for a good ending but gambled that if he shot what he could on what remained of his budget, the studio would kick in more funds to make a better ending. \"I knew the ending sucked, so I let it suck and they said, 'The movie's great but the ending sucks' and I know. So they gave me more money and we shot a more elaborate ending, bigger sets, the whole razzamatazz.\"<ref name=cdinterview /> The original film featured more characters, including a [[skunk ape]], and featured footage of the four teenagers on their road trip.<ref name=slasherama>{{cite web|url=http://www.slasherama.com/features/robzombie.HTML|title=Slasherama Interviews Rob Zombie|publisher=slasherama.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> Universal hoped that the film would focus more on the group of kids, but Zombie knew \"nobody gives a shit about the kids\".<ref name=slasherama /> Zombie claimed the film was not initially meant to feature elements of [[black humor]], saying it \"turned out a little wackier and campier than I originally intended. But as we were shooting, that's the tone that it was turning out to be. Movies sometimes dictate their own course, so I just sort of went with it.\"<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/rob-zombie-13946|title=avclub Interviews Rob Zombie!|publisher=avclub.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref>

The film was shot on a twenty-five-day shooting schedule. Two weeks were spent filming on the Universal Studios Hollywood backlots—the house featured in the film is the same house used in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), and it can be seen on Universal Studios' tram tours.<ref name=\"fangoria\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/chickenranch.shtml|work=The Studio Tour: Universal Studios Hollywood|title=The Chicken Ranch|accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> Zombie stated that filming on the lot was at times difficult, as the amusement park was often open and ruined takes.<ref name=cdinterview /> The remaining eleven days of the shoot were spent on a ranch in [[Valencia, California]].<ref name=\"fangoria\" /> The scene involving Bill being transformed into \"Fishboy\" was initially much longer, featuring gory details of the creation of the monster.<ref name=slasherama /> Zombie stated the scene was created after Universal passed on the film.<ref name=slasherama /> Scenes featuring Baby masturbating with a skeleton, along with other cutaway scenes, were filmed in Zombie's basement after initial filming for the project had concluded. Zombie later cited home recordings from the [[Charles Manson|Manson family]] as inspiration for the Firefly family's \"bizarre\" rants. Zombie often filmed two versions of scenes, one of them less gory, in an attempt to please Universal.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Jake McKinnon could not see well when dressed as The Professor, and almost hit actress Erin Daniels with a real ax during the film's climax. Zombie later said he had simply hoped Daniels would move out of the way in time. When Denise calls her father from a telephone booth, a sign for a missing dog head can be seen hanging in the booth; this was in fact a real item found by Zombie and used for the film. In the early stages of the film, Grandpa Hugo was to have been revealed as the murderous Dr. Satan, who at the time was simply referred to as the mad doctor. The legend of the mad doctor was to be a ploy by the Firefly family to lure victims in, though this idea was later scrapped. This led to Grandpa Hugo receiving much less screen time. The character of Dr. Satan was inspired by a 1950s billboard-sized poster advertising a \"live spook show starring a magician called Dr. Satan\" that Zombie has in his house.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ulmer | first = Gary | title = Interview with the Zombie | periodical = Dark Realms Magazine | pages = 14–16 | volume = issue 11 | date = Summer 2003 | url = http://www.monolithgraphics.com/darkrealms.html}}</ref>

The film's main cast consisted of the murderous Firefly family, the four teenagers and various police officers attempting to find the group, among others.<ref name=\"horrorhound\">{{citation|last =Newell|first =Eric|title=House of 1000 Corpses|journal=Horror Hound|volume=1|issue=36|pages=26–33| year= 2012}}</ref> Sid Haig was cast as Captain Spaulding, a man who dresses as a clown and owns a gas station and museum of curiosities.<ref name=\"horrorhound\"/> Haig claimed he had to \"get in touch with [his] own insanity\" for the role.<ref name=aboutfilm>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutfilm.com/features/devilsrejects/castinterviews.htm|title=Devil's Rejects - Cast Interviews|accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> His relation to the Firefly family is not revealed in the film, though he is working with them to some extent; however, the sequel establishes that he is the father of Baby. Bill Moseley starred as Otis B. Driftwood, who was adopted into the Firefly family.

The names of members of the Firefly family were taken from the names of [[Groucho Marx]] characters.

Driftwood was a character in ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935), Rufus T. Firefly was taken from ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933), and lastly Hugo Z. Hackenbush derived from ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' (1937). Despite only allusions to this being made in ''House of 1000 Corpses'', it is more prevalent in the film's sequel, with the names becoming integral to the plot.<ref name=\"ifc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2013/07/five-surprising-facts-about-rob-zombies-house-of-1000-corpses|title=Five Fun Facts About Rob Zombie’s House of 1000 Corpses|work=www.ifc.com}}</ref> Zombie acknowledged that viewers were meant to \"root for\" the Firefly family as opposed to the group of teens, though claims it wasn't intentional: \"Yeah, I wanted the audience to cheer 'em.

===Music===
{{main|House of 1000 Corpses (soundtrack)}}
The [[Film score|score for the film]] was composed by Zombie, alongside Canadian producer [[Scott Humphrey]]. Much of the production work for the soundtrack to the film was done in Humphrey's studio, The Chop Shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechopshop.com/ |title=The Chop Shop |publisher=The Chop Shop |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref><ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thechopshop.com/about.html |title=The Chop Shop |publisher=The Chop Shop |accessdate=2012-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426065635/http://www.thechopshop.com/about.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The film's score featured similar musical themes to Zombie's releases, consisting of heavy metal influences.

His manager later got both [[Lionel Richie]] and rapper [[Trina]] to appear on a cover of the song with Zombie, under the title \"Brick House 2003\".<ref name=MTVmusic /> Aside from making audio clips and snippets for the film, Zombie recorded a variety of new songs for the film's soundtrack.

==Release==
Prior to agreeing to release the film through Universal, Zombie reportedly told the studio of the film's nature, stating \"I was really blatant when I talked to them. I didn't want to get into a situation where they thought I was making something mainstream. And I told them that I wanted to make a drive-in movie, something very gritty and nasty and weird.\"<ref name=avclub /> Production of the film was completed in 2000, and was set for release through Universal. The studio completed a theatrical trailer for the film, which was shown in theaters and prior to the Universal ride created by Zombie.<ref name=avclub /> Zombie later received a call for a meeting with Stacey Snider, head of Universal, requesting a meeting. Zombie recalled fearing that the studio would demand a re-shoot, though he later learned that Snider's fears of the film receiving an [[NC-17 rating]] had led to the company's refusal to release the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.axs.com/news/rob-zombie-announces-new-movie-3i-rocking-dead-10999|title=Rob Zombie announces new movie ‘3I’: Rocking dead|date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> The film remained shelved for several months, with Zombie eventually purchasing the rights to the film from Universal. Zombie claimed that many urged him to scrap the film following the fallout with Universal, though he continued to search for a new distributor.

Zombie later made a deal with [[MGM]] to release the film, with MGM slating an October 2002 release for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-zombie-signs-deal-with-mgm-for-release-of-house-of-1000-corpses|title=ROB ZOMBIE Signs Deal With MGM For Release Of \"House Of 1000 Corpses\"|publisher=BlabberMouth.net}}</ref> Despite this, MGM later refused to release the film following a controversial remark from Zombie claiming that the company had no morals for releasing the film.<ref name=lentmag>{{cite web|url=http://lentmag.com/consider-the-zombie/|title=Consider the Zombie|author=Andrew Paul}}</ref> Zombie later announced plans to release the film himself, without the backing of a production company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-zombie-s-house-of-1000-corpses-gets-dropped-by-mgm/|title=Rob Zombie's \"House Of 1000 Corpses\" Gets Dropped By Mgm - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref> Despite this, Zombie eventually caught the eye of [[Lions Gate Entertainment]], the final studio to sign on for the project.<ref name=lentmag /> Lions Gate, attempting to venture into new types of films, hoped releasing a horror film would provide more opportunities.<ref name=lentmag /> The film was cut and edited in an attempt to achieve an R-rating, with Zombie claiming that most of the cut footage featured Sherri Moon Zombie's character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1454969/rob-zombies-house-of-1000-corpses-finds-a-home/|title=Rob Zombie’s ‘House of 1000 Corpses’ Finds A Home|publisher=MTV}}</ref>

''House of 1000 Corpses'' received a generally negative critical reception upon its release. Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the film \"lives up to the spirit but not the quality of its inspirations\" and is ultimately a \"cheesy and ultragory exploitation horror flick\" and \"strangely devoid of thrills, shocks or horror.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/critic/frank-scheck/?cats=&genreid=&letter=&switches=&sortby=&limit=50&page=18|work=RottenTomatoes, Hollywood Reporter|author=Scheck, Frank|title=Frank Scheck Movie Reviews|date=2003-04-14|accessdate=2013-10-05}}</ref> Clint Morris of ''[[Film Threat]]'' slammed the film as \"an hour and a half of undecipherable plot\" and found the film to be \"sickening\" overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?Id=4247|work=Film Threat|title=House of 1000 Corpses review|accessdate=2013-10-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309234847/http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?Id=4247|archivedate=March 9, 2005|df=mdy-all}}</ref> James Brundage of [[Filmcritic.com]] wrote that the film was simply \"hick after hick, cheap scary image after cheap scary image, lots of southern accents and [[psychosis|psychotic]] murders,\" and was \"too highbrow to be a good cheap horror movie, too lowbrow to be [[satire]], and too boring to bear the value of the ticket.\"<ref>[http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/5da244ef271690fb88256d0900187b41?OpenDocument House of 1000 Corpses Movie Review, DVD Release – Filmcritic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012100506/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/5da244ef271690fb88256d0900187b41?OpenDocument |date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, stating \"If not for the blink-and-miss sideshow attractions and stockpile of memorable quotes, ''[House of] 1000 Corpses'' would have been easier to shrug off.

'''''House of 1000 Corpses''''' is a 2003 American [[horror film]] written, co-scored, and directed by [[Rob Zombie]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], and the first film in the [[List of Firefly (film series) characters|''Firefly'' film series]]. It stars [[Sid Haig]], [[Bill Moseley]], [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri Moon]]<!--At the time of filming, she was yet to be married and is billed as simply \"Sheri Moon\" in the credits.-->, [[Karen Black]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Chris Hardwick]], and [[Dennis Fimple]] in his final role. The plot centers on a group of teenagers who are kidnapped and tortured by a psychotic family during [[Halloween]], after traveling across the country to write a book.

Inspired by 1970s horror films such as ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/videos/house-of-1000-corpses |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012031522/http://www.ifc.com/videos/house-of-1000-corpses |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |work=IFC (The Independent Film Channel) |title=House of 1000 Corpses |accessdate=2012-07-08 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Zombie conceived the film while designing a haunted house attraction for [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], where filming took place in 2000 on the backlots and [[Valencia, California]].

Despite receiving an unfavorable response from critics, it went on to gross $16 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has achieved a [[cult following]], was developed into a haunted house attraction by Zombie for Universal Studios, and was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005) and ''[[3 from Hell]]'' (2019).

==Plot==
On October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station, but are killed by the owner, [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]], and his assistant, Ravelli. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat [[roadside attraction]]s. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of \"The Museum of Monsters & Madmen\", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young free-spirited [[hitchhiker]] named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts (in what is later seen to be a trap) and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.

There they meet Baby's family: her adopted brother [[Otis Driftwood]], her deformed giant half-brother [[Tiny Firefly|Tiny]], Mother Firefly, and Grandpa Hugo. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house, after he suffered a psychotic breakdown. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As the couples leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as [[scarecrow]]s, attack them in the driveway and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially [[Scalping|scalped]] for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star.

When Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk. Don, a former policeman, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him; Don and Steve are then killed by Otis when they find more bodies of missing cheerleaders in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later.

Meanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of [[Intellectual disability|mental patients]]; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being [[Vivisection|vivisected]] and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Mother Firefly's ex-husband Earl, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface as he is crushed by falling debris. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the back seat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan's operating table, and she screams in horror.

The idea for ''House of 1000 Corpses'' came to Zombie while designing a haunted house attraction with that title for the studio,<ref name=cdinterview /> and Universal responded positively to his pitch.<ref name=cdinterview /> Zombie later stated \"I was in the office of the head of production or something and he asked me if I had any movie ideas and I pitched him Corpses, which was very rough at the time, because I wasn't ready and I made it up on the spot. He liked it, I went home, wrote a 12-page treatment and met up with them. Two months later, we were shooting.\"<ref name=theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/19/popandrock|title=Interview: Rob Zombie|website=theguardian.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> Production on the film began in May 2000<ref name=\"fangoria\" /> and was finished by Halloween of 2000.<ref name=cdinterview /> The house was launched the following year, although the title was changed to \"American Nightmare\" due to the film's shelving.<ref name=cdinterview /> Despite the name change, the house still featured numerous references to the film, and the theatrical trailer played while customers waited.<ref name=cdinterview />

The film's starting budget was $3–4 million, though its final budget is debatable.<ref name=\"fangoria\" /> Zombie first claimed that the film was made solely with the initial $4 million but later described a budget between $7 million and $14 million.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVffEFtxKhM|title=Rob Zombie explains why House of 1000 Corpses cost so much to make.|date=28 February 2014|work=YouTube}}</ref> Zombie later admitted that he initially knew he didn't have the funding for a good ending but gambled that if he shot what he could on what remained of his budget, the studio would kick in more funds to make a better ending. \"I knew the ending sucked, so I let it suck and they said, 'The movie's great but the ending sucks' and I know. So they gave me more money and we shot a more elaborate ending, bigger sets, the whole razzamatazz.\"<ref name=cdinterview /> The original film featured more characters, including a [[skunk ape]], and featured footage of the four teenagers on their road trip.<ref name=slasherama>{{cite web|url=http://www.slasherama.com/features/robzombie.HTML|title=Slasherama Interviews Rob Zombie|publisher=slasherama.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> Universal hoped that the film would focus more on the group of kids, but Zombie knew \"nobody gives a shit about the kids\".<ref name=slasherama /> Zombie claimed the film was not initially meant to feature elements of [[black humor]], saying it \"turned out a little wackier and campier than I originally intended. But as we were shooting, that's the tone that it was turning out to be. Movies sometimes dictate their own course, so I just sort of went with it.\"<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/rob-zombie-13946|title=avclub Interviews Rob Zombie!|publisher=avclub.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref>

The film was shot on a twenty-five-day shooting schedule. Two weeks were spent filming on the Universal Studios Hollywood backlots—the house featured in the film is the same house used in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), and it can be seen on Universal Studios' tram tours.<ref name=\"fangoria\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/chickenranch.shtml|work=The Studio Tour: Universal Studios Hollywood|title=The Chicken Ranch|accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> Zombie stated that filming on the lot was at times difficult, as the amusement park was often open and ruined takes.<ref name=cdinterview /> The remaining eleven days of the shoot were spent on a ranch in [[Valencia, California]].<ref name=\"fangoria\" /> The scene involving Bill being transformed into \"Fishboy\" was initially much longer, featuring gory details of the creation of the monster.<ref name=slasherama /> Zombie stated the scene was created after Universal passed on the film.<ref name=slasherama /> Scenes featuring Baby masturbating with a skeleton, along with other cutaway scenes, were filmed in Zombie's basement after initial filming for the project had concluded. Zombie later cited home recordings from the [[Charles Manson|Manson family]] as inspiration for the Firefly family's \"bizarre\" rants. Zombie often filmed two versions of scenes, one of them less gory, in an attempt to please Universal.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Jake McKinnon could not see well when dressed as The Professor, and almost hit actress Erin Daniels with a real ax during the film's climax. Zombie later said he had simply hoped Daniels would move out of the way in time. When Denise calls her father from a telephone booth, a sign for a missing dog head can be seen hanging in the booth; this was in fact a real item found by Zombie and used for the film. In the early stages of the film, Grandpa Hugo was to have been revealed as the murderous Dr. Satan, who at the time was simply referred to as the mad doctor. The legend of the mad doctor was to be a ploy by the Firefly family to lure victims in, though this idea was later scrapped. This led to Grandpa Hugo receiving much less screen time. The character of Dr. Satan was inspired by a 1950s billboard-sized poster advertising a \"live spook show starring a magician called Dr. Satan\" that Zombie has in his house.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ulmer | first = Gary | title = Interview with the Zombie | periodical = Dark Realms Magazine | pages = 14–16 | volume = issue 11 | date = Summer 2003 | url = http://www.monolithgraphics.com/darkrealms.html}}</ref>

The film's main cast consisted of the murderous Firefly family, the four teenagers and various police officers attempting to find the group, among others.<ref name=\"horrorhound\">{{citation|last =Newell|first =Eric|title=House of 1000 Corpses|journal=Horror Hound|volume=1|issue=36|pages=26–33| year= 2012}}</ref> Sid Haig was cast as Captain Spaulding, a man who dresses as a clown and owns a gas station and museum of curiosities.<ref name=\"horrorhound\"/> Haig claimed he had to \"get in touch with [his] own insanity\" for the role.<ref name=aboutfilm>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutfilm.com/features/devilsrejects/castinterviews.htm|title=Devil's Rejects - Cast Interviews|accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> His relation to the Firefly family is not revealed in the film, though he is working with them to some extent; however, the sequel establishes that he is the father of Baby. Bill Moseley starred as Otis B. Driftwood, who was adopted into the Firefly family.

Driftwood was a character in ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935), Rufus T. Firefly was taken from ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933), and lastly Hugo Z. Hackenbush derived from ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' (1937). Despite only allusions to this being made in ''House of 1000 Corpses'', it is more prevalent in the film's sequel, with the names becoming integral to the plot.<ref name=\"ifc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2013/07/five-surprising-facts-about-rob-zombies-house-of-1000-corpses|title=Five Fun Facts About Rob Zombie’s House of 1000 Corpses|work=www.ifc.com}}</ref> Zombie acknowledged that viewers were meant to \"root for\" the Firefly family as opposed to the group of teens, though claims it wasn't intentional: \"Yeah, I wanted the audience to cheer 'em.

===Music===
{{main|House of 1000 Corpses (soundtrack)}}
The [[Film score|score for the film]] was composed by Zombie, alongside Canadian producer [[Scott Humphrey]]. Much of the production work for the soundtrack to the film was done in Humphrey's studio, The Chop Shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechopshop.com/ |title=The Chop Shop |publisher=The Chop Shop |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref><ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thechopshop.com/about.html |title=The Chop Shop |publisher=The Chop Shop |accessdate=2012-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426065635/http://www.thechopshop.com/about.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The film's score featured similar musical themes to Zombie's releases, consisting of heavy metal influences.

==Release==
Prior to agreeing to release the film through Universal, Zombie reportedly told the studio of the film's nature, stating \"I was really blatant when I talked to them. I didn't want to get into a situation where they thought I was making something mainstream. And I told them that I wanted to make a drive-in movie, something very gritty and nasty and weird.\"<ref name=avclub /> Production of the film was completed in 2000, and was set for release through Universal. The studio completed a theatrical trailer for the film, which was shown in theaters and prior to the Universal ride created by Zombie.<ref name=avclub /> Zombie later received a call for a meeting with Stacey Snider, head of Universal, requesting a meeting. Zombie recalled fearing that the studio would demand a re-shoot, though he later learned that Snider's fears of the film receiving an [[NC-17 rating]] had led to the company's refusal to release the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.axs.com/news/rob-zombie-announces-new-movie-3i-rocking-dead-10999|title=Rob Zombie announces new movie ‘3I’: Rocking dead|date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> The film remained shelved for several months, with Zombie eventually purchasing the rights to the film from Universal. Zombie claimed that many urged him to scrap the film following the fallout with Universal, though he continued to search for a new distributor.

Zombie later made a deal with [[MGM]] to release the film, with MGM slating an October 2002 release for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-zombie-signs-deal-with-mgm-for-release-of-house-of-1000-corpses|title=ROB ZOMBIE Signs Deal With MGM For Release Of \"House Of 1000 Corpses\"|publisher=BlabberMouth.net}}</ref> Despite this, MGM later refused to release the film following a controversial remark from Zombie claiming that the company had no morals for releasing the film.<ref name=lentmag>{{cite web|url=http://lentmag.com/consider-the-zombie/|title=Consider the Zombie|author=Andrew Paul}}</ref> Zombie later announced plans to release the film himself, without the backing of a production company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-zombie-s-house-of-1000-corpses-gets-dropped-by-mgm/|title=Rob Zombie's \"House Of 1000 Corpses\" Gets Dropped By Mgm - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref> Despite this, Zombie eventually caught the eye of [[Lions Gate Entertainment]], the final studio to sign on for the project.<ref name=lentmag /> Lions Gate, attempting to venture into new types of films, hoped releasing a horror film would provide more opportunities.<ref name=lentmag /> The film was cut and edited in an attempt to achieve an R-rating, with Zombie claiming that most of the cut footage featured Sherri Moon Zombie's character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1454969/rob-zombies-house-of-1000-corpses-finds-a-home/|title=Rob Zombie’s ‘House of 1000 Corpses’ Finds A Home|publisher=MTV}}</ref>

===Critical response===
[[File:Cannes 2014 Texas Chain Saw Massacre 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Critics noted the influence of the [[Tobe Hooper]] (above) film ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974).]]
''House of 1000 Corpses'' received a generally negative critical reception upon its release. Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the film \"lives up to the spirit but not the quality of its inspirations\" and is ultimately a \"cheesy and ultragory exploitation horror flick\" and \"strangely devoid of thrills, shocks or horror.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/critic/frank-scheck/?cats=&genreid=&letter=&switches=&sortby=&limit=50&page=18|work=RottenTomatoes, Hollywood Reporter|author=Scheck, Frank|title=Frank Scheck Movie Reviews|date=2003-04-14|accessdate=2013-10-05}}</ref> Clint Morris of ''[[Film Threat]]'' slammed the film as \"an hour and a half of undecipherable plot\" and found the film to be \"sickening\" overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?Id=4247|work=Film Threat|title=House of 1000 Corpses review|accessdate=2013-10-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309234847/http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?Id=4247|archivedate=March 9, 2005|df=mdy-all}}</ref> James Brundage of [[Filmcritic.com]] wrote that the film was simply \"hick after hick, cheap scary image after cheap scary image, lots of southern accents and [[psychosis|psychotic]] murders,\" and was \"too highbrow to be a good cheap horror movie, too lowbrow to be [[satire]], and too boring to bear the value of the ticket.\"<ref>[http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/5da244ef271690fb88256d0900187b41?OpenDocument House of 1000 Corpses Movie Review, DVD Release – Filmcritic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012100506/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/5da244ef271690fb88256d0900187b41?OpenDocument |date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, stating \"If not for the blink-and-miss sideshow attractions and stockpile of memorable quotes, ''[House of] 1000 Corpses'' would have been easier to shrug off.

Grotesque imagery is shown through skewed camera angles as grinning faces watch on. A use of bright fluorescents almost creates a deceptive atmosphere of childlike innocence as the devils perfect their craft on screen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorexpress.com/moviereview/house-of-1000-corpses|title=HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES Movie Review|work=horrorexpress.com}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a C+, saying \"''House of 1000 Corpses'' \"isn’t coherent, exactly, but what dripping-ghoul horror movie is these days?

Zombie, who displays a natural flair for the cinematic, has a real appreciation and knowledge of horror pictures and a [[Diane Arbus]]-like affinity for sleazy, bizarre Americana and schlock culture.

It's great that we have this big celebration. I love seeing Sid Haig and the other actors get such great attention from it. The funny thing is, ten years becomes a long time.

The '''2016 [[UST Growling Tigers men's basketball]] team''' represented [[University of Santo Tomas]] in the [[UAAP Season 79|79th season]] of the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]]. The men's basketball tournament for the [[Academic year|school year]] 2016-17 began on September 4, 2016 and the host school for the season was also UST.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/09/02/16/uaap-season-79-set-for-simple-opening-ceremony-at-ust |title=UAAP Season 79 set for 'simple' opening ceremony at UST |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|author=Naredo, Camille B. |access-date=September 3, 2016}}</ref>

The Tigers finished eighth and [[Sports league ranking|last]] at the end of the [[round-robin tournament|double-round]] eliminations, winning three games against eleven losses.

== Coaching changes ==
'''Boy Sablan''' replaced '''Bong dela Cruz''' as the [[basketball coaching|head coach]] following controversies surrounding the latter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/uaap-men/ust-growling-tigers-bong-dela-cruz-investigation |title=UST source details maltreatment, violence allegedly committed by coach Bong Dela Cruz against players |website=SPIN.ph|author=Terrado, Reuben |access-date=January 28, 2016}}</ref>

Almost two months after falling short of winning the [[championship|title]] against the FEU Tamaraws in the [[UAAP Season 78 basketball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 men's basketball finals]], Dela Cruz became the subject of an administrative investigation stemming from complaints of physical and verbal abuse that he allegedly made against some of the players in the roster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/ust/120817-background-growling-tigers-coach-bong-dela-cruz |title=What we know about UST head coach Bong Dela Cruz |website=[[Rappler]]|access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

Short of calling it a preventive suspension, the [[University of Santo Tomas Institute of Physical Education and Athletics|Institute of Physical Education and Athletics]] (IPEA) through their director Fr. Ermito de Sagon, have asked him to inhibit himself from team activities until after investigations were completed and a decision on his tenure has been made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/ust/120567-bong-dela-cruz-under-probe |title=UST coach Bong Dela Cruz under probe – report |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Ganglani, Naveen |access-date=January 28, 2016}}</ref>

As a result, Dela Cruz stopped attending team practices beginning January 25, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2016/01/26/no-bong-dela-cruz-ust-growling-tigers-practice-8252 |title=No Bong dela Cruz in UST Growling Tigers practice |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|access-date=January 26, 2016}}</ref>

Rumors surfaced that [[Bal David]] was among those who were being considered to replace Dela Cruz,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/uaap-men/bong-dela-cruz-on-his-way-out-as-ust-coach-bal-david-among-top-candidates-for-job |title=Bong Dela Cruz on way out as UST coach, Bal David among top candidates, say sources |website=SPIN.ph|author=Terrado, Reuben |access-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref> but eventually, it was Sablan who was selected to be the new coach in late May where he signed a one-year contract for the upcoming [[UAAP Season 79 basketball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 basketball tournament]] to be hosted by UST.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/06/01/16/ust-names-sablan-as-new-coach-of-growling-tigers |title=UST names Sablan as new coach of Growling Tigers |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|access-date=June 1, 2016}}</ref>

Dela Cruz was not terminated, but instead, management decided to no longer renew his contract which expired on June 1, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/ust/134150-boy-sablan-new-coach |title=Boy Sablan to be named new UST Growling Tigers head coach - source |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Olivares, Rick |access-date=May 24, 2016}}</ref>

== Ineligibility issues ==
Before the start of the season, the UAAP came out with a new ruling that would lower the age limit of student-athletes from the previously-accepted 25 years to 24 years. This would mean that two of the three graduating Growling Tigers would be considered overaged for the upcoming UAAP tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/213575/new-ust-coach-sablan-grapples-with-ineligibility-of-vigil-sheriff |title=New UST coach Sablan grapples with ineligibility of Vigil, Sheriff |website=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|author=Leongson, Randolph B. |access-date=June 1, 2016}}</ref>

[[Captain (sports)|Team captain]] [[Louie Vigil]], Fil-Canadian point guard Jon Sheriff and forward Kent Lao were on their final playing year in the Tigers roster, but only Vigil and Sheriff would be affected by the new rule. Sheriff turned 25 on July 31,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2016/09/01/age-limit-rules-ust-guard-sheriff-ineligible-uaap-79-15064 |title=Age limit rules UST guard Sheriff ineligible for UAAP 79 |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> while Vigil would be the same age on September 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/213701/vigil-frustrated-over-ineligibility-as-ust-left-without-veteran-leader |title=Vigil frustrated over ineligibility as UST left without veteran leader |website=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|author=Leongson, Randolph B. |access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref>

Vigil was already considering signing up for the [[2016 PBA draft|PBA rookie draft]] in October<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxsportsasia.com/basketball/345636/louie-vigil-eyes-pba-jump-uaap-lowers-age-limit/ |title=Louie Vigil eyes PBA jump after UAAP lowers age limit |website=[[Fox Sports Asia]]|author=Lagunzad, Jerome |access-date=June 2, 2016}}</ref> when the UAAP decided to defer implementation of the said rule. Protests lodged by concerned schools and affected athletes were instrumental in the reversion of the age eligibility rules. This was announced after the UAAP board of trustees convened in their annual planning session in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/uaap-men/uaap-reverts-back-to-old-rule-on-age-limit |title=UAAP backs out of plan to lower age limit, maintains scrapping of 'seven year window' |website=SPIN.ph|author=Terrado, Reuben |access-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
*'''The Future'''
Reeling from one of their worst finishes in the [[UAAP Basketball Championship|UAAP Men's basketball tournament]], the UST faithful were eagerly awaiting Steve Akomo's completion of his residency so that he can finally suit up for the Tigers and lead them back to their winning ways.

The Cameroonian center has proven to be a reliable reinforcement when he led the [[University of the Visayas]] to the [[Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc.|CESAFI]] finals in 2012 against [[Ben Mbala]] who was then playing for [[Southwestern University (Philippines)|Southwestern University]].

During the Adamson-UST post-game interview at the [[Mall of Asia Arena|MOA Arena]] last November 9, UST coach Boy Sablan introduced Akomo to the press as the go-to guy for the Tigers alongside Joco Macasaet, Zach Huang and Regie Boy Basibas in their UAAP campaign for the next season.

Macasaet, Huang, and Basibas, who were all in their second playing year, started the game for UST against the [[Adamson Soaring Falcons|Falcons]], while the veteran group of [[Louie Vigil]], Kent Lao, Marvin Lee and Renzo Subido were benched, allegedly for disciplinary reasons. Sablan justified the action by saying that he was giving the fans a preview of the Tigers' future brand of basketball, in reference to the trio and Akomo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/10/16/touted-as-the-future-steve-akomo-vows-to-do-best-for-ust |title=Touted as 'the future,' Steve Akomo vows to do best for UST |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|author=Naredo, Camille B. |access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref>
*'''The Past'''
Former head coach [[Pido Jarencio]], who gave the Tigers the [[UAAP Season 69 basketball tournaments|2006 UAAP Championship]] title and a back-to-back finals appearances in 2012 and 2013, indirectly gave the UST community a glimmer of hope when he sent out a controversial [[Twitter|tweet]] from his [[social media]] account on December 6.

The message reads, \"I am just a call away,\" and a follow-up [[Twitter|tweet]] had Jarencio exclaiming, \"let's bring back the glory!\"

Fans were quick to attribute his messages to the dismal performance of the team in the tournament, which was quite the opposite of their finals run the previous year. Jarencio later confirmed in interviews that he was actually willing to come back to coach the team on two conditions: if the position for head coach became vacant and if the management and the UST community wanted him back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/ust/156286-pido-jarencio-open-ust-coaching-return-if-called |title=Jarencio open to UST coaching return if called upon |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref>

Jarencio resigned as UST's head coach in January 2014 in exchange for a coaching job in the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/philippines/48979-end-of-an-era-pido-jarencio-leaves-ust-moves-to-globalport |title=End of an era: Pido Jarencio leaves UST, moves to Globalport |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref>
*'''Departure of Key Players'''
On May 4, Renzo Subido announced his plan to skip the upcoming [[UAAP Season 80 basketball tournaments|UAAP Season 80 basketball tournament]]. In a [[Twitter]] post, he explained how he was dissatisfied with the way that he has played during the course of his three-year college career. He also added that he planned to join the [[PBA Developmental League|PBA D-League]] where he was hoping to improve his skills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/sports/basketball/20170505/subido-to-miss-next-uaap |title=Subido to miss next UAAP |website=[[The Varsitarian]]|author=Suing, Ivan Ruiz L. |author2=Anolin, Jan Carlo |access-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>

A week later, Mario Bonleon made a similar [[Twitter|tweet]] about taking time off from the team. On May 11, he had cited experiencing [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] as one of the reasons for wanting to leave the team. He also expressed his intention to join a [[PBA Developmental League|D-League]] team during his time away from the Tigers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/sports/basketball/20170511/bonleon-to-miss-next-uaap-cites-burnout |title=Bonleon to miss next UAAP, cites 'burnout' |website=[[The Varsitarian]]|author=Suing, Ivan Ruiz L. |access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>
*'''Rumored Dissatisfaction With the Coach'''
The Growling Tigers joined the [[2017 Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup|Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup]] in the summer, but failed to make it past the elimination round, losing 7 games against only 1 win. This was highlighted by a 39-point loss to the [[Lyceum Pirates|LPU Pirates]].

Because of the Tigers' poor showing in the tournament, various reports began to circulate about some players' growing dissatisfaction with their head coach,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/growling-tigers-defend-ust-head-coach-from-rumors/87145 |title=Growling Tigers defend UST head coach from 'rumors' |website=Tiebreaker Times|author=Li, Matthew |access-date=June 4, 2017|date=2017-06-04 }}</ref> which resulted to speculations that Coach Boy Sablan was on his way out as the team's chief tactician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/sports/news/20170613/tigers-coach-on-his-way-out |title=Tigers coach on his way out? |website=[[The Varsitarian]]|author=Suing, Ivan Ruiz L. |access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>

Sablan, whose one-year contract expired on May 31, 2017, had undergone a surgical procedure on his gallbladder on May 15 was unable to coach the team during the tournament. Assistant coaches Tylon Dar Juan and Bam Ledesma took over practices and coaching duties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/sports/2017/06/01/1705722/crisis-espana-more-players-mull-leaving-ust-tigers |title=Crisis in Espana? More players mull leaving UST Tigers |website=[[The Philippine Star]]|access-date=June 1, 2017}}</ref>

Sablan has belittled the rumors of his replacement, pointing out that there was not much time left for a new coach to prepare the team in time for the September 9 tournament opening.

Dar Juan and incoming team captain Marvin Lee have also come out to Sablan's defense.

Lee denied the report that some of his teammates wanted to leave the team by explaining that the players were given permission by the coaching staff to go on leave. He was referring to Regie Boy Basibas, Zach Huang, and Joco Macasaet who were all absent during the game against the [[San Beda Red Lions]].

Dar Juan, on the other hand told reporters that Sablan was not in physical shape to coach the team after going through surgery, but added that the head coach was actually present during the May 21 game against the [[Letran Knights]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2017/06/04/team-captain-lee-says-tigers-issues-coach-boy-26900 |title=Team captain Lee says Tigers have no issues with coach Sablan |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|author=Riego, Norman Lee Benjamin |access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref>

According to a tweet from former [[The Varsitarian|Varsitarian]] sports editor Alex Cerado on June 20, Sablan's contract has been renewed for another year.

The '''2016 [[UST Growling Tigers men's basketball]] team''' represented [[University of Santo Tomas]] in the [[UAAP Season 79|79th season]] of the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]]. The men's basketball tournament for the [[Academic year|school year]] 2016-17 began on September 4, 2016 and the host school for the season was also UST.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/09/02/16/uaap-season-79-set-for-simple-opening-ceremony-at-ust |title=UAAP Season 79 set for 'simple' opening ceremony at UST |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|author=Naredo, Camille B. |access-date=September 3, 2016}}</ref>

The Tigers finished eighth and [[Sports league ranking|last]] at the end of the [[round-robin tournament|double-round]] eliminations, winning three games against eleven losses. It was the most number of losses in a season for the Growling Tigers since the [[final four]] format began in [[UAAP Season 56|1993]].

They had an average winning margin of 3.7 points and an average losing margin of 16.2 points. Three of their losses were by [[blowout (sports)|blowouts]], once to the [[Adamson Falcons]] in the first round by 27 points,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sportsgatewayph.net/adamson-finishes-first-round-with-blowout-over-ust/ |title=Adamson finishes first round with blowout over UST |website=Sports Gateway PH|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> and twice to the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] by 38 and 43 points<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/150104-la-salle-blasts-ust-11-0-second-round-uaap-basketball |title=La Salle blasts UST for 11-0 record |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref> respectively.

== Coaching changes ==
'''Boy Sablan''' replaced '''Bong dela Cruz''' as the [[basketball coaching|head coach]] following controversies surrounding the latter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/uaap-men/ust-growling-tigers-bong-dela-cruz-investigation |title=UST source details maltreatment, violence allegedly committed by coach Bong Dela Cruz against players |website=SPIN.ph|author=Terrado, Reuben |access-date=January 28, 2016}}</ref>

Almost two months after falling short of winning the [[championship|title]] against the FEU Tamaraws in the [[UAAP Season 78 basketball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 men's basketball finals]], Dela Cruz became the subject of an administrative investigation stemming from complaints of physical and verbal abuse that he allegedly made against some of the players in the roster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/ust/120817-background-growling-tigers-coach-bong-dela-cruz |title=What we know about UST head coach Bong Dela Cruz |website=[[Rappler]]|access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

Short of calling it a preventive suspension, the [[University of Santo Tomas Institute of Physical Education and Athletics|Institute of Physical Education and Athletics]] (IPEA) through their director Fr.

== Ineligibility issues ==
Before the start of the season, the UAAP came out with a new ruling that would lower the age limit of student-athletes from the previously-accepted 25 years to 24 years. This would mean that two of the three graduating Growling Tigers would be considered overaged for the upcoming UAAP tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/213575/new-ust-coach-sablan-grapples-with-ineligibility-of-vigil-sheriff |title=New UST coach Sablan grapples with ineligibility of Vigil, Sheriff |website=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|author=Leongson, Randolph B. |access-date=June 1, 2016}}</ref>

[[Captain (sports)|Team captain]] [[Louie Vigil]], Fil-Canadian point guard Jon Sheriff and forward Kent Lao were on their final playing year in the Tigers roster, but only Vigil and Sheriff would be affected by the new rule. Sheriff turned 25 on July 31,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2016/09/01/age-limit-rules-ust-guard-sheriff-ineligible-uaap-79-15064 |title=Age limit rules UST guard Sheriff ineligible for UAAP 79 |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> while Vigil would be the same age on September 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/213701/vigil-frustrated-over-ineligibility-as-ust-left-without-veteran-leader |title=Vigil frustrated over ineligibility as UST left without veteran leader |website=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|author=Leongson, Randolph B. |access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref>

Vigil was already considering signing up for the [[2016 PBA draft|PBA rookie draft]] in October<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxsportsasia.com/basketball/345636/louie-vigil-eyes-pba-jump-uaap-lowers-age-limit/ |title=Louie Vigil eyes PBA jump after UAAP lowers age limit |website=[[Fox Sports Asia]]|author=Lagunzad, Jerome |access-date=June 2, 2016}}</ref> when the UAAP decided to defer implementation of the said rule. Protests lodged by concerned schools and affected athletes were instrumental in the reversion of the age eligibility rules. This was announced after the UAAP board of trustees convened in their annual planning session in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/uaap-men/uaap-reverts-back-to-old-rule-on-age-limit |title=UAAP backs out of plan to lower age limit, maintains scrapping of 'seven year window' |website=SPIN.ph|author=Terrado, Reuben |access-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
*'''The Future'''
Reeling from one of their worst finishes in the [[UAAP Basketball Championship|UAAP Men's basketball tournament]], the UST faithful were eagerly awaiting Steve Akomo's completion of his residency so that he can finally suit up for the Tigers and lead them back to their winning ways.

The Cameroonian center has proven to be a reliable reinforcement when he led the [[University of the Visayas]] to the [[Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc.|CESAFI]] finals in 2012 against [[Ben Mbala]] who was then playing for [[Southwestern University (Philippines)|Southwestern University]].

During the Adamson-UST post-game interview at the [[Mall of Asia Arena|MOA Arena]] last November 9, UST coach Boy Sablan introduced Akomo to the press as the go-to guy for the Tigers alongside Joco Macasaet, Zach Huang and Regie Boy Basibas in their UAAP campaign for the next season.

Macasaet, Huang, and Basibas, who were all in their second playing year, started the game for UST against the [[Adamson Soaring Falcons|Falcons]], while the veteran group of [[Louie Vigil]], Kent Lao, Marvin Lee and Renzo Subido were benched, allegedly for disciplinary reasons. Sablan justified the action by saying that he was giving the fans a preview of the Tigers' future brand of basketball, in reference to the trio and Akomo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/10/16/touted-as-the-future-steve-akomo-vows-to-do-best-for-ust |title=Touted as 'the future,' Steve Akomo vows to do best for UST |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|author=Naredo, Camille B. |access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref>
*'''The Past'''
Former head coach [[Pido Jarencio]], who gave the Tigers the [[UAAP Season 69 basketball tournaments|2006 UAAP Championship]] title and a back-to-back finals appearances in 2012 and 2013, indirectly gave the UST community a glimmer of hope when he sent out a controversial [[Twitter|tweet]] from his [[social media]] account on December 6.

The message reads, \"I am just a call away,\" and a follow-up [[Twitter|tweet]] had Jarencio exclaiming, \"let's bring back the glory!\"

Fans were quick to attribute his messages to the dismal performance of the team in the tournament, which was quite the opposite of their finals run the previous year. Jarencio later confirmed in interviews that he was actually willing to come back to coach the team on two conditions: if the position for head coach became vacant and if the management and the UST community wanted him back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/ust/156286-pido-jarencio-open-ust-coaching-return-if-called |title=Jarencio open to UST coaching return if called upon |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref>

Jarencio resigned as UST's head coach in January 2014 in exchange for a coaching job in the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/philippines/48979-end-of-an-era-pido-jarencio-leaves-ust-moves-to-globalport |title=End of an era: Pido Jarencio leaves UST, moves to Globalport |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref>
*'''Departure of Key Players'''
On May 4, Renzo Subido announced his plan to skip the upcoming [[UAAP Season 80 basketball tournaments|UAAP Season 80 basketball tournament]]. In a [[Twitter]] post, he explained how he was dissatisfied with the way that he has played during the course of his three-year college career. He also added that he planned to join the [[PBA Developmental League|PBA D-League]] where he was hoping to improve his skills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/sports/basketball/20170505/subido-to-miss-next-uaap |title=Subido to miss next UAAP |website=[[The Varsitarian]]|author=Suing, Ivan Ruiz L. |author2=Anolin, Jan Carlo |access-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>

A week later, Mario Bonleon made a similar [[Twitter|tweet]] about taking time off from the team. On May 11, he had cited experiencing [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] as one of the reasons for wanting to leave the team. He also expressed his intention to join a [[PBA Developmental League|D-League]] team during his time away from the Tigers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/sports/basketball/20170511/bonleon-to-miss-next-uaap-cites-burnout |title=Bonleon to miss next UAAP, cites 'burnout' |website=[[The Varsitarian]]|author=Suing, Ivan Ruiz L. |access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>
*'''Rumored Dissatisfaction With the Coach'''
The Growling Tigers joined the [[2017 Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup|Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup]] in the summer, but failed to make it past the elimination round, losing 7 games against only 1 win. This was highlighted by a 39-point loss to the [[Lyceum Pirates|LPU Pirates]].

Because of the Tigers' poor showing in the tournament, various reports began to circulate about some players' growing dissatisfaction with their head coach,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/growling-tigers-defend-ust-head-coach-from-rumors/87145 |title=Growling Tigers defend UST head coach from 'rumors' |website=Tiebreaker Times|author=Li, Matthew |access-date=June 4, 2017|date=2017-06-04 }}</ref> which resulted to speculations that Coach Boy Sablan was on his way out as the team's chief tactician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/sports/news/20170613/tigers-coach-on-his-way-out |title=Tigers coach on his way out? |website=[[The Varsitarian]]|author=Suing, Ivan Ruiz L. |access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>

Sablan, whose one-year contract expired on May 31, 2017, had undergone a surgical procedure on his gallbladder on May 15 was unable to coach the team during the tournament. Assistant coaches Tylon Dar Juan and Bam Ledesma took over practices and coaching duties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/sports/2017/06/01/1705722/crisis-espana-more-players-mull-leaving-ust-tigers |title=Crisis in Espana? More players mull leaving UST Tigers |website=[[The Philippine Star]]|access-date=June 1, 2017}}</ref>

Sablan has belittled the rumors of his replacement, pointing out that there was not much time left for a new coach to prepare the team in time for the September 9 tournament opening.

Dar Juan and incoming team captain Marvin Lee have also come out to Sablan's defense.

Lee denied the report that some of his teammates wanted to leave the team by explaining that the players were given permission by the coaching staff to go on leave. He was referring to Regie Boy Basibas, Zach Huang, and Joco Macasaet who were all absent during the game against the [[San Beda Red Lions]].

Dar Juan, on the other hand told reporters that Sablan was not in physical shape to coach the team after going through surgery, but added that the head coach was actually present during the May 21 game against the [[Letran Knights]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2017/06/04/team-captain-lee-says-tigers-issues-coach-boy-26900 |title=Team captain Lee says Tigers have no issues with coach Sablan |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|author=Riego, Norman Lee Benjamin |access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref>

According to a tweet from former [[The Varsitarian|Varsitarian]] sports editor Alex Cerado on June 20, Sablan's contract has been renewed for another year.

==Plot==
<!--

Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.
 
-->
In a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to [[Rumpelstiltskin|\"Rumpel\" Rumpelstiltskin]],  in exchange for lifting their daughter's curse. The deal is canceled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that [[Princess Fiona]] has been rescued by [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes Shrek was never born.

In the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a \"real ogre\" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, an escalating series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.

Shrek encounters Rumpel, who gives his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \"thank\" him. Shrek was tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing the contract and suddenly was taken to an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]] where the events starting from [[Shrek|the first film ]] never happened. Now feared by the villagers, Shrek takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he learns that Fiona is a fugitive, and his swamp is deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by [[Witchcraft|witches]] and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict.

Rumpel reveals that he erased the day that Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek does not exist, and the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin, making them disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\".

They soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel, led by a still-cursed Fiona, who keeps [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] as a lazy, overweight pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love after no one came to rescue her and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to take a liking to Shrek but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.

During the ambush, the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything, but it does not work because Fiona does not truly love him. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres, who storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel.

As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears. As she does not transform in the sunlight, she realizes that her kiss with Shrek has broken her curse as she has assumed \"love's true form\". The alternate reality disintegrates and everyone else disappears as Rumpel is then attacked by vengeful spirits.

Shrek finds himself back at his children's birthday party at the time right before he lost his temper. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces everyone with a newfound appreciation for family and friends.

In a [[mid-credits scene]], Rumpel is arrested by the villagers and is put in a cage by them as punishment.

==Plot==
<!--

Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.
 
-->
In a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to [[Rumpelstiltskin|\"Rumpel\" Rumpelstiltskin]],  in exchange for lifting their daughter's curse. The deal is canceled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that [[Princess Fiona]] has been rescued by [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes Shrek was never born.

In the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a \"real ogre\" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, an escalating series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.

Shrek encounters Rumpel, who gives his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \"thank\" him. Shrek was tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing the contract and suddenly was taken to an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]] where the events starting from [[Shrek|the first film ]] never happened. Now feared by the villagers, Shrek takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he learns that Fiona is a fugitive, and his swamp is deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by [[Witchcraft|witches]] and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict.

Rumpel reveals that he erased the day that Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek does not exist, and the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin, making them disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\".

They soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel, led by a still-cursed Fiona, who keeps [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] as a lazy, overweight pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love after no one came to rescue her and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to take a liking to Shrek but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.

During the ambush, the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything, but it does not work because Fiona does not truly love him. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres, who storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel.

As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears. As she does not transform in the sunlight, she realizes that her kiss with Shrek has broken her curse as she has assumed \"love's true form\". The alternate reality disintegrates and everyone else disappears as Rumpel is then attacked by vengeful spirits.

Shrek finds himself back at his children's birthday party at the time right before he lost his temper. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces everyone with a newfound appreciation for family and friends.

In a [[mid-credits scene]], Rumpel is arrested by the villagers and is put in a cage by them as punishment.

'''ABC News''' is the [[journalism|news]] division of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). Its flagship program is the daily evening newscast ''[[ABC World News Tonight|ABC World News Tonight with David Muir]]''; other programs include [[Breakfast television|morning news-talk show]] ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime]]'', and ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', and [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday morning political affairs]] program ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with George Stephanopoulos]]''.

==History==
===Early years===
ABC began news broadcasts early in its independent existence as a [[radio network]] after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ordered [[NBC]] to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] the former [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]] into an independent company in 1943.<ref>{{cite news|title=Red and Blue Networks of NBC To Be Split; WJZ May Be Sold|author=Thomas P. Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> The split (which NBC conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied) was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]] as the industry had only a few companies such as NBC and [[CBS]] that dominated the radio market, and in particular, was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Television [[History of television#United States and Canada|broadcasting was suspended]], however, during [[World War II]].

Regular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.

===Under Roone Arledge===
Only after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast \"model\", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic – Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>

ABC News' longtime slogan, \"More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source\" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>

In June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]]. Additionally, ABC News signed a multi-year content deal with AP for its affiliate video service [[Associated Press Television News]] (APTV) while providing material from ABC's news video service ABC News One to APTV.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|title=A.P.

===Modern era===
On August 7, 2014, ABC announced that it would relaunch its radio network division, [[ABC Audio|ABC Radio]], on January 1, 2015: the change occurred following the announcement that Cumulus would replace its ABC News radio service with [[Westwood One News]] (via [[CNN]]).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Venta|first1=Lance|title=ABC Radio to Expand Operations|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/89657/abc-radio-to-expand-operations/|accessdate=June 1, 2016|work=Radio Insight|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> On September 20, 2019, ABC Radio was renamed as ABC Audio as the network has evolved to offer a [[podcast]] portfolio and other forms of on-demand and linear content.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Lance |last1=Venta |title=ABC Radio Rebrands As ABC Audio |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/180635/abc-radio-rebrands-as-abc-audio/ |accessdate=January 15, 2020 |work=RadioInsight |date=September 20, 2019}}</ref>

On September 10, 2018, ABC News launched a second attempt to extend its Good Morning America brand into the afternoon with [[Strahan, Sara and Keke]].<ref name=vty0>{{cite news |last1=Steinberg |first1=Brian |title=Michael Strahan, Sara Haines Will Carry 'GMA' From Morning to Afternoon |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/michael-strahan-sara-haines-gma-day-good-morning-america-1202929220/ |accessdate=November 9, 2018 |work=Variety |date=September 6, 2018}}</ref> ABC News: Live steaming channel was launched on Roku in May 2019.<ref name=\"vty1\">{{cite news |last1=Roettgers |first1=Janko  |title=ABC Launches New 24/7 Online News Network 'ABC News Live' Exclusively on Roku Channel |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/abc-news-live-roku-1202783981/ |accessdate=15 January 2020 |work=Variety |date=24 April 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

===Former===

====Satellite News Channel====
{{main|Satellite News Channel}}
[[Satellite News Channel]] was a joint venture between ABC News and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] that started on June 21, 1982, as a satellite-delivered cable television network. SNC used footage from ABC News and seven [[Washington, D.C.]]-based crews, in addition to stories from other overseas networks to provide a rotating newscast every 20 minutes. However, this channel had difficulty getting clearance from cable systems, so ABC News and Group W decided to sell it to its competitor, [[CNN]] (a subsidiary of [[Time Warner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]]). CNN ceased Satellite News Channel's operations on October 27, 1983. SNC was either replaced by CNN or [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN2]] on most cable systems. Group W eventually shut down seven years later, in 1999. Following Satellite News Channel's discontinuation, ABC News did not return to the 24-hour cable news world until 22 years later, in 2004, when they launched [[ABC News Now]], whose launch indicated that Satellite News Channel was ABC News' first attempt in the 24-hour cable news world.

====''ABC News Now''====
{{main|ABC News Now}}
''[[ABC News Now]]'' was a [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[Cable television|cable]] [[News broadcasting|news]] [[Cable network|network]] that was launched on July 26, 2004 as a [[digital subchannel]] by ABC News, being the company's second attempt in the 24-hour cable news world after [[Satellite News Channel]]. It was offered via [[digital television]], [[broadband]] and [[Streaming media|streaming video]] at ABCNews.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.com|title=ABC News|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> and on [[mobile phones]]. It delivered [[breaking news]], headline news each half hour, and wide range of [[entertainment]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] [[Broadcast programming|programming]]. The channel was available in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Its Talk Back feature allowed viewers to voice their own input through the submission of videos and personal thoughts on controversial issues and current topics. It was shut down as a digital subchannel when after its experimental phase had ended with the President inauguration in 2005. ABC News Now was replaced on cable providers with [[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]] on October 28, 2013.

====Fusion====
{{main|Fusion TV}}
[[Fusion TV|Fusion]] is a [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] network that is owned & operated by [[Fusion Media Group]], LLC, which was a joint venture between ABC News and [[Univision Communications]].

==International broadcasts==
Several ABC News programs are broadcast daily on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]].

In [[Australia]], [[Sky News Australia]] airs daily broadcasts of ''World News Tonight'' (at 10:30&nbsp;a.m.) and ''Nightline'' (at 1:30&nbsp;a.m.) as well as weekly airings of ''20/20'' (on Wednesdays at 1:30&nbsp;p.m., with an extended version at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Sundays) and occasionally ''Primetime'' (at 1:30&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays, with extended edition at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Saturdays). Coincidentally, that country's [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], operates its own unrelated news division that is also named [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]. The U.S. ABC News maintains a content sharing agreement with the [[Nine Network]], which also broadcasts ''GMA'' domestically in the early morning before its own [[Today (Australian TV program)|breakfast program]].

In [[New Zealand]], ''ABC World News'' was broadcast daily at 5:10&nbsp;p.m. and at again at 11:35&nbsp;p.m. As with the BBC in the U.K., [[TVNZ 7]] (owned by [[Television New Zealand]]) aired the program commercial-free, until the channel ceased operations on June 30, 2012.

'''ABC News''' is the [[journalism|news]] division of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). Its flagship program is the daily evening newscast ''[[ABC World News Tonight|ABC World News Tonight with David Muir]]''; other programs include [[Breakfast television|morning news-talk show]] ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime]]'', and ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', and [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday morning political affairs]] program ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with George Stephanopoulos]]''.

==History==
===Early years===
ABC began news broadcasts early in its independent existence as a [[radio network]] after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ordered [[NBC]] to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] the former [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]] into an independent company in 1943.<ref>{{cite news|title=Red and Blue Networks of NBC To Be Split; WJZ May Be Sold|author=Thomas P. Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> The split (which NBC conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied) was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]] as the industry had only a few companies such as NBC and [[CBS]] that dominated the radio market, and in particular, was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Television [[History of television#United States and Canada|broadcasting was suspended]], however, during [[World War II]].

Regular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.

===Under Roone Arledge===
Only after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast \"model\", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic – Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>

ABC News' longtime slogan, \"More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source\" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>

In June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]]. Additionally, ABC News signed a multi-year content deal with AP for its affiliate video service [[Associated Press Television News]] (APTV) while providing material from ABC's news video service ABC News One to APTV.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|title=A.P.

===Modern era===
On August 7, 2014, ABC announced that it would relaunch its radio network division, [[ABC Audio|ABC Radio]], on January 1, 2015: the change occurred following the announcement that Cumulus would replace its ABC News radio service with [[Westwood One News]] (via [[CNN]]).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Venta|first1=Lance|title=ABC Radio to Expand Operations|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/89657/abc-radio-to-expand-operations/|accessdate=June 1, 2016|work=Radio Insight|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> On September 20, 2019, ABC Radio was renamed as ABC Audio as the network has evolved to offer a [[podcast]] portfolio and other forms of on-demand and linear content.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Lance |last1=Venta |title=ABC Radio Rebrands As ABC Audio |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/180635/abc-radio-rebrands-as-abc-audio/ |accessdate=January 15, 2020 |work=RadioInsight |date=September 20, 2019}}</ref>

====Satellite News Channel====
{{main|Satellite News Channel}}
[[Satellite News Channel]] was a joint venture between ABC News and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] that started on June 21, 1982, as a satellite-delivered cable television network. SNC used footage from ABC News and seven [[Washington, D.C.]]-based crews, in addition to stories from other overseas networks to provide a rotating newscast every 20 minutes. However, this channel had difficulty getting clearance from cable systems, so ABC News and Group W decided to sell it to its competitor, [[CNN]] (a subsidiary of [[Time Warner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]]). CNN ceased Satellite News Channel's operations on October 27, 1983. SNC was either replaced by CNN or [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN2]] on most cable systems. Group W eventually shut down seven years later, in 1999. Following Satellite News Channel's discontinuation, ABC News did not return to the 24-hour cable news world until 22 years later, in 2004, when they launched [[ABC News Now]], whose launch indicated that Satellite News Channel was ABC News' first attempt in the 24-hour cable news world.

It delivered [[breaking news]], headline news each half hour, and wide range of [[entertainment]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] [[Broadcast programming|programming]]. The channel was available in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Its Talk Back feature allowed viewers to voice their own input through the submission of videos and personal thoughts on controversial issues and current topics. It was shut down as a digital subchannel when after its experimental phase had ended with the President inauguration in 2005. ABC News Now was replaced on cable providers with [[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]] on October 28, 2013.

==International broadcasts==
Several ABC News programs are broadcast daily on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]].

In [[Australia]], [[Sky News Australia]] airs daily broadcasts of ''World News Tonight'' (at 10:30&nbsp;a.m.) and ''Nightline'' (at 1:30&nbsp;a.m.) as well as weekly airings of ''20/20'' (on Wednesdays at 1:30&nbsp;p.m., with an extended version at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Sundays) and occasionally ''Primetime'' (at 1:30&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays, with extended edition at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Saturdays). Coincidentally, that country's [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], operates its own unrelated news division that is also named [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]. The U.S. ABC News maintains a content sharing agreement with the [[Nine Network]], which also broadcasts ''GMA'' domestically in the early morning before its own [[Today (Australian TV program)|breakfast program]].

In [[New Zealand]], ''ABC World News'' was broadcast daily at 5:10&nbsp;p.m. and at again at 11:35&nbsp;p.m. As with the BBC in the U.K., [[TVNZ 7]] (owned by [[Television New Zealand]]) aired the program commercial-free, until the channel ceased operations on June 30, 2012.

==History==

[[File:Script Tree of India.jpg|thumb|Script Tree of India]]
[[File:Evolution of Oriya Language.jpg|thumb|A detailed chart depicting evolution of the Odia script as displayed in a museum at [[Ratnagiri, Odisha]]]]   
The name Oriya originated from Odra or Udra tribes that inhabited the central coastal belt (Khordha District and Nayagarh District) of modern Odisha. Odisha has also been the home of the Kalinga, Utkal, Mahakantara/Kantara and Kosal that played a particularly prominent role in the region's history, and one of the earliest references to the ancient Kalingas appears in the writings of Vedic chroniclers.[Refernce-Odisha Familypedia].
Odia is an [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan language]] belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family. It is thought to be directly descended from an Odra [[Magadhi Prakrit|Prakrit]], which was spoken in east India over 1,500 years ago, and is the primary language used in early [[Jainism|Jain]] texts.<ref name=\"The Harvard Lecture\">Misra, Bijoy (April 11, 2009). [http://www.odia.org/articles/harvardLecture.pdf Oriya Language and Literature] (PDF) (Lecture). Languages and Literature of India. Harvard University.</ref> Odia appears to have had relatively little influence from [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], compared to other major North Indian languages.

The history of the Odia language is divided into eras:

* Proto Odia (12th century and earlier): Inscriptions from 10th century onwards provide evidence for the existence of the Old Odia language, although the earliest known inscription that actually contains Odia lines is dated to 1249 CE.<ref>{{cite book |author=B. P.

* Late Middle Odia (1700–1850): ''Ushabhilasa'' of Sisu Sankara Das, the ''Rahasya Manjari'' of Deba Durlabha Dasa and the ''Rukmini Bibha'' of Kartika Dasa were written. A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.
* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.

===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===
The beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.

===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===
[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Morphology==
{{Main|Odia morphology}}
Odia retains most of the cases of [[Sanskrit]], though the nominative and vocative have merged (both without a separate marker), as have the accusative and dative. There are three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two grammatical numbers (singular and plural). There are three true tenses (present, past and future), others being formed with auxiliaries.

The earliest literature in Odia language can be traced to the Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|url = {{Google books|id=KYLpvaKJIMEC|plainurl=yes}}|publisher = Sahitya Akademi|date = 1997-01-01|isbn = 9788126003655}}</ref> Before Sarala Das, the most important works in Odia literature are the Shishu Veda, Saptanga, Amara Kosha, Rudrasudhanidhi, Kesaba Koili, Kalasha Chautisha etc.<ref name=\"patnaik 1989\" /><ref name=\"panda\" /><ref name=\"patnaik 1997\" /> In the 14th century, the poet [[Sarala Das]] wrote the Sarala Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, in praise of the goddess [[Durga]]. Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.

The following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.

However, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670–1720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.

The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841–43) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800–1997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta – 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>

Odia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.

Other eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].

Prose in the language has had a late development.

Three great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849–1908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843–1918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853–1912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).

Among the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924–1936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.

One of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907–1995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971–72 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.

One of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927–2002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.

20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875–1928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862–1924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877–1928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]], Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, [[Ramakanta Rath]], Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.

[[Anita Desai]]'s novella, ''Translator Translated'', from her collection ''The Art of Disappearance'', features a translator of a fictive Odia short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.

Four writers in Odia – [[Gopinath Mohanty]], [[Sachidananda Routray]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]] and [[Pratibha Ray]] – have been awarded the [[Jnanpith Award|Jnanpith]], a prestigious Indian literary award.

==History==

[[File:Script Tree of India.jpg|thumb|Script Tree of India]]
[[File:Evolution of Oriya Language.jpg|thumb|A detailed chart depicting evolution of the Odia script as displayed in a museum at [[Ratnagiri, Odisha]]]]

Odia is an [[List of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan language]] belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family. It is thought to be directly descended from an Odra [[Magadhi Prakrit|Prakrit]], which was spoken in east India over 1,500 years ago, and is the primary language used in early [[Jainism|Jain]] texts.<ref name=\"The Harvard Lecture\">Misra, Bijoy (April 11, 2009). [http://www.odia.org/articles/harvardLecture.pdf Oriya Language and Literature] (PDF) (Lecture). Languages and Literature of India. Harvard University.</ref> Odia appears to have had relatively little influence from [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], compared to other major North Indian languages.

The history of the Odia language is divided into eras:

* Proto Odia (12th century and earlier): Inscriptions from 10th century onwards provide evidence for the existence of the Old Odia language, although the earliest known inscription that actually contains Odia lines is dated to 1249 CE.<ref>{{cite book |author=B. P.

* Early Middle Odia (1200–1400): The earliest use of prose can be found in the ''[[Madala Panji]]'' of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple at Puri]], which dates back to the 12th century. Such works as ''Shishu Veda'', ''Amara Kosha'', ''Gorakha Samhita'', ''Kalasha Chautisha'', and ''Saptanga'' are written in this form of Odia.<ref name=\"patnaik 1989\">{{cite book |last= Patnaik |first=Durga|title=Palm Leaf Etchings of Orissa |year=1989 |publisher= Abhinav Publications |place=New Delhi |isbn= 978-8170172482 |url= {{Google books |id=90_qAeMT1bwC |page=11 |plainurl=yes}} |page=11}}</ref><ref name=\"panda\">{{cite book |last=Panda |first=Shishir |title= Medieval Orissa: A Socio-economic Study |year=1991 |publisher= Mittal Publications |place=New Delhi |isbn= 978-8170992615 |url={{Google books|id=C_LT5Q-f3YEC |page=106 |plainurl= yes}}|page=106}}</ref><ref name=\"patnaik 1997\">{{cite book |last= Patnaik |first=Nihar |title =Economic History of Orissa |year=1997 |publisher= Indus Publishing |place=New Delhi |isbn= 978-8173870750 |url= {{Google books |id= 1AA9W9_4Z9gC |page=149 |plainurl=yes}} |page= 149}}</ref>
* Middle Odia (1400–1700): [[Sarala Das]] writes the ''[[Vilanka Ramayana]]''.<ref name=\"Sukhdeva2002\">{{cite book |author=Sukhdeva |title=Living Thoughts of the Ramayana |url={{Google books|id=BMyxwk5g3NEC&pg=PT7|plainurl=yes}}|year=2002 |publisher=Jaico Publishing House |isbn=978-81-7992-002-2 |pages=7}}</ref><ref name=\"Mukherjee1998\">{{cite book |author=Sujit Mukherjee |title=A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850 |url={{Google books|id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&pg=PA420|plainurl=yes}}|date=1998 |publisher=Orient Blackswan |isbn=978-81-250-1453-9 |pages=420}}</ref> Towards the 16th century, poets emerged around the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] leader [[Acyutananda|Achyutananda]], These five poets are Balaram Das, [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Achyutananda, Ananta Dasa and Jasobanta Dasa.
* Late Middle Odia (1700–1850): ''Ushabhilasa'' of Sisu Sankara Das, the ''Rahasya Manjari'' of Deba Durlabha Dasa and the ''Rukmini Bibha'' of Kartika Dasa were written. A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.
* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.

===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===
The beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.

===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===
[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Morphology==
{{Main|Odia morphology}}
Odia retains most of the cases of [[Sanskrit]], though the nominative and vocative have merged (both without a separate marker), as have the accusative and dative. There are three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two grammatical numbers (singular and plural). There are three true tenses (present, past and future), others being formed with auxiliaries.

The earliest literature in Odia language can be traced to the Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|url = {{Google books|id=KYLpvaKJIMEC|plainurl=yes}}|publisher = Sahitya Akademi|date = 1997-01-01|isbn = 9788126003655}}</ref> Before Sarala Das, the most important works in Odia literature are the Shishu Veda, Saptanga, Amara Kosha, Rudrasudhanidhi, Kesaba Koili, Kalasha Chautisha etc.<ref name=\"patnaik 1989\" /><ref name=\"panda\" /><ref name=\"patnaik 1997\" /> In the 14th century, the poet [[Sarala Das]] wrote the Sarala Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, in praise of the goddess [[Durga]]. Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.

The following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.

However, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670–1720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.

The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841–43) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800–1997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta – 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>

Odia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.

Other eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].

Prose in the language has had a late development.

Three great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849–1908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843–1918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853–1912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).

Among the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924–1936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.

One of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907–1995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971–72 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.

One of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927–2002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.

20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875–1928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862–1924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877–1928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]], Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, [[Ramakanta Rath]], Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.

[[Anita Desai]]'s novella, ''Translator Translated'', from her collection ''The Art of Disappearance'', features a translator of a fictive Odia short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.

Four writers in Odia – [[Gopinath Mohanty]], [[Sachidananda Routray]], [[Sitakant Mahapatra]] and [[Pratibha Ray]] – have been awarded the [[Jnanpith Award|Jnanpith]], a prestigious Indian literary award.

On 17 September 2019, Barkley missed a vital penalty in a home [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] game against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]].

{short description|Low-power wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth SIG}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}
'''Bluetooth Low Energy''' ('''Bluetooth LE''', colloquially '''BLE''', formerly marketed as '''Bluetooth Smart'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310111443/https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-03-10|title=Bluetooth Smart or Version 4.0+ of the Bluetooth specification|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>) is a [[Personal area network|wireless personal area network]] technology designed and marketed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (Bluetooth SIG) aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, [[Physical fitness|fitness]], beacons,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |title=beacons |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024074548/http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> security, and home entertainment industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart.aspx|title=bluetooth.com: Bluetooth Smart|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>  It is independent of [[Bluetooth BR/EDR]] and has no compatibility, but BR/EDR and LE can coexist. The original specification was developed by Nokia in 2006 under the name Wibree<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/wibree.htm|title=Is Wibree going to rival Bluetooth?|date=2006-12-01|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>, which was integrated into Bluetooth 4.0 in December 2009 as Bluetooth Low Energy.  

Compared to [[Bluetooth|Classic Bluetooth]], Bluetooth Low Energy is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a [[#Radio_interface|similar communication range]]. Mobile operating systems including [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone]] and [[BlackBerry 10|BlackBerry]], as well as [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]], natively support Bluetooth Low Energy.

== Compatibility ==
Bluetooth Low Energy is distinct from the previous (often called \"classic\") [[Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate]] (BR/EDR) protocol, but the two protocols can both be supported by one device: the [[Bluetooth#Bluetooth 4.0 + LE|Bluetooth 4.0 specification]] permits devices to implement either or both of the LE and BR/EDR systems.

Bluetooth Low Energy uses the same [[ISM band|2.4&nbsp;GHz radio frequencies]] as classic Bluetooth, which allows dual-mode devices to share a single [[radio antenna]], but uses a simpler [[modulation]] system.

== Branding ==
[[File:Bluetooth Smart Logo.svg|right|thumb|300px|The previously used Bluetooth Smart logo]]
In 2011, the Bluetooth SIG announced the Bluetooth Smart logo so as to clarify compatibility between the new low energy devices and other Bluetooth devices.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Press-Releases-Detail.aspx?ItemID=138| title=Bluetooth SIG Extends Bluetooth Brand, Introduces Bluetooth Smart Marks| date=24 October 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203053330/http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Press-Releases-Detail.aspx?ItemID=138| publisher=[[Bluetooth SIG]]| archive-date=3 February 2015| accessdate=2016-01-31 }}</ref>

* Bluetooth Smart Ready indicates a dual-mode device compatible with both classic and low energy [[peripheral]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/bluetooth-brand/smart-marks-faqs| title=Bluetooth Smart Marks FAQ| publisher=[[Bluetooth SIG]]| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724115332/https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/bluetooth-brand/smart-marks-faqs| archive-date=24 July 2015| accessdate=2016-01-31}}</ref>
* Bluetooth Smart indicates a low energy-only device which requires either a Smart Ready or another [[Smart device]] in order to function.

With the May 2016 Bluetooth SIG branding information, the Bluetooth SIG began phasing out the Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready logos and word marks and reverted to using the Bluetooth logo and word mark<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/marketing-branding/brand-best-practices-guidelines|title=Brand Your Product - Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref> in a new blue color.

== Target market ==
The Bluetooth SIG identifies a number of markets for low energy technology, particularly in the smart home, health, sport and fitness sectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/market.aspx|title=Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref> Cited advantages include:
* low power requirements, operating for \"months or years\" on a [[button cell]]
* small size and low cost
* compatibility with a large [[installed base]] of mobile phones, tablets and computers

== History ==

The Bluetooth SIG released Mesh Profile and Mesh Model specifications officially on 18 July 2017. [[Bluetooth mesh networking|Mesh specification]] enables using Bluetooth Low Energy for many-to-many device communications for home automation, sensor networks and other applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2017/07/bluetooth-sig-announces-mesh-networking-capability|title=Bluetooth SIG Announces Mesh Networking Capability {{!}} Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.com|access-date=2017-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908061136/https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2017/07/bluetooth-sig-announces-mesh-networking-capability|archive-date=8 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Applications ==
Borrowing from the original Bluetooth specification, the Bluetooth SIG defines several [[Bluetooth profile|profiles]] — specifications for how a device works in a particular application — for low energy devices. Manufacturers are expected to implement the appropriate specifications for their device in order to ensure compatibility. A device may contain implementations of multiple profiles.

The majority of current low energy application profiles are based on the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT), a general specification for sending and receiving short pieces of data, known as attributes, over a low energy link.<ref>Bluetooth SIG [https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications Adopted specifications]</ref> The [[Bluetooth mesh]] profile is an exception to this rule, being based on the General Access Profile (GAP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/mesh|title=Bluetooth Mesh and the IOT|last=bluetooth|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref>

=== Mesh profiles ===
Bluetooth mesh profiles use Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with other Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the network. Each device can pass the information forward to other Bluetooth Low Energy devices creating a \"mesh\" effect. For example, switching off an entire building of lights from a single smartphone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/markets/smart-building|title=Smart Building - Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref>

* MESH (Mesh Profile) — for base mesh networking.
* MMDL ([[Bluetooth mesh networking#Mesh models|Mesh models]]) — for application layer definitions. Term \"model\" is used in mesh specifications instead of \"profile\" to avoid ambiguities.

=== Health care profiles ===
There are many profiles for Bluetooth Low Energy devices in healthcare applications. [[The Continua Health Alliance]] consortium promotes these in cooperation with the Bluetooth SIG.

* BLP (Blood Pressure Profile) — for blood pressure measurement.
* HTP (Health Thermometer Profile) — for medical temperature measurement devices.
* GLP (Glucose Profile) — for [[blood glucose]] monitors.
* CGMP (Continuous Glucose Monitor Profile)

=== Sports and fitness profiles ===
Profiles for sporting and fitness accessories include:
* BCS (Body Composition Service)
* CSCP (Cycling Speed and Cadence Profile) — for sensors attached to a [[bicycle]] or [[exercise bike]] to measure [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]] and wheel speed.
* CPP (Cycling Power Profile)
* HRP (Heart Rate Profile) — for devices which measure [[heart rate]]
* LNP (Location and Navigation Profile)
* RSCP (Running Speed and Cadence Profile) 
* WSP (Weight Scale Profile)

=== Internet connectivity ===
* IPSP (Internet Protocol Support Profile)

=== Generic sensors ===
* ESP (Environmental Sensing Profile)
* UDS (User Data Service)

=== HID connectivity ===
* HOGP ([[Human interface device|HID]] over GATT Profile) allowing Bluetooth LE-enabled Wireless mice, keyboards and other devices offering long-lasting battery life.

=== Proximity sensing ===
\"[[Electronic leash]]\" applications are well suited to the long battery life possible for 'always-on' devices.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gsm-modem.de/M2M/m2m-apps/casio-bluetooth-low-energy-watch/|title=Casio Bluetooth Low Energy Watch communicates with smartphones|date=2011-03-07|work=M2M / IoT hints and tips|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref> Manufacturers of [[iBeacon]] devices implement the appropriate specifications for their device to make use of proximity sensing capabilities supported by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS devices]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/19/inside-ios-7-ibeacons-enhance-apps-location-awareness-via-bluetooth-le|title=Inside iOS 7: iBeacons enhance apps' location awareness via Bluetooth LE|website=AppleInsider|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref>

Relevant application profiles include:
* FMP — the \"find me\" profile — allows one device to issue an alert on a second misplaced device.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=239389|title=Find Me Profile specification|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.org}}</ref>
* PXP — the proximity profile — allows a proximity monitor to detect whether a proximity reporter is within a close range. Physical proximity can be estimated using the radio receiver's [[RSSI]] value, although this does not have absolute calibration of distances. Typically, an alarm may be sounded when the distance between the devices exceeds a set threshold.

=== Alerts and time profiles ===
* The phone alert status profile and alert notification profile allow a client device to receive notifications such as incoming call alerts from another device.
* The time profile allows current time and [[time zone]] information on a client device to be set from a server device, such as between a wristwatch and a mobile phone's [[Network Time Protocol|network time]].

=== Battery ===

* The Battery Service exposes the Battery State and Battery Level of a single battery or set of batteries in a device.

=== Audio ===
Announced in January 2020, LE Audio will allow the protocol to carry sound and add features such as one set of headphones connecting to multiple audio sources or multiple headphones connecting to one source<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/bluetooth-le-audio/|title=The New Version of Bluetooth Is Here to Fix Your Headphones|work=Wired|access-date=2020-02-03|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/06/bluetooth-sig-debuts-le-audio/|title=Bluetooth SIG Announces 'LE Audio' With Audio Sharing, Lower Data Consumption, Hearing Aid Support and More|last=Clover|first=Juli|website=www.macrumors.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> it will also add support for hearing aids<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://source.android.com/devices/bluetooth/asha|title=Hearing Aid Audio Support Using Bluetooth LE|website=Android Open Source Project|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>.

== Implementation ==

=== Chip ===
Starting in late 2009, Bluetooth Low Energy [[integrated circuits]] were announced by a number of manufacturers. These ICs commonly use [[software radio]] so updates to the specification can be accommodated through a [[firmware]] upgrade.

=== Hardware ===
Current mobile devices are commonly released with hardware and software support for both classic Bluetooth and the Bluetooth Low Energy.

== Technical details ==

=== Radio interface ===
Bluetooth Low Energy technology operates in the same spectrum range (the 2.400–2.4835&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]]) as classic Bluetooth technology, but uses a different set of channels. Instead of the classic Bluetooth seventy-nine 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has forty 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].

Bluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[ETSI]] classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].<ref>Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 \"Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects\"], April 2011</ref>

More technical details may be obtained from official specification as published by the Bluetooth SIG. Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification.

=== Advertising and discovery ===
BLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.

The discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models<ref>{{Cite journal|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=|year=2017|last1=Kindt|first1=Philipp H.}}</ref> for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

===Security ===
     
Bluetooth LE comes with very low, and in many cases broken security. BTLE or Bluetooth Smart, is a new modulation mode and link layer packet format targeting low powered devices and is found in recent high-end smart phones, sports devices, sensors, and will soon appear in many medical devices. Unfortunately the security implementation is broken with the encryption of any Bluetooth LE Energy link easily being rendered useless. This flaw in security can allow any device nearby to eavesdrop on Bluetooth Low Energy conversations. This includes packets being intercepted and reassembled into connection streams, as well as injection attacks.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarkar|first1=Sopan|last2=Liu|first2=Jianqing|last3=Jovanov|first3=Emil|title=A Robust Algorithm for Sniffing BLE Long-Lived Connections in Real-Time|journal=2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)|year=2019|pages=1–6|doi=10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014318}}</ref><!--Paragraph is section simply recopied on 13 Apr 20 after deletion in 2014, needs updating and expanding, see Talk.

Bluetooth LE has been suggested as the basis of an app for tracing contacts of people during the [[Covid pandemic]] of 2020, silently tracking other phones which come within BT LE range of a person's phone, allowing those who have been in sustained proximity with a possibly infected person to be notified without identifying the person. However, a draft government memo said that ministers might be given the ability to identify people from their mobile phones, which has been criticised as a potential security breach.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users |title=NHS coronavirus app: memo discussed giving ministers power to 'de-anonymise' users |newspaper=The Guardian|author1=David Pegg|author2=Paul Lewis|date= 13 April 2020}}</ref>

=== Software model ===
All Bluetooth Low Energy devices use the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.<ref>See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework</ref> GATT has the following terminology:

;Client
:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.
;Server
:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.
;Characteristic
:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.
;Service
:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.
;Descriptor
:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional – each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.

Some service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes – for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.

==== Identifiers ====

Services, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''{{not a typo|xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}}'' <ref>See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''</ref>) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than {{not a typo|0000180A-0000-1000-}}... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/ Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.

==== GATT operations ====

The GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:
* Discover UUIDs for all primary services
* Find a service with a given UUID
* Find secondary services for a given primary service
* Discover all characteristics for a given service
* Find characteristics matching a given UUID
* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic

Commands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:
* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).
* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.
* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.

Finally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.

An ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.

[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>]]

Bluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices to have very low power consumption. Several chipmakers including [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]], [[Dialog Semiconductor]], [[Nordic Semiconductor]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Labs]] and [[Texas Instruments]] had introduced Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets by 2014. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company [[Aislelabs]] reported that peripherals such as proximity beacons usually function for 1–2 years powered by a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> This is possible because of the power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol, which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.

In contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and the number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> With newer chipsets and advances in software, by 2014 both Android and iOS phones had negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>

=== 2M PHY ===
Bluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled [[symbol rate]]. Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from about 1&nbsp;MHz to about 2&nbsp;MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40&nbsp;channels spaced at a distance of 2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=edn2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459086/Bluetooth-5--More-speeds--more-range--new-RF-tests|title=Bluetooth 5: More speeds, more range, new RF tests|author=Allen Henley|date=2017-11-21|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref> This is an essential differences over Bluetooth 2 EDR which did also double the data rate but it is doing that by employing a π/4-DQPSK or 8-DPSK [[phase modulation]] on a 1&nbsp;MhZ channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying.

The traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station (at a few meters).

=== LE Coded ===
Bluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new \"Coded PHY\" is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S=2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S=2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P=1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S=8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P=4 producing contrasting symbol sequences - a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/long-distance-bluetooth-low-energy-bit-data-paths/|title=What is Bluetooth 5? Learn about the Bit Paths Behind the New BLE Standard|author=Mark Hughes}}</ref> In mode S=2 using P=1 the range doubles approximately, while in mode S=8 using P=4 it does quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/exploring-bluetooth-5-going-the-distance/|title=Exploring Bluetooth 5 -Going the Distance|first=Martin|last=Woolley|date=13 February 2017|website=Bluetooth Technology Website}}</ref>

The \"LE Coded\" transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new package format. Each \"LE Coded\" burst consists of three blocks. The switch block (\"extended preamble\") is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it does only consist of 10 times a binaryr '00111100' pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block (\"FEC Block 1\") which is always transmitted in S=8 mode. The header block does only contain the destination address (\"Access Address\" / 32 bit) and an encoding flag (\"Coding Indicator\" / 2 Bit). The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block (\"FEC Block 2\") where S=2 is possible.<ref name=edn2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459130/Bluetooth-5-variations-complicate-PHY-testing|title=Bluetooth 5 variations complicate PHY testing|author=Dorine Gurney|date=2018-01-29|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref>

The new package format of Bluetooth 5 allows to transmit from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled range - at the same transmission power - is achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eight with 125&nbsp;kBit. The old transmission package format, as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes, has been named \"Uncoded\" in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate \"LE Coded\" S=2 mode allows for a  500&nbsp;kBit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.

'''Bluetooth Low Energy''' ('''Bluetooth LE''', colloquially '''BLE''', formerly marketed as '''Bluetooth Smart'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310111443/https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-03-10|title=Bluetooth Smart or Version 4.0+ of the Bluetooth specification|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>) is a [[Personal area network|wireless personal area network]] technology designed and marketed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (Bluetooth SIG) aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, [[Physical fitness|fitness]], beacons,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |title=beacons |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024074548/http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> security, and home entertainment industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart.aspx|title=bluetooth.com: Bluetooth Smart|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>  It is independent of [[Bluetooth BR/EDR]] and has no compatibility, but BR/EDR and LE can coexist. The original specification was developed by Nokia in 2006 under the name Wibree<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/wibree.htm|title=Is Wibree going to rival Bluetooth?|date=2006-12-01|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>, which was integrated into Bluetooth 4.0 in December 2009 as Bluetooth Low Energy.  

Compared to [[Bluetooth|Classic Bluetooth]], Bluetooth Low Energy is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a [[#Radio_interface|similar communication range]]. Mobile operating systems including [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone]] and [[BlackBerry 10|BlackBerry]], as well as [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]], natively support Bluetooth Low Energy. 

== Compatibility ==
Bluetooth Low Energy is distinct from the previous (often called \"classic\") [[Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate]] (BR/EDR) protocol, but the two protocols can both be supported by one device: the [[Bluetooth#Bluetooth 4.0 + LE|Bluetooth 4.0 specification]] permits devices to implement either or both of the LE and BR/EDR systems.

Bluetooth Low Energy uses the same [[ISM band|2.4&nbsp;GHz radio frequencies]] as classic Bluetooth, which allows dual-mode devices to share a single [[radio antenna]], but uses a simpler [[modulation]] system.

== Branding ==
[[File:Bluetooth Smart Logo.svg|right|thumb|300px|The previously used Bluetooth Smart logo]]
In 2011, the Bluetooth SIG announced the Bluetooth Smart logo so as to clarify compatibility between the new low energy devices and other Bluetooth devices.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Press-Releases-Detail.aspx?ItemID=138| title=Bluetooth SIG Extends Bluetooth Brand, Introduces Bluetooth Smart Marks| date=24 October 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203053330/http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Press-Releases-Detail.aspx?ItemID=138| publisher=[[Bluetooth SIG]]| archive-date=3 February 2015| accessdate=2016-01-31 }}</ref>

* Bluetooth Smart indicates a low energy-only device which requires either a Smart Ready or another [[Smart device]] in order to function.

With the May 2016 Bluetooth SIG branding information, the Bluetooth SIG began phasing out the Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready logos and word marks and reverted to using the Bluetooth logo and word mark<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/marketing-branding/brand-best-practices-guidelines|title=Brand Your Product - Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref> in a new blue color.

== Target market ==
The Bluetooth SIG identifies a number of markets for low energy technology, particularly in the smart home, health, sport and fitness sectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/market.aspx|title=Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref> Cited advantages include:
* low power requirements, operating for \"months or years\" on a [[button cell]]
* small size and low cost
* compatibility with a large [[installed base]] of mobile phones, tablets and computers

The Bluetooth SIG officially unveiled Bluetooth 5 on 16 June 2016 during a media event in London. One change on the marketing side is that the point number was dropped, so it now just called Bluetooth 5 (and not Bluetooth 5.0 or 5.0 LE like for Bluetooth 4.0). This decision was made to \"simplifying marketing, and communicating user benefits more effectively\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnx-software.com/2016/06/10/bluetooth-5-promises-four-times-the-speed-twice-the-range-of-bluetooth-4-0-le-transmissions/|title=Bluetooth 5 Promises Four times the Range, Twice the Speed of Bluetooth 4.0 LE Transmissions|website=www.cnx-software.com|access-date=2017-11-08|date=10 June 2016}}</ref> On the technical side, Bluetooth 5 will quadruple the range by using increased transmit power or coded physical layer, double the speed by using optional half of the symbol time compared to Bluetooth 4.x, and provide an eight-fold increase in data broadcasting capacity by increasing the advertising data length{{clarify|date=May 2017}} of low energy Bluetooth transmissions compared to Bluetooth 4.x, which could be important for [[Internet of things|IoT]] applications where nodes are connected throughout a whole house.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2016/06/16/-bluetooth-5-quadruples-rangedoubles-speedincreases-data-broadcasting-capacity-by-800|title=Bluetooth® 5 Quadruples Range, Doubles Speed, Increases Data Broadcasting Capacity by 800% {{!}} Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.com|access-date=2017-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209055417/https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2016/06/16/-bluetooth-5-quadruples-rangedoubles-speedincreases-data-broadcasting-capacity-by-800|archive-date=9 December 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Bluetooth SIG released Mesh Profile and Mesh Model specifications officially on 18 July 2017. [[Bluetooth mesh networking|Mesh specification]] enables using Bluetooth Low Energy for many-to-many device communications for home automation, sensor networks and other applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2017/07/bluetooth-sig-announces-mesh-networking-capability|title=Bluetooth SIG Announces Mesh Networking Capability {{!}} Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.com|access-date=2017-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908061136/https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2017/07/bluetooth-sig-announces-mesh-networking-capability|archive-date=8 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Applications ==
Borrowing from the original Bluetooth specification, the Bluetooth SIG defines several [[Bluetooth profile|profiles]] — specifications for how a device works in a particular application — for low energy devices. Manufacturers are expected to implement the appropriate specifications for their device in order to ensure compatibility. A device may contain implementations of multiple profiles.

The majority of current low energy application profiles are based on the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT), a general specification for sending and receiving short pieces of data, known as attributes, over a low energy link.<ref>Bluetooth SIG [https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications Adopted specifications]</ref> The [[Bluetooth mesh]] profile is an exception to this rule, being based on the General Access Profile (GAP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/mesh|title=Bluetooth Mesh and the IOT|last=bluetooth|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref>

=== Mesh profiles ===
Bluetooth mesh profiles use Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with other Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the network. Each device can pass the information forward to other Bluetooth Low Energy devices creating a \"mesh\" effect. For example, switching off an entire building of lights from a single smartphone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/markets/smart-building|title=Smart Building - Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref>

* MESH (Mesh Profile) — for base mesh networking.
* MMDL ([[Bluetooth mesh networking#Mesh models|Mesh models]]) — for application layer definitions. Term \"model\" is used in mesh specifications instead of \"profile\" to avoid ambiguities.

=== Health care profiles ===
There are many profiles for Bluetooth Low Energy devices in healthcare applications. [[The Continua Health Alliance]] consortium promotes these in cooperation with the Bluetooth SIG.

* BLP (Blood Pressure Profile) — for blood pressure measurement.
* HTP (Health Thermometer Profile) — for medical temperature measurement devices.
* GLP (Glucose Profile) — for [[blood glucose]] monitors.
* CGMP (Continuous Glucose Monitor Profile)

=== Sports and fitness profiles ===
Profiles for sporting and fitness accessories include:
* BCS (Body Composition Service)
* CSCP (Cycling Speed and Cadence Profile) — for sensors attached to a [[bicycle]] or [[exercise bike]] to measure [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]] and wheel speed.
* CPP (Cycling Power Profile)
* HRP (Heart Rate Profile) — for devices which measure [[heart rate]]
* LNP (Location and Navigation Profile)
* RSCP (Running Speed and Cadence Profile) 
* WSP (Weight Scale Profile)

=== Internet connectivity ===
* IPSP (Internet Protocol Support Profile)

=== Generic sensors ===
* ESP (Environmental Sensing Profile)
* UDS (User Data Service)

=== HID connectivity ===
* HOGP ([[Human interface device|HID]] over GATT Profile) allowing Bluetooth LE-enabled Wireless mice, keyboards and other devices offering long-lasting battery life.

=== Proximity sensing ===
\"[[Electronic leash]]\" applications are well suited to the long battery life possible for 'always-on' devices.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gsm-modem.de/M2M/m2m-apps/casio-bluetooth-low-energy-watch/|title=Casio Bluetooth Low Energy Watch communicates with smartphones|date=2011-03-07|work=M2M / IoT hints and tips|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref> Manufacturers of [[iBeacon]] devices implement the appropriate specifications for their device to make use of proximity sensing capabilities supported by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS devices]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/19/inside-ios-7-ibeacons-enhance-apps-location-awareness-via-bluetooth-le|title=Inside iOS 7: iBeacons enhance apps' location awareness via Bluetooth LE|website=AppleInsider|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref>

Relevant application profiles include:
* FMP — the \"find me\" profile — allows one device to issue an alert on a second misplaced device.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=239389|title=Find Me Profile specification|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.org}}</ref>
* PXP — the proximity profile — allows a proximity monitor to detect whether a proximity reporter is within a close range. Physical proximity can be estimated using the radio receiver's [[RSSI]] value, although this does not have absolute calibration of distances. Typically, an alarm may be sounded when the distance between the devices exceeds a set threshold.

=== Alerts and time profiles ===
* The phone alert status profile and alert notification profile allow a client device to receive notifications such as incoming call alerts from another device.
* The time profile allows current time and [[time zone]] information on a client device to be set from a server device, such as between a wristwatch and a mobile phone's [[Network Time Protocol|network time]].

=== Battery ===

* The Battery Service exposes the Battery State and Battery Level of a single battery or set of batteries in a device.

=== Audio ===
Announced in January 2020, LE Audio will allow the protocol to carry sound and add features such as one set of headphones connecting to multiple audio sources or multiple headphones connecting to one source<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/bluetooth-le-audio/|title=The New Version of Bluetooth Is Here to Fix Your Headphones|work=Wired|access-date=2020-02-03|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/06/bluetooth-sig-debuts-le-audio/|title=Bluetooth SIG Announces 'LE Audio' With Audio Sharing, Lower Data Consumption, Hearing Aid Support and More|last=Clover|first=Juli|website=www.macrumors.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> it will also add support for hearing aids<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://source.android.com/devices/bluetooth/asha|title=Hearing Aid Audio Support Using Bluetooth LE|website=Android Open Source Project|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>.

== Implementation ==

=== Chip ===
Starting in late 2009, Bluetooth Low Energy [[integrated circuits]] were announced by a number of manufacturers. These ICs commonly use [[software radio]] so updates to the specification can be accommodated through a [[firmware]] upgrade.

=== Hardware ===
Current mobile devices are commonly released with hardware and software support for both classic Bluetooth and the Bluetooth Low Energy.

== Technical details ==

=== Radio interface ===
Bluetooth Low Energy technology operates in the same spectrum range (the 2.400–2.4835&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]]) as classic Bluetooth technology, but uses a different set of channels. Instead of the classic Bluetooth seventy-nine 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has forty 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].

Bluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[ETSI]] classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].<ref>Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 \"Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects\"], April 2011</ref>

=== Advertising and discovery ===
BLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.

The discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models<ref>{{Cite journal|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=|year=2017|last1=Kindt|first1=Philipp H.}}</ref> for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

===Security ===
     
Bluetooth LE comes with very low, and in many cases broken security. BTLE or Bluetooth Smart, is a new modulation mode and link layer packet format targeting low powered devices and is found in recent high-end smart phones, sports devices, sensors, and will soon appear in many medical devices. Unfortunately the security implementation is broken with the encryption of any Bluetooth LE Energy link easily being rendered useless. This flaw in security can allow any device nearby to eavesdrop on Bluetooth Low Energy conversations. This includes packets being intercepted and reassembled into connection streams, as well as injection attacks.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarkar|first1=Sopan|last2=Liu|first2=Jianqing|last3=Jovanov|first3=Emil|title=A Robust Algorithm for Sniffing BLE Long-Lived Connections in Real-Time|journal=2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)|year=2019|pages=1–6|doi=10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014318}}</ref><!--Paragraph is section simply recopied on 13 Apr 20 after deletion in 2014, needs updating and expanding, see Talk.

Bluetooth LE has been suggested as the basis of an app for tracing contacts of people during the [[Covid pandemic]] of 2020, silently tracking other phones which come within BT LE range of a person's phone, allowing those who have been in sustained proximity with a possibly infected person to be notified without identifying the person. However, a draft government memo said that ministers might be given the ability to identify people from their mobile phones, which has been criticised as a potential security breach.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/nhs-coronavirus-app-memo-discussed-giving-ministers-power-to-de-anonymise-users |title=NHS coronavirus app: memo discussed giving ministers power to 'de-anonymise' users |newspaper=The Guardian|author1=David Pegg|author2=Paul Lewis|date= 13 April 2020}}</ref>

=== Software model ===
All Bluetooth Low Energy devices use the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.<ref>See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework</ref> GATT has the following terminology:

;Client
:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.
;Server
:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.
;Characteristic
:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.
;Service
:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.
;Descriptor
:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional – each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.

Some service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes – for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.

==== Identifiers ====

Services, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''{{not a typo|xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}}'' <ref>See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''</ref>) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than {{not a typo|0000180A-0000-1000-}}... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/ Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.

==== GATT operations ====

The GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:
* Discover UUIDs for all primary services
* Find a service with a given UUID
* Find secondary services for a given primary service
* Discover all characteristics for a given service
* Find characteristics matching a given UUID
* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic

Commands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:
* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).
* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.
* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.

Finally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.

An ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.

==== Battery impact ====

[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>]]

Bluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices to have very low power consumption. Several chipmakers including [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]], [[Dialog Semiconductor]], [[Nordic Semiconductor]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Labs]] and [[Texas Instruments]] had introduced Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets by 2014. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company [[Aislelabs]] reported that peripherals such as proximity beacons usually function for 1–2 years powered by a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> This is possible because of the power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol, which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.

In contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and the number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> With newer chipsets and advances in software, by 2014 both Android and iOS phones had negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>

=== 2M PHY ===
Bluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled [[symbol rate]]. Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from about 1&nbsp;MHz to about 2&nbsp;MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40&nbsp;channels spaced at a distance of 2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=edn2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459086/Bluetooth-5--More-speeds--more-range--new-RF-tests|title=Bluetooth 5: More speeds, more range, new RF tests|author=Allen Henley|date=2017-11-21|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref> This is an essential differences over Bluetooth 2 EDR which did also double the data rate but it is doing that by employing a π/4-DQPSK or 8-DPSK [[phase modulation]] on a 1&nbsp;MhZ channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying.

The traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station (at a few meters).

=== LE Coded ===
Bluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new \"Coded PHY\" is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S=2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S=2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P=1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S=8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P=4 producing contrasting symbol sequences - a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/long-distance-bluetooth-low-energy-bit-data-paths/|title=What is Bluetooth 5? Learn about the Bit Paths Behind the New BLE Standard|author=Mark Hughes}}</ref> In mode S=2 using P=1 the range doubles approximately, while in mode S=8 using P=4 it does quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/exploring-bluetooth-5-going-the-distance/|title=Exploring Bluetooth 5 -Going the Distance|first=Martin|last=Woolley|date=13 February 2017|website=Bluetooth Technology Website}}</ref>

The \"LE Coded\" transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new package format. Each \"LE Coded\" burst consists of three blocks. The switch block (\"extended preamble\") is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it does only consist of 10 times a binaryr '00111100' pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block (\"FEC Block 1\") which is always transmitted in S=8 mode. The header block does only contain the destination address (\"Access Address\" / 32 bit) and an encoding flag (\"Coding Indicator\" / 2 Bit). The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block (\"FEC Block 2\") where S=2 is possible.<ref name=edn2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459130/Bluetooth-5-variations-complicate-PHY-testing|title=Bluetooth 5 variations complicate PHY testing|author=Dorine Gurney|date=2018-01-29|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref>

The new package format of Bluetooth 5 allows to transmit from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled range - at the same transmission power - is achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eight with 125&nbsp;kBit. The old transmission package format, as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes, has been named \"Uncoded\" in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate \"LE Coded\" S=2 mode allows for a  500&nbsp;kBit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.

'''Richard Edward Donovan''' (December 27, 1927 – January 6, 1997) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] who played for the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] (1950–1952), [[Detroit Tigers]] (1954), [[Chicago White Sox]] (1955–1960), [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] (1961) and [[Cleveland Indians]] (1962–1965). He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.

A [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 [[winning percentage]] in 1957, going 16–6, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and was moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10–10. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.

Donovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.

==Early life==
Donovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until his senior year, when he switched positions and became a [[pitcher]]. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an [[exhibition game]]. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching attracted the attention of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher” he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school. Donovan graduated during [[World War II]], though, and he served three years in the [[United States Navy]] before beginning his professional career in 1947.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>

==Career==
===Early years===
Donovan's career started far south of his home, with the [[Fort Lauderdale Braves]] of the [[Class C (baseball)|Class C]] [[Florida International League]]. He had a 7–15 [[Win-loss record (pitching)|record]] and a 4.17 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in his first professional season but still got promoted to the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Evansville Braves]] of the [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]]. With Evansville in 1948, he had a 12–9 record and a 3.08 ERA.<ref name=\"minors\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=donova001ric|title=Dick Donovan Minor Leagues Statistics & History|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He moved on to the [[Hartford Chiefs]] of the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] in 1949, posting a 12–6 record and a 2.66 ERA and earning a promotion to the [[Class AAA (baseball)|Class AAA]] [[Milwaukee Brewers (American Association)|Milwaukee Brewers]] of the [[American Association (20th Century)|American Association]], the Braves' top farm team, for a couple games.<ref name=\"minors\"/> 

By 1950, Donovan was one of three rookie pitching prospects looking to make it with the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]], along with [[Norman Roy]] and George Uhle, Jr. The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' wrote, \"The best of the prospects seems to be Roy, who had a great year in 1949 at Milwaukee.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Vince|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19500103&id=m9gNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1483,634622&hl=en|title=Once Over Lightly|work=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=January 3, 1950|accessdate=March 22, 2020|page=15}}</ref> Uhle apparently got hurt (he only appeared in four games in the minors that year and never pitched again), but Roy and Donovan both made the Braves out of [[spring training]], Donovan as a starter.<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=royno01&t=p&year=1950|title=Normie Roy 1950 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He made his major league debut on April 24, giving up six [[Run (baseball)|runs]] (five earned) in {{frac|6|2|3}} [[Innings pitched|innings]] and taking the loss in a 6–4 defeat to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BSN/BSN195004240.shtml|title=Brooklyn Dodgers at Boston Braves Box Score, April 24, 1950|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan lost his next start, moved to the bullpen, then went to Milwaukee after appearing in two more games.<ref name=\"1950 Donovan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=donovdi01&t=p&year=1950|title=Dick Donovan 1950 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He was called up in June and in September but spent most of the rest of the year in the minors.<ref name=\"1950 Donovan\"/> In 10 games (three starts) his rookie year, Donovan had an 0–2 record, an 8.19 ERA, nine [[strikeout]]s, and 34 [[Walk (baseball)|walks]] in {{frac|29|2|3}} innings.<ref name=\"reference\"/> His numbers were not much better at Milwaukee, where in 19 games (10 starts) he had a 3–6 record, a 6.24 ERA, 44 strikeouts, and 33 walks in 75 innings.<ref name=\"minors\"/>

In 1951, Donovan started the season with the Braves again but was again moved to the bullpen after two starts.<ref name=\"1951 Donovan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=donova001ric|title=Dick Donovan 1951 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He had a 5.27 ERA (with no record) in eight games with the Braves and did not appear for them after June 5.<ref name=\"1951 Donovan\"/> Spending most of the season with Milwaukee, Donovan had more success with the Brewers in 1951. He had a 7–5 record, a 3.28 ERA, 88 strikeouts, and 59 walks in 129 innings, and he helped the Brewers win the American Association pennant.<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref name=\"minors\"/> However, he did not pitch for the Braves in September.<ref name=\"1951 Donovan\"/>

Similarly to his previous two years, Donovan started the season with the Braves, then spent most of the year in Milwaukee, with the exception of a brief call-up in late May to early June. In his only two starts, he gave up six runs in one and was pulled from the game in the other after walking the first three hitters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=donovdi01&t=p&year=1952|title=Dick Donovan 1952 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He had a 5.54 ERA and an 0–2 record with the Braves. With Milwaukee, he appeared in 16 games (12 starts), posting a 4–6 record, a 4.55 ERA, 36 strikeouts, and 43 walks in 91 innings.<ref name=\"minors\"/>

Donovan hoped to remain in Milwaukee for the 1953 season, because the Braves moved there from Boston. However, he failed to make the team out of spring training this time, and the Braves tried to send him to their new AAA affiliate, the [[Toledo Mud Hens]]. Fearing he would remain in the minor leagues, Donovan requested a trade. “I believed I could win in the major leagues and wanted a chance to prove it,\" he said.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> [[John Quinn (baseball executive)|John Quinn]] denied his request at first, then made him available, but he rejected all deals other teams tried to make for Donovan. Finally, [[Gene Mauch]], Donovan's former roommate and manager of the Braves' [[Class AA (baseball)|Class AA]] affiliate, convinced Donovan to come play for the [[Atlanta Crackers]] of the [[Southern Association]].<ref name=\"SABR\"/>

\"That was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Donovan said of getting sent to Atlanta. “It brought me under the wing of [[Whitlow Wyatt|[Whitlow] Wyatt]].\"<ref name=\"SABR\"/> A former pitcher for the Dodgers, Wyatt taught Donovan how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] while the [[Prospect (sports)|prospect]] was at Atlanta.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> Donovan appeared in 32 games (19 starts) for Atlanta, posting an 11–8 record, a 3.71 ERA, 132 strikeouts, and 51 walks in 182 innings.<ref name=\"minors\"/> He got his wish after the season, when the Braves sold his contract to the [[Detroit Tigers]].<ref name=\"reference\"/> Donovan made the Tigers out of spring training but only appeared in two games before Detroit returned him to the Braves on May 13.<ref name=\"reference\"/> He was happy to accept another assignment to Atlanta, where Wyatt was now the manager.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> He responded with his best minor league season yet. In 27 games (all starts) for Atlanta, he had an 18–8 record and a 2.69 ERA for the team. Donovan also managed to hit well for the Crackers, slugging 12 [[home run]]s and having 32 [[runs batted in]]. The Crackers won the Southern Association pennant, and Donovan was named their Most Valuable Player.<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref>{{Cite web|last=Skelton|first=David E. |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/9a7e6a05 |title=Pete Burnside|work=SABR|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref> After the minor league season, the [[Chicago White Sox]] purchased his contract from Milwaukee.<ref name=\"reference\"/>

It will be nice to take it easy if I don’t go with another club.”<ref name=\"SABR\"/>

During a 15-year major league career, Donovan compiled 122 wins, 880 strikeouts, and a 3.67 ERA, with 101 complete games, 25 shutouts and five saves. In 2,017<small>{{fraction|1|3}}</small> innings pitched, he allowed 1,988 hits and 495 walks.<ref name=\"reference\"/> 

==Playing style==
Donovan threw three pitches: a [[fastball]], a [[curveball]], and a slider. He learned the slider while pitching for Atlanta, when coach and later manager Whitlow Wyatt helped teach it to him.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> In 1955, when he finally stuck in a major league team's rotation, ''Sports Illustrated'' called it \"one of the most effective pitches in baseball.\"<ref name=\"slider\"/> Among pitchers, Donovan was also an unusually gifted hitter. In 1954, he was the team MVP for Atlanta after hitting 12 home runs and driving in 38 runs in only 27 games.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> With the White Sox, he was frequently used as a pinch-hitter. At the plate in his 15-year major league career, Donovan posted a .163 batting average (113-for-694) with 67 runs, 15 home runs, 64 RBI, and 64 walks.<ref name=\"reference\"/>

==Personal life==
On February 7, 1959, Donovan married Patricia Casey, a [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], Massachusetts, resident who was a stewardess for [[United Airlines]]. The couple had two children, Peter and Amy. His friend Wyatt gave him the idea to sell insurance, and Donovan had a home business selling insurance during his MLB career. In 1963, he earned his stockbroker's license and joined the Boston-based firm Eastman & Dillon. After his baseball career, he served as the executive vice president for [[Bache & Co.]]. In 1980, he opened a real estate appraisal office in Quincy, which he ran until 1994. Additionally, Donovan served as distributor with Earth Care Products, a Quincy company that makes products out of recycled plastic. He died from cancer on January 6, 1997.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>

'''Richard Edward Donovan''' (December 27, 1927 – January 6, 1997) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] who played for the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] (1950–1952), [[Detroit Tigers]] (1954), [[Chicago White Sox]] (1955–1960), [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] (1961) and [[Cleveland Indians]] (1962–1965). He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.

A [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 [[winning percentage]] in 1957, going 16–6, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and was moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10–10. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.

Donovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.

==Early life==
Donovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until his senior year, when he switched positions and became a [[pitcher]]. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an [[exhibition game]]. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching attracted the attention of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher” he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school. Donovan graduated during [[World War II]], though, and he served three years in the [[United States Navy]] before beginning his professional career in 1947.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>

==Career==
===Early years===
Donovan's career started far south of his home, with the [[Fort Lauderdale Braves]] of the [[Class C (baseball)|Class C]] [[Florida International League]]. He had a 7–15 [[Win-loss record (pitching)|record]] and a 4.17 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in his first professional season but still got promoted to the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Evansville Braves]] of the [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]]. With Evansville in 1948, he had a 12–9 record and a 3.08 ERA.<ref name=\"minors\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=donova001ric|title=Dick Donovan Minor Leagues Statistics & History|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He moved on to the [[Hartford Chiefs]] of the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] in 1949, posting a 12–6 record and a 2.66 ERA and earning a promotion to the [[Class AAA (baseball)|Class AAA]] [[Milwaukee Brewers (American Association)|Milwaukee Brewers]] of the [[American Association (20th Century)|American Association]], the Braves' top farm team, for a couple games.<ref name=\"minors\"/> 

By 1950, Donovan was one of three rookie pitching prospects looking to make it with the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]], along with [[Norman Roy]] and George Uhle, Jr. The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' wrote, \"The best of the prospects seems to be Roy, who had a great year in 1949 at Milwaukee.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Vince|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19500103&id=m9gNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1483,634622&hl=en|title=Once Over Lightly|work=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=January 3, 1950|accessdate=March 22, 2020|page=15}}</ref> Uhle apparently got hurt (he only appeared in four games in the minors that year and never pitched again), but Roy and Donovan both made the Braves out of [[spring training]], Donovan as a starter.<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=royno01&t=p&year=1950|title=Normie Roy 1950 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He made his major league debut on April 24, giving up six [[Run (baseball)|runs]] (five earned) in {{frac|6|2|3}} [[Innings pitched|innings]] and taking the loss in a 6–4 defeat to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BSN/BSN195004240.shtml|title=Brooklyn Dodgers at Boston Braves Box Score, April 24, 1950|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan lost his next start, moved to the bullpen, then went to Milwaukee after appearing in two more games.<ref name=\"1950 Donovan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=donovdi01&t=p&year=1950|title=Dick Donovan 1950 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He was called up in June and in September but spent most of the rest of the year in the minors.<ref name=\"1950 Donovan\"/> In 10 games (three starts) his rookie year, Donovan had an 0–2 record, an 8.19 ERA, nine [[strikeout]]s, and 34 [[Walk (baseball)|walks]] in {{frac|29|2|3}} innings.<ref name=\"reference\"/> His numbers were not much better at Milwaukee, where in 19 games (10 starts) he had a 3–6 record, a 6.24 ERA, 44 strikeouts, and 33 walks in 75 innings.<ref name=\"minors\"/>

In 1951, Donovan started the season with the Braves again but was again moved to the bullpen after two starts.<ref name=\"1951 Donovan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=donova001ric|title=Dick Donovan 1951 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He had a 5.27 ERA (with no record) in eight games with the Braves and did not appear for them after June 5.<ref name=\"1951 Donovan\"/> Spending most of the season with Milwaukee, Donovan had more success with the Brewers in 1951. He had a 7–5 record, a 3.28 ERA, 88 strikeouts, and 59 walks in 129 innings, and he helped the Brewers win the American Association pennant.<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref name=\"minors\"/> However, he did not pitch for the Braves in September.<ref name=\"1951 Donovan\"/>

Similarly to his previous two years, Donovan started the season with the Braves, then spent most of the year in Milwaukee, with the exception of a brief call-up in late May to early June. In his only two starts, he gave up six runs in one and was pulled from the game in the other after walking the first three hitters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=donovdi01&t=p&year=1952|title=Dick Donovan 1952 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> He had a 5.54 ERA and an 0–2 record with the Braves. With Milwaukee, he appeared in 16 games (12 starts), posting a 4–6 record, a 4.55 ERA, 36 strikeouts, and 43 walks in 91 innings.<ref name=\"minors\"/>

Donovan hoped to remain in Milwaukee for the 1953 season, because the Braves moved there from Boston. However, he failed to make the team out of spring training this time, and the Braves tried to send him to their new AAA affiliate, the [[Toledo Mud Hens]]. Fearing he would remain in the minor leagues, Donovan requested a trade. “I believed I could win in the major leagues and wanted a chance to prove it,\" he said.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> [[John Quinn (baseball executive)|John Quinn]] denied his request at first, then made him available, but he rejected all deals other teams tried to make for Donovan. Finally, [[Gene Mauch]], Donovan's former roommate and manager of the Braves' [[Class AA (baseball)|Class AA]] affiliate, convinced Donovan to come play for the [[Atlanta Crackers]] of the [[Southern Association]].<ref name=\"SABR\"/>

\"That was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Donovan said of getting sent to Atlanta. “It brought me under the wing of [[Whitlow Wyatt|[Whitlow] Wyatt]].\"<ref name=\"SABR\"/> A former pitcher for the Dodgers, Wyatt taught Donovan how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] while the [[Prospect (sports)|prospect]] was at Atlanta.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> Donovan appeared in 32 games (19 starts) for Atlanta, posting an 11–8 record, a 3.71 ERA, 132 strikeouts, and 51 walks in 182 innings.<ref name=\"minors\"/> He got his wish after the season, when the Braves sold his contract to the [[Detroit Tigers]].<ref name=\"reference\"/> Donovan made the Tigers out of spring training but only appeared in two games before Detroit returned him to the Braves on May 13.<ref name=\"reference\"/> He was happy to accept another assignment to Atlanta, where Wyatt was now the manager.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> He responded with his best minor league season yet. In 27 games (all starts) for Atlanta, he had an 18–8 record and a 2.69 ERA for the team. Donovan also managed to hit well for the Crackers, slugging 12 [[home run]]s and having 32 [[runs batted in]]. The Crackers won the Southern Association pennant, and Donovan was named their Most Valuable Player.<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref>{{Cite web|last=Skelton|first=David E. |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/9a7e6a05 |title=Pete Burnside|work=SABR|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref> After the minor league season, the [[Chicago White Sox]] purchased his contract from Milwaukee.<ref name=\"reference\"/>

The White Sox faced the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1959 World Series]]. Donovan got the start in Game 3 and held the Dodgers to one baserunner through the first six innings. After getting two outs in the seventh, though, he walked [[Norm Larker]] and [[Gil Hodges]] on nine pitches, prompting manager [[Al López]] to replace him on the mound with [[Gerry Staley]].

For the second year in a row, he led the league in walks per nine innings, with a 1.2 mark.<ref name=\"reference\"/>

Donovan held the [[Los Angeles Angels]] to two runs over eight innings and drove in a couple of his own with a single against [[Ken McBride]] in a 3–2 victory over the Angels on April 23, 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAA/LAA196404230.shtml|title=Cleveland Indians at Los Angeles Angels Box Score, April 23, 1964|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref> Through August 8, though his record was close to .500 at 6–7, his ERA was 4.72.

In 1965, Donovan was again a starter for the Indians, but only for his first two games, after which he was moved to the bullpen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=donovdi01&t=p&year=1965|title=Dick Donovan 1965 Pitching Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref> He had not made it through the sixth inning in either of his starts, and the Indians wanted to give more starts to prospects like [[Sonny Siebert]] and [[Luis Tiant]].<ref name=\"SABR\"/> Used all but once in relief after that, he was released June 15 after posting a 5.96 ERA in 12 games.<ref name=\"reference\"/>  “I figure baseball was good to me,” Donovan said. “I was good to a lot of people in baseball too -- the hitters. It will be nice to take it easy if I don’t go with another club.”<ref name=\"SABR\"/>

During a 15-year major league career, Donovan compiled 122 wins, 880 strikeouts, and a 3.67 ERA, with 101 complete games, 25 shutouts and five saves. In 2,017<small>{{fraction|1|3}}</small> innings pitched, he allowed 1,988 hits and 495 walks.<ref name=\"reference\"/> 

==Playing style==
Donovan threw three pitches: a [[fastball]], a [[curveball]], and a slider. He learned the slider while pitching for Atlanta, when coach and later manager Whitlow Wyatt helped teach it to him.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> In 1955, when he finally stuck in a major league team's rotation, ''Sports Illustrated'' called it \"one of the most effective pitches in baseball.\"<ref name=\"slider\"/> Among pitchers, Donovan was also an unusually gifted hitter. In 1954, he was the team MVP for Atlanta after hitting 12 home runs and driving in 38 runs in only 27 games.<ref name=\"SABR\"/> With the White Sox, he was frequently used as a pinch-hitter. At the plate in his 15-year major league career, Donovan posted a .163 batting average (113-for-694) with 67 runs, 15 home runs, 64 RBI, and 64 walks.<ref name=\"reference\"/>

==Personal life==
On February 7, 1959, Donovan married Patricia Casey, a [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], Massachusetts, resident who was a stewardess for [[United Airlines]]. The couple had two children, Peter and Amy. His friend Wyatt gave him the idea to sell insurance, and Donovan had a home business selling insurance during his MLB career. In 1963, he earned his stockbroker's license and joined the Boston-based firm Eastman & Dillon. After his baseball career, he served as the executive vice president for [[Bache & Co.]]. In 1980, he opened a real estate appraisal office in Quincy, which he ran until 1994. Additionally, Donovan served as distributor with Earth Care Products, a Quincy company that makes products out of recycled plastic. He died from cancer on January 6, 1997.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>

==Production overview==
The series consisted of short animated stories that essentially were intended to set up the visual illustration of Beatles songs that were played in their entirety. In addition, there were sing-along sequences with simpler imagery complementing the full lyrics of particular songs. The songs were taken from all the albums up to 'Revolver' as well as non-album singles up to 'Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane', the song 'Bad Boy', the German language song 'Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand', and the 'Long Tall Sally' EP.

The series depicted the band in their early \"moptop-and-suit\" look as depicted in the live action film, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', even though the band moved beyond it during the series' run.  The producers did attempt to acknowledge the band members' contemporary appearances with photographs of them in the series' [[title sequence]]s during its production run.

The band members themselves had nothing to do with the series' production beyond the use of their music recordings. American actor [[Paul Frees]] did the voices of [[John Lennon|John]] and [[George Harrison|George]] while [[Lance Percival]] (of the [[Carry On films|''Carry On'']] series) did the voices of [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]]. Frees had been the voice of [[Boris Badenov]] in the ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' series. The female voices were provided by [[Julie Bennett]] and [[Carol Corbett]]. At first, the Beatles disliked the series.<ref>Axelrod, Mitchell. ''Beatletoons: The Real Story Behind The Cartoon Beatles''. Wynn, 1999,</ref> It is reported, however, that the band members enjoyed the cartoons in later years.<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\">Axelrod 1999.</ref> Their views of the cartoon series discouraged them from participating significantly in the later [[animated feature film]], ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Only when the band saw and were impressed by the ''Yellow Submarine''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s finished footage did they realize the film was a more ambitious creation. As a result, they agreed to appear in a short live action epilogue for it. In fact, ''Yellow Submarine'' producer [[Al Brodax]] and director [[George Dunning]] were involved in the production both of the animated series and of ''Yellow Submarine''.

Initially, the opening credits theme was a guitar riff from \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\" segueing into \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", over a cartoon sequence of the group running down a fire escape, echoing a scene in ''A Hard Day's Night''. The second season's opening theme was \"[[Help! (song)|Help!]]\", while the third season's theme was \"[[And Your Bird Can Sing]]\", over a different cartoon sequence.

Although uncredited, [[Dennis Marks (screenwriter)|Dennis Marks]], along with [[Jack Mendelsohn]], [[Heywood Kling]] and Bruce Howard, wrote all 39 episodes of ''The Beatles'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/beatles.htm| title=The Beatles (cartoon Series): Cartoon adventures of the world's most famously successful group. | work=televisionheaven.co.uk | author=Marcus, Laurence | date=14 February 2004| accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>

Most of the episodes of the series were produced by Artransa Park Studios in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia<ref>[http://www.thebeatleshk.com/Cartoons/Background.html The background of The Beatles cartoon television series.]</ref> and George Dunning's company TVC Animation in London,<ref name=\"womack\"/> with a handful of episodes made in Hollywood,<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\"/> with a crew supervised by veteran cartoon writer [[John W. Dunn (animator)|John W. Dunn]].<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\"/>

==Depiction of the Beatles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
[[File:Beatcart652.jpg|thumb|The Beatles stand before cartoon images of themselves from the ABC TV series, 1965.]]
Each Beatles figure was a loose, rough, exaggerated description of them with [[John Lennon|John]] and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] wearing a blue collar-less suit and tie while [[George Harrison|George]] and [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] wore navy blue shirts and light blue blazer jackets, all of them wearing matching blue drainpipe trousers and [[Beatle Boots]].

===John Lennon===
[[John Lennon|John]] is described as being the leader. His mop-top is slightly shorter than that of the rest of the band. He has his chin up, looking down his nose, feet apart and hands on hips, and points and poses with his hands with a \"showbiz\" expression with a mocking gesture, especially when giving orders (showing John does not take his job as leader seriously), and is often malicious, especially towards George and Ringo. He slouches rather than sits. He will often pull funny faces and immediately wipe them off. John's movements are described as being short and slightly aggressive. His chin is rather large, chubby and rounded and his eyes are rather small. Whenever he looks to the front he uses a sideways look to talk to somebody and looks away after giving an order. John's right eyebrow is connected to his nose and gives him a look suitable to his \"real life\" appearance.

He tends to use sarcastic, dry humor. He is also extremely lazy and overly laid-back. And yet, despite all that, he truly cares about the band members and will do anything for them.

===Paul McCartney===
[[Paul McCartney|Paul]] is shown as second-in-command of the band. Paul is the most poised and stylish of the cartoon Beatles, and his mop-top is the neatest of the four of them.

He uses his hands, with his fingers spread apart, to express himself when talking. He is the one to get excited whenever John suggests something. He always looks straight at whomever he's talking to. His face is very fine, with his eyebrows wide and far apart and his eyes partly closed in an almost mockingly sad expression and they will only open fully when he is excited or frightened. His moptop takes on a messier look and his eyes open wide when he is terrified. Paul sits like he's about to jump out and get on with whatever is happening. He does not really walk, he skips. When he is making his own suggestions or comments, especially when suggesting mischief, he covers up by assuming a mockingly innocent look; eyes wide and head tilted to one side. Whenever he gets especially excited, he will put his hand in his mouth.

Also like John, Paul uses a dry and sarcastic humour and is happy-go-lucky and rather laid-back. In spite of this, he will always help somebody when needed. Paul, along with Ringo, are the only Beatles who sound closest to their real-life counterparts.
His character is the only left-hander, while in real life both he and Ringo use their left hands.

===George Harrison===
[[George Harrison|George]]'s character has a more angular, wry figure, especially when he walks, his legs are long and thin (emphasis on the knees keeps his angular appearance). His mop-top is rather longer in the back compared to the other members of the band. He always leans against something, shoulders hunched, hands in pocket, legs crossed. He is also the same height as Paul. His shoulders are hunched when he is in a standing or a leaning pose, which can indicate direction and his head tilted forward. He has a crooked smile and is almost always giving the impression of frowning due to his characters eyebrows becoming thicker as they reach his nose. His chin is long and thin, with sunken cheeks, and his nose is tall and thin. He never looks at who he's speaking to and will close his eyes for short periods when talking. Notice the distance between his nose and his mouth; his mouth is lopsided.

He often uses dry, witty humour and succumbs to peer pressure. George is the only Beatle with a diverse accent that does not really fit with any accent in particular, but it sounds slightly Scottish/Irish. George has been shown to be fascinated with various cultures and is occasionally superstitious. He and Ringo are almost always made to do the work for John and Paul, such as in the episode \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", they were the only ones carrying in the bands' extensive luggage into their vacation cottage. He cares a lot about the group members and will help them when they need him.

===Ringo Starr===
[[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] is the most sympathetic Beatle. His mop-top is the longest and shaggiest (sometimes almost completely covering his eyes) of the four of them. He is the more calm, gentle, least aggressive, innocent, and more lovable Beatle. Ringo's nose and sad, goofy, expressive eyes are among his most prominent features along with his trademark, rather deep, goofy laugh, which is highly exaggerated. His face usually has a sad or goofy expression with his upper lip protruding in a wavy line. He does smile a lot, but when he does not he has a look of curiosity or sadness on his face. Ringo's expressions and humour are usually deadpan, but when expression is required, his eye position (eyes arched) are used to make a goofy expression whenever he laughs. Whenever he laughs, having made a funny remark, he squints.

Although being the eldest Beatle (three months before John), he is the smallest Beatle with a disjointed [[Groucho Marx]]-like figure. His neck is thin and gets smaller as it reaches the base of his neck, with his small chin sticking out a little, which is evidence of his disjointed figure. When he walks, his feet, legs, knees, arms and hands move loosely. Being responsible for the show's light-hearted humorous, or slapstick comical relief, after having bodily harm of any kind, his figure is crooked, bent or twisted into an, sometimes, unusual position. His clothes also often look a bit too big, especially his Beatle Boots and Blue Blazer Jacket.

During the song portions of the episodes (not the sing-along segments), he often shakes his head and mop-top around with a goofy expression when drumming. He gets along best with George, and he, like George, shows interest in various cultures.  He often makes bad puns and jokes (usually he's the only one laughing). During the introductions to the Sing-Along segments he substitutes for the prop-man (who is either on vacation, out sick or just not there) and sets the stage, literally, to John, Paul, or George's description, and more often than not, to their surprise or chagrin.

He is often the butt of the joke, victim of a prank, or just simply has bad luck. Ringo's character tends to have bad luck, often because of his naivety, curiosity and being unaware of the danger, mistake or threat. In the episode \"Good Day Sunshine\", he becomes depressed and upset, thinking he is a [[jinx]] for misfortunes, such as that it rained at Carny Island on the Beatles' weekends, (i.e. it rained at the piers fair every time Ringo arrived) and was described in that episode as being a \"sourpuss\". He felt better after John, Paul, and George sang \"[[Good Day Sunshine]]\" for him, and showed him how to have fun again.

It is revealed in \"Money\" that Ringo's mother dropped him as a baby (\"Me mother dropped me once\").

Ringo, like Paul, is also left-handed, although in \"I'll Be Back\" Ringo plays a guitar right-handed.

===Brian Epstein===
[[Brian Epstein]] acts as the Beatles' manager. He is rarely seen or mentioned but he was mostly mentioned in the episode \"Please Mr. Postman\" when the Beatles ran out of money. Ringo had purchased 15 rings, which were later snapped by autograph collectors, and they needed to contact Epstein for money. Epstein finally makes his appearance in the episode \"Thank You Girl\" in the beginning of the episode, but only his arm is seen, again voiced by [[Paul Frees]] as he grounds the Beatles for gaining so much weight after dining on the French cooking. Epstein, himself, along with the other real-life Beatles, appear in a lost deleted scene featuring the production of the animated Beatles cartoons at the end.

His fictionalized animated version of his appearance and habit of smoking is a homage and based on the animated series' creator, [[Al Brodax]].

==Reception==
The series was an instant ratings hit on ABC in the Saturday morning time slot after it debuted on 25 September 1965 at 10:30 AM ET.<ref name=\"TV.com\"/> It racked up a 13 score (or 52 share), then unheard of in daytime television. The series was sponsored by the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]], the [[Quaker Oats Company]] and the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars Candy Company]].<ref name=\"TV.com\"/> For the third season in 1967, the series was moved to Saturdays at noon.

Originally, the Beatles disliked the cartoon; however, as time went on they grew to like it. In 1972, Lennon commented, \"I still get a blast out of watching the Beatles cartoons on TV.\" In 1999, Harrison said, \"I always kind of liked [the cartoons]. They were so bad or silly that they were good, if you know what I mean, and I think the passage of time might make them more fun now.\"<ref name=\"womack\">{{cite book |title=Long and Winding Roads: The Evolving Artistry of The Beatles |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Continuum Books |location=New York |isbn= |page=101 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}} Womack quotes the interviews with Lennon (1972) and Harrison (1999) via a reference to {{cite book |title=Beatletoons: The Real Story Behind the Cartoon Beatles |last=Axelrod |first=Mitchell |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Wynn |location=Pickens |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The series was syndicated worldwide on television and cable after the original run ended in 1969. In 1986 and 1987, new generations were introduced to the series when it was rebroadcast in syndication by MTV and also by the Disney Channel. On MTV, the series was shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings at 10 AM ET or 7 AM PT. On The Disney Channel, the series was shown on Fridays at 5 PM beginning in 1989. [[Mark Hamill]] was a guest host of the MTV run of the series in 1987.

==Legacy==

While the series remained popular in syndication worldwide, the internet has allowed for even more exposure due to its [[so bad it's good]] nature. Due to the nature of the show and the Beatles' enduring popularity as a band, the series has recently gained a [[cult following]] online. The series was available on YouTube and on online websites, but most episodes have since been removed due to copyright infringement. In December 2004, [[McFarlane Toys]] released a line of figures based on the cartoon series featuring all four band members with instruments. In 2005, they released a boxed set featuring cartoon figures of all four band members with instruments, plus an alligator figure, speakers, and a radio. [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd.]] purchased the rights to the series in the early 1990s. There has been popular demand for the [[remastered]] release of the series on [[DVD]] by Apple.<ref name=\"Animators\"/> On 30 January 2019, convenience store chain [[Speedway LLC|Speedway]] used an image from the series on [[social media]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the band's rooftop concert during the [[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Get Back sessions]].<ref>https://www.facebook.com/189194787875143/posts/1845427148918557/</ref>

==Production overview==
The series consisted of short animated stories that essentially were intended to set up the visual illustration of Beatles songs that were played in their entirety. In addition, there were sing along sequences with simpler imagery complementing the full lyrics of particular songs. The songs were taken from all the albums up to 'Revolver' as well as non-album singles up to 'Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane', the song 'Bad Boy', the German language song 'Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand', and the 'Long Tall Sally' EP.

The series depicted the band in their early \"moptop-and-suit\" look as depicted in the live action film, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', even though the band moved beyond it during the series' run.  The producers did attempt to acknowledge the band members' contemporary appearances with photographs of them in the series' [[title sequence]]s during its production run.

The band members themselves had nothing to do with the series' production beyond the use of their music recordings. American actor [[Paul Frees]] did the voices of [[John Lennon|John]] and [[George Harrison|George]] while [[Lance Percival]] (of the [[Carry On films|''Carry On'']] series) did the voices of [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]]. Frees had been the voice of [[Boris Badenov]] in the ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' series. The female voices were provided by [[Julie Bennett]] and [[Carol Corbett]]. At first, the Beatles disliked the series.<ref>Axelrod, Mitchell. ''Beatletoons: The Real Story Behind The Cartoon Beatles''. Wynn, 1999,</ref> It is reported, however, that the band members enjoyed the cartoons in later years.<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\">Axelrod 1999.</ref> Their views of the cartoon series discouraged them from participating significantly in the later [[animated feature film]], ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Only when the band saw and were impressed by the ''Yellow Submarine''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s finished footage did they realize the film was a more ambitious creation. As a result, they agreed to appear in a short live action epilogue for it. In fact, ''Yellow Submarine'' producer [[Al Brodax]] and director [[George Dunning]] were involved in the production both of the animated series and of ''Yellow Submarine''.

Initially, the opening credits theme was a guitar riff from \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\" segueing into \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", over a cartoon sequence of the group running down a fire escape, echoing a scene in ''A Hard Day's Night''. The second season's opening theme was \"[[Help! (song)|Help!]]\", while the third season's theme was \"[[And Your Bird Can Sing]]\", over a different cartoon sequence.

Although uncredited, [[Dennis Marks (screenwriter)|Dennis Marks]], along with [[Jack Mendelsohn]], [[Heywood Kling]] and Bruce Howard, wrote all 39 episodes of ''The Beatles'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/beatles.htm| title=The Beatles (cartoon Series): Cartoon adventures of the world's most famously successful group. | work=televisionheaven.co.uk | author=Marcus, Laurence | date=14 February 2004| accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>

Most of the episodes of the series were produced by Artransa Park Studios in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia<ref>[http://www.thebeatleshk.com/Cartoons/Background.html The background of The Beatles cartoon television series.]</ref> and George Dunning's company TVC Animation in London,<ref name=\"womack\"/> with a handful of episodes made in Hollywood,<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\"/> with a crew supervised by veteran cartoon writer [[John W. Dunn (animator)|John W. Dunn]].<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\"/>

==Depiction of the Beatles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
[[File:Beatcart652.jpg|thumb|The Beatles stand before cartoon images of themselves from the ABC TV series, 1965.]]
Each Beatles figure was a loose, rough, exaggerated description of them with [[John Lennon|John]] and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] wearing a blue collar-less suit and tie while [[George Harrison|George]] and [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] wore navy blue shirts and light blue blazer jackets, all of them wearing matching blue drainpipe trousers and [[Beatle Boots]].

===John Lennon===
[[John Lennon|John]] is described as being the leader. His mop-top is slightly shorter than that of the rest of the band. He has his chin up, looking down his nose, feet apart and hands on hips, and points and poses with his hands with a \"showbiz\" expression with a mocking gesture, especially when giving orders (showing John does not take his job as leader seriously), and is often malicious, especially towards George and Ringo. He slouches rather than sits. He will often pull funny faces and immediately wipe them off. John's movements are described as being short and slightly aggressive. His chin is rather large, chubby and rounded and his eyes are rather small. Whenever he looks to the front he uses a sideways look to talk to somebody and looks away after giving an order. John's right eyebrow is connected to his nose and gives him a look suitable to his \"real life\" appearance.

He tends to use sarcastic, dry humor. He is also extremely lazy and overly laid-back. And yet, despite all that, he truly cares about the band members and will do anything for them.

===Paul McCartney===
[[Paul McCartney|Paul]] is shown as second-in-command of the band. Paul is the most poised and stylish of the cartoon Beatles, and his mop-top is the neatest of the four of them.

He uses his hands, with his fingers spread apart, to express himself when talking. He is the one to get excited whenever John suggests something. He always looks straight at whomever he's talking to. His face is very fine, with his eyebrows wide and far apart and his eyes partly closed in an almost mockingly sad expression and they will only open fully when he is excited or frightened. His moptop takes on a messier look and his eyes open wide when he is terrified. Paul sits like he's about to jump out and get on with whatever is happening. He does not really walk, he skips. When he is making his own suggestions or comments, especially when suggesting mischief, he covers up by assuming a mockingly innocent look; eyes wide and head tilted to one side. Whenever he gets especially excited, he will put his hand in his mouth.

Also like John, Paul uses a dry and sarcastic humour and is happy-go-lucky and rather laid-back. In spite of this, he will always help somebody when needed. Paul, along with Ringo, are the only Beatles who sound closest to their real-life counterparts.
His character is the only left-hander, while in real life both he and Ringo use their left hands.

===George Harrison===
[[George Harrison|George]]'s character has a more angular, wry figure, especially when he walks, his legs are long and thin (emphasis on the knees keeps his angular appearance). His mop-top is rather longer in the back compared to the other members of the band. He always leans against something, shoulders hunched, hands in pocket, legs crossed. He is also the same height as Paul. His shoulders are hunched when he is in a standing or a leaning pose, which can indicate direction and his head tilted forward. He has a crooked smile and is almost always giving the impression of frowning due to his characters eyebrows becoming thicker as they reach his nose. His chin is long and thin, with sunken cheeks, and his nose is tall and thin. He never looks at who he's speaking to and will close his eyes for short periods when talking. Notice the distance between his nose and his mouth; his mouth is lopsided.

He often uses dry, witty humour and succumbs to peer pressure. George is the only Beatle with a diverse accent that does not really fit with any accent in particular, but it sounds slightly Scottish/Irish. George has been shown to be fascinated with various cultures and is occasionally superstitious. He and Ringo are almost always made to do the work for John and Paul, such as in the episode \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", they were the only ones carrying in the bands' extensive luggage into their vacation cottage. He cares a lot about the group members and will help them when they need him.

===Ringo Starr===
[[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] is the most sympathetic Beatle. His mop-top is the longest and shaggiest (sometimes almost completely covering his eyes) of the four of them. He is the more calm, gentle, least aggressive, innocent, and more lovable Beatle. Ringo's nose and sad, goofy, expressive eyes are among his most prominent features along with his trademark, rather deep, goofy laugh, which is highly exaggerated. His face usually has a sad or goofy expression with his upper lip protruding in a wavy line. He does smile a lot, but when he does not he has a look of curiosity or sadness on his face. Ringo's expressions and humour are usually deadpan, but when expression is required, his eye position (eyes arched) are used to make a goofy expression whenever he laughs. Whenever he laughs, having made a funny remark, he squints.

Although being the eldest Beatle (three months before John), he is the smallest Beatle with a disjointed [[Groucho Marx]]-like figure. His neck is thin and gets smaller as it reaches the base of his neck, with his small chin sticking out a little, which is evidence of his disjointed figure. When he walks, his feet, legs, knees, arms and hands move loosely. Being responsible for the show's light-hearted humorous, or slapstick comical relief, after having bodily harm of any kind, his figure is crooked, bent or twisted into an, sometimes, unusual position. His clothes also often look a bit too big, especially his Beatle Boots and Blue Blazer Jacket.

During the song portions of the episodes (not the sing-along segments), he often shakes his head and mop-top around with a goofy expression when drumming. He gets along best with George, and he, like George, shows interest in various cultures.  He often makes bad puns and jokes (usually he's the only one laughing). During the introductions to the Sing-Along segments he substitutes for the prop-man (who is either on vacation, out sick or just not there) and sets the stage, literally, to John, Paul, or George's description, and more often than not, to their surprise or chagrin.

He is often the butt of the joke, victim of a prank, or just simply has bad luck. Ringo's character tends to have bad luck, often because of his naivety, curiosity and being unaware of the danger, mistake or threat. In the episode \"Good Day Sunshine\", he becomes depressed and upset, thinking he is a [[jinx]] for misfortunes, such as that it rained at Carny Island on the Beatles' weekends, (i.e. it rained at the piers fair every time Ringo arrived) and was described in that episode as being a \"sourpuss\". He felt better after John, Paul, and George sang \"[[Good Day Sunshine]]\" for him, and showed him how to have fun again.

It is revealed in \"Money\" that Ringo's mother dropped him as a baby (\"Me mother dropped me once\").

Ringo, like Paul, is also left-handed, although in \"I'll Be Back\" Ringo plays a guitar right-handed.

===Brian Epstein===
[[Brian Epstein]] acts as the Beatles' manager. He is rarely seen or mentioned but he was mostly mentioned in the episode \"Please Mr. Postman\" when the Beatles ran out of money. Ringo had purchased 15 rings, which were later snapped by autograph collectors, and they needed to contact Epstein for money. Epstein finally makes his appearance in the episode \"Thank You Girl\" in the beginning of the episode, but only his arm is seen, again voiced by [[Paul Frees]] as he grounds the Beatles for gaining so much weight after dining on the French cooking. Epstein, himself, along with the other real-life Beatles, appear in a lost deleted scene featuring the production of the animated Beatles cartoons at the end.

His fictionalized animated version of his appearance and habit of smoking is a homage and based on the animated series' creator, [[Al Brodax]].

==Reception==
The series was an instant ratings hit on ABC in the Saturday morning time slot after it debuted on 25 September 1965 at 10:30 AM ET.<ref name=\"TV.com\"/> It racked up a 13 score (or 52 share), then unheard of in daytime television. The series was sponsored by the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]], the [[Quaker Oats Company]] and the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars Candy Company]].<ref name=\"TV.com\"/> For the third season in 1967, the series was moved to Saturdays at noon.

Originally, the Beatles disliked the cartoon; however, as time went on they grew to like it. In 1972, Lennon commented, \"I still get a blast out of watching the Beatles cartoons on TV.\" In 1999, Harrison said, \"I always kind of liked [the cartoons]. They were so bad or silly that they were good, if you know what I mean, and I think the passage of time might make them more fun now.\"<ref name=\"womack\">{{cite book |title=Long and Winding Roads: The Evolving Artistry of The Beatles |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Continuum Books |location=New York |isbn= |page=101 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}} Womack quotes the interviews with Lennon (1972) and Harrison (1999) via a reference to {{cite book |title=Beatletoons: The Real Story Behind the Cartoon Beatles |last=Axelrod |first=Mitchell |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Wynn |location=Pickens |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The series was syndicated worldwide on television and cable after the original run ended in 1969. In 1986 and 1987, new generations were introduced to the series when it was rebroadcast in syndication by MTV and also by the Disney Channel. On MTV, the series was shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings at 10 AM ET or 7 AM PT. On The Disney Channel, the series was shown on Fridays at 5 PM beginning in 1989. [[Mark Hamill]] was a guest host of the MTV run of the series in 1987.

==Legacy==

While the series remained popular in syndication worldwide, the internet has allowed for even more exposure due to its [[so bad it's good]] nature. Due to the nature of the show and the Beatles' enduring popularity as a band, the series has recently gained a [[cult following]] online. The series was available on YouTube and on online websites, but most episodes have since been removed due to copyright infringement. In December 2004, [[McFarlane Toys]] released a line of figures based on the cartoon series featuring all four band members with instruments. In 2005, they released a boxed set featuring cartoon figures of all four band members with instruments, plus an alligator figure, speakers, and a radio. [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd.]] purchased the rights to the series in the early 1990s. There has been popular demand for the [[remastered]] release of the series on [[DVD]] by Apple.<ref name=\"Animators\"/> On 30 January 2019, convenience store chain [[Speedway LLC|Speedway]] used an image from the series on [[social media]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the band's rooftop concert during the [[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Get Back sessions]].<ref>https://www.facebook.com/189194787875143/posts/1845427148918557/</ref>

'''1. Fußball-Club Köln 01/07 e. V.''', commonly known as simply '''1. FC Köln''' or '''FC Cologne''' in English ({{IPA-de|ʔɛf ˈtseː ˈkœln}}), is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Cologne]]. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs ''Kölner Ballspiel-Club 1901'' and ''SpVgg Sülz 07''. Köln gained promotion back to the [[Bundesliga]] in the [[2018-19 2. Bundesliga|2018–19 season]] after being relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] [[2017-18 Bundesliga|the previous season]]. The team won the first Bundesliga in 1963.

The club's nickname ''Die Geißböcke'' (The [[Goat|Billy Goats]]) refers to the club's [[mascot]], a male goat named ''Hennes'' after the veteran FC player and (later) manager [[Hennes Weisweiler]]. The first ''Hennes'' was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a [[Cologne carnival]] joke. The current mascot is ''Hennes'' IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age.<ref>https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/fc-present-hennes-ix/</ref> Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is ''FC'' (often written as ''Effzeh''), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the [[Colognian language|dialect spoken around Cologne]], this is pronounced \"EF-tsay\",{{fix|text=Colognian IPA needed|date=October 2015}} in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized ({{IPA-de|ʔɛf ˈtseː|}}). Köln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history.

Like many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1. FC Köln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like [[handball]], [[table tennis]] and [[gymnastics]]. 1. FC Köln has over 100,000 members, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/mitglieder-boom-dank-europa-fc-knackt-bald-die-100-000--27800598 | title = Mitglieder-Boom dank Europa FC knackt bald die 100.000! | language = de | trans-title=Member's boom thanks to Europa League FC will soon break the 100,000! | publisher = express.de | date = 16 June 2017 | accessdate = 12 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/record-setting-members-meeting | title = Record-Setting Members' Meeting | publisher = fc.de | date = 26 September 2017 | accessdate = 27 September 2017}}</ref>

==History==
===Predecessor sides===
[[File:Kolner BC.png|thumb|left|250px|Historical logos of predecessor side ''Kölner BC'']]Kölner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the [[gymnastics]] club FC Borussia Köln and far more interested in football. BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before [[World War I]] who took the [[Western German football championship|Westdeutsche championship]] in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the [[1912 German football championship|national finals]]. Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final, where they lost a 1–3 to [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]].

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SpVgg Sulz.png|thumb|right|100px|Historical logo of predecessor side ''SpVgg Sülz'']] -->
Spielvereinigung 1907 Köln-Sülz was established in 1907 as Sülzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fußball Club 1908 Hertha Sülz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the [[1928 German football championship|national finals]] in their turn on that stage. They went on to play as a top flight club in the [[Gauliga Mittelrhein]], one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. The side earned generally good results through the 1930s&nbsp;– including a divisional championship in 1939&nbsp;– but then faltered in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the [[Gauliga Köln-Aachen]] and the [[Gauliga Moselland]], which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg. Sülz struggled until they were united with [[VfL Köln 1899]] for the 1943–44 season to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/Sülz 07 which promptly won the Gauliga Köln-Aachen title by a single point over SG Düren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.

===A successful new club===

FC Köln began play in the tough [[Oberliga West (1947–63)|Oberliga West]] in the 1949–50 season and by 1954 had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the [[1953–54 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final 1–0 to [[VfB Stuttgart]]. ''Die Geißböcke'' won their second divisional championship in 1960 and appeared in the [[1960 German football championship|national final]] against [[Hamburger SV]], where they went down to a 2–3 defeat. They went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons and again played their way to the national final in [[1962 German football championship|1962]] and [[1963 German football championship|1963]]. They won the '62 match 4–0 over [[1. FC Nürnberg]] resulting in entry to the [[1962–63 European Cup]] where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round Köln visited [[Dundee F.C.]] of Scotland and lost 1–8, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4–0 they were out of the tournament. In the following year's national final they lost 1–3 to [[Borussia Dortmund]].

===Continuing success===
[[File:Einweihung Carola-Williams-Park 05.jpg|thumb|Mascot Hennes VIII]]
In 1963, FC Köln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. Köln continued their winning ways by becoming the first ever [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga champion]] in the league's inaugural [[1963–64 Bundesliga|1963–64 season]]. As German champions, Köln entered the [[1964–65 European Cup]] where it met England's [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the quarter-final stage. After two 0–0 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2–2. As the [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shootout]] had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, Köln went out of the competition on the [[Coin toss|toss of a coin]]. Ironically enough, there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground. The club also became the first Bundesliga side to field a Brazilian player when it signed [[Zézé]] for a then club record fee of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 150,000.<ref name=\"Schnee\" >[http://www.weltfussball.de/news/_n1498951_/schnee-allergie-beim-samba-kicker/ Schnee-Allergie beim Samba-Kicker] {{in lang|de}} Weltfussball.de, published: 27 March 2015. Retrieved 28 March 2015.</ref> Domestically, Köln recorded a second-place finish in the [[1964–65 Bundesliga]] season and won its first [[DFB-Pokal]] in [[1967–68 DFB-Pokal|1967–68]].

At the start of the 1970s, Köln reached three DFB-Pokal finals in four seasons, losing all three; to [[Kickers Offenbach]] in [[1969–70 DFB-Pokal|1970]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in [[1970–71 DFB-Pokal|1971]] and [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in [[1972–73 DFB-Pokal|1973]]. The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in [[1972–73 Bundesliga|1973]] before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in [[1976–77 DFB-Pokal|1977]], beating [[Hertha BSC]] over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.

In 1977–78, FC Köln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the [[1977–78 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title, its third national title overall, and retaining the [[1977–78 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]]. This makes Köln one of only four clubs to have won [[Double (association football)#Germany|the double]] in [[Double (association football)#Bundesliga era|the Bundesliga era]].

Köln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in [[1979–80 DFB-Pokal|1980]], before winning the competition for a fourth time in [[1982–83 DFB-Pokal|1983]]. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5–3 on aggregate to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]]. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in [[1988–89 Bundesliga|1988–89]] and [[1989–90 Bundesliga|1989–90]], and another DFB-Pokal final loss in [[1990–91 DFB-Pokal|1991]], marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC Köln.

===21st century: ups and downs===
In recent years, the club's performance has been mixed. The FC holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history: in [[2001–02 Bundesliga|2002]], the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes (equivalent to 11-and-a-half games) until [[Thomas Cichon]] found the back of the net again.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/2002/25/fckoeln-herthabsc/ | title = Das ersehnte Tor war zuwenig | language = de | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = 2 March 2002 | accessdate = 10 December 2014}}</ref>
In the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC Köln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club's performance fell, and in [[1997–98 Bundesliga|1998]] it was relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a \"[[yo-yo club|yo-yo team]]\", moving between the first and second divisions. It has returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the [[2004–05 2. Bundesliga|2004–05 season]] as [[2. Bundesliga]] champions after having been relegated the [[2003–04 Bundesliga|season before]]. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight as they were picked by German football magazine ''kicker'' as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.

This prediction came true when Köln lost to [[Hamburger SV]] 1–0 in the third-to-last match of [[2005–06 Bundesliga|the season]]. The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team's most prolific goal scorer was [[Lukas Podolski]] with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season. He also appeared with the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

In late 2006, former coach [[Christoph Daum]] was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2. Bundesliga club and succeeded in leading the club back to the Bundesliga in 2008. After a successful Bundesliga campaign in 2008–09, Daum left Köln for his former club [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]]. Köln's former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the [[2009–10 Bundesliga|2009–10 season]].

After a poor run of form in the [[2010–11 Bundesliga|2010–11 season]], recording only one win from its opening nine Bundesliga fixtures, Köln replaced coach [[Zvonimir Soldo]] with [[Frank Schaefer]]. Schaefer, who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of Köln, decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga. Former [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] and recent [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] coach [[Ståle Solbakken]] replaced him. After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season, Schaefer and former Köln player [[Dirk Lottner]] replaced Solbakken.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2011/05/14/2486732/koln-confirm-stale-solbakken-as-new-coach-for-next-season/ |title=Köln confirm Stale Solbakken as new coach for next season |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |publisher=goal.com}}</ref> The club, however, was relegated at the end of the season, finishing in 17th place, having accumulated €33m debt, and €11m [[equity (finance)|negative equity]].<ref name=dept2017>[http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/1--fc-koeln-wehrle-schafft-das-finanz-wunder--hier-die-mega-zahlen-26913860 1.

===Turn around (2012–2017)===
In April 2012 the club members elected a new board of directors, Werner Spinner as president, Markus Ritterbach for marketing, and [[Harald Schumacher|Toni Schumacher]] for sport. In the [[2012–13 2. Bundesliga|2012–13 season]], under new trainer [[Holger Stanislawski]], Köln finished in fifth place in the [[2. Bundesliga]], missing out on promotion back to the top division.

In 2012 the board hired Jörg Jakobs as director of football who then got promoted in 2014 to sporting director, chief scout and director of the academy.<ref>[http://www.goal.com/de/news/968/transfernews/2014/06/23/4907416/1-fc-k%C3%B6ln-j%C3%B6rg-jakobs-bleibt-und-wird-bef%C3%B6rdert Der Leiter Lizenzfußball bleibt und rückt auf: Zukünftig ist Jakobs als Sportdirektor mit mehr Kompetenzen ausgestattet], 23 June 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.90min.de/de/posts/4911495-1-fc-koeln-sportdirektor-joerg-jakobs-soll-seinen-vertrag-verlaengern 1.

[[2013–14 2. Bundesliga|2013–14]] Köln finished first in the 2. Bundesliga and earned promotion to the top division. It was followed by a 12th place [[2014–15 Bundesliga|2014–15]], ninth in [[2015–16 Bundesliga|2015–16]], and fifth place in [[2016–17 Bundesliga|2016–17]]. 25 years after the club's last appearance in international football to date they qualified for the Europa League. After restructuring and repaying debt, equity turned from €11m negative to €20m positive. The turnover increased from €56m in 2012/13 to more than €120m in 2016/17.<ref name=dept2017/><ref>[http://www.stern.de/sport/fussball/1-fc-koeln---was-das-ueberraschungsteam-der-bundesliga-so-stark-macht-7197078.html Mer stonn zo Dir, FC Kölle!], ''Stern'', 19 November 2016.</ref><ref>[http://www.ksta.de/sport/1-fc-koeln/rekorde-fuer-den-1--fc-koeln-150-millionen-euro-umsatz-in-reichweite-28011944 Rekorde für den 1.

===Decline and changes (2018–)===
After the club's return the European stage, fortunes quickly changed. The team experienced an unsuccessful start to the [[2017-18 Bundesliga|2017–18 Bundesliga season]] gaining only three points from its first sixteen matches. At the same time, the club's Europa League campaign ended after the group stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://story.ksta.de/2018/05/fc-saison-rueckblick/|title= Euphorie und Enttäuschung – Der Herzschalg der FC Saison|website=ksta.de|accessdate= 7 May 2019}}</ref> This downtrend led to the resignation of [[Jörg Schmadtke]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fc.de/fc-info/news/detailseite/details/fc-und-schmadtke-loesen-vertrag-auf/|title=FC und Schmadtke lösen Vertrag auf|date=23 October 2017|work=fc.de}}</ref> and Stöger's dismissal in December 2017; he was replaced by [[Stefan Ruthenbeck]] who was appointed as caretaker manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ksta.de/sport/1-fc-koeln/stoeger-aus-so-geht-es-weiter-beim-1--fc-koeln-28990612|title=1.FC Köln: Peter Stöger entlassen|website=ksta.de|accessdate= 7 May 2019}}</ref> In spite of an improved record in the second half of the season, the team finished last and were relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] at the end of the year.

Ahead of the [[2018–19 2.

==Stadium==
The team plays its home matches in the [[Müngersdorfer Stadion]], also known as the RheinEnergie Stadion for sponsorship purposes. It has a seating capacity of 45,965 and the average attendance in the 2015–16 season was 48,676.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/bundesliga-2015-2016/1/ |title=Germany \" Bundesliga 2015/2016 \" Attendance \" Home matches |website=worldfootball.net |accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref> The stadium sponsorship comes from a contract with the local power supplier RheinEnergie AG. However, most fans still call the stadium \"Müngersdorfer Stadion\", named after the suburb of Müngersdorf, where it is located.

The club owns the ''Geißbockheim'' training centre currently known as ''RheinEnergieSportpark'' for sponsorship, located in [[Sülz]] which is a municipal part of Köln in the southwest of the city. The centre is home to the ''Franz-Kremer-Stadion'' being home to [[1. FC Köln II]].

'''1. Fußball-Club Köln 01/07 e. V.''', commonly known as simply '''1. FC Köln''' or '''FC Cologne''' in English ({{IPA-de|ʔɛf ˈtseː ˈkœln}}), is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Cologne]]. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs ''Kölner Ballspiel-Club 1901'' and ''SpVgg Sülz 07''. Köln gained promotion back to the [[Bundesliga]] in the [[2018-19 2. Bundesliga|2018–19 season]] after being relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] [[2017-18 Bundesliga|the previous season]]. The team won the first Bundesliga in 1963.

The club's nickname ''Die Geißböcke'' (The [[Goat|Billy Goats]]) refers to the club's [[mascot]], a male goat named ''Hennes'' after the veteran FC player and (later) manager [[Hennes Weisweiler]]. The first ''Hennes'' was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a [[Cologne carnival]] joke. The current mascot is ''Hennes'' IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age.<ref>https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/fc-present-hennes-ix/</ref> Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is ''FC'' (often written as ''Effzeh''), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the [[Colognian language|dialect spoken around Cologne]], this is pronounced \"EF-tsay\",{{fix|text=Colognian IPA needed|date=October 2015}} in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized ({{IPA-de|ʔɛf ˈtseː|}}). Köln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history.

Like many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1. FC Köln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like [[handball]], [[table tennis]] and [[gymnastics]]. 1. FC Köln has over 100,000 members, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/mitglieder-boom-dank-europa-fc-knackt-bald-die-100-000--27800598 | title = Mitglieder-Boom dank Europa FC knackt bald die 100.000! | language = de | trans-title=Member's boom thanks to Europa League FC will soon break the 100,000! | publisher = express.de | date = 16 June 2017 | accessdate = 12 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/record-setting-members-meeting | title = Record-Setting Members' Meeting | publisher = fc.de | date = 26 September 2017 | accessdate = 27 September 2017}}</ref>

==History==
===Predecessor sides===
[[File:Kolner BC.png|thumb|left|250px|Historical logos of predecessor side ''Kölner BC'']]Kölner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the [[gymnastics]] club FC Borussia Köln and far more interested in football. BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before [[World War I]] who took the [[Western German football championship|Westdeutsche championship]] in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the [[1912 German football championship|national finals]]. Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final, where they lost a 1–3 to [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]].

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SpVgg Sulz.png|thumb|right|100px|Historical logo of predecessor side ''SpVgg Sülz'']] -->
Spielvereinigung 1907 Köln-Sülz was established in 1907 as Sülzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fußball Club 1908 Hertha Sülz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the [[1928 German football championship|national finals]] in their turn on that stage. They went on to play as a top flight club in the [[Gauliga Mittelrhein]], one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. The side earned generally good results through the 1930s&nbsp;– including a divisional championship in 1939&nbsp;– but then faltered in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the [[Gauliga Köln-Aachen]] and the [[Gauliga Moselland]], which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg. Sülz struggled until they were united with [[VfL Köln 1899]] for the 1943–44 season to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/Sülz 07 which promptly won the Gauliga Köln-Aachen title by a single point over SG Düren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.

===A successful new club===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:FC Köln Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of 1. FC Köln league performance]]
After the union of these two predecessor sides (1948), 1. FC Köln began play in the tough [[Oberliga West (1947–63)|Oberliga West]] in the 1949–50 season and by 1954 had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the [[1953–54 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final 1–0 to [[VfB Stuttgart]]. ''Die Geißböcke'' won their second divisional championship in 1960 and appeared in the [[1960 German football championship|national final]] against [[Hamburger SV]], where they went down to a 2–3 defeat. They went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons and again played their way to the national final in [[1962 German football championship|1962]] and [[1963 German football championship|1963]]. They won the '62 match 4–0 over [[1. FC Nürnberg]] resulting in entry to the [[1962–63 European Cup]] where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round Köln visited [[Dundee F.C.]] of Scotland and lost 1–8, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4–0 they were out of the tournament. In the following year's national final they lost 1–3 to [[Borussia Dortmund]].

===Continuing success===
[[File:Einweihung Carola-Williams-Park 05.jpg|thumb|Mascot Hennes VIII]]
In 1963, FC Köln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. Köln continued their winning ways by becoming the first ever [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga champion]] in the league's inaugural [[1963–64 Bundesliga|1963–64 season]]. As German champions, Köln entered the [[1964–65 European Cup]] where it met England's [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the quarter-final stage. After two 0–0 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2–2. As the [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shootout]] had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, Köln went out of the competition on the [[Coin toss|toss of a coin]]. Ironically enough, there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground. The club also became the first Bundesliga side to field a Brazilian player when it signed [[Zézé]] for a then club record fee of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 150,000.<ref name=\"Schnee\" >[http://www.weltfussball.de/news/_n1498951_/schnee-allergie-beim-samba-kicker/ Schnee-Allergie beim Samba-Kicker] {{in lang|de}} Weltfussball.de, published: 27 March 2015. Retrieved 28 March 2015.</ref> Domestically, Köln recorded a second-place finish in the [[1964–65 Bundesliga]] season and won its first [[DFB-Pokal]] in [[1967–68 DFB-Pokal|1967–68]].

At the start of the 1970s, Köln reached three DFB-Pokal finals in four seasons, losing all three; to [[Kickers Offenbach]] in [[1969–70 DFB-Pokal|1970]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in [[1970–71 DFB-Pokal|1971]] and [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in [[1972–73 DFB-Pokal|1973]]. The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in [[1972–73 Bundesliga|1973]] before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in [[1976–77 DFB-Pokal|1977]], beating [[Hertha BSC]] over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.

In 1977–78, FC Köln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the [[1977–78 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title, its third national title overall, and retaining the [[1977–78 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]]. This makes Köln one of only four clubs to have won [[Double (association football)#Germany|the double]] in [[Double (association football)#Bundesliga era|the Bundesliga era]].

Köln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in [[1979–80 DFB-Pokal|1980]], before winning the competition for a fourth time in [[1982–83 DFB-Pokal|1983]]. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5–3 on aggregate to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]]. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in [[1988–89 Bundesliga|1988–89]] and [[1989–90 Bundesliga|1989–90]], and another DFB-Pokal final loss in [[1990–91 DFB-Pokal|1991]], marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC Köln.

===21st century: ups and downs===
In recent years, the club's performance has been mixed. The FC holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history: in [[2001–02 Bundesliga|2002]], the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes (equivalent to 11-and-a-half games) until [[Thomas Cichon]] found the back of the net again.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/2002/25/fckoeln-herthabsc/ | title = Das ersehnte Tor war zuwenig | language = de | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = 2 March 2002 | accessdate = 10 December 2014}}</ref>
In the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC Köln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club's performance fell, and in [[1997–98 Bundesliga|1998]] it was relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a \"[[yo-yo club|yo-yo team]]\", moving between the first and second divisions. It has returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the [[2004–05 2. Bundesliga|2004–05 season]] as [[2. Bundesliga]] champions after having been relegated the [[2003–04 Bundesliga|season before]]. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight as they were picked by German football magazine ''kicker'' as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.

This prediction came true when Köln lost to [[Hamburger SV]] 1–0 in the third-to-last match of [[2005–06 Bundesliga|the season]]. The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team's most prolific goal scorer was [[Lukas Podolski]] with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season. He also appeared with the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

In late 2006, former coach [[Christoph Daum]] was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2. Bundesliga club and succeeded in leading the club back to the Bundesliga in 2008. After a successful Bundesliga campaign in 2008–09, Daum left Köln for his former club [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]]. Köln's former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the [[2009–10 Bundesliga|2009–10 season]].

After a poor run of form in the [[2010–11 Bundesliga|2010–11 season]], recording only one win from its opening nine Bundesliga fixtures, Köln replaced coach [[Zvonimir Soldo]] with [[Frank Schaefer]]. Schaefer, who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of Köln, decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga. Former [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] and recent [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] coach [[Ståle Solbakken]] replaced him. After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season, Schaefer and former Köln player [[Dirk Lottner]] replaced Solbakken.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2011/05/14/2486732/koln-confirm-stale-solbakken-as-new-coach-for-next-season/ |title=Köln confirm Stale Solbakken as new coach for next season |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |publisher=goal.com}}</ref> The club, however, was relegated at the end of the season, finishing in 17th place, having accumulated €33m debt, and €11m [[equity (finance)|negative equity]].<ref name=dept2017>[http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/1--fc-koeln-wehrle-schafft-das-finanz-wunder--hier-die-mega-zahlen-26913860 1.

===Turn around (2012–2017)===
In April 2012 the club members elected a new board of directors, Werner Spinner as president, Markus Ritterbach for marketing, and [[Harald Schumacher|Toni Schumacher]] for sport. In the [[2012–13 2. Bundesliga|2012–13 season]], under new trainer [[Holger Stanislawski]], Köln finished in fifth place in the [[2. Bundesliga]], missing out on promotion back to the top division.

In 2012 the board hired Jörg Jakobs as director of football who then got promoted in 2014 to sporting director, chief scout and director of the academy.<ref>[http://www.goal.com/de/news/968/transfernews/2014/06/23/4907416/1-fc-k%C3%B6ln-j%C3%B6rg-jakobs-bleibt-und-wird-bef%C3%B6rdert Der Leiter Lizenzfußball bleibt und rückt auf: Zukünftig ist Jakobs als Sportdirektor mit mehr Kompetenzen ausgestattet], 23 June 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.90min.de/de/posts/4911495-1-fc-koeln-sportdirektor-joerg-jakobs-soll-seinen-vertrag-verlaengern 1.

[[2013–14 2. Bundesliga|2013–14]] Köln finished first in the 2. Bundesliga and earned promotion to the top division. It was followed by a 12th place [[2014–15 Bundesliga|2014–15]], ninth in [[2015–16 Bundesliga|2015–16]], and fifth place in [[2016–17 Bundesliga|2016–17]]. 25 years after the club's last appearance in international football to date they qualified for the Europa League. After restructuring and repaying debt, equity turned from €11m negative to €20m positive. The turnover increased from €56m in 2012/13 to more than €120m in 2016/17.<ref name=dept2017/><ref>[http://www.stern.de/sport/fussball/1-fc-koeln---was-das-ueberraschungsteam-der-bundesliga-so-stark-macht-7197078.html Mer stonn zo Dir, FC Kölle!], ''Stern'', 19 November 2016.</ref><ref>[http://www.ksta.de/sport/1-fc-koeln/rekorde-fuer-den-1--fc-koeln-150-millionen-euro-umsatz-in-reichweite-28011944 Rekorde für den 1.

===Decline and changes (2018–)===
After the club's return the European stage, fortunes quickly changed. The team experienced an unsuccessful start to the [[2017-18 Bundesliga|2017–18 Bundesliga season]] gaining only three points from its first sixteen matches. At the same time, the club's Europa League campaign ended after the group stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://story.ksta.de/2018/05/fc-saison-rueckblick/|title= Euphorie und Enttäuschung – Der Herzschalg der FC Saison|website=ksta.de|accessdate= 7 May 2019}}</ref> This downtrend led to the resignation of [[Jörg Schmadtke]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fc.de/fc-info/news/detailseite/details/fc-und-schmadtke-loesen-vertrag-auf/|title=FC und Schmadtke lösen Vertrag auf|date=23 October 2017|work=fc.de}}</ref> and Stöger's dismissal in December 2017; he was replaced by [[Stefan Ruthenbeck]] who was appointed as caretaker manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ksta.de/sport/1-fc-koeln/stoeger-aus-so-geht-es-weiter-beim-1--fc-koeln-28990612|title=1.FC Köln: Peter Stöger entlassen|website=ksta.de|accessdate= 7 May 2019}}</ref> In spite of an improved record in the second half of the season, the team finished last and were relegated to [[2.

==Stadium==
The team plays its home matches in the [[Müngersdorfer Stadion]], also known as the RheinEnergie Stadion for sponsorship purposes. It has a seating capacity of 45,965 and the average attendance in the 2015–16 season was 48,676.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/bundesliga-2015-2016/1/ |title=Germany \" Bundesliga 2015/2016 \" Attendance \" Home matches |website=worldfootball.net |accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref> The stadium sponsorship comes from a contract with the local power supplier RheinEnergie AG. However, most fans still call the stadium \"Müngersdorfer Stadion\", named after the suburb of Müngersdorf, where it is located.

The club owns the ''Geißbockheim'' training centre currently known as ''RheinEnergieSportpark'' for sponsorship, located in [[Sülz]] which is a municipal part of Köln in the southwest of the city. The centre is home to the ''Franz-Kremer-Stadion'' being home to [[1. FC Köln II]].

The diesel drops to 119 g/km,<ref>{{cite web|author=Car supermarkets |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/alfa-romeo-giulietta-tct-review/261168 |title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta TCT review – Car and Car-Buying News – What Car? |publisher=Whatcar.com |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> while the petrol is reduced to 121 g/km,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evocarreviews/278056/driven_alfa_giulietta_tct.html |title=Driven: Alfa Romeo Giulietta 1.4 Multiair Lusso TCT review |publisher=evo |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> giving the latter best-in-class emissions and power output in its class for a petrol engine.

The Alfa Romeo Giulietta uses a new engine which utilizes a system known as [[Multiair]]. The system controls the amount of air going into the engine by controlling when air is allowed into the engine and how much the inlet valve opens. The system works by inserting a \"tappet\" between the cam shaft and the valve and the engine management system can control the amount of oil that is allowed into the \"tappet\" thus changing the effective opening profile of the inlet valve. The system can also change the overlap of the inlet and exhaust valves as well as changing the amount of lift and this allows the engine to maintain a steady pressure in the inlet manifold which is used to increase the amount of torque the engine produces while maintaining the efficiency of the engine. The system is said to increase torque by 20% while reducing emissions by a similar amount. All engines except the 1750 TBi have a [[Start&Stop]] system and all are [[Euro5]] rated.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6718104/Alfa-Romeo-Giulietta-revealed.html|title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta revealed |accessdate=19 December 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph| location=London | first=Simon | last=Arron | date=5 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091210214123/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6718104/Alfa-Romeo-Giulietta-revealed.html| archivedate= 10 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

The Giulietta was used as a hero car in the 2013 film ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]''. To promote the film, Alfa Romeo published a series of photos featuring Giuliettas that were destroyed during the film's production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/05/07/alfa-romeo-guilietta-to-star-in-fast-and-furious-6/ |title=Alfa Romeo Guilietta to star in Fast & Furious 6 [w/video] |author=Ramsey, Jonathon |publisher=Autoblog |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}</ref> In addition, six Giuliettas were offered with a dashboard plaque signed by cast members of the film, as well as the option to attend a stunt day with a stunt coordinator.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/go/news/go-news-fast-and-furious-6-fever-infects-alfa-romeo |title=Fast & Furious 6 fever infects Alfa Romeo |author=Roth, Dan |magazine=[[Road & Track]] |date=16 May 2013 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}</ref>

A NGTC-spec Giulietta entered the 2018 British Touring Car Championship by Handy Motorsport, achieving a race win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btcc.net/2017/08/27/legendary-italian-marque-alfa-romeo-to-make-btcc-return-with-handy-motorsport/|title=LEGENDARY ITALIAN MARQUE ALFA ROMEO TO MAKE BTCC RETURN WITH HANDY MOTORSPORT|date=27 August 2017|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref>

'''The Romeo Ferraris TCR Giulietta QV'''

In 2015, the Italian tuning garage [[Romeo Ferraris]] started to work, without the marques help, in the Alfa Romeo Giulietta to race in [[TCR International Series]], appearing under the banner of Mulsanne Racing, with Michela Cerruti for the first two races of the [[2016 TCR International Series|2016]] season. They returned in the 5th round in Salzburgring with second car for Petř Fulín and a new color scheme, staying in the championship until the end of the year with two cars. For 2016 season, the engine was tuned for {{convert|330|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romeoferraris.com/en/cars/giulietta-tcr/|title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV TCR|website=romeoferraris.com|accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>

In [[2017 TCR International Series|2017]], Davit Kajaia and Dusan Borković joined forces with Romeo Ferraris and raced the full TCR-season as GE-Force, taking three victories in Georgia, Bahrain and Salzburgring.

In [[2018 World Touring Car Cup|2018]], mostly because WTCC and TCR Internacional became one, the team Mulsanne Racing entered the [[World Touring Car Cup|World Touring Car Cup (WTCR)]] with two Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV for the two Alfa Romeo legends Gianni Morbidelli, which raced until Vila Real being replaced by Kevin Ceccon (who scored a race win in Suzuka), and Fabrizio Giovanardi, who was replaced in the Suzuka round by Luigi \"Gigi\" Ferrara (2nd overall in TCR Italy 2018). For 2018 season, the car produced over {{convert|350|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romeoferraris.com/automobili/giulietta-tcr/|title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta TCR|website=romeoferraris.com|language=italian|accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>

For the [[2019 World Touring Car Cup|2019 season]], the car received a major aerodynamic upgrade being renamed as \"Alfa Romeo Giulietta Veloce\". Team Mulsanne maintained Ceccon and hired Ma Qing Hua (ex-Formula E and WTCC driver). Alongside the World Cup cars, Romeo Ferraris will have about 8–10 Giuliettas racing in [[TCR Touring Car|TCR]] Italy, UK, USA, [[2019 TCR Australia Touring Car Series|Australia]] and China.

The diesel drops to 119 g/km,<ref>{{cite web|author=Car supermarkets |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/alfa-romeo-giulietta-tct-review/261168 |title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta TCT review – Car and Car-Buying News – What Car? |publisher=Whatcar.com |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> while the petrol is reduced to 121 g/km,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evocarreviews/278056/driven_alfa_giulietta_tct.html |title=Driven: Alfa Romeo Giulietta 1.4 Multiair Lusso TCT review |publisher=evo |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref> giving the latter best-in-class emissions and power output in its class for a petrol engine.

The Alfa Romeo Giulietta uses a new engine which utilizes a system known as [[Multiair]]. The system controls the amount of air going into the engine by controlling when air is allowed into the engine and how much the inlet valve opens. The system works by inserting a \"tappet\" between the cam shaft and the valve and the engine management system can control the amount of oil that is allowed into the \"tappet\" thus changing the effective opening profile of the inlet valve. The system can also change the overlap of the inlet and exhaust valves as well as changing the amount of lift and this allows the engine to maintain a steady pressure in the inlet manifold which is used to increase the amount of torque the engine produces while maintaining the efficiency of the engine. The system is said to increase torque by 20% while reducing emissions by a similar amount. All engines except the 1750 TBi have a [[Start&Stop]] system and all are [[Euro5]] rated.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6718104/Alfa-Romeo-Giulietta-revealed.html|title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta revealed |accessdate=19 December 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph| location=London | first=Simon | last=Arron | date=5 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091210214123/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6718104/Alfa-Romeo-Giulietta-revealed.html| archivedate= 10 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

A NGTC-spec Giulietta entered the 2018 British Touring Car Championship by Handy Motorsport, achieving a race win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btcc.net/2017/08/27/legendary-italian-marque-alfa-romeo-to-make-btcc-return-with-handy-motorsport/|title=LEGENDARY ITALIAN MARQUE ALFA ROMEO TO MAKE BTCC RETURN WITH HANDY MOTORSPORT|date=27 August 2017|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref>

'''The Romeo Ferraris TCR Giulietta QV'''

In 2015, the Italian tuning garage [[Romeo Ferraris]] started to work, without the marques help, in the Alfa Romeo Giulietta to race in [[TCR International Series]], appearing under the banner of Mulsanne Racing, with Michela Cerruti for the first two races of the [[2016 TCR International Series|2016]] season. They returned in the 5th round in Salzburgring with second car for Petř Fulín and a new color scheme, staying in the championship until the end of the year with two cars. For 2016 season, the engine was tuned for {{convert|330|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romeoferraris.com/en/cars/giulietta-tcr/|title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV TCR|website=romeoferraris.com|accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>

In [[2017 TCR International Series|2017]], Davit Kajaia and Dusan Borković joined forces with Romeo Ferraris and raced the full TCR-season as GE-Force, taking three victories in Georgia, Bahrain and Salzburgring.

In [[2018 World Touring Car Cup|2018]], mostly because WTCC and TCR Internacional became one, the team Mulsanne Racing entered the [[World Touring Car Cup|World Touring Car Cup (WTCR)]] with two Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV for the two Alfa Romeo legends Gianni Morbidelli, which raced until Vila Real being replaced by Kevin Ceccon (who scored a race win in Suzuka), and Fabrizio Giovanardi, who was replaced in the Suzuka round by Luigi \"Gigi\" Ferrara (2nd overall in TCR Italy 2018). For 2018 season, the car produced over {{convert|350|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.romeoferraris.com/automobili/giulietta-tcr/|title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta TCR|website=romeoferraris.com|language=italian|accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>

For the [[2019 World Touring Car Cup|2019 season]], the car received a major aerodynamic upgrade being renamed as \"Alfa Romeo Giulietta Veloce\". Team Mulsanne maintained Ceccon and hired Ma Qing Hua (ex-Formula E and WTCC driver). Alongside the World Cup cars, Romeo Ferraris will have about 8–10 Giuliettas racing in [[TCR Touring Car|TCR]] Italy, UK, USA, [[2019 TCR Australia Touring Car Series|Australia]] and China.

'''Louis the Pious''' (778 – 20 June 840), also called '''the Fair''', and '''the Debonaire''',<ref>{{lang-la|Ludovicus or Hludowicus Pius}}, {{lang-de|Ludwig der Fromme}}, {{lang-fr|Louis le Pieux}} or {{lang|fr|Louis le Débonnaire}}, {{lang|it|Ludovico il Pio}}, {{lang-es|Luis el Piadoso}} or {{lang|es|Ludovico Pío}}.</ref> was the [[King of the Franks]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor|co-emperor]] with his father, [[Charlemagne]], from 813. He was also [[King of Aquitaine]] from 781.
As the only surviving adult son of Charlemagne and [[Hildegard of the Vinzgau|Hildegard]], he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father's death in 814, a position which he held until his death, save for the period 833–34, during which he was deposed.

During his reign in Aquitaine, Louis was charged with the defence of the empire's southwestern frontier. He [[History of Barcelona#Barcelona in the Spanish March|conquered Barcelona]] from the [[Muslims]] in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over [[Pamplona]] and the [[Basques]] south of the [[Pyrenees]] in 812. As emperor he included his adult sons, [[Lothair I|Lothair]], [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], and [[Louis the German|Louis]], in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them. The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments, notably the brutal treatment of his nephew [[Bernard of Italy]], for which Louis atoned in a public act of self-debasement.

In the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons, only exacerbated by Louis's attempts to include his son [[Charles the Bald|Charles]] by his second wife in the succession plans. Though his reign ended on a high note, with order largely restored to his empire, it was followed by three years of civil war. Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father, though the problems he faced were of a distinctly different sort.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/24403332?seq=1 |title= Louis the Pious Reconsidered |publisher=  JSTOR | date=   | author=F. L. Ganshof   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref>

==Birth and rule in Aquitaine==
Louis was born while his father [[Charlemagne]] was on campaign in Spain, at the Carolingian [[Roman villa|villa]] of [[Chasseneuil-du-Poitou|Cassinogilum]], according to [[Einhard]] and the anonymous chronicler called [[Astronomus]]; the place is usually identified with [[Chasseneuil-du-Poitou|Chasseneuil]], near Poitiers.<ref>Einhard gives the name of his birthplace as ''Cassanoilum''. In addition to Chasseneuil near Poitiers, scholars have suggested that Louis may have been born at Casseneuil (Lot et Garonne) or at Casseuil on the [[Garonne]] near La Réole, where the Dropt flows into the Garonne.</ref> He was the third son of Charlemagne by his wife [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]].<ref name=jong>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/15388945/The_Penitential_State._Authority_and_Atonement_in_the_Ages_of_Louis_the_Pious_814-840_Cambridge_2009_._Second_proofs |title= The Penitential State.

Louis was crowned [[King of Aquitaine]] as a three year old child in 781.<ref>Pierre Riche, ''The Carolingians: The Family who Forged Europe'', transl. Michael Idomir Allen, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 116.</ref> In the following year he was sent to Aquitaine accompanied by [[regent]]s and a court. Charlemagne constituted this sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his realm after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under [[Waiofar|Waifer]] (capitulated ''c''. 768) and later [[Hunald II]], which culminated in the disastrous [[Battle of Roncesvalles]] (778). Charlemagne wanted his son Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign. However, in 785, wary of the customs his son may have been taking in Aquitaine, Charlemagne, who after Hildegard's death in 783, had remarried Fastrada, sent for Louis in 785. Louis presented himself in Saxony at the royal [[Council of Paderborn]] dressed in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army.<ref name=jong/>

In 794, Charlemagne gave four former [[Gallo-Roman]] villas to Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: [[Doué-la-Fontaine]] in today's [[Anjou]], [[Ebreuil]] in Allier, [[Angeac-Charente]], and the disputed Cassinogilum. Charlemagne's intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs. Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at a young age. The marches - peripheral principalities - played a vital role as bullwarks against exterior threats to the empire. Louis reigned over the [[Spanish March]]. In 797, [[Barcelona]], the largest city of the ''Marca'', fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]] and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including [[Gascons]] with their duke [[Sancho I of Gascony]], [[Provence|Provençals]] under [[Leibulf of Provence|Leibulf]], and [[Visigoths|Goths]] under [[Bera, Count of Barcelona|Bera]], over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|author=David Levering Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570–1215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zxuar_ISdcUC&pg=PA312|date=12 January 2009|publisher=W.

However, the princes were not given independence from central authority as Charlemagne wished to implant in them the concepts of empire and unity by sending them on remote military expeditions. Louis joined his brother Pippin at the [[Mezzogiorno]] campaign in Italy against the Duke Grimoald of [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]] at least once.<ref name=jong/>

[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne crowns Louis the Pious]]
Louis was one of Charlemagne's three legitimate sons to survive infancy. His twin brother, Lothair died during infancy. According to the  Frankish custom of [[partible inheritance]], Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, [[Charles the Younger]], [[King of Neustria]], and [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]], [[King of Italy]]. In the ''Divisio Regnorum'' of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], while giving Pepin the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added [[Septimania]], Provence, and part of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. However, Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died – Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 – and Louis was crowned co-emperor with an already ailing Charlemagne in Aachen in 813. On his father's death in 814, he inherited the entire Carolingian Empire and all its possessions (with the sole exception of the kingdom of Italy; although within Louis's empire, in 813 Charlemagne had ordered that [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]], Pepin's son be made and called king).<ref name=jong/><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvd1c74c.6?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=%22Louis+the+Pious%22&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3D%2522Louis%2Bthe%2BPious%2522%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-4946%2Fcontrol&refreqid=search%3A0f8a6e321ca88a12d44dd4db92ec2a9d&seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents |title= Framing the Carolingian Reforms: The Early Years of Louis the Pious|publisher=  JSTOR | date=   | author=Rutger Kramer  | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref>

Upon arriving at the imperial court in Aachen in an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety on both sides, Louis's first act was to purge the palace of what he considered undesirable. He destroyed the old Germanic [[pagan]] tokens and texts which had been collected by Charlemagne. He further exiled members of the court he deemed morally \"dissolute\", including some of his own relatives.<ref name=booker>{{Cite book| isbn = 978-0-8122-0138-3| last = Booker| first = Courtney M| title = Past Convictions: The Penance of Louis the Pious and the Decline of the Carolingians| date = 2012| doi = 10.9783/9780812201383}}{{subscription|via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>

He quickly sent all of his many unmarried (half-)sisters and nieces to nunneries in order to avoid any possible entanglements from overly powerful brothers-in-law.<ref name=\"Driscoll194\" /> Sparing his illegitimate half-brothers Drogo, Hugh and Theoderic, he forced his father's cousins, [[Adalard of Corbie|Adalard]] and [[Wala of Corbie|Wala]] to be [[Tonsure#History|tonsured]], placing them in into monastic exile at St-Philibert on the island of [[Noirmoutier]] and [[Corbie]], respectively, despite the latter's initial loyalty.<ref>''Church Architecture and Liturgy in the Carolingian Era'', Michael S. Driscoll, ''A Companion to the Eucharist in the Middle Ages'', 195.</ref>

He made [[Bernard of Septimania|Bernard, margrave of Septimania]], and [[Ebbo]], [[Archbishop of Reims]] his chief counsellors. The latter, born a serf, was raised by Louis to that office, but betrayed him later. He retained some of his father's ministers, such as Elisachar, abbot of [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|St. Maximin]] near [[Trier]], and [[Hildebold]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]]. Later he replaced Elisachar with [[Hilduin|Hildwin]], abbot of many monasteries.<ref name=\"Poupardin2017\">{{cite book|author=Rene Poupardin|title=Louis the Pious and the Carolingian Kingdoms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLZ4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT28|date=5 December 2017|publisher=Jovian Press|isbn=978-1-5378-0424-8|pages=28–}}</ref>

===''Ordinatio imperii''===
[[File:Wgt Stifterbüchlein 11v.jpg|thumb|left|[[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Empress Judith]], 2nd wife of Emperor Louis (from a manuscript around 1510)]]
On 9 April 817, [[Maundy Thursday]], Louis and his court were crossing a wooden gallery from the cathedral to the palace in Aachen when the gallery collapsed, killing many. Louis, having barely survived and feeling the imminent danger of death, began planning for his succession. Three months later among the approval of his Aachen court and the clergy he issued an imperial decree of eighteen chapters, the ''Ordinatio Imperii'', that laid out plans for an orderly dynastic succession. The term ''Ordinatio Imperii'' is a modern (19th century) creation. The decree is called ''divisio imperii'' in the only surviving contemporary manuscript.<ref name=jong/> 

In 815, Louis had already given his two eldest sons a share in the government, when he had sent his elder sons [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] to govern [[Bavaria]] and Aquitaine respectively, though without the royal titles. He proceeded to divide the empire among his three sons:

* Lothair was proclaimed and crowned co-emperor in Aachen by his father. He was promised the succession to most of the Frankish dominions (excluding the exceptions below), and would be the overlord of his brothers and cousin.
* Pepin was proclaimed King of Aquitaine, his territory including Gascony, the march around Toulouse, and the counties of Carcassonne, Autun, Avallon and Nevers.
* [[Louis the German|Louis]], the youngest son, was proclaimed King of Bavaria and the neighbouring marches.

If one of the subordinate kings died, he was to be succeeded by his sons. If he died childless, Lothair would inherit his kingdom. In the event of Lothair dying without sons, one of Louis the Pious' younger sons would be chosen to replace him by \"the people\". Above all, the Empire would not be divided: the Emperor would rule supreme over the subordinate kings, whose obedience to him was mandatory.

With this settlement, Louis attempted to combine his sense for the Empire's unity, supported by the clergy, while at the same time providing positions for all of his sons. Instead of treating his sons equally in status and land, he elevated his first-born son Lothair above his younger brothers and gave him the largest part of the Empire as his share.

The decree failed to create order as it omitted Bernard, who immediately began to conspire. When Louis began to issue changes in favor of his second wife [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith's]] son [[Charles the Bald]], his sons Lothar, Pepin and Louis refused to accept. The rule of sons being favoured over brothers in succession remained also untouched.<ref name=jong/>

===Bernard's rebellion and Louis's penance===
[[File:Louis the Pious.jpg|thumb|Louis the Pious doing penance at Attigny in 822]]
The ''ordinatio imperii'' of Aachen left Bernard in Italy in an uncertain and subordinate position as king of Italy, and he began plotting to declare independence. Upon hearing of this, Louis immediately directed his army towards Italy, and headed for [[Chalon-sur-Saône]]. Intimidated by the emperor's swift action, Bernard met his uncle at Chalon, under invitation, and surrendered. He was taken to Aachen by Louis, who there had him tried and condemned to death for treason. Louis had the sentence commuted to blinding, which was duly carried out; Bernard did not survive the ordeal, however, dying after two days of agony. Others also suffered: [[Theodulf of Orléans]], in eclipse since the death of Charlemagne, was accused of having supported the rebellion, and was thrown into a monastic prison, dying soon afterwards; it was rumored that he had been poisoned.<ref>''The Frankish Kingdoms, 814–898: The West'', Janet L. Nelson, ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, 700–900'', Vol. II, ed. Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 1995), 114.</ref> The fate of his nephew deeply marked Louis's conscience for the rest of his life.

In 822, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed [[penance]] for causing Bernard's death, at his palace of [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] near Vouziers in the [[Ardennes]], before [[Pope Paschal I]], and a council of clerics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three younger half-brothers, [[Hugh (abbot of Saint-Quentin)|Hugo]] whom he soon made abbot of St-Quentin, [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] whom he soon made [[Bishop of Metz]], and Theodoric. This act of contrition, partly in emulation of [[Theodosius I]], had the effect of greatly reducing his prestige as a Frankish ruler, for he also recited a list of minor offences about which no secular ruler of the time would have taken any notice. He also made the egregious error of releasing Wala and Adalard from their monastic confinements, placing the former in a position of power in the court of Lothair and the latter in a position in his own house.<ref name=jong/>

===Frontier wars===
{{unref|section|date=February 2020}}
[[File:Louis le Pieu denier Sens 818 823.jpg|left|thumb|Louis on a ''[[denarius]]'' from [[Sens]], 818–823]]
At the start of Louis's reign, the many tribes – [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Obotrites]], [[Slovenes]], [[Bretons]], [[Basques]] – which inhabited his frontierlands were still in awe of the Frankish emperor's power and dared not stir up any trouble. In 816, however, the [[Sorbs]] rebelled and were quickly followed by Slavomir, chief of the Obotrites, who was captured and abandoned by his own people, being replaced by Ceadrag in 818. Soon, Ceadrag too had turned against the Franks and allied with the Danes, who were to become the greatest menace of the Franks in a short time.

A greater Slavic menace was gathering on the southeast. There, [[Ljudevit]], duke of [[Pannonia]], was harassing the border at the [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers. The [[margrave of Friuli]], [[Cadolah]], was sent out against him, but he died on campaign and, in 820, his margravate was invaded by Slovenes. In 821, an alliance was made with [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], duke of the [[Dalmatia]], and Liudewit was brought to heel. In 824 several Slav tribes in the north-western parts of [[Bulgaria]] acknowledged Louis's suzerainty and after he was reluctant to settle the matter peacefully with the Bulgarian ruler [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]], in 827 the Bulgarians attacked the Franks in [[Pannonia]] and regained their lands.

On the far southern edge of his great realm, Louis had to control the Lombard [[list of Dukes and Princes of Benevento|princes of Benevento]] whom Charlemagne had never subjugated. He extracted promises from Princes [[Grimoald IV of Benevento|Grimoald IV]] and [[Sico of Benevento|Sico]], but to no effect.

On the southwestern frontier, problems commenced early when c. 812, Louis the Pious crossed the western Pyrenees 'to settle matters' in Pamplona. The expedition made its way back north, where it narrowly escaped an ambush attempt arranged by the [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basques]] in the pass of Roncevaux thanks to the precautions he took, i.e. hostages. [[Semen Lop of Gascony|Séguin]], duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]], was then deposed by Louis in 816, possibly for failing to suppress or collaborating with the Basque revolt south of the western Pyrenees, so sparking off a Basque uprising that was duly put down by the Frankish emperor in Dax. Seguin was replaced by [[Lop III Centullo of Gascony|Lupus III]], who was dispossessed in 818 by the emperor. In 820 an assembly at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]] decided to send an expedition against the Cordoban caliphate (827). The counts in charge of the army, [[Hugh of Tours|Hugh]], count of [[Tours]], and [[Matfrid of Orléans|Matfrid]], count of [[Orléans]], were slow in acting and the expedition came to naught.

===First civil war===
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}
[[File:Bibliothèque nationale de France - Bible de Vivien Ms. Latin 1 folio 423r détail Le comte Vivien offre le manuscrit de la Bible faite à l'abbaye de Saint-Martin de Tours à Charles le Chauve.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Louis's son [[Charles the Bald]] as depicted in the [[First Bible of Charles the Bald|Vivian Bible]], c. 845]]
In 818, as Louis was returning from a campaign to [[Brittany]], he was greeted by news of the death of his wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye|Ermengarde]]. Ermengarde was the daughter of [[Ingerman, Count of Hesbania|Ingerman]], the duke of Hesbaye. Louis had been close to his wife, who had been involved in policymaking. It was rumoured that she had played a part in her nephew's death and Louis himself believed her own death was divine retribution for that event. It took many months for his courtiers and advisors to convince him to remarry, but eventually he did, in 820, to [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith]], daughter of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], count of [[Altdorf (Weingarten)|Altdorf]]. In 823 Judith gave birth to a son, who was named [[Charles the Bald|Charles]].

The birth of this son damaged the ''Partition of Aachen'', as Louis's attempts to provide for his fourth son met with stiff resistance from his older sons, and the last two decades of his reign were marked by civil war.

At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 829, Louis gave [[Alemannia]] to Charles, with the title of king or duke (historians differ on this), thus enraging his son and co-emperor Lothair,<ref>Paired gold medallions of father and son had been struck on the occasion of the synod of Paris (825) that asserted Frankish claims as emperor, recently denigrated by the Byzantines; see Karl F. Morrison, \"The Gold Medallions of Louis the Pious and Lothaire I and the Synod of Paris (825)\" ''Speculum'' '''36'''.4 (October 1961:592–599).</ref> whose promised share was thereby diminished. An insurrection was soon at hand.

With the urging of the vengeful Wala and the cooperation of his brothers, Lothair accused Judith of having committed adultery with Bernard of Septimania, even suggesting Bernard to be the true father of Charles. Ebbo and Hildwin abandoned the emperor at that point, Bernard having risen to greater heights than either of them. [[Agobard]], [[Archbishop of Lyon]], and Jesse of Amiens, [[bishop of Amiens]], too, opposed the redivision of the empire and lent their episcopal prestige to the rebels.

In 830, at Wala's insistence that Bernard of Septimania was plotting against him, Pepin of Aquitaine led an army of [[Gascony|Gascon]]s, with the support of the Neustrian magnates, all the way to Paris. At [[Verberie]], Louis the German joined him. At that time, the emperor returned from another campaign in Brittany to find his empire at war with itself. He marched as far as [[Compiègne]], an ancient royal town, before being surrounded by Pepin's forces and captured. Judith was incarcerated at [[Poitiers]] and Bernard fled to Barcelona.

Then Lothair finally set out with a large Lombard army, but Louis had promised his sons Louis the German and Pepin of Aquitaine greater shares of the inheritance, prompting them to shift loyalties in favour of their father. When Lothair tried to call a general council of the realm in [[Nijmegen]], in the heart of [[Austrasia]], the Austrasians and Rhinelanders came with a following of armed retainers, and the disloyal sons were forced to free their father and bow at his feet (831). Lothair was pardoned, but disgraced and banished to Italy.

Pepin returned to Aquitaine and Judith – after being forced to humiliate herself with a solemn oath of innocence – to Louis's court. Only Wala was severely dealt with, making his way to a secluded monastery on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]]. Although [[Hilduin]], abbot of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Denis]], was exiled to [[Paderborn]] and Elisachar and Matfrid were deprived of their honours north of the Alps; they did not lose their freedom.<ref name=jong/>

===Second civil war===
The next revolt occurred a mere two years later, in 832. The disaffected Pepin was summoned to his father's court, where he was so poorly received he left against his father's orders. Immediately, fearing that Pepin would be stirred up to revolt by his nobles and desiring to reform his morals, Louis the Pious summoned all his forces to meet in Aquitaine in preparation of an uprising, but Louis the German garnered an army of [[Slavic peoples|Slav]] allies and conquered [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]] before the emperor could react. Once again the elder Louis divided his vast realm. At [[Jonac]], he declared Charles king of Aquitaine and deprived Pepin (he was less harsh with the younger Louis), restoring the whole rest of the empire to Lothair, not yet involved in the civil war. Lothair was, however, interested in usurping his father's authority. His ministers had been in contact with Pepin and may have convinced him and Louis the German to rebel, promising him Alemannia, the kingdom of Charles.

Soon Lothair, with the support of [[Pope Gregory IV]], whom he had confirmed in office without his father's support, joined the revolt in 833. While Louis was at Worms gathering a new force, Lothair marched north. Louis marched south. The armies met on the plains of the Rothfeld. There, Gregory met the emperor and may have tried to sow dissension amongst his ranks. Soon much of Louis's army had evaporated before his eyes, and he ordered his few remaining followers to go, because \"it would be a pity if any man lost his life or limb on my account.\" The resigned emperor was taken to [[Abbey of Saint-Médard de Soissons|Saint-Médard de Soissons]], his son Charles to [[Prüm]], and the queen to [[Tortona]]. The despicable show of disloyalty and disingenuousness earned the site the name [[Field of Lies]], or Lügenfeld, or Campus Mendacii, ''ubi plurimorum fidelitas exstincta est''.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0459/_P16.HTM].</ref>

[[File:Louis le Pieux sesquisolidus 814 840.jpg|thumb|Louis on a ''[[sesquisolidus]]'', essentially Roman in design.<ref>''Medieval European Coinage'' by [[Philip Grierson]], Mark Blackburn, [[Lucia Travaini]], p. 329 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkz9NGFXIMC&pg=PA327&dq=manqush+coin#PPA329,M1]</ref>]]

On 13 November 833, [[Ebbo]], with [[Agobard of Lyon]], presided over a synod at the Church of Saint Medard in Soissons which saw Louis undertake public [[penance]] for the second time in his reign. The penitential ritual that was undertaken began when Louis arrived at the church and confessed multiple times to the crimes levied against him. The crimes had been historic and recent, with accusations of oath breaking, violation of the public peace and inability to control his adulterous wife, [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]].<ref> Mayke De Jong, \"Power and Humility in Carolingian society: the Public Penance of Louis the Pious\", ''Early Medieval Europe'' 1 (1992). p. 29. </ref> Afterwards, he threw his sword belt at the base of the altar and received judgement through the imposition of the hands of the bishops.<ref> Agobard, \"Personal Attestation to the Penance of Louis the Pious\" in Lievan Van Acker (ed.) ''Corpus Christianorum Continuatio Medievalis '', trans. Courtney M. Booker (Turnhout, 1981). p. 324. </ref>  Louis was to live the rest of his life as a penitent, never to hold office again.<ref> Mayke De Jong, ''The Penitential State: Authority and Atonement in the Age of Louis the Pious, 814–840 '' (Cambridge, 2009), pp. 1–3. </ref> The penance divided the aristocracy. The anonymous biographer of the [[Vita Hludovici]] criticized the whole affair on the basis that God does not judge twice for sins committed and confessed.<ref> The Astronomer, ''The Life of Emperor Louis'', trans. Thomas F.X. Noble (Pennsylvania, 2009), p. 282. </ref> Lothair's allies were generously compensated. Ebbo himself received the monastery of [[St Vaast]] whilst [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] was allowed to keep the lands reclaimed from his father. 

Men like [[Rabanus Maurus]], Louis' younger half-brothers Drogo and Hugh, and Emma, Judith's sister and Louis the German's new wife, worked on the younger Louis to make peace with his father, for the sake of unity of the empire. The humiliation to which Louis was then subjected at Notre Dame in Compiègne turned the loyal barons of Austrasia and [[Saxony]] against Lothair, and the usurper fled to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], skirmishing with loyalists near [[Chalon-sur-Saône]]. Louis was restored the next year, on 1 March 834.

On Lothair's return to Italy, Wala, Jesse, and Matfrid, formerly count of Orléans, died of a pestilence. On 2 February 835 at the palace [[Thionville]], Louis presided over a general council to deal with the events of the previous year. Known as the [[Synod of Thionville]], Louis himself was reinvested with his ancestral garb and the crown, symbols of [[Carolingian]] rulership. Furthermore, the penance of 833 was officially reversed and Archbishop  [[Ebbo]] officially resigned after confessing to a capital crime, whilst [[Agobard of Lyon]] and Bartholmew, Archbishop of Narbonne were also deposed.<ref> ''The Annals of Saint Bertin'', trans. Janet L. Nelson (Manchester, 1991), pp. 32–33. </ref> Later that year Lothair fell ill; once again the events turned in Louis favour.

In 836, however, the family made peace and Louis restored Pepin and Louis, deprived Lothair of all save Italy, and gave it to Charles in a new division, given at the diet of [[Crémieu]]. At about that time, the [[Vikings]] terrorized and sacked [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Antwerp]]. In 837, they went up the [[Rhine]] as far as Nijmegen, and their king, [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]], demanded the [[weregild]] of some of his followers killed on previous expeditions before Louis the Pious mustered a massive force and marched against them. They fled, but it would not be the last time they harried the northern coasts. In 838, they even claimed sovereignty over [[Frisia]], but a treaty was confirmed between them and the Franks in 839. Louis the Pious ordered the construction of a North Sea fleet and the sending of ''[[missus dominicus|missi dominici]]'' into Frisia to establish Frankish sovereignty there.<ref name=jong/><ref name=\"Riche1993\">{{cite book|author=Pierre Riche|title=The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcjy7bCmFL0C|year=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1342-4}}</ref>

===Third civil war===
In 837, Louis crowned Charles king over all of Alemannia and Burgundy and gave him a portion of his brother Louis' land. Louis the German promptly rose in revolt, and the emperor redivided his realm again at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], giving all of the young king of Bavaria's lands, save Bavaria itself, to Charles. Emperor Louis did not stop there, however. His devotion to Charles knew no bounds. When Pepin died in 838, Louis declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine. The nobles, however, elected Pepin's son [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]]. When Louis threatened invasion, the third great civil war of his reign broke out. In the spring of 839, Louis the German invaded Swabia, Pepin II and his Gascon subjects fought all the way to the [[Loire]], and the Danes returned to ravage the [[Frisia]]n coast (sacking [[Dorestad]] for a second time).

Lothair, for the first time in a long time, allied with his father and pledged support at Worms in exchange for a redivision of the inheritance. At a final ''[[placitum]]'' held at Worms on 20 May, Louis gave Bavaria to Louis the German and disinherited Pepin II, leaving the entire remainder of the empire to be divided roughly into an eastern part and a western. Lothair was given the choice of which partition he would inherit and he chose the eastern, including Italy, leaving the western for Charles. The emperor quickly subjugated Aquitaine and had Charles recognised by the nobles and clergy at [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-en-Auvergne]] in 840. Louis then, in a final flash of glory, rushed into Bavaria and forced the younger Louis into the [[March of Pannonia|Ostmark]]. The empire now settled as he had declared it at Worms, he returned in July to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he disbanded the army. The final civil war of his reign was over.<ref name=jong/><ref name=\"Riche1993\"/>

===Death===
[[File:Partage de l'Empire carolingien au Traité de Verdun en 843.JPG|thumb|200px|The parting of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.]]
Louis fell ill soon after his final victorious campaigns and retreated to his summer hunting lodge on an island in the Rhine near his [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|palace at Ingelheim]]. He died on 20 June 840 in the presence of many bishops and clerics and in the arms of his half-brother Drogo as he pardoned his son Louis, proclaimed Lothair emperor and commended the absent Charles and Judith to his protection. 

Soon dispute plunged the surviving brothers into yet another civil war. It lasted until 843 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Verdun]], in which the division of the empire into three souvereign entities was settled. [[West Francia]] and [[East Francia]] became the kernels of modern France and Germany respectively. [[Middle Francia]], that included [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], the [[Low Countries]] and northern Italy among other regions was only short-lived until 855 and later reorganized as [[Lotharingia]].<ref name=\"Riddle2008\">{{cite book|author=John M.

'''Louis the Pious''' (778 – 20 June 840), also called '''the Fair''', and '''the Debonaire''',<ref>{{lang-la|Ludovicus or Hludowicus Pius}}, {{lang-de|Ludwig der Fromme}}, {{lang-fr|Louis le Pieux}} or {{lang|fr|Louis le Débonnaire}}, {{lang|it|Ludovico il Pio}}, {{lang-es|Luis el Piadoso}} or {{lang|es|Ludovico Pío}}.</ref> was the [[King of the Franks]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor|co-emperor]] with his father, [[Charlemagne]], from 813. He was also [[King of Aquitaine]] from 781.
As the only surviving adult son of Charlemagne and [[Hildegard of the Vinzgau|Hildegard]], he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father's death in 814, a position which he held until his death, save for the period 833–34, during which he was deposed.

During his reign in Aquitaine, Louis was charged with the defence of the empire's southwestern frontier. He [[History of Barcelona#Barcelona in the Spanish March|conquered Barcelona]] from the [[Muslims]] in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over [[Pamplona]] and the [[Basques]] south of the [[Pyrenees]] in 812. As emperor he included his adult sons, [[Lothair I|Lothair]], [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], and [[Louis the German|Louis]], in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them. The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments, notably the brutal treatment of his nephew [[Bernard of Italy]], for which Louis atoned in a public act of self-debasement.

In the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons, only exacerbated by Louis's attempts to include his son [[Charles the Bald|Charles]] by his second wife in the succession plans. Though his reign ended on a high note, with order largely restored to his empire, it was followed by three years of civil war. Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father, though the problems he faced were of a distinctly different sort.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/24403332?seq=1 |title= Louis the Pious Reconsidered |publisher=  JSTOR | date=   | author=F.

==Birth and rule in Aquitaine==
Louis was born while his father [[Charlemagne]] was on campaign in Spain, at the Carolingian [[Roman villa|villa]] of [[Chasseneuil-du-Poitou|Cassinogilum]], according to [[Einhard]] and the anonymous chronicler called [[Astronomus]]; the place is usually identified with [[Chasseneuil-du-Poitou|Chasseneuil]], near Poitiers.<ref>Einhard gives the name of his birthplace as ''Cassanoilum''. In addition to Chasseneuil near Poitiers, scholars have suggested that Louis may have been born at Casseneuil (Lot et Garonne) or at Casseuil on the [[Garonne]] near La Réole, where the Dropt flows into the Garonne.</ref> He was the third son of Charlemagne by his wife [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]].<ref name=jong>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/15388945/The_Penitential_State._Authority_and_Atonement_in_the_Ages_of_Louis_the_Pious_814-840_Cambridge_2009_._Second_proofs |title= The Penitential State.

Louis was crowned [[King of Aquitaine]] as a three year old child in 781.<ref>Pierre Riche, ''The Carolingians: The Family who Forged Europe'', transl. Michael Idomir Allen, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 116.</ref> In the following year he was sent to Aquitaine accompanied by [[regent]]s and a court. Charlemagne constituted this sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his realm after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under [[Waiofar|Waifer]] (capitulated ''c''. 768) and later [[Hunald II]], which culminated in the disastrous [[Battle of Roncesvalles]] (778). Charlemagne wanted his son Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign. However, in 785, wary of the customs his son may have been taking in Aquitaine, Charlemagne, who after Hildegard's death in 783, had remarried Fastrada, sent for Louis in 785. Louis presented himself in Saxony at the royal [[Council of Paderborn]] dressed in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army.<ref name=jong/>

In 794, Charlemagne gave four former [[Gallo-Roman]] villas to Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: [[Doué-la-Fontaine]] in today's [[Anjou]], [[Ebreuil]] in Allier, [[Angeac-Charente]], and the disputed Cassinogilum. Charlemagne's intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs. Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at a young age. The marches - peripheral principalities - played a vital role as bullwarks against exterior threats to the empire. Louis reigned over the [[Spanish March]]. In 797, [[Barcelona]], the largest city of the ''Marca'', fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]] and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including [[Gascons]] with their duke [[Sancho I of Gascony]], [[Provence|Provençals]] under [[Leibulf of Provence|Leibulf]], and [[Visigoths|Goths]] under [[Bera, Count of Barcelona|Bera]], over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|author=David Levering Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570–1215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zxuar_ISdcUC&pg=PA312|date=12 January 2009|publisher=W.

[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne crowns Louis the Pious]]
Louis was one of Charlemagne's three legitimate sons to survive infancy. His twin brother, Lothair died during infancy. According to the  Frankish custom of [[partible inheritance]], Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, [[Charles the Younger]], [[King of Neustria]], and [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]], [[King of Italy]]. In the ''Divisio Regnorum'' of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of [[Neustria]] and [[Austrasia]], while giving Pepin the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added [[Septimania]], Provence, and part of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. However, Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died – Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 – and Louis was crowned co-emperor with an already ailing Charlemagne in Aachen in 813. On his father's death in 814, he inherited the entire Carolingian Empire and all its possessions (with the sole exception of the kingdom of Italy; although within Louis's empire, in 813 Charlemagne had ordered that [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]], Pepin's son be made and called king).<ref name=jong/><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvd1c74c.6?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=%22Louis+the+Pious%22&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3D%2522Louis%2Bthe%2BPious%2522%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-4946%2Fcontrol&refreqid=search%3A0f8a6e321ca88a12d44dd4db92ec2a9d&seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents |title= Framing the Carolingian Reforms: The Early Years of Louis the Pious|publisher=  JSTOR | date=   | author=Rutger Kramer  | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref>

Upon arriving at the imperial court in Aachen in an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety on both sides, Louis's first act was to purge the palace of what he considered undesirable. He destroyed the old Germanic [[pagan]] tokens and texts which had been collected by Charlemagne. He further exiled members of the court he deemed morally \"dissolute\", including some of his own relatives.<ref name=booker>{{Cite book| isbn = 978-0-8122-0138-3| last = Booker| first = Courtney M| title = Past Convictions: The Penance of Louis the Pious and the Decline of the Carolingians| date = 2012| doi = 10.9783/9780812201383}}{{subscription|via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>

He quickly sent all of his many unmarried (half-)sisters and nieces to nunneries in order to avoid any possible entanglements from overly powerful brothers-in-law.<ref name=\"Driscoll194\" /> Sparing his illegitimate half-brothers Drogo, Hugh and Theoderic, he forced his father's cousins, [[Adalard of Corbie|Adalard]] and [[Wala of Corbie|Wala]] to be [[Tonsure#History|tonsured]], placing them in into monastic exile at St-Philibert on the island of [[Noirmoutier]] and [[Corbie]], respectively, despite the latter's initial loyalty.<ref>''Church Architecture and Liturgy in the Carolingian Era'', Michael S. Driscoll, ''A Companion to the Eucharist in the Middle Ages'', 195.</ref>

He made [[Bernard of Septimania|Bernard, margrave of Septimania]], and [[Ebbo]], [[Archbishop of Reims]] his chief counsellors. The latter, born a serf, was raised by Louis to that office, but betrayed him later. He retained some of his father's ministers, such as Elisachar, abbot of [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|St. Maximin]] near [[Trier]], and [[Hildebold]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]]. Later he replaced Elisachar with [[Hilduin|Hildwin]], abbot of many monasteries.<ref name=\"Poupardin2017\">{{cite book|author=Rene Poupardin|title=Louis the Pious and the Carolingian Kingdoms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLZ4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT28|date=5 December 2017|publisher=Jovian Press|isbn=978-1-5378-0424-8|pages=28–}}</ref>

===''Ordinatio imperii''===
[[File:Wgt Stifterbüchlein 11v.jpg|thumb|left|[[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Empress Judith]], 2nd wife of Emperor Louis (from a manuscript around 1510)]]
On 9 April 817, [[Maundy Thursday]], Louis and his court were crossing a wooden gallery from the cathedral to the palace in Aachen when the gallery collapsed, killing many. Louis, having barely survived and feeling the imminent danger of death, began planning for his succession. Three months later among the approval of his Aachen court and the clergy he issued an imperial decree of eighteen chapters, the ''Ordinatio Imperii'', that laid out plans for an orderly dynastic succession. The term ''Ordinatio Imperii'' is a modern (19th century) creation. The decree is called ''divisio imperii'' in the only surviving contemporary manuscript.<ref name=jong/> 

In 815, Louis had already given his two eldest sons a share in the government, when he had sent his elder sons [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] to govern [[Bavaria]] and Aquitaine respectively, though without the royal titles. He proceeded to divide the empire among his three sons:

* Lothair was proclaimed and crowned co-emperor in Aachen by his father. He was promised the succession to most of the Frankish dominions (excluding the exceptions below), and would be the overlord of his brothers and cousin.
* Pepin was proclaimed King of Aquitaine, his territory including Gascony, the march around Toulouse, and the counties of Carcassonne, Autun, Avallon and Nevers.
* [[Louis the German|Louis]], the youngest son, was proclaimed King of Bavaria and the neighbouring marches.

If one of the subordinate kings died, he was to be succeeded by his sons. If he died childless, Lothair would inherit his kingdom. In the event of Lothair dying without sons, one of Louis the Pious' younger sons would be chosen to replace him by \"the people\". Above all, the Empire would not be divided: the Emperor would rule supreme over the subordinate kings, whose obedience to him was mandatory.

With this settlement, Louis attempted to combine his sense for the Empire's unity, supported by the clergy, while at the same time providing positions for all of his sons. Instead of treating his sons equally in status and land, he elevated his first-born son Lothair above his younger brothers and gave him the largest part of the Empire as his share.

The decree failed to create order as it omitted Bernard, who immediately began to conspire. When Louis began to issue changes in favor of his second wife [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith's]] son [[Charles the Bald]], his sons Lothar, Pepin and Louis refused to accept. The rule of sons being favoured over brothers in succession remained also untouched.<ref name=jong/>

===Bernard's rebellion and Louis's penance===
[[File:Louis the Pious.jpg|thumb|Louis the Pious doing penance at Attigny in 822]]
The ''ordinatio imperii'' of Aachen left Bernard in Italy in an uncertain and subordinate position as king of Italy, and he began plotting to declare independence. Upon hearing of this, Louis immediately directed his army towards Italy, and headed for [[Chalon-sur-Saône]]. Intimidated by the emperor's swift action, Bernard met his uncle at Chalon, under invitation, and surrendered. He was taken to Aachen by Louis, who there had him tried and condemned to death for treason. Louis had the sentence commuted to blinding, which was duly carried out; Bernard did not survive the ordeal, however, dying after two days of agony. Others also suffered: [[Theodulf of Orléans]], in eclipse since the death of Charlemagne, was accused of having supported the rebellion, and was thrown into a monastic prison, dying soon afterwards; it was rumored that he had been poisoned.<ref>''The Frankish Kingdoms, 814–898: The West'', Janet L. Nelson, ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, 700–900'', Vol. II, ed. Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 1995), 114.</ref> The fate of his nephew deeply marked Louis's conscience for the rest of his life.

In 822, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed [[penance]] for causing Bernard's death, at his palace of [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] near Vouziers in the [[Ardennes]], before [[Pope Paschal I]], and a council of clerics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three younger half-brothers, [[Hugh (abbot of Saint-Quentin)|Hugo]] whom he soon made abbot of St-Quentin, [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] whom he soon made [[Bishop of Metz]], and Theodoric. This act of contrition, partly in emulation of [[Theodosius I]], had the effect of greatly reducing his prestige as a Frankish ruler, for he also recited a list of minor offences about which no secular ruler of the time would have taken any notice. He also made the egregious error of releasing Wala and Adalard from their monastic confinements, placing the former in a position of power in the court of Lothair and the latter in a position in his own house.<ref name=jong/>

===Frontier wars===
{{unref|section|date=February 2020}}
[[File:Louis le Pieu denier Sens 818 823.jpg|left|thumb|Louis on a ''[[denarius]]'' from [[Sens]], 818–823]]
At the start of Louis's reign, the many tribes – [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Obotrites]], [[Slovenes]], [[Bretons]], [[Basques]] – which inhabited his frontierlands were still in awe of the Frankish emperor's power and dared not stir up any trouble. In 816, however, the [[Sorbs]] rebelled and were quickly followed by Slavomir, chief of the Obotrites, who was captured and abandoned by his own people, being replaced by Ceadrag in 818. Soon, Ceadrag too had turned against the Franks and allied with the Danes, who were to become the greatest menace of the Franks in a short time.

A greater Slavic menace was gathering on the southeast. There, [[Ljudevit]], duke of [[Pannonia]], was harassing the border at the [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers. The [[margrave of Friuli]], [[Cadolah]], was sent out against him, but he died on campaign and, in 820, his margravate was invaded by Slovenes. In 821, an alliance was made with [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], duke of the [[Dalmatia]], and Liudewit was brought to heel. In 824 several Slav tribes in the north-western parts of [[Bulgaria]] acknowledged Louis's suzerainty and after he was reluctant to settle the matter peacefully with the Bulgarian ruler [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]], in 827 the Bulgarians attacked the Franks in [[Pannonia]] and regained their lands.

On the far southern edge of his great realm, Louis had to control the Lombard [[list of Dukes and Princes of Benevento|princes of Benevento]] whom Charlemagne had never subjugated. He extracted promises from Princes [[Grimoald IV of Benevento|Grimoald IV]] and [[Sico of Benevento|Sico]], but to no effect.

On the southwestern frontier, problems commenced early when c. 812, Louis the Pious crossed the western Pyrenees 'to settle matters' in Pamplona. The expedition made its way back north, where it narrowly escaped an ambush attempt arranged by the [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basques]] in the pass of Roncevaux thanks to the precautions he took, i.e. hostages. [[Semen Lop of Gascony|Séguin]], duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]], was then deposed by Louis in 816, possibly for failing to suppress or collaborating with the Basque revolt south of the western Pyrenees, so sparking off a Basque uprising that was duly put down by the Frankish emperor in Dax. Seguin was replaced by [[Lop III Centullo of Gascony|Lupus III]], who was dispossessed in 818 by the emperor. In 820 an assembly at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]] decided to send an expedition against the Cordoban caliphate (827). The counts in charge of the army, [[Hugh of Tours|Hugh]], count of [[Tours]], and [[Matfrid of Orléans|Matfrid]], count of [[Orléans]], were slow in acting and the expedition came to naught.

===First civil war===
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}
[[File:Bibliothèque nationale de France - Bible de Vivien Ms. Latin 1 folio 423r détail Le comte Vivien offre le manuscrit de la Bible faite à l'abbaye de Saint-Martin de Tours à Charles le Chauve.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Louis's son [[Charles the Bald]] as depicted in the [[First Bible of Charles the Bald|Vivian Bible]], c. 845]]
In 818, as Louis was returning from a campaign to [[Brittany]], he was greeted by news of the death of his wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye|Ermengarde]]. Ermengarde was the daughter of [[Ingerman, Count of Hesbania|Ingerman]], the duke of Hesbaye. Louis had been close to his wife, who had been involved in policymaking. It was rumoured that she had played a part in her nephew's death and Louis himself believed her own death was divine retribution for that event. It took many months for his courtiers and advisors to convince him to remarry, but eventually he did, in 820, to [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Judith]], daughter of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], count of [[Altdorf (Weingarten)|Altdorf]]. In 823 Judith gave birth to a son, who was named [[Charles the Bald|Charles]].

The birth of this son damaged the ''Partition of Aachen'', as Louis's attempts to provide for his fourth son met with stiff resistance from his older sons, and the last two decades of his reign were marked by civil war.

At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 829, Louis gave [[Alemannia]] to Charles, with the title of king or duke (historians differ on this), thus enraging his son and co-emperor Lothair,<ref>Paired gold medallions of father and son had been struck on the occasion of the synod of Paris (825) that asserted Frankish claims as emperor, recently denigrated by the Byzantines; see Karl F. Morrison, \"The Gold Medallions of Louis the Pious and Lothaire I and the Synod of Paris (825)\" ''Speculum'' '''36'''.4 (October 1961:592–599).</ref> whose promised share was thereby diminished. An insurrection was soon at hand.

With the urging of the vengeful Wala and the cooperation of his brothers, Lothair accused Judith of having committed adultery with Bernard of Septimania, even suggesting Bernard to be the true father of Charles. Ebbo and Hildwin abandoned the emperor at that point, Bernard having risen to greater heights than either of them. [[Agobard]], [[Archbishop of Lyon]], and Jesse of Amiens, [[bishop of Amiens]], too, opposed the redivision of the empire and lent their episcopal prestige to the rebels.

In 830, at Wala's insistence that Bernard of Septimania was plotting against him, Pepin of Aquitaine led an army of [[Gascony|Gascon]]s, with the support of the Neustrian magnates, all the way to Paris. At [[Verberie]], Louis the German joined him. At that time, the emperor returned from another campaign in Brittany to find his empire at war with itself. He marched as far as [[Compiègne]], an ancient royal town, before being surrounded by Pepin's forces and captured. Judith was incarcerated at [[Poitiers]] and Bernard fled to Barcelona.

Then Lothair finally set out with a large Lombard army, but Louis had promised his sons Louis the German and Pepin of Aquitaine greater shares of the inheritance, prompting them to shift loyalties in favour of their father. When Lothair tried to call a general council of the realm in [[Nijmegen]], in the heart of [[Austrasia]], the Austrasians and Rhinelanders came with a following of armed retainers, and the disloyal sons were forced to free their father and bow at his feet (831). Lothair was pardoned, but disgraced and banished to Italy.

Pepin returned to Aquitaine and Judith – after being forced to humiliate herself with a solemn oath of innocence – to Louis's court. Only Wala was severely dealt with, making his way to a secluded monastery on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]]. Although [[Hilduin]], abbot of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Denis]], was exiled to [[Paderborn]] and Elisachar and Matfrid were deprived of their honours north of the Alps; they did not lose their freedom.<ref name=jong/>

===Second civil war===
The next revolt occurred a mere two years later, in 832. The disaffected Pepin was summoned to his father's court, where he was so poorly received he left against his father's orders. Immediately, fearing that Pepin would be stirred up to revolt by his nobles and desiring to reform his morals, Louis the Pious summoned all his forces to meet in Aquitaine in preparation of an uprising, but Louis the German garnered an army of [[Slavic peoples|Slav]] allies and conquered [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]] before the emperor could react. Once again the elder Louis divided his vast realm. At [[Jonac]], he declared Charles king of Aquitaine and deprived Pepin (he was less harsh with the younger Louis), restoring the whole rest of the empire to Lothair, not yet involved in the civil war. Lothair was, however, interested in usurping his father's authority. His ministers had been in contact with Pepin and may have convinced him and Louis the German to rebel, promising him Alemannia, the kingdom of Charles.

Soon Lothair, with the support of [[Pope Gregory IV]], whom he had confirmed in office without his father's support, joined the revolt in 833. While Louis was at Worms gathering a new force, Lothair marched north. Louis marched south. The armies met on the plains of the Rothfeld. There, Gregory met the emperor and may have tried to sow dissension amongst his ranks. Soon much of Louis's army had evaporated before his eyes, and he ordered his few remaining followers to go, because \"it would be a pity if any man lost his life or limb on my account.\" The resigned emperor was taken to [[Abbey of Saint-Médard de Soissons|Saint-Médard de Soissons]], his son Charles to [[Prüm]], and the queen to [[Tortona]]. The despicable show of disloyalty and disingenuousness earned the site the name [[Field of Lies]], or Lügenfeld, or Campus Mendacii, ''ubi plurimorum fidelitas exstincta est''.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0459/_P16.HTM].</ref>

On 13 November 833, [[Ebbo]], with [[Agobard of Lyon]], presided over a synod at the Church of Saint Medard in Soissons which saw Louis undertake public [[penance]] for the second time in his reign. The penitential ritual that was undertaken began when Louis arrived at the church and confessed multiple times to the crimes levied against him. The crimes had been historic and recent, with accusations of oath breaking, violation of the public peace and inability to control his adulterous wife, [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]].<ref> Mayke De Jong, \"Power and Humility in Carolingian society: the Public Penance of Louis the Pious\", ''Early Medieval Europe'' 1 (1992). p. 29. </ref> Afterwards, he threw his sword belt at the base of the altar and received judgement through the imposition of the hands of the bishops.<ref> Agobard, \"Personal Attestation to the Penance of Louis the Pious\" in Lievan Van Acker (ed.)

Ebbo himself received the monastery of [[St Vaast]] whilst [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]] was allowed to keep the lands reclaimed from his father. 

Men like [[Rabanus Maurus]], Louis' younger half-brothers Drogo and Hugh, and Emma, Judith's sister and Louis the German's new wife, worked on the younger Louis to make peace with his father, for the sake of unity of the empire. The humiliation to which Louis was then subjected at Notre Dame in Compiègne turned the loyal barons of Austrasia and [[Saxony]] against Lothair, and the usurper fled to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], skirmishing with loyalists near [[Chalon-sur-Saône]]. Louis was restored the next year, on 1 March 834.

On Lothair's return to Italy, Wala, Jesse, and Matfrid, formerly count of Orléans, died of a pestilence. On 2 February 835 at the palace [[Thionville]], Louis presided over a general council to deal with the events of the previous year. Known as the [[Synod of Thionville]], Louis himself was reinvested with his ancestral garb and the crown, symbols of [[Carolingian]] rulership. Furthermore, the penance of 833 was officially reversed and Archbishop  [[Ebbo]] officially resigned after confessing to a capital crime, whilst [[Agobard of Lyon]] and Bartholmew, Archbishop of Narbonne were also deposed.<ref> ''The Annals of Saint Bertin'', trans. Janet L. Nelson (Manchester, 1991), pp. 32–33. </ref> Later that year Lothair fell ill; once again the events turned in Louis favour.

In 836, however, the family made peace and Louis restored Pepin and Louis, deprived Lothair of all save Italy, and gave it to Charles in a new division, given at the diet of [[Crémieu]]. At about that time, the [[Vikings]] terrorized and sacked [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Antwerp]]. In 837, they went up the [[Rhine]] as far as Nijmegen, and their king, [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]], demanded the [[weregild]] of some of his followers killed on previous expeditions before Louis the Pious mustered a massive force and marched against them. They fled, but it would not be the last time they harried the northern coasts. In 838, they even claimed sovereignty over [[Frisia]], but a treaty was confirmed between them and the Franks in 839. Louis the Pious ordered the construction of a North Sea fleet and the sending of ''[[missus dominicus|missi dominici]]'' into Frisia to establish Frankish sovereignty there.<ref name=jong/><ref name=\"Riche1993\">{{cite book|author=Pierre Riche|title=The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcjy7bCmFL0C|year=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1342-4}}</ref>

===Third civil war===
In 837, Louis crowned Charles king over all of Alemannia and Burgundy and gave him a portion of his brother Louis' land. Louis the German promptly rose in revolt, and the emperor redivided his realm again at [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], giving all of the young king of Bavaria's lands, save Bavaria itself, to Charles. Emperor Louis did not stop there, however. His devotion to Charles knew no bounds. When Pepin died in 838, Louis declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine. The nobles, however, elected Pepin's son [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]]. When Louis threatened invasion, the third great civil war of his reign broke out. In the spring of 839, Louis the German invaded Swabia, Pepin II and his Gascon subjects fought all the way to the [[Loire]], and the Danes returned to ravage the [[Frisia]]n coast (sacking [[Dorestad]] for a second time).

Lothair, for the first time in a long time, allied with his father and pledged support at Worms in exchange for a redivision of the inheritance. At a final ''[[placitum]]'' held at Worms on 20 May, Louis gave Bavaria to Louis the German and disinherited Pepin II, leaving the entire remainder of the empire to be divided roughly into an eastern part and a western. Lothair was given the choice of which partition he would inherit and he chose the eastern, including Italy, leaving the western for Charles. The emperor quickly subjugated Aquitaine and had Charles recognised by the nobles and clergy at [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-en-Auvergne]] in 840. Louis then, in a final flash of glory, rushed into Bavaria and forced the younger Louis into the [[March of Pannonia|Ostmark]]. The empire now settled as he had declared it at Worms, he returned in July to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he disbanded the army. The final civil war of his reign was over.<ref name=jong/><ref name=\"Riche1993\"/>

===Death===
[[File:Partage de l'Empire carolingien au Traité de Verdun en 843.JPG|thumb|200px|The parting of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.]]
Louis fell ill soon after his final victorious campaigns and retreated to his summer hunting lodge on an island in the Rhine near his [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|palace at Ingelheim]]. He died on 20 June 840 in the presence of many bishops and clerics and in the arms of his half-brother Drogo as he pardoned his son Louis, proclaimed Lothair emperor and commended the absent Charles and Judith to his protection. 

Soon dispute plunged the surviving brothers into yet another civil war. It lasted until 843 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Verdun]], in which the division of the empire into three souvereign entities was settled. [[West Francia]] and [[East Francia]] became the kernels of modern France and Germany respectively. [[Middle Francia]], that included [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], the [[Low Countries]] and northern Italy among other regions was only short-lived until 855 and later reorganized as [[Lotharingia]].<ref name=\"Riddle2008\">{{cite book|author=John M.

'''''Total Recall''''' is a 1990 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]] and starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Rachel Ticotin]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Ronny Cox]], and [[Michael Ironside]]. The film is loosely based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\".

The film tells the story of a construction worker who suddenly finds himself embroiled in espionage on [[Mars]] and unable to determine if the experiences are real or the result of memory implants. It was written by [[Ronald Shusett]], [[Dan O'Bannon]], [[Jon Povill]], and [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]], and won a [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for its [[visual effects]]. The [[Film score|original score]], composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], won the [[BMI Awards|BMI Film Music Award]].

With a budget of $50–60 million, ''Total Recall'' was [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films made]] at the time of its release,<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite book|last=Keesey|first=Douglas|year=2005|title=Paul Verhoeven|pages=119, 123|isbn=3-8228-3101-8}}</ref> although estimates of its production budget vary and whether it ever actually held the record is not certain.

==Plot==
In 2084, construction worker Douglas Quaid is having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there. His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting a rebellion. At Rekall, a company that provides memory implants of vacations, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent. However, something goes wrong during the procedure, and Quaid starts revealing suppressed memories of actually being a secret agent. The Rekall employees sedate him, wipe his memory of the visit, and send him home. On the way, Quaid is attacked by his friend Harry and other men, and is forced to kill them. He is then ambushed in his apartment by Lori, who states that she isn't his wife; their marriage is a false memory implant, and \"The Agency\" sent her to monitor Quaid. Quaid knocks Lori out and runs off, pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband.

After evading his attackers, Quaid is left a suitcase containing money, gadgets, fake IDs, and a video recording. The video is of Quaid himself, who identifies himself as Hauser and explains that he used to work for Cohaagen, but switched sides after learning about an alien artifact on Mars and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself. Hauser instructs Quaid to remove a tracking device located inside his skull before ordering him to go to Mars. On arrival, Quaid finds a note from Hauser directing him to Venusville, populated by people mutated as a result of poor radiation shielding. He meets Benny, a taxi driver, and Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that he is still working for Cohaagen.

Quaid later encounters Rekall's Dr. Edgemar and Lori. Edgemar states that he is from Rekall and was implanted in Quaid, asserting that he suffered a \"schizoid embolism\" and is trapped in a fantasy from the implanted memories. His solution is to take an offered pill to wake up, or he will otherwise be lobotomized. Seeing sweat on Edgemar's face and realizing he isn't an implant, Quaid refuses the pill and shoots him, just as Richter's men burst into the room. Led by Lori, the men capture Quaid. Melina arrives to aid Quaid, recognizing Quaid to be truthful, and in their escape Quaid kills Lori. 

They flee to Venusville with Benny, and are ushered into a secret tunnel. Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation, slowly asphyxiating its citizens. Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to the mutant Kuato, conjoined to his brother George. Kuato reads Quaid's mind recalling a discussion with Cohaagen and Richter about the Martian artifact and its unknown purpose. Cohaagen's forces burst in and kill most of the resistance. Quaid, George/Kuato, Melina & Benny escape to an airlock. Benny kills George and reveals that he works for Cohaagen. Kuato implores Quaid to activate the reactor before being shot by Richter.

Quaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who explains that the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and expose Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina re-programmed as Hauser's obedient \"babe\", but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located. Benny attacks them in an excavation machine, but Quaid kills him. Quaid and Melina then outwit and kill Richter and his men lying in ambush for them.

Quaid reaches the reactor control room, where Cohaagen is waiting with a bomb, claiming starting the reactor will destroy them all. Melina arrives and shoots Cohaagen, but he starts the bomb timer. Quaid throws the bomb down the tunnel, blowing the door open and causing an [[explosive decompression]]. Quaid pushes Cohaagen aside, and Cohaagen is blown out onto the surface, where he suffocates and dies. Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor rods deploy, [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] the turbinium glacier underneath and releasing gas, which bursts from a mountain and forms a breathable planetary atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina, Venusville, and the rest of Mars' population. As the Mars humans and mutants stand on an outcropping looking at the newly blue sky, Quaid momentarily pauses to wonder whether he is dreaming or not, before turning to kiss Melina.

==Cast==
{{div col begin}}
* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who discovers that he is actually a secret agent formerly named Carl Hauser, and travels to Mars to uncover his true identity and why his memory was erased.
* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Melina, a beautiful woman seen as the partner in Quaid's Rekall memory program who turns out to be a resistance fighter seeking to overthrow Cohaagen.
* [[Sharon Stone]] as Lori Quaid, Quaid's seemingly loving wife who is later also revealed to be an agent sent by Cohaagen to monitor Quaid. She is Richter's wife. Lori is shown to possess various martial arts skills (she is able to nearly fight Quaid to a standstill, and also gives Melina a vicious beating), as well as being proficient in the use of knives and firearms.
* [[Ronny Cox]] as Vilos Cohaagen, the corrupt and ruthless governor of the Mars Colony and friend of Hauser who stops at nothing in the mining of turbinium ore, which places innocent people at risk.
* [[Michael Ironside]] as Richter, Cohaagen's chief lieutenant. He is domineering and sadistic and has a seething hatred for Quaid stemming from a grudge against Quaid for sleeping with the undercover Lori. He relentlessly tries to kill Quaid several times, defying Cohaagen's orders to take him alive.
* [[Mel Johnson Jr.]] as Benny, a taxi driver and mutant on Mars Colony who befriends and later betrays Quaid and the mutants to Cohaagen.
* [[Marshall Bell]] as George and as the voice of Kuato. George is a member of the resistance who has his mutant brother Kuato, the resistance leader, conjoined at his abdomen. Kuato helps Quaid unlock the secret to his past and the mystery of a reactor built by an ancient Martian civilization. Kuato seemingly has clairvoyant powers.
* [[Roy Brocksmith]] as Dr. Edgemar, who tries to talk Quaid into taking a pill which he claims would break Quaid out of his fantasy and restore him to reality. Quaid executes him with a pistol upon discovering he is in league with Cohaagen.
* [[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Bob McClane, a Rekall manager and sales agent who convinces Quaid to buy an \"Ego Trip\" memory implant.
* [[Michael Campbell (musician and actor)|Michael Champion]] as Helm, Richter's acerbic right-hand man.

* [[Marc Alaimo]] as Captain Everett, a Captain of the Mars Colony security force. He does not get along with Richter. Everett orders his men to arrest a disguised Quaid on Richter's orders, but Quaid escapes.
* [[Dean Norris]] as Tony, a disfigured mutant who knew Quaid on Mars as Hauser, and dislikes him.
* [[Debbie Lee Carrington]] as Thumbelina, a dwarf mutant who fought against Richter's mercenaries with Tony.
* [[Lycia Naff]] as Mary, widely known as the Three-Breasted prostitute.

==Production==
The original screenplay was written by [[Dan O'Bannon]] and [[Ronald Shusett]], the writers of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]],'' who wrote the initial script before their collaboration on ''Alien.'' They had bought the rights to [[Philip K. Dick]]'s short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\" while Dick was still alive. Unable to find a backer for the project, it drifted into [[development hell]], passing from studio to studio for several years, during which time approximately forty drafts of the script were written.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Will|date=July 1990|title=Man Without Memory|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-156/page/n49?q=total+recall|journal=[[Starlog]]|volume=|issue=156|pages=50-55, 79|via=}}</ref>

In the mid-1980s, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] took on the project with [[Richard Dreyfuss]] attached to star.<ref name=\"WiredPKD\">{{cite magazine| last = Rose| first = Frank| title = The Second Coming of Philip K.

''Fantastic: The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger'', pp. 259–262. Macmillan, 2006. {{ISBN|0-312-93301-0}}</ref> In 1987, it was announced that De Laurentiis would make the film as the first production for his DEG company at the new De Laurentiis film studios on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], with [[Bruce Beresford]] to direct from a screenplay by O'Bannon and Shusett. This version of the film was never made.<ref name=\"stratton2\">David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Pan MacMillan, 1990 p285-286</ref>

[[David Cronenberg]] was given the script by De Laurentiis, which in his opinion had a great start, but as it went on he felt that O'Bannon and Shusett did not know what to do with the story. Cronenberg described his work on the project as constantly fighting and eventually falling out with Shusett: \"I worked on it for a year and did about 12 drafts. Eventually, we got to a point where Ron Shusett said, 'You know what you've done? You've done the Philip K. Dick version.' I said, 'Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing?' He said, 'No, no, we want to do ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]] Go to Mars''.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cronenberg intended to cast [[William Hurt]] in the role and envisioned the film as \"''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'' goes to Mars\". Shusett claimed that another reason why Cronenberg quit the film was because around the time Dreyfuss was involved, the director wanted to go on a different approach and in Shusett's words, was \"suddenly against his own ideas\" after some disagreements.<ref>{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Tales from Development Hell: Hollywood Film-making the Hard Way|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=9780857687234}}</ref> Although he went uncredited in the final version of the film, Cronenberg originated the idea of mutants on Mars, including the character of Kuato (spelled Quato in his screenplay).<ref>Robb, Brian J.

The collapse of De Laurentiis' company provided an opening for Schwarzenegger, who had unsuccessfully approached the producer about starring in the film. Schwarzenegger had first become aware of the project while filming ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'', which had been distributed by [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]]. He initially discussed doing the film with ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' producer [[Joel Silver]] while working on that film, but this project would never come to fruition.<ref name=\":0\" /> He persuaded [[Carolco Pictures|Carolco]] to buy the rights to the film for a comparatively cheap $3 million and negotiated a salary of $10–11 million (plus 15% of the profits)<ref name=\"10TR12T2\">{{cite news|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|title=The Hole in Hollywood's Pocket|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 10, 1990|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC163CF933A25751C1A966958260|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"11plusTR\">{{cite magazine|title=The 101 Most Powerful People in Entertainment|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 2, 1990|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318518,00.html|accessdate=February 19, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425092710/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318518,00.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> to star, with an unusually broad degree of control over the production. He obtained veto power over the producer, director, screenplay, co-stars, and promotion. Schwarzenegger first personally recruited Paul Verhoeven to direct the film, having been impressed by the Dutch director's ''[[RoboCop]]'' (for which Schwarzenegger was considered for the title role). By this time, the script had been through 42 drafts, but it still lacked a third act. Gary Goldman was then brought in by Schwarzenegger to work with Ronald Shusett to develop the final draft of the screenplay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Leamer\" /> The director also brought in many of his collaborators on ''RoboCop'', including actor Ronny Cox, cinematographer [[Jost Vacano]], production designer [[William Sandell]], editor [[Frank J.

===Filming===
Much of the filming took place in 20 March 1989 to 23 August 1989 on location in [[Mexico City]] and at [[Estudios Churubusco]]. The futuristic subway station and vehicles are actually part of the [[Mexico City Metro]], with the subway cars painted gray and television monitors added.

The score was composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], and 40 minutes of it were released by the [[Varèse Sarabande]] label in 1990.<ref name=\"soundtrack1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=234 |title=SoundtrackNet : Total Recall Soundtrack |publisher=Soundtrack.net |accessdate=2009-06-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009230729/http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=234 |archivedate=October 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Ten years later, the same label released a \"Deluxe Edition\", in chronological order with additional cues that were left out, totaling 74 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.varesesarabande.com/details.asp?pid=302%2D066%2D197%2D2 |title=Varèse Sarabande Product Details |publisher=Varesesarabande.com |accessdate=2009-06-08 |archivedate=April 21, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421003514/http://www.varesesarabande.com/details.asp?pid=302-066-197-2 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As with several Goldsmith scores, the music was performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Total Recall'' debuted at number one at the box office.<ref>{{cite news|title=Total Recall Totally Dominates Box Office Movies: Film starring Schwarzenegger posts one of the top 10 biggest three-day openings ever.|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-06-04|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-04/entertainment/ca-608_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=2010-11-16|first=Pat H.|last=Broeske|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20101117005503/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-04/entertainment/ca-608_1_weekend-box-office|archivedate=November 17, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The film ultimately grossed $261,299,840 worldwide. It received an 82% positive rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 7.29/10. The site's critical consensus states \"Under Paul Verhoeven's frenetic direction, ''Total Recall'' is a fast-paced rush of violence, gore, and humor that never slacks.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_recall/ |title=Total Recall |author=Rotten Tomatoes |authorlink=Rotten Tomatoes |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225161829/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_recall/ |archivedate=February 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Metacritic]] rated it 57 out of 100 based on 17 reviews.<ref name=\"metac\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/total-recall |title=Total Recall |accessdate=2007-12-03 |author=Metacritic |authorlink=Metacritic |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826042343/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/total-recall |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three and a half stars (out of four), calling it \"one of the most complex and visually interesting science-fiction movies in a long time,\" and arguing ''Total Recall'' demonstrated Schwarzenegger's talent as an actor by his showing more confusion and vulnerability than earlier roles.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900601/REVIEWS/6010301/1023 Review by Roger Ebert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311205950/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900601%2FREVIEWS%2F6010301%2F1023 |date=March 11, 2010 }}, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', 1 June 1990</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a score of \"B+\" and said that it \"starts out as mind-bending futuristic satire and then turns relentless [and] becomes a violent, post-punk version of an [[Indiana Jones]] cliff-hanger.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317598~1~~,00.html|title=Article 99|website=ew.com|accessdate=May 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111112018/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317598~1~~,00.html|archivedate=January 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Film scholar William Buckland considers it one of the more \"sublime\" Philip K. Dick adaptations, contrasting it with films like ''[[Impostor (2002 film)|Impostor]]'' and ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'', which he considered \"ridiculous\".<ref>Buckland. pg. 209</ref>

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said the film is not a classic, \"but it's still solid and entertaining.\"<ref name=\"metac\"/> [[James Berardinelli]] gave the film two and a half stars (out of four), saying that \"neither Schwarzenegger nor Verhoeven [has] stretched [his] talents here,\" but added, \"with a script that's occasionally as smart as it is energetic, ''Total Recall'' offers a little more than wholesale carnage.\"<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/t/total_recall.html Review by James Berardinelli], ReelViews</ref>

Some critics, such as [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', considered the film excessively violent.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&title1=&title2=TOTAL%20RECALL%20%28MOVIE%29&reviewer=Janet%20Maslin&v_id=50523&pdate=19900601&oref=login Review by Janet Maslin of the ''NY Times'']{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, 1 June 1990</ref> Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave it a negative review, saying that director Paul Verhoeven \"disappoints with this appalling onslaught of blood and boredom.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kempley|first1=Rita|title=Total Recall (R)|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/totalrecallrkempley_a0a014.htm|accessdate=2018-05-07|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 1, 1990}}</ref> Feminist cultural critic [[Susan Faludi]] called it one of \"an endless stream of war and action movies\" in which \"women are reduced to mute and incidental characters or banished altogether.\"<ref>Susan Faludi, in Backlash, Chatto & Windus, 1992, p. 169</ref>

==Legacy==

===Novelization===
The film was novelized by [[Piers Anthony]].<ref>{{ISBN|0-380-70874-4}}</ref> The novel and film correspond fairly well, although Anthony was evidently working from an earlier script than the one used for the film, with the main character named Douglas Quail instead of Douglas Quaid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-688-05209-6|title=Fiction Book Review: Total Recall by Piers Anthony, Author  William Morrow & Company $16.95 (0p) ISBN 978-0-688-05209-6|website=publishersweekly.com|accessdate=May 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213092454/https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-688-05209-6|archivedate=December 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Anthony was criticized for the ending of his book which removed the ambiguity about whether the events of ''Total Recall'' are real or a dream. In addition, the novel had a subplot wherein the aliens planted a fail-safe device within their Mars technology, so that if it were misused or destroyed, the local star would go [[supernova|nova]] and therefore prevent the species from entering the galactic community. It coincided with a comment earlier in the novel that astronomers were noticing an abnormal number of recent supernovae, giving an indication that the aliens seeded their tech as part of a galactic experiment in technological maturity. Instead of mentioning that he dreamt of her earlier in the film, Melina mentions she was once a model, explaining how Quaid could have seen her on the screen at Rekall.

===Video game===
A ''[[Total Recall (video game)|Total Recall]]'' video game based on the film was developed and released by [[Ocean Software]] in 1990, featuring 2D [[Action game|action]], [[Platform game|platformer]] scenes and top-down racing scenes; a version for popular 8-bit home computers ([[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]) and popular 16-bit home computers ([[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]) was also released the following year.

===Television series===
A television series called ''[[Total Recall 2070]]'' went into production in 1999. The series was meant to be a sequel; however, it had far more similarities with the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' film (also inspired by a Philip K. Dick story) than Verhoeven's film.<ref>{{citation|author=Platt, John|date=1999-03-01|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue98/screen.html|title=A Total Recall spin-off that's an awful lot like Blade Runner|journal=Science Fiction Weekly|pages=Issue 98 Vol.5 No.9|accessdate=2008-02-06|nopp=true |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080115153719/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue98/screen.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-15}}</ref> The two-hour series pilot, released on VHS and DVD for the North American market, borrowed footage from the film, such as the space cruiser arriving on Mars.

===Sequel===
Due to the film's success, a [[sequel]] was written with the script title ''Total Recall 2'', and with Schwarzenegger's character still Douglas Quaid, now working as a reformed law enforcer. The sequel was based on another Philip K. Dick short story, \"[[The Minority Report]]\", which hypothesizes about a future where a crime can be solved before it is committed—in the movie, the [[clairvoyance|clairvoyants]] would be Martian mutants.<ref>{{cite web |author=Alan Daly, The Digital Fix |url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4332 |title=Overview of ''Total Recall'' DVD audio commentary at |publisher=Dvdtimes.co.uk |accessdate=2016-10-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113072950/http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4332 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1994, producer Mario Kassar spoke with director [[Ronny Yu]] about possibly helming the sequel.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=September 5, 1994 |title=Yu talks with Kassar about helming \"Total Recall 2\" |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-09-05-1994-31 |location=varietyultimate.com |magazine=Variety |accessdate=June 1, 2015 }}</ref> In 1998, actor-director [[Jonathan Frakes]] was also attached to the follow-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5887350/we-almost-got-total-recall-2-in-the-1990s|title=The Long, Strange Saga of Total Recall 2|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=8 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017203437/http://io9.com/5887350/we-almost-got-total-recall-2-in-the-1990s|archivedate=October 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The sequel ultimately was not filmed, but the script survived and it was changed drastically and contained greater elements from the original short story. The story was eventually adapted into the [[Steven Spielberg]] sci-fi thriller ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', which opened in 2002 to commercial success.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=minorityreport.htm|title=Minority Report box office reports|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213113326/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=minorityreport.htm|archivedate=December 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.audiorevolution.com/news/0103/17.dvd.shtml|title=Home Video (DVD & VHS) Out Sells Feature Films, Video Games and Movies in 2002|publisher=audiorevolution.com|accessdate=2007-02-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516185136/http://www.audiorevolution.com/news/0103/17.dvd.shtml|archivedate=May 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Remake===
{{Main|Total Recall (2012 film)}}
In 1997 [[Dimension Films]] acquired sequel, prequel and remake rights to ''Total Recall'' from [[Carolco Pictures]]' bankruptcy auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/recall-in-new-dimension-1117433616/|title=‘RECALL’ IN NEW DIMENSION|date=14 January 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=24 July 2019}}</ref>

In February 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that [[Neal H. Moritz]] and [[Original Film]] were in negotiations for developing a contemporary version of ''Total Recall'' for Columbia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/total-recall-ready-revival-79899 |title='Total Recall' ready for revival |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=2012-09-05 |date=2009-02-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203215127/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/total-recall-ready-revival-79899 |archivedate=February 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In June 2009, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] had hired [[Kurt Wimmer]] to write the script for the remake. Over a year later, [[Len Wiseman]] was hired to direct.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004451.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 |title=Wimmer to write 'Recall' remake—Entertainment News, Film News, Media |magazine=Variety |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703221832/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004451.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 |archivedate=July 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On January 9, 2011, it was confirmed that [[Colin Farrell]] would be starring in the remake and [[Bryan Cranston]] would play the villain, with production starting in Toronto on May 15. According to Moritz, this version of the film would be closer to Dick's original story. Moritz also stated that the film would not be shot in [[3D film|3D]], saying \"we decided that it would be too much.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Neal Moritz Interview TOTAL RECALL; Says Colin Farrell Is the Lead, No 3D|date=January 9, 2011|website=Collider}}</ref> [[Kate Beckinsale]] was cast in the role of agent Lori,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/35/20110421/tmovies-kate-beckinsale-set-for-total-recall-c71d56c.html |title=Kate Beckinsale has also been set for Total Recall role |publisher=bangshowbiz.com |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2011-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424131035/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/35/20110421/tmovies-kate-beckinsale-set-for-total-recall-c71d56c.html |archivedate=April 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> while [[John Cho]] was cast as McClane, the smooth-talking rep for the memory company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/05/26/john-cho-signs-on-for-total-recall/|title=John Cho signs on for 'Total Recall' -- EXCLUSIVE|first=Jeff|last=Labrecque|date=2011-05-26|accessdate=2011-05-26|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528022350/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/05/26/john-cho-signs-on-for-total-recall/|archivedate=May 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The film was released on August 3, 2012,<ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/sony-schedules-total-recall-august-2012-dates-i-hate-dad-kevin-james-mma-film |title=Sony Schedules 'Total Recall' For August 2012, Also Dates 'I Hate You, Dad' And Kevin James' MMA Film |last=Fischer |first=Russ |work=[[/Film]] |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> and received mixed reviews.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\">{{cite web |title=Total Recall |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_recall_2010 |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixter |accessdate=2012-08-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804181018/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_recall_2010/ |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web |title=Total Recall |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/total-recall-2012 |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=2012-08-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819090813/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/total-recall-2012 |archivedate=August 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

'''''Total Recall''''' is a 1990 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]] and starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Rachel Ticotin]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Ronny Cox]], and [[Michael Ironside]]. The film is loosely based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\".

The film tells the story of a construction worker who suddenly finds himself embroiled in espionage on [[Mars]] and unable to determine if the experiences are real or the result of memory implants. It was written by [[Ronald Shusett]], [[Dan O'Bannon]], [[Jon Povill]], and [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]], and won a [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for its [[visual effects]]. The [[Film score|original score]], composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], won the [[BMI Awards|BMI Film Music Award]].

With a budget of $50–65 million, ''Total Recall'' was [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films made]] at the time of its release,<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite book|last=Keesey|first=Douglas|year=2005|title=Paul Verhoeven|pages=119, 123|isbn=3-8228-3101-8}}</ref> although estimates of its production budget vary and whether it ever actually held the record is not certain.

==Plot==
In 2084, construction worker Douglas Quaid is having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there. His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting a rebellion. At Rekall, a company that provides memory implants of vacations, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent. However, something goes wrong during the procedure, and Quaid starts revealing suppressed memories of actually being a secret agent. The Rekall employees sedate him, wipe his memory of the visit, and send him home. On the way, Quaid is attacked by his friend Harry and other men, and is forced to kill them. He is then ambushed in his apartment by Lori, who states that she isn't his wife; their marriage is a false memory implant, and \"The Agency\" sent her to monitor Quaid. Quaid knocks Lori out and runs off, pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband.

After evading his attackers, Quaid is left a suitcase containing money, gadgets, fake IDs, and a video recording. The video is of Quaid himself, who identifies himself as Hauser and explains that he used to work for Cohaagen, but switched sides after learning about an alien artifact on Mars and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself. Hauser instructs Quaid to remove a tracking device located inside his skull before ordering him to go to Mars. On arrival, Quaid finds a note from Hauser directing him to Venusville, populated by people mutated as a result of poor radiation shielding. He meets Benny, a taxi driver, and Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that he is still working for Cohaagen.

Quaid later encounters Rekall's Dr. Edgemar and Lori. Edgemar states that he is from Rekall and was implanted in Quaid, asserting that he suffered a \"schizoid embolism\" and is trapped in a fantasy from the implanted memories. His solution is to take an offered pill to wake up, or he will otherwise be lobotomized. Seeing sweat on Edgemar's face and realizing he isn't an implant, Quaid refuses the pill and shoots him, just as Richter's men burst into the room. Led by Lori, the men capture Quaid. Melina arrives to aid Quaid, recognizing Quaid to be truthful, and in their escape Quaid kills Lori. 

They flee to Venusville with Benny, and are ushered into a secret tunnel. Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation, slowly asphyxiating its citizens. Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to the mutant Kuato, conjoined to his brother George. Kuato reads Quaid's mind recalling a discussion with Cohaagen and Richter about the Martian artifact and its unknown purpose. Cohaagen's forces burst in and kill most of the resistance. Quaid, George/Kuato, Melina & Benny escape to an airlock. Benny kills George and reveals that he works for Cohaagen. Kuato implores Quaid to activate the reactor before being shot by Richter.

Quaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who explains that the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and expose Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina re-programmed as Hauser's obedient \"babe\", but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located. Benny attacks them in an excavation machine, but Quaid kills him. Quaid and Melina then outwit and kill Richter and his men lying in ambush for them.

Quaid reaches the reactor control room, where Cohaagen is waiting with a bomb, claiming starting the reactor will destroy them all. Melina arrives and shoots Cohaagen, but he starts the bomb timer. Quaid throws the bomb down the tunnel, blowing the door open and causing an [[explosive decompression]]. Quaid pushes Cohaagen aside, and Cohaagen is blown out onto the surface, where he suffocates and dies. Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor rods deploy, [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] the turbinium glacier underneath and releasing gas, which bursts from a mountain and forms a breathable planetary atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina, Venusville, and the rest of Mars' population. As the Mars humans and mutants stand on an outcropping looking at the newly blue sky, Quaid momentarily pauses to wonder whether he is dreaming or not, before turning to kiss Melina.

==Production==
The original screenplay was written by [[Dan O'Bannon]] and [[Ronald Shusett]], the writers of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]],'' who wrote the initial script before their collaboration on ''Alien.'' They had bought the rights to [[Philip K. Dick]]'s short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\" while Dick was still alive. Unable to find a backer for the project, it drifted into [[development hell]], passing from studio to studio for several years, during which time approximately forty drafts of the script were written.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Will|date=July 1990|title=Man Without Memory|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-156/page/n49?q=total+recall|journal=[[Starlog]]|volume=|issue=156|pages=50-55, 79|via=}}</ref>

In the mid-1980s, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] took on the project with [[Richard Dreyfuss]] attached to star.<ref name=\"WiredPKD\">{{cite magazine| last = Rose| first = Frank| title = The Second Coming of Philip K. Dick| magazine = Wired magazine| url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/philip_pr.html| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140317004142/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/philip_pr.html| archivedate = March 17, 2014| df = mdy-all}}</ref> [[Patrick Swayze]], who had recently starred in ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', was also considered for the role.<ref name=\"Leamer\">Leamer, Laurence. ''Fantastic: The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger'', pp. 259–262. Macmillan, 2006. {{ISBN|0-312-93301-0}}</ref> In 1987, it was announced that De Laurentiis would make the film as the first production for his DEG company at the new De Laurentiis film studios on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], with [[Bruce Beresford]] to direct from a screenplay by O'Bannon and Shusett. This version of the film was never made.<ref name=\"stratton2\">David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Pan MacMillan, 1990 p285-286</ref>

[[David Cronenberg]] was given the script by De Laurentiis, which in his opinion had a great start, but as it went on he felt that O'Bannon and Shusett did not know what to do with the story. Cronenberg described his work on the project as constantly fighting and eventually falling out with Shusett: \"I worked on it for a year and did about 12 drafts. Eventually, we got to a point where Ron Shusett said, 'You know what you've done? You've done the Philip K. Dick version.' I said, 'Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing?' He said, 'No, no, we want to do ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]] Go to Mars''.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cronenberg intended to cast [[William Hurt]] in the role and envisioned the film as \"''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'' goes to Mars\". Shusett claimed that another reason why Cronenberg quit the film was because around the time Dreyfuss was involved, the director wanted to go on a different approach and in Shusett's words, was \"suddenly against his own ideas\" after some disagreements.<ref>{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Tales from Development Hell: Hollywood Film-making the Hard Way|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=9780857687234}}</ref> Although he went uncredited in the final version of the film, Cronenberg originated the idea of mutants on Mars, including the character of Kuato (spelled Quato in his screenplay).<ref>Robb, Brian J.

Dick on Film'', Titan Books, pp. 15, 158-159, {{ISBN|1-84023-968-9}}</ref> When the adaptation of ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' flopped at the box office, De Laurentiis similarly lost enthusiasm for the project.<ref>[http://www.moria.co.nz/sf/totalrecall.htm Review at Moria.co.nz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520103006/http://moria.co.nz/sf/totalrecall.htm |date=May 20, 2010 }}, 2005</ref>

The collapse of De Laurentiis' company provided an opening for Schwarzenegger, who had unsuccessfully approached the producer about starring in the film. Schwarzenegger had first become aware of the project while filming ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'', which had been distributed by [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]]. He initially discussed doing the film with ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' producer [[Joel Silver]] while working on that film, but this project would never come to fruition.<ref name=\":0\" /> He persuaded [[Carolco Pictures|Carolco]] to buy the rights to the film for a comparatively cheap $3 million and negotiated a salary of $10–11 million (plus 15% of the profits)<ref name=\"10TR12T2\">{{cite news|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|title=The Hole in Hollywood's Pocket|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 10, 1990|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC163CF933A25751C1A966958260|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"11plusTR\">{{cite magazine|title=The 101 Most Powerful People in Entertainment|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 2, 1990|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318518,00.html|accessdate=February 19, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425092710/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318518,00.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> to star, with an unusually broad degree of control over the production. He obtained veto power over the producer, director, screenplay, co-stars, and promotion. Schwarzenegger first personally recruited Paul Verhoeven to direct the film, having been impressed by the Dutch director's ''[[RoboCop]]'' (for which Schwarzenegger was considered for the title role). By this time, the script had been through 42 drafts, but it still lacked a third act. Gary Goldman was then brought in by Schwarzenegger to work with Ronald Shusett to develop the final draft of the screenplay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Leamer\" /> The director also brought in many of his collaborators on ''RoboCop'', including actor Ronny Cox, cinematographer [[Jost Vacano]], production designer [[William Sandell]], editor [[Frank J. Urioste]], and special-effects designer [[Rob Bottin]].<ref name=\"Lichtenfeld\">Lichtenfeld, Eric. ''Action Speaks Louder: Violence, Spectacle, and the American Action Movie''.

===Filming===
Much of the filming took place in 20 March 1989 to 23 August 1989 on location in [[Mexico City]] and at [[Estudios Churubusco]]. The futuristic subway station and vehicles are actually part of the [[Mexico City Metro]], with the subway cars painted gray and television monitors added. The interior of the metro stations [[Metro Chabacano|Chabacano]] and [[Metro Universidad|Universidad]] and the exterior of the metro station [[Metro Insurgentes|Insurgentes]] were shot.<ref name=\"filmlocations\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/t/totalrecall.html|title=Film locations for Total Recall|accessdate=17 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022157/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/t/totalrecall.html|archivedate=July 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Rating===

===Novelization===
The film was novelized by [[Piers Anthony]].<ref>{{ISBN|0-380-70874-4}}</ref> The novel and film correspond fairly well, although Anthony was evidently working from an earlier script than the one used for the film, with the main character named Douglas Quail instead of Douglas Quaid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-688-05209-6|title=Fiction Book Review: Total Recall by Piers Anthony, Author  William Morrow & Company $16.95 (0p) ISBN 978-0-688-05209-6|website=publishersweekly.com|accessdate=May 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213092454/https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-688-05209-6|archivedate=December 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Anthony was criticized for the ending of his book which removed the ambiguity about whether the events of ''Total Recall'' are real or a dream. In addition, the novel had a subplot wherein the aliens planted a fail-safe device within their Mars technology, so that if it were misused or destroyed, the local star would go [[supernova|nova]] and therefore prevent the species from entering the galactic community. It coincided with a comment earlier in the novel that astronomers were noticing an abnormal number of recent supernovae, giving an indication that the aliens seeded their tech as part of a galactic experiment in technological maturity. Instead of mentioning that he dreamt of her earlier in the film, Melina mentions she was once a model, explaining how Quaid could have seen her on the screen at Rekall.

===Video game===
A ''[[Total Recall (video game)|Total Recall]]'' video game based on the film was developed and released by [[Ocean Software]] in 1990, featuring 2D [[Action game|action]], [[Platform game|platformer]] scenes and top-down racing scenes; a version for popular 8-bit home computers ([[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]) and popular 16-bit home computers ([[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]]) was also released the following year.

===Television series===
A television series called ''[[Total Recall 2070]]'' went into production in 1999. The series was meant to be a sequel; however, it had far more similarities with the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' film (also inspired by a Philip K. Dick story) than Verhoeven's film.<ref>{{citation|author=Platt, John|date=1999-03-01|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue98/screen.html|title=A Total Recall spin-off that's an awful lot like Blade Runner|journal=Science Fiction Weekly|pages=Issue 98 Vol.5 No.9|accessdate=2008-02-06|nopp=true |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080115153719/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue98/screen.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-15}}</ref> The two-hour series pilot, released on VHS and DVD for the North American market, borrowed footage from the film, such as the space cruiser arriving on Mars.

===Sequel===
Due to the film's success, a [[sequel]] was written with the script title ''Total Recall 2'', and with Schwarzenegger's character still Douglas Quaid, now working as a reformed law enforcer. The sequel was based on another Philip K. Dick short story, \"[[The Minority Report]]\", which hypothesizes about a future where a crime can be solved before it is committed—in the movie, the [[clairvoyance|clairvoyants]] would be Martian mutants.<ref>{{cite web |author=Alan Daly, The Digital Fix |url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4332 |title=Overview of ''Total Recall'' DVD audio commentary at |publisher=Dvdtimes.co.uk |accessdate=2016-10-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113072950/http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4332 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1994, producer Mario Kassar spoke with director [[Ronny Yu]] about possibly helming the sequel.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=September 5, 1994 |title=Yu talks with Kassar about helming \"Total Recall 2\" |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-09-05-1994-31 |location=varietyultimate.com |magazine=Variety |accessdate=June 1, 2015 }}</ref> In 1998, actor-director [[Jonathan Frakes]] was also attached to the follow-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5887350/we-almost-got-total-recall-2-in-the-1990s|title=The Long, Strange Saga of Total Recall 2|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=8 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017203437/http://io9.com/5887350/we-almost-got-total-recall-2-in-the-1990s|archivedate=October 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The sequel ultimately was not filmed, but the script survived and it was changed drastically and contained greater elements from the original short story. The story was eventually adapted into the [[Steven Spielberg]] sci-fi thriller ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', which opened in 2002 to commercial success.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=minorityreport.htm|title=Minority Report box office reports|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213113326/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=minorityreport.htm|archivedate=December 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.audiorevolution.com/news/0103/17.dvd.shtml|title=Home Video (DVD & VHS) Out Sells Feature Films, Video Games and Movies in 2002|publisher=audiorevolution.com|accessdate=2007-02-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516185136/http://www.audiorevolution.com/news/0103/17.dvd.shtml|archivedate=May 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Remake===
{{Main|Total Recall (2012 film)}}
In 1997 [[Dimension Films]] acquired sequel, prequel and remake rights to ''Total Recall'' from [[Carolco Pictures]]' bankruptcy auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/recall-in-new-dimension-1117433616/|title=‘RECALL’ IN NEW DIMENSION|date=14 January 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=24 July 2019}}</ref>

In February 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that [[Neal H. Moritz]] and [[Original Film]] were in negotiations for developing a contemporary version of ''Total Recall'' for Columbia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/total-recall-ready-revival-79899 |title='Total Recall' ready for revival |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=2012-09-05 |date=2009-02-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203215127/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/total-recall-ready-revival-79899 |archivedate=February 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In June 2009, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] had hired [[Kurt Wimmer]] to write the script for the remake. Over a year later, [[Len Wiseman]] was hired to direct.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004451.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 |title=Wimmer to write 'Recall' remake—Entertainment News, Film News, Media |magazine=Variety |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703221832/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004451.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 |archivedate=July 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On January 9, 2011, it was confirmed that [[Colin Farrell]] would be starring in the remake and [[Bryan Cranston]] would play the villain, with production starting in Toronto on May 15. According to Moritz, this version of the film would be closer to Dick's original story. Moritz also stated that the film would not be shot in [[3D film|3D]], saying \"we decided that it would be too much.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Neal Moritz Interview TOTAL RECALL; Says Colin Farrell Is the Lead, No 3D|date=January 9, 2011|website=Collider}}</ref> [[Kate Beckinsale]] was cast in the role of agent Lori,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/35/20110421/tmovies-kate-beckinsale-set-for-total-recall-c71d56c.html |title=Kate Beckinsale has also been set for Total Recall role |publisher=bangshowbiz.com |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2011-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424131035/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/35/20110421/tmovies-kate-beckinsale-set-for-total-recall-c71d56c.html |archivedate=April 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> while [[John Cho]] was cast as McClane, the smooth-talking rep for the memory company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/05/26/john-cho-signs-on-for-total-recall/|title=John Cho signs on for 'Total Recall' -- EXCLUSIVE|first=Jeff|last=Labrecque|date=2011-05-26|accessdate=2011-05-26|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528022350/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/05/26/john-cho-signs-on-for-total-recall/|archivedate=May 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The film was released on August 3, 2012,<ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/sony-schedules-total-recall-august-2012-dates-i-hate-dad-kevin-james-mma-film |title=Sony Schedules 'Total Recall' For August 2012, Also Dates 'I Hate You, Dad' And Kevin James' MMA Film |last=Fischer |first=Russ |work=[[/Film]] |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> and received mixed reviews.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\">{{cite web |title=Total Recall |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_recall_2010 |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixter |accessdate=2012-08-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804181018/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_recall_2010/ |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web |title=Total Recall |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/total-recall-2012 |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=2012-08-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819090813/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/total-recall-2012 |archivedate=August 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

'''Brøndby Stadion''' {{IPA-da|ˈpʁɶnpy stɛˈtjʌn|pron}} is a [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Brøndbyvester]], Denmark and the home ground of [[Danish Superliga]] club [[Brøndby IF]]. It is the second largest stadium in [[Denmark]]. Built in 1965 and inaugurated on 31 June 1966 where it had no stands, it saw a major redevelopment in 2000 which increased capacity to 31,500 spectators, of which 19,700 were seated. Continuous adjustments to the spectator facilities have since resulted in the stadium having a total capacity of 28,000 spectators, of which 23,400 are seated. Record attendance dates to 18 June 2003, where a crowd of 31,508 were present in a [[Copenhagen Derby]] against [[F.C. Copenhagen]].

When hosting the [[UEFA]] competitions [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], seats are installed on the South End [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] ({{lang-da|Sydsiden}}) in accordance with UEFA regulations, which reduces the total capacity to 26,000.

The stadium has also hosted the [[Denmark national football team]] in five matches. Their first game at Brøndby Stadion was a [[exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] on 1 September 2006 which ended in a 4–2 win.

== History ==
=== Turning idea into product ===
The idea of constructing a centrally located, municipal sports facility was presented by erstwhile mayor [[Jens Christian Jensen (mayor)|Jens Christian Jensen]] in 1945,<ref name=\"Barnak27\">Barnak 2007, p. 27.</ref> but at the time the sports clubs of the municipality could not agree on a common stadium.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> 

When a merger of the municipality's three largest sports clubs was considered in the 1950s, much suggests that these plans were fostered on a political as well as executive level.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> Having only one club in the municipality would enable a more rational use of a future Brøndby Stadion.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> The idea of a merger gained support in [[Brøndbyøster Idrætsforening]], and at the general assembly in 1962 a majority of the board voted their approval of merging [[:da:Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening|Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening]] and [[:da:Brøndby Strands Idrætsklub|Brøndby Strands Idrætsforeninger]].<ref name=\"Barnak28\"/> The latter, however, immediately disapproved of the idea, while a vote in Brøndbyvester ended up with the same result: a 'no' to merging into a municipal superstructure.<ref name=\"Barnak28\">Barnak 2007, p. 28.</ref>

Only a few years would pass before plans of merging Brøndbyøster Idrætsforening and Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening would resurface.<ref name=\"Barnak28\"/> Financial benefit was one of the main arguments for uniting the two clubs in order to play at a future municipal stadium,<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\">{{cite news |author= |title=Stadion tillæg |publisher=Brøndby IF |pages= 2 |date=22 October 2000 }}</ref> and mayor of [[Brøndby Municipality|Brøndby]] in the period 1966–2005, as well as chairman of [[Brøndby IF]] board in 1971–71, [[Kjeld Rasmussen]], has since stated that he and Brøndby's mayor at the time had decided to construct a stadium, provided that the two clubs would merge.<ref name=\"Barnak61\">Barnak 2007, p. 61.</ref> {{quotation|The closer we came to a completion of Brøndby Stadion, the stronger grew the support of forming one big club. Its proponents saw obvious advantages in a merger, which would mean that administrative personnel and athletes would have better physical surroundings to exercise and compete, and finally it would benefit both horisontally and vertically that all energy would become gathered in one club. Eventually, it was suggested that a merger would mean avoiding a reciprocal competitiveness especially in the area of municipal subsidies||[[Kjeld Rasmussen (mayor)|Kjeld Rasmussen]], Mayor of Brøndby Municipality, 1966–2005.<ref name=\"Barnak28\"/>}}

On 3 December 1964 in Kirkebjerg Salen in [[Brøndbyvester]], the boards of Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening and Brøndbyøster Idrætsforening adopted an agreement to merge into one club: [[Brøndby IF|Brøndbyernes Idrætsforening]] (Brøndby IF).<ref name=\"Rasmussen37\">Rasmussen 2009, pp. 37–38.</ref><ref name=\"64-70\">{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/klub/historie/1970-1964/ |title=Brøndby - 1964–1970 |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 }}</ref>

=== Construction and early years ===
When the stadium reached its completion in 1965, the ground consisted of nothing more than a grass pitch surrounded by an [[sport of athletics|athletics]] track and a spectator rail circling the field of play, a training complex featuring four grass pitches, and a gravel pitch.<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\"/> Behind one of the goals various athletics facilities were established, as the club shared the stadium with Brøndby Atletik.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=1. etape - 1965: Masser af luft |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/1-etape-1965/ |publisher=brondby.com |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In addition, a changing room with four separate compartments was constructed, featuring showers and toilet facilities.<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/><ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\"/> 

The official inauguration of the pitch was officially planned for late Summer 1965, but issues with making the grass grow postponed the launch to 31 July 1966.<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/>

In the following years, the area around Brøndby Stadion continuously developed and expanded; in 1969–70 the municipality constructed additional training pitches South of the ground, close to the [[Danish national road 21|Holbæk Motorway]],<ref name=\"Barnak33\">Barnak 2007, p. 33</ref> and even more training complexes were built South of the motorway in 1972–74.<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/>

Conditions around the main playing pitch were also improved; in 1966 two [[turnstile]]s were set up at the stadium entrance,<ref name=\"Barnak33\"/> and in 1969 a clock was added, courtesy of local [[watchmaker]] Bent Henriksen from [[Brøndbyøster Torv]].<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/> In 1973 the municipality allocated [[Danish krone|DKK]] 20,000 to set up a modern loudspeaker system consisting of four ''folded'' [[horn loudspeaker]]s suspended on four-metre steel trusses.<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/>

=== Constructing the stands ===
As [[Brøndby IF]] moved up the ranks, a need arose for a more contemporary stadium. In 1975, the [[Brøndby Municipality|municipality]] allowed the club to improve spectator facilities by installing two-step terraces around the [[running track]].<ref name=\"Barnak72\">Barnak 2007, p. 72</ref> This happened despite the club's wishes to install a covered grandstand.<ref name=\"Barnak72\"/>

Only in 1977, when the club reached promotion to the third highest football league in Denmark, the [[Danish 2nd Division]], did the municipality decide that a covered grandstand should be erected.<ref name=\"Barnak73\"/> The [[Danish krone|DKK]] 4 million project broke ground during the summer of 1978, and in early 1979 the grandstand was ready for use.<ref name=\"Barnak73\">Barnak 2007, p. 73</ref> The stand, which could hold 1,335 seated spectators, and included a [[announcer|speaker]] booth, media facilities and a TV plateau, was placed facing West towards [[Gildhøj (Brøndby Municipality)|Gildhøjskolen]].<ref name=\"Barnak73\"/> Beneath the stand were constructed four dressing rooms, a kiosk, an office, toilet facilities, a storage room as well as the club room of Brøndby Atletik.<ref name=\"Barnak73\"/> In the spring of 1980, the municipality installed the first floodlights with a brightness of 4 x 24&nbsp;kW.<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\"/> With the new stand, spectator capacity increased to 5,000.<ref name=\"Barnak72\"/>

As Brøndby IF had reached promotion to the highest football league in Denmark in the fall of 1981, then known as the [[Danish Superliga|1st Division]], mayor Kjeld Rasmussen proclaimed that a covered stand would be constructed.<ref name=\"Barnak80\">Barnak 2007, p. 80</ref> Prior to the [[1982 Danish 1st Division|1982 season]] &ndash; Brøndby's first on the highest level &ndash; concrete [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] were installed opposite the existing grandstand, consisting of 13 rows of terraces the length of the pitch in open air.<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg2\">{{cite news |author= |title=Stadion tillæg |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |date=22 October 2000 }}</ref> This allowed a crowd of 5,000 additional people,<ref name=\"3. etape\">{{cite news |author= |title=3. etape - 1982: Ståpladser til folket |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/3-etape-1982/ |publisher=brondby.com |pages= |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> bringing the total capacity to 10,000.

After the club had established itself in the top of [[Football in Denmark|Danish football]] during the 1980s, Brøndby IF reached a hitherto zenith by reaching the [[1990–91_UEFA_Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] of the [[1990–91 UEFA Cup]].<ref name=\"FiB07\">{{cite web|url=https://brondby.com/nyhed/2007/03/20/fra-mark-til-arena|publisher=[[Brøndby IF]]|title=Fra mark til Arena|date=20 March 2007|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rasmussen205207\">Rasmussen 2009, pp. 205–207.</ref> At that time, Brøndby Stadion did not live up to international standards to host matches at that level. However, this was solved by installing temporary end stands of [[scaffolding]], which allowed the club to receive an approval by the [[UEFA]] to organise the home leg against [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]].<ref name=\"FiB07\"/> The changes raised the total capacity to 15,000 spectators, and the club even outdid themselves when they reached the [[1990–91_UEFA_Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] by increasing the capacity to 17,000&ndash;18,000.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=5. etape - 1991: Den uslåelige stadionrekord |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/4-etape-1989/ |publisher=brondby.com |pages= |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In the same period Brøndby IF submitted a bid to host the [[Denmark national football team]] at a new national stadium; a \"''Stadion Danmark''\", which would seat 60,000 spectators and border the [[Danish national road 21|Holbæk Motorway]].<ref name=\"FiB07\" /> These plans, however, never came to fruition as [[Parken Stadium]] won the bid and eventually became the national stadium.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parken, Danmarks Nationalstadion |url=https://www.cfmoller.com/p/-da/Parken-Danmarks-Nationalstadion-i34.html# |website=cfmoller.com |publisher=[[C.

As Brøndby IF gained domestic and European success, spectator interest had grown to such a degree, that it became necessary to move the biggest matches to [[Københavns Idrætspark]].<ref name=\"4. etape\">{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415020824/http://brondby.com/article.asp?aid=77 |title=4. etape - 1989-1990 |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |date=1 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415020824/http://brondby.com/article.asp?aid=77 |archivedate=15 August 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2020 }}</ref> This solution was not deemed satisfactory for neither club, fans nor sponsors, who wanted to remain rooted in the local community.<ref name=\"4. etape\"/><ref name=\"FiB07\"/> Therefore, the board under leadership of [[Per Bjerregaard]], decided to plan an expansion of Brøndby Stadion.<ref name=\"Barnak139140\">Barnak 2007, pp. 139-140</ref> The first step was taken in 1990, when the stand opposite the grandstand was covered and expanded with eight rows, holding 3,500 seated spectators, as well as terracing holding 10,500 standing spectators in total.<ref name=\"BT 1991-03-12\">{{cite news |title=B.T. tester de 10 Superliga stadion |publisher=[[B.T.

=== 1999–2000 expansion ===
Despite several expansions and improvements over the years, Brøndby Stadion could still not achieve acceptable capacity for international matches, and the club was therefore forced to rent [[Parken Stadium]] in [[Indre Østerbro]] &ndash; home of the [[Denmark national football team|national team]] as well as archrivals [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC Copenhagen]] &ndash; for major matches under [[UEFA]].<ref name=\"6. etape\"/> This resulted in losses; both on a financial level, but also in terms of prestige, and because of this the board continued to work on plans of further expanding the stadium.<ref name=\"6. etape\"/>

The first step was commencing negotiations with [[Brøndby Municipality]] in order to secure the total acquisition of the stadium, and as a result of the proceedings, [[Brøndby IF]] [[Aktieselskab|A/S]] purchased Brøndby Stadion for [[Danish krone|DKK]] 23.5 million in May 1998.<ref name=\"Reuters 1998-05-14\">{{cite news |title=Brøndby køber eget stadion for 23,5 mio - BIF |work=[[Reuters]] |date=14 May 1998 }}</ref><ref>Storm & Thomsen 2016, p. 278</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Larsen |first1=Christian W. |title=Brøndby får eget stadion |publisher=[[Aktuelt]] |date=14 May 1998}}</ref> From this, DKK 16 million was to be deducted for the two end stands and the sponsors lounge,<ref name=\"Reuters 1998-05-14\"/> which the club itself had financed, resulting in a final amount of DKK 7.3 million.<ref name=\"Barnak180\">Barnak 2007, p. 180</ref>

The acquisition officially took place on 1 January 1999,<ref name=\"Barnak180\"/> after which the largest expansion of Brøndby Stadion could commence;<ref name=\"Reuters 1998-11-02\">{{cite news |title=Kapitaludvidelse i Brøndby 2 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=2 November 1998 }}</ref> a connected upper stand supported by a total of 32 concrete [[Staircase tower|staircase towers]],<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> and a new roof carried by a total of 32 m tall iron structures, each 25 m apart.<ref name=\"Barnak180\"/> These would &ndash; together with the existing lower stands &ndash; ensure that the stadium could bring the total spectator capacity to more than 30,000 for [[UEFA|European games]] and 33,000 to [[Danish Superliga|domestic]] matches.<ref name=\"Reuters 1998-10-19\">{{cite news |title=Nyt stadion øger Brøndby-res 15-20 mio - prospekt |work=[[Reuters]] |date=19 October 1998 }}</ref> The total costs for the expansion were DKK 270 million,<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\">{{cite web|url=http://brondby.com/upload/biffile_069yfp0l4ln18ma686z5_34271.pdf|publisher=[[Brøndby IF]]|title=Årsrapport 2000|pages=10-11|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> 40 million more than original estimates due to costs spiralling.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2001\">{{cite web|url=http://brondby.com/upload/biffile_wumjjipadudjnqgt2xau_34260.pdf|publisher=[[Brøndby IF]]|title=Årsrapport 2001|page=9 }}</ref> In addition to the new upper stand section, the main grandstand was expanded with a superstructure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pedersen|first=Flemming|title=Ny tribune står klar til næste år|date=2 September 1998|publisher=Politiken, section 1 page 19}}</ref> Not least, the sponsor and lounge areas were expanded considerably,<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> and a new three-storey annex providing administrative offices, press facilities, commercial kitchen and lounge areas able to host more than 3,000 was erected facing the parking lot.<ref name=\"Barnak181\">Barnak 2007, p. 181</ref> On the ground floor were constructed additional facilies, including a lobby, a gym for the players and a fanshop.<ref name=\"Barnak181\"/>
[[File:Brøndby_Stadion.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Brøndby Stadion.]]

The connected upper stands meant that the corners of the stadium became partly enclosed, and toilet stalls as well as food and drink outlets were placed in the spaces between the lower and upper stands.<ref name=\"Barnak181\"/> The new upper stands included 13,600 new seats, increasing the total capacity to 31,500 spectators.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> For international matches, capacity was limited to 26,500 spectators as they demand [[all-seater|all-seated]] crowds.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> The entire redevelopment was carried out while the club still played its home games at the stadium, and the original changing rooms under the main grandstand, originating from 1978, were retained.<ref name=\"Barnak181\"/>

The stadium officially reopened with a ceremony on 22 October 2000,<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> followed by an [[exhibition game]] between the [[Brøndby IF]] team from 1989 and [[:da:Skagen Idræts Klub|Skagen IK]]; a rematch mirroring a [[1986–87 Danish Cup]] game, where Skagen from the Danish fifth tier knocked out Brøndby after a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty-shootout]], in what has been described as \"the biggest sensation in Danish Cup history\".<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Videbæk |first1=Klaus |title=Da Skagen IK slog Brøndby: 'Det største jeg har oplevet i mit sportsliv' |url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/regionale/nordjylland/da-skagen-ik-slog-broendby-det-stoerste-jeg-har-oplevet-i-mit |website=dr.dk |publisher=[[Danmarks Radio]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=27 April 2017}}</ref> The first competitive game after the rebuild occurred on 22 October 2000 with a 4&ndash;2 league win over [[Akademisk Boldklub]] in front of 28,416 spectators.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rachlin |first1=Michael |title=Brøndbys dejlige dag |url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/kbh/ECE3300722/Br%C3%B8ndbys-dejlige-dag/ |website=jyllands-posten.dk |publisher=[[Jyllands-Posten]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=22 October 2000}}</ref> 

The stadium reached total completion in 2001.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> The redevelopment also made Brøndby Stadion a part of the Nordic countries' [[UEFA Euro 2008 bids|bid]] for hosting the [[UEFA Euro 2008]], which was eventually awarded to [[Austria]]–[[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Austria-Switzerland to host Euro 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2569017.stm |website=bbc.co.uk/sport |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=12 December 2002}}</ref>

=== Additions and improvements ===
Because the total costs of the 1999–2000 expansion exceeded the originally planned budget by [[Danish krone|DKK]] 30–40 million, some major and minor additions and improvements to audience facilities were postponed and subsequently carried out over time.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2001\"/><ref name=\"Barnak181\"/> First of foremost, the club could not afford new turnstiles, and a planned, highly modern entrance system was only installed in 2003, just as the scoreboards initally did not meet the requirements of the [[Danish Football Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.infomedia.dk/mediearkiv/link?articles=e008d0b4 |title=11 superligastadions dumpet |publisher=[[Ritzau]] |date=30 June 2003 |accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> The original substitutes' benches in the [[technical area]] likewise had to be utilised for some years before being permanently replaced by benches below pitch-level in 2005.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://brondby.com/upload/biffile_vrizkpoxn3iharmmlzhm_36880.pdf|publisher=[[Brøndby IF]]|title=Årsrapport 2005|accessdate=17January 2015|page=19}}</ref>

The new blue seats planned for the lower stands would initially have to wait; firstly, the old, worn-out seats were retained on the two original longside stands, which in the first years following the rebuild appeared as gray, red, yellow and light blue seats. Secondly, seats were expected to be fitted to the extended section of the old grandstand and the lower section of the northern end stand. However, an extra \"row 34\" was added relatively quickly all the way around the top of the stands, in front of the glass partitions.

As new dark blue seats were installed on the aforementioned areas in 2003, a total seating capacity reached 23,400. This increased total stadium capacity to 29,000,<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2003\">{{cite web|url=http://brondby.com/upload/biffile_vrj7ojvt3bb7yet69qvf_34266.pdf|publisher=[[Brøndby IF]]|title=Årsrapport 2003|accessdate=17 January 2015|page=11}}</ref> while the stadium could hold crowds of 26,144 for international matches.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2003\"/> This was due to the fact that for international fixtures, the South Side-end [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] could be converted into approximately 2,600 seats.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lassen |first1=Kurt |title=Stådrengene fra Vestegnen |url=https://www.berlingske.dk/sport/staadrengene-fra-vestegnen |website=berlingske.dk |publisher=[[Berlingske]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=13 March 2004}}</ref> Despite many delayed improvements to the stadium, the redevelopment in 2000 already had already secured improved facilities for wheelchair users, as a wheelchair lift had been installed at the southern end of the East Stand.<ref name=\"stadionoverblik\" />

In 2006–2007, the East Stand (today known as ''GSV Stand'' ({{lang-da|GSV-tribunen}}) for sponsorship reasons) was further expanded at the back with a lounge for sponsors, classrooms for [[:da:Brøndby Gymnasium|Brøndby Gymnasium]] ([[Secondary education in Denmark|general upper secondary education]]), a public gym, a production kitchen and the sports bar \"''1964''\".<ref name=\"RB Børsen 2006-03-07\">{{cite news |title=Brøndby opfører ny bygning på Brøndby Stadion for 90 mio (Opd) |publisher=[[Børsen]] |date=7 March 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"9. etape\">{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/9-etape-2007/ |title=9. etape - 2007 |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 }}</ref> In addition, spectator conditions were improved upon with six new multi-stalls and three new staircases beneath the East Stand.<ref name=\"9. etape\"/> Two large [[Light-emitting diodes|LED]] screens were also installed during this period.<ref name=\"9. etape\"/> The total cost of the project ran up to DKK 90 million.<ref name=\"RB Børsen 2006-03-07\"/>

During the winter break in of the [[2017–18 Brøndby IF season|2017–18 season]], the hole on the South Side-end was closed which meant that an additional 75 seats and extra capacity for 150 standing spectators on terracing were added to the stadium.<ref name=\"TipsSyd\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/superliga/broendby-fans-betaler-selv-ombygning-af-sydsiden|title=Brøndby-fans betaler selv ombygningen af Sydsiden|work=[[Tipsbladet]]|date=22 December 2017|accessdate=23 April 2018|author=Lasse Sylvest Mikkelsen}}</ref> The rebuild was financed by the club's fans, through the official fanclub ''[[Brøndby_IF#Support|Brøndby Support]]'' and various unofficial fan groups,<ref name=\"TipsSyd\"/> and through a so-called \"fan fund\" which arose as a result of season tickets and merchandise sales, among other things.<ref name=\"VaerMed\">{{cite web|url=https://brondby.com/nyhed/2017/12/13/vaer-med-til-at-forbedre-sydsiden|title=Vær med til at forbedre Sydsiden|date=13 December 2017|accessdate=23 April 2018|work=[[Brøndby IF]]}}</ref> In total, the renovation costs amounted to DKK 450,000, of which the fan fund accounted for DKK 270,000.<ref name=\"TipsSyd\"/><ref name=\"VaerMed\"/> In the summer of 2018, new 256 LED floodlights were installed, produced in China.<ref name=\"Lys2018\">{{cite web|url=https://brondby.com/nyhed/2018/07/10/454399|title=Nyt lys skal langtidssikre Brøndby Stadion|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=11 July 2018|work=[[Brøndby IF]]}}</ref>

== Structure and facilities ==
The Brøndby Stadion pitch is surrounded by four covered stands, officially known as Sydsiden (South), GSV-tribunen (East), J. Jensen-tribunen (North) and Carlsberg-tribunen (West). Three stands are all-seaters (except the away section on the North End) while the South End is terracing. Each stand has two tiers.

=== Sydsiden (South End) ===
Sydsiden, literally \"South Side\" in English, was inaugurated as the new South Stand on 29 March 1992 in a match against [[Lyngby Boldklub]], due to a rise in interest for Brøndby IF.<ref name=\"FiB07\"/><ref name=Sydsiden2>{{cite web |url=https://sydsiden.brondby.com/ |title=Sydsiden 25 år |date=15 March 2017 |publisher=Brøndby IF |accessdate=15 March}}</ref> The lower part of the stand has a standing capacity of 5,600 spectators. Initially, spectators would sit on the terraces,<ref name=Sydsiden>{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2017/03/14/de-foerste-aar-paa-sydsiden |title=De Første År På Sydsiden |date=15 March 2017 |publisher=Brøndby IF |accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref> but younger fans would begin encouraging all fans on Sydsiden to stand up, because they thought that it was easier to sing while standing, which would evolve into the mantra \"sing or piss off\" ({{lang-da|syng eller skrid}}).<ref name=Sydsiden/> This would mark the beginning of a hard-core fan-culture formation on Sydsiden, which has remained ever since, and it is known as the stand in Denmark with the most dedicated and loudest fans when Brøndby plays its home games.<ref name=\"6. etape\"/>

Until 6 March 2011, Sydsiden was known by its sponsor name, \"Faxe Tribunen\", a subsidiary of [[Royal Unibrew]]. This had to change as there was a conflict of interest as [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] moved in as new sponsors. Sydsiden was chosen by a panel representing a broad section of the active fan base at Brøndby Stadion, as fans had called the stand this before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2011/01/18/faxe-tribunen-bliver-til-sydsiden |title=Faxe-tribunen bliver til Sydsiden |date=18 January 2011 |publisher=Brøndby IF |accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> Halfway through the 2017–18 season, the hole in the middle of the stand was partly closed, after continuous requests by fans.<ref name=\"VaerMed\"/>

A permanent fanzone was inaugurated outside Sydsiden in 2018 for spectators and fans before, during and after the games. The fanzone is the first of its kind in Scandinavia, and consists of stands for live concerts, bars, foodstands and toilet facilities.

Sydsiden popularised the \"Fenerbahçe greeting\" in Denmark, imported through the transfer of [[Brian Steen Nielsen]] to the Turkish club. A cooperation between goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and [[Brøndby IF#Support|Brøndby Support]] effectually made the greeting get foothold in Denmark.<ref name=Sydsiden/>

=== North End ===
The North Stand, now known as \"J. Jensen-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was originally known as \"da:OBS!-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1992 as terracing, and has among fans been known as \"Pølseenden\" ({{lang-da|[[:da:Rosinen i pølseenden|the sausage end]]}}) due to its former major sponsor, sausage producer Steff-Houlberg. Fans from the away team are assigned a section on this stand, usually in the eastern part of the North Stand, separated from Brøndby's home fans.

=== West Stand ===
The West Stand, known as \"[[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]-tribunen\", was originally named \"Frisko-tribunen and later also \"SAS-tribunen\" and \"Apollo-tribunen\". The original part of the stand was completed in 1979 as the first stand of the stadium, and it has been preserved through the large expansion in 1999–2000. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites, and is the ground's main grandstand.

=== East Stand ===
The East Stand, now known as \"GSV-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was formerly called \"LOXAM-tribunen\", \"[[Codan]]-tribunen and \"DNE-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1982 and 1990. The East Stand was originally without a roof, and consisted of terraces. Today, it is the largest stand of Brøndby Stadion with a total of 34 rows of seats. In 2006, a larger extension was established behind the stand from the facade, consisting of sponsor facilities, a sports bar and classrooms for Brøndby Gymnasium. The classrooms were inaugurated on 8 January 2007. In April 2018, a new family lounge was opened behind the East Stand with both physical and Esports facilities.

==Transportation==
The easiest way of getting to the stadium with public transport is with the [[S-tog]] or S-train. Line B (green) will stop at both Brøndbyøster and Glostrup stations, where there are shuttle buses on match days. One can also walk from the stations, with the walk taking 15 minutes from Glostrup, and slightly longer from Brøndbyøster.

'''Brøndby Stadion''' {{IPA-da|ˈpʁɶnpy stɛˈtjʌn|pron}} is a [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Brøndbyvester]], Denmark and the home ground of [[Danish Superliga]] club [[Brøndby IF]]. It is the second largest stadium in [[Denmark]]. Built in 1965 and inaugurated on 31 June 1966 where it had no stands, it saw a major redevelopment in 2000 which increased capacity to 31,500 spectators, of which 19,700 were seated. Continuous adjustments to the spectator facilities have since resulted in the stadium having a total capacity of 28,000 spectators, of which 23,400 are seated. Record attendance dates to 18 June 2003, where a crowd of 31,508 were present in a [[Copenhagen Derby]] against [[F.C. Copenhagen]].

When hosting the [[UEFA]] competitions [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], seats are installed on the South End [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] ({{lang-da|Sydsiden}}) in accordance with UEFA regulations, which reduces the total capacity to 26,000.

The stadium has also hosted the [[Denmark national football team]] in five matches. Their first game at Brøndby Stadion was a [[exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] on 1 September 2006 which ended in a 4–2 win.

== History ==
=== Turning idea into product ===
The idea of constructing a centrally located, municipal sports facility was presented by erstwhile mayor [[Jens Christian Jensen (mayor)|Jens Christian Jensen]] in 1945,<ref name=\"Barnak27\">Barnak 2007, p. 27.</ref> but at the time the sports clubs of the municipality could not agree on a common stadium.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> 

When a merger of the municipality's three largest sports clubs was considered in the 1950s, much suggests that these plans were fostered on a political as well as executive level.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> Having only one club in the municipality would enable a more rational use of a future Brøndby Stadion.<ref name=\"Barnak27\"/> The idea of a merger gained support in [[Brøndbyøster Idrætsforening]], and at the general assembly in 1962 a majority of the board voted their approval of merging [[:da:Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening|Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening]] and [[:da:Brøndby Strands Idrætsklub|Brøndby Strands Idrætsforeninger]].<ref name=\"Barnak28\"/> The latter, however, immediately disapproved of the idea, while a vote in Brøndbyvester ended up with the same result: a 'no' to merging into a municipal superstructure.<ref name=\"Barnak28\">Barnak 2007, p. 28.</ref>

Only a few years would pass before plans of merging Brøndbyøster Idrætsforening and Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening would resurface.<ref name=\"Barnak28\"/> Financial benefit was one of the main arguments for uniting the two clubs in order to play at a future municipal stadium,<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\">{{cite news |author= |title=Stadion tillæg |publisher=Brøndby IF |pages= 2 |date=22 October 2000 }}</ref> and mayor of [[Brøndby Municipality|Brøndby]] in the period 1966–2005, as well as chairman of [[Brøndby IF]] board in 1971–71, [[Kjeld Rasmussen]], has since stated that he and Brøndby's mayor at the time had decided to construct a stadium, provided that the two clubs would merge.<ref name=\"Barnak61\">Barnak 2007, p. 61.</ref> {{quotation|The closer we came to a completion of Brøndby Stadion, the stronger grew the support of forming one big club. Its proponents saw obvious advantages in a merger, which would mean that administrative personnel and athletes would have better physical surroundings to exercise and compete, and finally it would benefit both horisontally and vertically that all energy would become gathered in one club. Eventually, it was suggested that a merger would mean avoiding a reciprocal competitiveness especially in the area of municipal subsidies||[[Kjeld Rasmussen (mayor)|Kjeld Rasmussen]], Mayor of Brøndby Municipality, 1966–2005.<ref name=\"Barnak28\"/>}}

On 3 December 1964 in Kirkebjerg Salen in [[Brøndbyvester]], the boards of Brøndbyvester Idrætsforening and Brøndbyøster Idrætsforening adopted an agreement to merge into one club: [[Brøndby IF|Brøndbyernes Idrætsforening]] (Brøndby IF).<ref name=\"Rasmussen37\">Rasmussen 2009, pp. 37–38.</ref><ref name=\"64-70\">{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/klub/historie/1970-1964/ |title=Brøndby - 1964–1970 |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 }}</ref>

=== Construction and early years ===
When the stadium reached its completion in 1965, the ground consisted of nothing more than a grass pitch surrounded by an [[sport of athletics|athletics]] track and a spectator rail circling the field of play, a training complex featuring four grass pitches, and a gravel pitch.<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\"/> Behind one of the goals various athletics facilities were established, as the club shared the stadium with Brøndby Atletik.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=1. etape - 1965: Masser af luft |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/1-etape-1965/ |publisher=brondby.com |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In addition, a changing room with four separate compartments was constructed, featuring showers and toilet facilities.<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/><ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\"/> 

The official inauguration of the pitch was officially planned for late Summer 1965, but issues with making the grass grow postponed the launch to 31 July 1966.<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/>

In the following years, the area around Brøndby Stadion continuously developed and expanded; in 1969–70 the municipality constructed additional training pitches South of the ground, close to the [[Danish national road 21|Holbæk Motorway]],<ref name=\"Barnak33\">Barnak 2007, p. 33</ref> and even more training complexes were built South of the motorway in 1972–74.<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/>

Conditions around the main playing pitch were also improved; in 1966 two [[turnstile]]s were set up at the stadium entrance,<ref name=\"Barnak33\"/> and in 1969 a clock was added, courtesy of local [[watchmaker]] Bent Henriksen from [[Brøndbyøster Torv]].<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/> In 1973 the municipality allocated [[Danish krone|DKK]] 20,000 to set up a modern loudspeaker system consisting of four ''folded'' [[horn loudspeaker]]s suspended on four-metre steel trusses.<ref name=\"Barnak3233\"/>

=== Constructing the stands ===
As [[Brøndby IF]] moved up the ranks, a need arose for a more contemporary stadium. In 1975, the [[Brøndby Municipality|municipality]] allowed the club to improve spectator facilities by installing two-step terraces around the [[running track]].<ref name=\"Barnak72\">Barnak 2007, p. 72</ref> This happened despite the club's wishes to install a covered grandstand.<ref name=\"Barnak72\"/>

Only in 1977, when the club reached promotion to the third highest football league in Denmark, the [[Danish 2nd Division]], did the municipality decide that a covered grandstand should be erected.<ref name=\"Barnak73\"/> The [[Danish krone|DKK]] 4 million project broke ground during the summer of 1978, and in early 1979 the grandstand was ready for use.<ref name=\"Barnak73\">Barnak 2007, p. 73</ref> The stand, which could hold 1,335 seated spectators, and included a [[announcer|speaker]] booth, media facilities and a TV plateau, was placed facing West towards [[Gildhøj (Brøndby Municipality)|Gildhøjskolen]].<ref name=\"Barnak73\"/> Beneath the stand were constructed four dressing rooms, a kiosk, an office, toilet facilities, a storage room as well as the club room of Brøndby Atletik.<ref name=\"Barnak73\"/> In the spring of 1980, the municipality installed the first floodlights with a brightness of 4 x 24&nbsp;kW.<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg\"/> With the new stand, spectator capacity increased to 5,000.<ref name=\"Barnak72\"/>

As Brøndby IF had reached promotion to the highest football league in Denmark in the fall of 1981, then known as the [[Danish Superliga|1st Division]], mayor Kjeld Rasmussen proclaimed that a covered stand would be constructed.<ref name=\"Barnak80\">Barnak 2007, p. 80</ref> Prior to the [[1982 Danish 1st Division|1982 season]] &ndash; Brøndby's first on the highest level &ndash; concrete [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] were installed opposite the existing grandstand, consisting of 13 rows of terraces the length of the pitch in open air.<ref name=\"Stadion tillaeg2\">{{cite news |author= |title=Stadion tillæg |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |date=22 October 2000 }}</ref> This allowed a crowd of 5,000 additional people,<ref name=\"3. etape\">{{cite news |author= |title=3. etape - 1982: Ståpladser til folket |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/3-etape-1982/ |publisher=brondby.com |pages= |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> bringing the total capacity to 10,000.

[[File:Brøndby_Stadion_2005-04.jpg|thumb|left|Brøndby Stadion as seen from the South in 2005.]]
After the club had established itself in the top of [[Football in Denmark|Danish football]] during the 1980s, Brøndby IF reached a hitherto zenith by reaching the [[1990–91_UEFA_Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] of the [[1990–91 UEFA Cup]].<ref name=\"FiB07\">{{cite web|url=https://brondby.com/nyhed/2007/03/20/fra-mark-til-arena|publisher=[[Brøndby IF]]|title=Fra mark til Arena|date=20 March 2007|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rasmussen205207\">Rasmussen 2009, pp. 205–207.</ref> At that time, Brøndby Stadion did not live up to international standards to host matches at that level. However, this was solved by installing temporary end stands of [[scaffolding]], which allowed the club to receive an approval by the [[UEFA]] to organise the home leg against [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]].<ref name=\"FiB07\"/> The changes raised the total capacity to 15,000 spectators, and the club even outdid themselves when they reached the [[1990–91_UEFA_Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] by increasing the capacity to 17,000&ndash;18,000.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=5. etape - 1991: Den uslåelige stadionrekord |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/4-etape-1989/ |publisher=brondby.com |pages= |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In the same period Brøndby IF submitted a bid to host the [[Denmark national football team]] at a new national stadium; a \"''Stadion Danmark''\", which would seat 60,000 spectators and border the [[Danish national road 21|Holbæk Motorway]].<ref name=\"FiB07\" /> These plans, however, never came to fruition as [[Parken Stadium]] won the bid and eventually became the national stadium.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parken, Danmarks Nationalstadion |url=https://www.cfmoller.com/p/-da/Parken-Danmarks-Nationalstadion-i34.html# |website=cfmoller.com |publisher=[[C. F. Møller Architects]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

As Brøndby IF gained domestic and European success, spectator interest had grown to such a degree, that it became necessary to move the biggest matches to [[Københavns Idrætspark]].<ref name=\"4. etape\">{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415020824/http://brondby.com/article.asp?aid=77 |title=4. etape - 1989-1990 |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |date=1 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415020824/http://brondby.com/article.asp?aid=77 |archivedate=15 August 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2020 }}</ref> This solution was not deemed satisfactory for neither club, fans nor sponsors, who wanted to remain rooted in the local community.<ref name=\"4. etape\"/><ref name=\"FiB07\"/> Therefore, the board under leadership of [[Per Bjerregaard]], decided to plan an expansion of Brøndby Stadion.<ref name=\"Barnak139140\">Barnak 2007, pp. 139-140</ref> The first step was taken in 1990, when the stand opposite the grandstand was covered and expanded with eight rows, holding 3,500 seated spectators, as well as terracing holding 10,500 standing spectators in total.<ref name=\"BT 1991-03-12\">{{cite news |title=B.T. tester de 10 Superliga stadion |publisher=[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] |date=12 March 1991 |page=2 }}</ref> In the same year the grandstand was expanded with a lounge for sponsors in which a panoramic window allowed for a view of the entire pitch.<ref name=\"FiB07\"/> While Brøndby Municipality had financed the new covered stand, Brøndby IF funded the construction of the sponsors lounge.<ref name=\"Barnak139140\"/>

Despite improved spectator facilities, the stadium did still not live up to UEFA requirements,<ref name=\"6. etape\">{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/6-etape-1992/ |title=6. etape - 1992 |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> and the club wished to erect permanent terracing behind both goals.<ref name=\"Barnak139140\"/> As this would mean that the running track around the pitch had to be demolished, and that Brøndby Atletik would have to be compensated with a new running track elsewhere,<ref name=\"BT-1991-06-12\">{{cite news |last=Fredberg |first=Peter |title=Vi ofrer ikke atletikken |publisher=[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] |date=12 June 1991 |page=34 }}</ref> the municipality chose to turn down Brøndby IF's application to further expand the stadium.<ref name=\"Barnak139140\">Barnak 2007, pp. 139-140</ref> This made the club consider moving to another city where it would be able to host international games,<ref name=\"Barnak139140\"/> prompting the municipality to offer Brøndby IF to acquire the stadium and thus raise money to construct an athletics stadium.<ref name=\"Barnak139140\"/> The club board, spearheaded by Bjerregaard, was, however, only interested in purchasing the area behind the two goals.<ref name=\"Barnak139140\"/> Brøndby IF had meanwhile offered to pay for construction costs of the end stands themselves, but in order to do so the pitch had to be expanded both in width and length.<ref name=\"Barnak139140\"/>

In 1991, the municipal council decided that Brøndby IF should have the sole right to use the stadium.<ref name=\"Barnak140141\">Barnak 2007, pp. 140-141</ref> Thus, a green light was finally given to turn Brøndby Stadion into a [[Soccer-specific stadium|football-specific stadium]]. In December 1991, the contractor began removing the running track,<ref name=\"Barnak140141\"/> and in the spring of 1992, the expanded Brøndby Stadion has reached completion: four covered stands with a total capacity of almost 21,000 spectators.<ref name=\"BT 1991-02-13\">{{cite news |last=Fredberg |first=Peter |title=Nu får Brøndby sit Super-Stadion |publisher=[[B.T. (tabloid|B.T.]] |date=13 February 1991 |page=33 }}</ref><ref name=\"BT 1991-08-07\">{{cite news |last=Uno |first=Steeb |title=Brøndby får sit EC-stadion |work=[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] |date=7 August 1991 |page=28 }}</ref> This included the infamous terraced \"South Side\"-end ({{lang-da|Sydsiden}}) &ndash; then known as ''[[Faxe Brewery|Faxe]] Tribunen'' for sponsorship reasons &ndash; which was inaugurated on 29 March 1992.<ref name=\"6. etape\"/> With the 1,335 seats on the main grandstand and another 3,000 new seats on the lower side of the opposite stand, the stadium could hold more than 6,000 seated spectators.<ref name=\"Barnak141\">Barnak 2007, p. 141</ref>

=== 1999–2000 expansion ===
Despite several expansions and improvements over the years, Brøndby Stadion could still not achieve acceptable capacity for international matches, and the club was therefore forced to rent [[Parken Stadium]] in [[Indre Østerbro]] &ndash; home of the [[Denmark national football team|national team]] as well as archrivals [[F.C.

The first step was commencing negotiations with [[Brøndby Municipality]] in order to secure the total acquisition of the stadium, and as a result of the proceedings, [[Brøndby IF]] [[Aktieselskab|A/S]] purchased Brøndby Stadion for [[Danish krone|DKK]] 23.5 million in May 1998.<ref name=\"Reuters 1998-05-14\">{{cite news |title=Brøndby køber eget stadion for 23,5 mio - BIF |work=[[Reuters]] |date=14 May 1998 }}</ref><ref>Storm & Thomsen 2016, p. 278</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Larsen |first1=Christian W. |title=Brøndby får eget stadion |publisher=[[Aktuelt]] |date=14 May 1998}}</ref> From this, DKK 16 million was to be deducted for the two end stands and the sponsors lounge,<ref name=\"Reuters 1998-05-14\"/> which the club itself had financed, resulting in a final amount of DKK 7.3 million.<ref name=\"Barnak180\">Barnak 2007, p. 180</ref>

[[File:Brøndby_Stadion.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Brøndby Stadion.]]

The connected upper stands meant that the corners of the stadium became partly enclosed, and toilet stalls as well as food and drink outlets were placed in the spaces between the lower and upper stands.<ref name=\"Barnak181\"/> The new upper stands included 13,600 new seats, increasing the total capacity to 31,500 spectators.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> For international matches, capacity was limited to 26,500 spectators as they demand [[all-seater|all-seated]] crowds.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> The entire redevelopment was carried out while the club still played its home games at the stadium, and the original changing rooms under the main grandstand, originating from 1978, were retained.<ref name=\"Barnak181\"/>

The stadium officially reopened with a ceremony on 22 October 2000,<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/> followed by an [[exhibition game]] between the [[Brøndby IF]] team from 1989 and [[:da:Skagen Idræts Klub|Skagen IK]]; a rematch mirroring a [[1986–87 Danish Cup]] game, where Skagen from the Danish fifth tier knocked out Brøndby after a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty-shootout]], in what has been described as \"the biggest sensation in Danish Cup history\".<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2000\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Videbæk |first1=Klaus |title=Da Skagen IK slog Brøndby: 'Det største jeg har oplevet i mit sportsliv' |url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/regionale/nordjylland/da-skagen-ik-slog-broendby-det-stoerste-jeg-har-oplevet-i-mit |website=dr.dk |publisher=[[Danmarks Radio]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=27 April 2017}}</ref> The first competitive game after the rebuild occurred on 22 October 2000 with a 4&ndash;2 league win over [[Akademisk Boldklub]] in front of 28,416 spectators.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rachlin |first1=Michael |title=Brøndbys dejlige dag |url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/kbh/ECE3300722/Br%C3%B8ndbys-dejlige-dag/ |website=jyllands-posten.dk |publisher=[[Jyllands-Posten]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=22 October 2000}}</ref>

=== Additions and improvements ===
Because the total costs of the 1999–2000 expansion exceeded the originally planned budget by [[Danish krone|DKK]] 30–40 million, some major and minor additions and improvements to audience facilities were postponed and subsequently carried out over time.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2001\"/><ref name=\"Barnak181\"/> First of foremost, the club could not afford new turnstiles, and a planned, highly modern entrance system was only installed in 2003, just as the scoreboards initally did not meet the requirements of the [[Danish Football Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.infomedia.dk/mediearkiv/link?articles=e008d0b4 |title=11 superligastadions dumpet |publisher=[[Ritzau]] |date=30 June 2003 |accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> The original substitutes' benches in the [[technical area]] likewise had to be utilised for some years before being permanently replaced by benches below pitch-level in 2005.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://brondby.com/upload/biffile_vrizkpoxn3iharmmlzhm_36880.pdf|publisher=[[Brøndby IF]]|title=Årsrapport 2005|accessdate=17January 2015|page=19}}</ref>

The new blue seats planned for the lower stands would initially have to wait; firstly, the old, worn-out seats were retained on the two original longside stands, which in the first years following the rebuild appeared as gray, red, yellow and light blue seats. Secondly, seats were expected to be fitted to the extended section of the old grandstand and the lower section of the northern end stand. However, an extra \"row 34\" was added relatively quickly all the way around the top of the stands, in front of the glass partitions.

As new dark blue seats were installed on the aforementioned areas in 2003, a total seating capacity reached 23,400. This increased total stadium capacity to 29,000,<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2003\">{{cite web|url=http://brondby.com/upload/biffile_vrj7ojvt3bb7yet69qvf_34266.pdf|publisher=[[Brøndby IF]]|title=Årsrapport 2003|accessdate=17 January 2015|page=11}}</ref> while the stadium could hold crowds of 26,144 for international matches.<ref name=\"Årsrapport 2003\"/> This was due to the fact that for international fixtures, the South Side-end [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] could be converted into approximately 2,600 seats.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lassen |first1=Kurt |title=Stådrengene fra Vestegnen |url=https://www.berlingske.dk/sport/staadrengene-fra-vestegnen |website=berlingske.dk |publisher=[[Berlingske]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |date=13 March 2004}}</ref> Despite many delayed improvements to the stadium, the redevelopment in 2000 already had already secured improved facilities for wheelchair users, as a wheelchair lift had been installed at the southern end of the East Stand.<ref name=\"stadionoverblik\" />

In 2006–2007, the East Stand (today known as ''GSV Stand'' ({{lang-da|GSV-tribunen}}) for sponsorship reasons) was further expanded at the back with a lounge for sponsors, classrooms for [[:da:Brøndby Gymnasium|Brøndby Gymnasium]] ([[Secondary education in Denmark|general upper secondary education]]), a public gym, a production kitchen and the sports bar \"''1964''\".<ref name=\"RB Børsen 2006-03-07\">{{cite news |title=Brøndby opfører ny bygning på Brøndby Stadion for 90 mio (Opd) |publisher=[[Børsen]] |date=7 March 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"9. etape\">{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/klub/stadion/historie/9-etape-2007/ |title=9. etape - 2007 |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 }}</ref> In addition, spectator conditions were improved upon with six new multi-stalls and three new staircases beneath the East Stand.<ref name=\"9. etape\"/> Two large [[Light-emitting diodes|LED]] screens were also installed during this period.<ref name=\"9. etape\"/> The total cost of the project ran up to DKK 90 million.<ref name=\"RB Børsen 2006-03-07\"/>

During the winter break in of the [[2017–18 Brøndby IF season|2017–18 season]], the hole on the South Side-end was closed which meant that an additional 75 seats and extra capacity for 150 standing spectators on terracing were added to the stadium.<ref name=\"TipsSyd\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/superliga/broendby-fans-betaler-selv-ombygning-af-sydsiden|title=Brøndby-fans betaler selv ombygningen af Sydsiden|work=[[Tipsbladet]]|date=22 December 2017|accessdate=23 April 2018|author=Lasse Sylvest Mikkelsen}}</ref> The rebuild was financed by the club's fans, through the official fanclub ''[[Brøndby_IF#Support|Brøndby Support]]'' and various unofficial fan groups,<ref name=\"TipsSyd\"/> and through a so-called \"fan fund\" which arose as a result of season tickets and merchandise sales, among other things.<ref name=\"VaerMed\">{{cite web|url=https://brondby.com/nyhed/2017/12/13/vaer-med-til-at-forbedre-sydsiden|title=Vær med til at forbedre Sydsiden|date=13 December 2017|accessdate=23 April 2018|work=[[Brøndby IF]]}}</ref> In total, the renovation costs amounted to DKK 450,000, of which the fan fund accounted for DKK 270,000.<ref name=\"TipsSyd\"/><ref name=\"VaerMed\"/> In the summer of 2018, new 256 LED floodlights were installed, produced in China.<ref name=\"Lys2018\">{{cite web|url=https://brondby.com/nyhed/2018/07/10/454399|title=Nyt lys skal langtidssikre Brøndby Stadion|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=11 July 2018|work=[[Brøndby IF]]}}</ref>

== Structure and facilities ==
The Brøndby Stadion pitch is surrounded by four covered stands, officially known as Sydsiden (South), GSV-tribunen (East), J. Jensen-tribunen (North) and Carlsberg-tribunen (West). Three stands are all-seaters (except the away section on the North End) while the South End is terracing. Each stand has two tiers.

=== Sydsiden (South End) ===
Sydsiden, literally \"South Side\" in English, was inaugurated as the new South Stand on 29 March 1992 in a match against [[Lyngby Boldklub]], due to a rise in interest for Brøndby IF.<ref name=\"FiB07\"/><ref name=Sydsiden2>{{cite web |url=https://sydsiden.brondby.com/ |title=Sydsiden 25 år |date=15 March 2017 |publisher=Brøndby IF |accessdate=15 March}}</ref> The lower part of the stand has a standing capacity of 5,600 spectators. Initially, spectators would sit on the terraces,<ref name=Sydsiden>{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2017/03/14/de-foerste-aar-paa-sydsiden |title=De Første År På Sydsiden |date=15 March 2017 |publisher=Brøndby IF |accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref> but younger fans would begin encouraging all fans on Sydsiden to stand up, because they thought that it was easier to sing while standing, which would evolve into the mantra \"sing or piss off\" ({{lang-da|syng eller skrid}}).<ref name=Sydsiden/> This would mark the beginning of a hard-core fan-culture formation on Sydsiden, which has remained ever since, and it is known as the stand in Denmark with the most dedicated and loudest fans when Brøndby plays its home games.<ref name=\"6. etape\"/>

Until 6 March 2011, Sydsiden was known by its sponsor name, \"Faxe Tribunen\", a subsidiary of [[Royal Unibrew]]. This had to change as there was a conflict of interest as [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] moved in as new sponsors. Sydsiden was chosen by a panel representing a broad section of the active fan base at Brøndby Stadion, as fans had called the stand this before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2011/01/18/faxe-tribunen-bliver-til-sydsiden |title=Faxe-tribunen bliver til Sydsiden |date=18 January 2011 |publisher=Brøndby IF |accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> Halfway through the 2017–18 season, the hole in the middle of the stand was partly closed, after continuous requests by fans.<ref name=\"VaerMed\"/>

A permanent fanzone was inaugurated outside Sydsiden in 2018 for spectators and fans before, during and after the games. The fanzone is the first of its kind in Scandinavia, and consists of stands for live concerts, bars, foodstands and toilet facilities.

Sydsiden popularised the \"Fenerbahçe greeting\" in Denmark, imported through the transfer of [[Brian Steen Nielsen]] to the Turkish club. A cooperation between goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and [[Brøndby IF#Support|Brøndby Support]] effectually made the greeting get foothold in Denmark.<ref name=Sydsiden/>

=== North End ===
The North Stand, now known as \"J. Jensen-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was originally known as \"da:OBS!-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1992 as terracing, and has among fans been known as \"Pølseenden\" ({{lang-da|[[:da:Rosinen i pølseenden|the sausage end]]}}) due to its former major sponsor, sausage producer Steff-Houlberg. Fans from the away team are assigned a section on this stand, usually in the eastern part of the North Stand, seperated from Brøndby's home fans.

=== West Stand ===
The West Stand, known as \"[[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]-tribunen\", was originally named \"Frisko-tribunen and later also \"SAS-tribunen\" and \"Apollo-tribunen\". The original part of the stand was completed in 1979 as the first stand of the stadium, and it has been preserved through the large expansion in 1999–2000. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites, and is the ground's main grandstand.

=== East Stand ===
The East Stand, now known as \"GSV-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was formerly called \"LOXAM-tribunen\", \"[[Codan]]-tribunen and \"DNE-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1982 and 1990. The East Stand was originally without a roof, and consisted of terraces. Today, it is the largest stand of Brøndby Stadion with a total of 34 rows of seats. In 2006, a larger extension was established behind the stand from the facade, consisting of sponsor facilities, a sports bar and classrooms for Brøndby Gymnasium. The classrooms were inaugurated on 8 January 2007. In April 2018, a new family lounge was opened behind the East Stand with both physical and Esports facilities.

==Transportation==
The easiest way of getting to the stadium with public transport is with the [[S-tog]] or S-train. Line B (green) will stop at both Brøndbyøster and Glostrup stations, where there are shuttle buses on match days. One can also walk from the stations, with the walk taking 15 minutes from Glostrup, and slightly longer from Brøndbyøster.

==National games==
Brøndby Stadion has been used five times as home ground for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]]. Further it has been the venue of four youth national matches and a league national match:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/page.aspx?id=5641 |title=Landsholdsdatabasen |publisher=[[Danish Football Association]] |accessdate=2010-03-01 |language=Danish }}</ref>

'''Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas''' (22 October 1870{{spaced ndash}}20 March 1945) was a British poet and journalist best known as the lover of [[Oscar Wilde]].

While studying at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], he edited an undergraduate journal, ''The Spirit Lamp'', which carried a [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] subtext, and met Wilde, with whom he started a close but stormy relationship. Douglas’ father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], disapproved strongly of the affair, and set out to humiliate Wilde, publicly accusing him of homosexuality. Wilde sued him for criminal [[libel]], but some of his intimate notes were discovered, and he was duly jailed. On his release, Wilde briefly lived with Douglas in Naples, but they were separated by the time Wilde died in 1900.

Douglas married [[Olive Custance]] in 1902, and they produced a son, Raymond. Converting to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1911, he openly repudiated Wilde’s homosexuality, and in a High-Catholic magazine, ''Plain English'', he expressed views that were openly [[anti-Semitic]], though he rejected the policies of [[Nazi Germany]]. He was also jailed for libeling [[Winston Churchill]] over claims of wartime misconduct.

Douglas wrote several books of verse, some of it classified in the homoerotic [[Uranian poetry|Uranian]] genre. The phrase \"The love that dare not speak its name\" came from one of Douglas’ poems, though it is widely misattributed to Wilde.

==Early life and background==
[[File:JohnSholtoDouglasMarquessofQueensberry.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|The 9th Marquess of Queensberry]]]]
Douglas was born at Ham Hill House in [[Powick]], [[Worcestershire]], the third son of [[The Most Honourable|The Most Hon.]] [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] and his first wife, Sibyl Montgomery.

He was his mother's favourite child; she called him Bosie (a derivative of \"boysie\", as in boy), a nickname which stuck for the rest of his life.<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB|id=32869|title=Douglas, Lord Alfred Bruce (1870–1945)}}</ref> His mother successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his father's adultery.<ref>\"The Queensberry Divorce Case\", ''The Times'', 24 January 1887, p. 4</ref> The [[Marquess]] married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year.

Douglas was educated at [[Wixenford School]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Rupert|last=Croft-Cooke|title=Bosie: The Story of Lord Alfred Douglas, His Friends and Enemies|publisher=[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=1963|isbn=978-1299419407|page=33}}</ref> [[Winchester College]] (1884–88) and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1889–93), which he left without obtaining a degree. At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], he edited an undergraduate journal, ''The Spirit Lamp'' (1892–3), an activity that intensified the constant conflict between him and his father. Their relationship had always been a strained one and, during the Queensberry-Wilde feud, Douglas sided with Wilde, even encouraging Wilde to prosecute the Marquess for libel. In 1893, Douglas had a brief affair with [[George Cecil Ives|George Ives]].

==Relationship with Wilde==
[[File:Wilde Douglas British Library B20147-85.jpg|thumb|Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas, May 1893]]

In 1891, Douglas's cousin [[Lionel Johnson]] introduced him to Oscar Wilde; although the playwright was married with two sons, they soon began an affair.<ref>H. Montgomery Hyde, ''The Love That Dared not Speak its Name;'' p.144</ref><ref>Ellmann (1988:98)</ref> In 1894, the [[Robert Smythe Hichens|Robert Hichens]] novel ''[[The Green Carnation]]'' was published. Said to be a ''[[roman à clef]]'' based on the relationship of Wilde and Douglas, it was one of the texts used against Wilde during his trials in 1895.

Douglas has been described as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on men and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to funding his tastes. They often argued and broke up, but would also always reconcile.

Douglas had praised Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' in the Oxford magazine, ''The Spirit Lamp'', of which he was editor (and used as a covert means of gaining acceptance for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written ''Salomé'' in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"''On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs''\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered  \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and  claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two men, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] and the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] when they themselves objected to Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to [[Robbie Ross]]: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but, in a gesture of reconciliation, suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title-page. Accepting this, Douglas, somewhat vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title-page as \"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman\".<ref name=\"Ellmann\" />

In 1894, Douglas came and visited Oscar Wilde in Worthing, much to the consternation of the latter's wife Constance.<ref>Antony Edmunds, ''Oscar Wilde's Scandalous Summer;'' p.26 [http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128075207/http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html |date=28 November 2018 }}</ref>

On another occasion, while staying with Wilde in [[Brighton]], Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, but failed to return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] and, on Wilde's 40th birthday, sent him a letter saying that he had charged him the bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for [[blackmail]].<ref name=\"Ellmann\">''Oscar Wilde'' by Richard Ellman, published in 1987</ref>

Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, suspected the liaison to be more than a friendship. He sent his son a letter, attacking him for leaving Oxford without a degree and failing to take up a proper career. He threatened to \"disown [Alfred] and stop all money supplies\". Alfred responded with a telegram stating: \"What a funny little man you are\".

Queensberry's next letter threatened his son with a \"thrashing\" and accused him of being \"crazy\". He also threatened to \"make a public scandal in a way you little dream of\" if he continued his relationship with Wilde.

Queensberry was well known for his temper and threatening to beat people with a horsewhip. Alfred sent his father a postcard stating \"I detest you\" and making it clear that he would take Wilde's side in a fight between him and the Marquess, \"with a loaded revolver\".

In answer Queensberry wrote to Alfred (whom he addressed as \"You miserable creature\") that he had divorced Alfred's mother in order not to \"run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself\" and that, when Alfred was a baby, \"I cried over you the bitterest tears a man ever shed, that I had brought such a creature into the world, and unwittingly committed such a crime&nbsp;... You must be demented\".

When Douglas's eldest brother [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig|Francis Viscount Drumlanrig]] died in a suspicious hunting accident in October 1894, rumours circulated that he had been having a homosexual relationship with the Prime Minister, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], and that the cause of death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son, and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant, and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial.<ref>Ellmann (1988:101)</ref> He and a minder confronted the playwright in his own home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde during the premiere of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', but, forewarned of this, the playwright was able to deny him access to the theatre.

Queensberry then publicly insulted Wilde by leaving, at the latter's club, a [[visiting card]] on which he had written: \"For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite {{sic}}\". The wording is in dispute – the handwriting is unclear – although Hyde reports it as this. According to [[Merlin Holland]], Wilde's grandson, it is more likely \"Posing somdomite\", while Queensberry himself claimed it to be \"Posing as somdomite\". Holland suggests that this wording (\"posing [as] ...\") would have been easier to defend in court.

==The 1895 trials==
{{Main|Oscar Wilde#Trials|l1=Oscar Wilde – Trials}}
In response to this card, and with Douglas's avid support, but against the advice of friends such as [[Robbie Ross]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]], Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal [[libel]] in a [[private prosecution]], as [[sodomy]] was then a criminal offence. According to libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction only by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was factually true, but that there was also some public interest in having made the charge publicly. [[Edward Carson]], Queensberry's lawyer, accordingly portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who habitually preyed upon naive young boys and, with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle, seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced into evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was closely questioned about the homoerotic themes in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and in ''The Chameleon'', a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed his 'Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young'.

[[File:Somdomite.jpg|thumb|The calling card in question, labelled Exhibit A in the trial (bottom left corner)|left]]Queensberry's attorney announced in court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry's considerable legal costs, leaving him [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].

Based on the evidence raised during the case, Wilde was arrested the next day and charged with committing criminal [[sodomy]] and \"[[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]]\", a charge only capable of being committed by two men and which covered sexual acts other than sodomy.

Douglas's September 1892 poem \"[[s:Two Loves (1894 poem)|Two Loves]]\" (published in the Oxford magazine ''The Chameleon'' in December 1894), which was used against Wilde at the latter's trial, ends with the famous line that refers to homosexuality as ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'', a quote often falsely attributed to Wilde. Wilde gave an eloquent but counterproductive explanation of the nature of this love on the witness stand. The trial resulted in a [[hung jury]].

In 1895, when during his trials Wilde was released on bail, Douglas's cousin [[Sholto Johnstone Douglas]] stood [[surety]] for [[pound sterling|£]]500 of the bail money.<ref>Borland, Maureen, ''Wilde's Devoted Friend: A Life of Robert Ross, 1869–1918'' (Lennard Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j2lnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&dq=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&ei=j1R5SfWUMpWyyQS4kNSwBg&pgis=1 p. 206] at books.google.com, accessed 22 January 2009</ref> The prosecutor opted to retry the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years' [[hard labour]], first at [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville]], then [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], then famously in [[HM Prison Reading|Reading Gaol]]. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.

While in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter titled ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', describing exactly what he felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but which may or may not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde's on which Ross consulted. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at [[Rouen]], but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.

==Naples and Paris==
The meeting in Rouen was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together in Naples, but because of financial pressures and for other personal reasons, they separated. Wilde spent the remainder of his life primarily in Paris, and Douglas returned to Britain in late 1898.

The period when the two men lived in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed that Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually did gain funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he did give him occasional handouts. When Wilde died in 1900, he was still bankrupt. Douglas served as chief mourner, although there reportedly was an altercation at the grave between him and Robbie Ross. This struggle developed into a feud<ref>{{cite book|title=World Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvwIAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=E. Hulton}}</ref> which foreshadowed the later litigations between the two former lovers of Wilde.

==Marriage==
[[File:Lady-alfred-douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady Alfred Douglas]]
After Wilde's death, Douglas established a close friendship with [[Olive Custance]], a [[bisexual]] heiress and poet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Sarah|title='A Girl's Love': Lord Alfred Douglas as Homoerotic Muse in the Poetry of Olive Custance|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|location=London, England|date=September 2011|volume=22|issue=2–3|pages=220–240|doi=10.1080/09574042.2011.585045|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/22672}}</ref> They married on 4 March 1902.

The marriage was stormy after Douglas became a [[Roman Catholic]] in 1911. They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Custance also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up Catholicism. The health of their only child further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920s was all but over, although they never divorced.

==Repudiation of Wilde==
In 1911, Douglas embraced Roman Catholicism, as Wilde had done earlier. More than a decade after Wilde's death, with the release of suppressed portions of Wilde's ''De Profundis'' letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by [[Maud Allan]] against [[Noel Pemberton Billing]] in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', of being part of a homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.

Douglas also contributed to Billing's journal ''Vigilante'' as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem referring to [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]] \"bound with Lesbian fillets\" while her husband [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert]], the Prime Minister, gave money to Ross.<ref>Philip Hoare. (1999). ''Oscar Wilde’s Last Stand: Decadence, Conspiracy, and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century''. Arcade Publishing, p.&nbsp;110.</ref> During the trial he described Wilde as \"the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years\". Douglas added that he intensely regretted having met Wilde, and having helped him with the translation of ''Salome'', which he described as \"a most pernicious and abominable piece of work\".

==''Plain English''==

In 1920 Douglas founded a [[Far-right politics|right-wing]], Catholic, and \"deeply anti-Jewish\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Toczek|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2015|isbn=978-1138853485|page=239}}</ref> weekly magazine called ''Plain English'', on which he collaborated with [[Harold Sherwood Spencer]], and to begin with [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland]]. It regarded itself as the successor to ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', to which Douglas had been a contributing editor. ''Plain English'' ran until the end of 1922. Douglas later admitted that its policy was \"strongly anti-Semitic\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p. 302</ref><ref>Brown, William Sorley ''The Life and Genius of T.W.H. Crosland'' (1928) p394</ref>

From August 1920 (issue No 8) ''Plain English'' began publishing a long running series of articles called \"The Jewish Peril\" by [[Arthur Cherep-Spiridovich|Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovitch]] the title of which was taken from the fore-title of [[George Shanks]]' version of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. ''Plain English'' advertised (from issue 20) [[The Britons]]' second edition of Shank's version of the ''Protocols''. Douglas challenged the ''Jewish Guardian'', published by the [[League of British Jews]], to take him to court suggesting they would not as they were \"well aware of the absolute truth of the allegations which we have made\".<ref>The \"Jewish Guardian\" Again, ''Plain English'' No 21, 27 November 1920</ref> The magazine suggested in 1921, \"we need a [[Ku Klux Klan]] in this country\",<ref>Lies, ''Plain English'' No 66, 8 October 1921</ref> but a promotion for ''[[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]'' magazine was generally not well received by readers.

Other regular targets of the magazine included [[David Lloyd George]], [[Lord Northcliffe|Alfred Viscount Northcliffe]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[Sinn Féin]]. In December 1920 the magazine was the first to publish the secret constitution of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].

From 25 December 1920 it began publishing regularly its most notorious series of articles alleging that a \"powerful individual in the Admiralty\" had alerted the Germans at the [[Battle of Jutland]] that the British had broken their code, and that [[Winston Churchill]] had falsified a report in return for a large sum of money from [[Ernest Cassel]] who thereby profited; in May 1921 Douglas would also insinuate that [[Herbert Kitchener|Herbert Earl Kitchener]] had been murdered by the Jews.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Heathorn|title=Haig and Kitchener in Twentieth-Century Britain: Remembrance, Representation and Appropriation|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2016|isbn=978-0754669654|pages=68–72}}</ref>

Douglas ceased to be editor after issue 67 in 1921 after a row with Spencer.<ref>Toczek, p. 34</ref> He then produced a short lived, almost identical, rival magazine called ''Plain Speech'' in 1921 with [[Herbert Moore Pim]]. Its first issue contained a letter from a correspondent in Germany praising \"[[Adolf Hitler|Herr Hittler]]\" (as spelled in original) and \"[[Nazi Party|The German White Labour Party]]\".

Douglas's view of a Jewish plot was nuanced. In 1920 he would, whilst recognizing \"the Jewish Peril\", noted that \"Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race\".<ref>Christian Charity and the Jews, ''Plain English'' No. 4, 31 July 1920, p. 78</ref> In 1921 he would state it was not acceptable to \"shift responsibility\" onto the Jews.<ref>\"The Jews, 'The Britons' and the ''Morning Post''\", ''Plain Speech'' No. 10, 24 December 1921, p. 149</ref> In his ''Autobiography'' in 1929 he wrote, \"I feel now that it is ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish\", and then indicated the country had only itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.<ref>''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) pp. 303–304</ref>

The historian [[Colin Holmes (historian)|Colin Holmes]] indicated that while \"Douglas had been to the forefront of anti-semitism in the early 1920s, he was quite unable to come to terms with the vicious racist anti-semitism in Germany\" under the Nazis.<ref>Holmes, Colin ''Anti-Semitism in British Society, 1876–1939'' Routledge (1979) p. 218</ref> Politically he described himself as \"a strong Conservative of the 'Diehard' variety\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p220</ref>

==Libel actions==
Douglas started his \"litigious and libellous career\" by obtaining an apology and fifty guineas each from the Oxford and Cambridge university magazines ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]'' and ''Cambridge'' for defamatory references to him in an article on Wilde.<ref>(Murray p&nbsp;152)</ref>

Douglas was either plaintiff or defendant in several trials for civil or [[criminal libel]]. In 1913 he was charged with libelling his father-in-law. Also in 1913 he accused [[Arthur Ransome]] of libelling him in his book ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study''. He saw this trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour and Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12530/page/77 The Edinburgh Gazette Publication date:17 January 1913 Issue: 12530, Page 77]</ref> Ransome did remove the offending passages from the second edition of his book.<ref>Ransome, Arthur, ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study'', 2nd edition, Methuen, 1913</ref>

In the most noted case, brought by the Crown on Winston Churchill's behalf in 1923, Douglas was found guilty of libelling Churchill and was sentenced to six months in prison. Churchill had been accused as cabinet minister, of falsifying an official report on the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 when, although suffering losses, the Royal Navy drove the German battle fleet off the high seas. Churchill was said to have reported that the British navy had in fact, been defeated; the motive was supposed to be that when this news was flashed, the prices of British securities would tumble on the world's stock exchanges, allowing a group of named Jewish financiers to snap them up cheaply. Churchill's reward was a houseful of furniture, valued at [[Pound sterling|£]]40,000.

The allegations were made by Douglas in his journal ''Plain English'' and later at a public meeting in London. A false report of a crushing British naval defeat had indeed been planted in the New York press by German interests but by this time (following the failure of his [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]]), Churchill was not connected with the Admiralty. As the attorney general asserted in court, on Churchill's behalf, there was \"no plot, no phoney communiqué, no stock market raid and no present of fine furniture\".<ref>http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727630,00.html accessed 10/2/2017</ref><ref>http://www.jta.org/1923/12/13/archive/churchill-wins-libel-suit-against-douglas accessed 10/2/2017</ref>

In 1924, while in prison, Douglas, in an echo of Wilde's composition of ''De Profundis'' ([[Latin]] for \"From the Depths\") during his incarceration, wrote his last major poetic work, ''In Excelsis'' (In the Highest), which contains 17 [[canto]]s. Since the prison authorities would not allow Douglas to take the manuscript with him when he was released, he had to rewrite the work from memory. Douglas maintained that his health never recovered from his harsh prison ordeal, which included sleeping on a plank bed without a mattress.

==Later life==
Following his incarceration in 1924, Douglas's feelings towards Wilde began to soften. He wrote in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' that \"Sometimes a sin is also a crime (for example, a murder or theft), but this is not the case with homosexuality, any more than with adultery\".<ref>(Murray pp 309–310)</ref> Throughout the 1930s and until his death Douglas maintained correspondence with many people, including [[Marie Stopes]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. [[Anthony Wynn]] wrote the play ''Bernard and Bosie: A Most Unlikely Friendship'' based on the letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas's final public appearances was his well-received lecture to the [[Royal Society of Literature]] on 2 September 1943, entitled ''The Principles of Poetry'', which was published in an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] and the talk was praised by [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[Augustus John]].<ref>(Murray pp 318–319)</ref>

Douglas's only child, Raymond, was diagnosed with [[schizoaffective disorder]] in 1927, at the age of 24 and entered [[St Andrew's Hospital]], a mental institution. He was decertified and discharged after five years but suffered another breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral and in June he was again decertified. His conduct rapidly deteriorated and he returned to St Andrew's in November. He stayed there until his death on 10 October 1964. He never married.<ref>[http://www.anthonywynn.com/bosietimeline/ \"Timeline to the Life of Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas\" anthonywynn.com] Retrieved 24 August 2011</ref>

==Writings==
Douglas published several volumes of poetry; two books about his relationship with Wilde, ''Oscar Wilde and Myself'' (1914, largely ghostwritten by [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland|T. W. H. Crosland]], the assistant editor of ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'' and later repudiated by Douglas), ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' (1940) and two memoirs, ''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) and ''Without Apology'' (1938).

Douglas also was the editor of a literary journal, ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', from 1907 to 1910 and during this time he had an affair with artist [[Romaine Brooks]], who was also [[bisexual]] (the main love of her life, [[Natalie Clifford Barney]], also had an affair with Wilde's niece [[Dorothy Wilde|Dorothy]] and even, in 1901, with Douglas's future wife [[Olive Custance]], the year before the couple married).

There are six biographies of Douglas. The earlier ones by Braybrooke and Freeman were not allowed to quote from Douglas's copyright work and ''De Profundis'' was unpublished. Later biographies were by Rupert Croft-Cooke, [[H.

'''Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas''' (22 October 1870{{spaced ndash}}20 March 1945) was a British poet and journalist best known as the lover of [[Oscar Wilde]].

While studying at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], he edited an undergraduate journal, ''The Spirit Lamp'', which carried a [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] subtext, and met Wilde, with whom he started a close but stormy relationship. Douglas’ father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], disapproved strongly of the affair, and set out to humiliate Wilde, publicly accusing him of homosexuality. Wilde sued him for criminal [[libel]], but some of his intimate notes were discovered, and he was duly jailed. On his release, Wilde briefly lived with Douglas in Naples, but they were separated by the time Wilde died in 1900.

Douglas married [[Olive Custance]] in 1902, and they produced a son, Raymond. Converting to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1911, he openly repudiated Wilde’s homosexuality, and in a High-Catholic magazine, ''Plain English'', he expressed views that were openly [[anti-Semitic]], though he rejected the policies of [[Nazi Germany]]. He was also jailed for libeling [[Winston Churchill]] over claims of wartime misconduct.

Douglas wrote several books of verse, some of it classified in the homoerotic [[Uranian poetry|Uranian]] genre. The phrase \"The love that dare not speak its name\" came from one of Douglas’ poems, though it is widely misattributed to Wilde.

==Early life and background==
[[File:JohnSholtoDouglasMarquessofQueensberry.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|The 9th Marquess of Queensberry]]]]
Douglas was born at Ham Hill House in [[Powick]], [[Worcestershire]], the third son of [[The Most Honourable|The Most Hon.]] [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] and his first wife, Sibyl Montgomery.

He was his mother's favourite child; she called him Bosie (a derivative of \"boysie\", as in boy), a nickname which stuck for the rest of his life.<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB|id=32869|title=Douglas, Lord Alfred Bruce (1870–1945)}}</ref> His mother successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his father's adultery.<ref>\"The Queensberry Divorce Case\", ''The Times'', 24 January 1887, p. 4</ref> The [[Marquess]] married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year.

Douglas was educated at [[Wixenford School]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Rupert|last=Croft-Cooke|title=Bosie: The Story of Lord Alfred Douglas, His Friends and Enemies|publisher=[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=1963|isbn=978-1299419407|page=33}}</ref> [[Winchester College]] (1884–88) and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1889–93), which he left without obtaining a degree. At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], he edited an undergraduate journal, ''The Spirit Lamp'' (1892–3), an activity that intensified the constant conflict between him and his father. Their relationship had always been a strained one and, during the Queensberry-Wilde feud, Douglas sided with Wilde, even encouraging Wilde to prosecute the Marquess for libel. In 1893, Douglas had a brief affair with [[George Cecil Ives|George Ives]].

In 1858 his grandfather, [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry]], died in what was reported as a shooting accident, but was widely believed to have been suicide.<ref>Linda Stratmann, The Marquess of Queensberry: Wilde's Nemesis, Yale University Press 2013 p.25</ref><ref>Neil McKenna, The Secret Life Of Oscar Wilde, Random House 2011 p.427</ref> In 1862, his widowed grandmother, Lady Queensberry, converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and took her children to live in [[Paris]].<ref name=schoolnet>[https://spartacus-educational.com/Fdixie.htm Lady Florence Dixie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320041127/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fdixie.htm |date=20 March 2008 }} at Spartacus-Educational.com (accessed 26 February 2019)</ref>One of his uncles, Lord James Douglas, was deeply attached to his twin sister \"Florrie\" ([[Lady Florence Douglas]]) and was heartbroken when she married a baronet, [[Dixie baronets|Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie]].

==Relationship with Wilde==
[[File:Wilde Douglas British Library B20147-85.jpg|thumb|Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas, May 1893]]

In 1891, Douglas's cousin [[Lionel Johnson]] introduced him to Oscar Wilde; although the playwright was married with two sons, they soon began an affair.<ref>H. Montgomery Hyde, ''The Love That Dared not Speak its Name;'' p.144</ref><ref>Ellmann (1988:98)</ref> In 1894, the [[Robert Smythe Hichens|Robert Hichens]] novel ''[[The Green Carnation]]'' was published. Said to be a ''[[roman à clef]]'' based on the relationship of Wilde and Douglas, it was one of the texts used against Wilde during his trials in 1895.

Douglas has been described as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on men and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to funding his tastes. They often argued and broke up, but would also always reconcile.

Douglas had praised Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' in the Oxford magazine, ''The Spirit Lamp'', of which he was editor (and used as a covert means of gaining acceptance for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written ''Salomé'' in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"''On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs''\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered  \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and  claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two men, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] and the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] when they themselves objected to Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to [[Robbie Ross]]: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but, in a gesture of reconciliation, suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title-page. Accepting this, Douglas, somewhat vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title-page as \"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman\".<ref name=\"Ellmann\" />

In 1894, Douglas came and visited Oscar Wilde in Worthing, much to the consternation of the latter's wife Constance.<ref>Antony Edmunds, ''Oscar Wilde's Scandalous Summer;'' p.26 [http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128075207/http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html |date=28 November 2018 }}</ref>

On another occasion, while staying with Wilde in [[Brighton]], Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, but failed to return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] and, on Wilde's 40th birthday, sent him a letter saying that he had charged him the bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for [[blackmail]].<ref name=\"Ellmann\">''Oscar Wilde'' by Richard Ellman, published in 1987</ref>

Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, suspected the liaison to be more than a friendship. He sent his son a letter, attacking him for leaving Oxford without a degree and failing to take up a proper career. He threatened to \"disown [Alfred] and stop all money supplies\". Alfred responded with a telegram stating: \"What a funny little man you are\".

Queensberry's next letter threatened his son with a \"thrashing\" and accused him of being \"crazy\". He also threatened to \"make a public scandal in a way you little dream of\" if he continued his relationship with Wilde.

Queensberry was well known for his temper and threatening to beat people with a horsewhip. Alfred sent his father a postcard stating \"I detest you\" and making it clear that he would take Wilde's side in a fight between him and the Marquess, \"with a loaded revolver\".

In answer Queensberry wrote to Alfred (whom he addressed as \"You miserable creature\") that he had divorced Alfred's mother in order not to \"run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself\" and that, when Alfred was a baby, \"I cried over you the bitterest tears a man ever shed, that I had brought such a creature into the world, and unwittingly committed such a crime&nbsp;... You must be demented\".

When Douglas's eldest brother [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig|Francis Viscount Drumlanrig]] died in a suspicious hunting accident in October 1894, rumours circulated that he had been having a homosexual relationship with the Prime Minister, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], and that the cause of death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son, and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant, and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial.<ref>Ellmann (1988:101)</ref> He and a minder confronted the playwright in his own home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde during the premiere of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', but, forewarned of this, the playwright was able to deny him access to the theatre.

Queensberry then publicly insulted Wilde by leaving, at the latter's club, a [[visiting card]] on which he had written: \"For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite {{sic}}\". The wording is in dispute – the handwriting is unclear – although Hyde reports it as this. According to [[Merlin Holland]], Wilde's grandson, it is more likely \"Posing somdomite\", while Queensberry himself claimed it to be \"Posing as somdomite\". Holland suggests that this wording (\"posing [as] ...\") would have been easier to defend in court.

==The 1895 trials==
{{Main|Oscar Wilde#Trials|l1=Oscar Wilde – Trials}}
In response to this card, and with Douglas's avid support, but against the advice of friends such as [[Robbie Ross]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]], Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal [[libel]] in a [[private prosecution]], as [[sodomy]] was then a criminal offence. According to libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction only by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was factually true, but that there was also some public interest in having made the charge publicly. [[Edward Carson]], Queensberry's lawyer, accordingly portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who habitually preyed upon naive young boys and, with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle, seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced into evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was closely questioned about the homoerotic themes in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and in ''The Chameleon'', a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed his 'Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young'.

[[File:Somdomite.jpg|thumb|The calling card in question, labelled Exhibit A in the trial (bottom left corner)|left]]Queensberry's attorney announced in court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry's considerable legal costs, leaving him [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].

Based on the evidence raised during the case, Wilde was arrested the next day and charged with committing criminal [[sodomy]] and \"[[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]]\", a charge only capable of being committed by two men and which covered sexual acts other than sodomy.

Douglas's September 1892 poem \"[[s:Two Loves (1894 poem)|Two Loves]]\" (published in the Oxford magazine ''The Chameleon'' in December 1894), which was used against Wilde at the latter's trial, ends with the famous line that refers to homosexuality as ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'', a quote often falsely attributed to Wilde. Wilde gave an eloquent but counterproductive explanation of the nature of this love on the witness stand. The trial resulted in a [[hung jury]].

In 1895, when during his trials Wilde was released on bail, Douglas's cousin [[Sholto Johnstone Douglas]] stood [[surety]] for [[pound sterling|£]]500 of the bail money.<ref>Borland, Maureen, ''Wilde's Devoted Friend: A Life of Robert Ross, 1869–1918'' (Lennard Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j2lnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&dq=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&ei=j1R5SfWUMpWyyQS4kNSwBg&pgis=1 p. 206] at books.google.com, accessed 22 January 2009</ref> The prosecutor opted to retry the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years' [[hard labour]], first at [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville]], then [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], then famously in [[HM Prison Reading|Reading Gaol]]. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.

While in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter titled ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', describing exactly what he felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but which may or may not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde's on which Ross consulted. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at [[Rouen]], but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.

==Naples and Paris==
The meeting in Rouen was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together in Naples, but because of financial pressures and for other personal reasons, they separated. Wilde spent the remainder of his life primarily in Paris, and Douglas returned to Britain in late 1898.

The period when the two men lived in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed that Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually did gain funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he did give him occasional handouts. When Wilde died in 1900, he was still bankrupt. Douglas served as chief mourner, although there reportedly was an altercation at the grave between him and Robbie Ross. This struggle developed into a feud<ref>{{cite book|title=World Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvwIAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=E. Hulton}}</ref> which foreshadowed the later litigations between the two former lovers of Wilde.

==Marriage==
[[File:Lady-alfred-douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady Alfred Douglas]]
After Wilde's death, Douglas established a close friendship with [[Olive Custance]], a [[bisexual]] heiress and poet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Sarah|title='A Girl's Love': Lord Alfred Douglas as Homoerotic Muse in the Poetry of Olive Custance|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|location=London, England|date=September 2011|volume=22|issue=2–3|pages=220–240|doi=10.1080/09574042.2011.585045|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/22672}}</ref> They married on 4 March 1902.

The marriage was stormy after Douglas became a [[Roman Catholic]] in 1911. They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Custance also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up Catholicism. The health of their only child further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920s was all but over, although they never divorced.

==Repudiation of Wilde==
In 1911, Douglas embraced Roman Catholicism, as Wilde had done earlier. More than a decade after Wilde's death, with the release of suppressed portions of Wilde's ''De Profundis'' letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by [[Maud Allan]] against [[Noel Pemberton Billing]] in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', of being part of a homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.

Douglas also contributed to Billing's journal ''Vigilante'' as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem referring to [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]] \"bound with Lesbian fillets\" while her husband [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert]], the Prime Minister, gave money to Ross.<ref>Philip Hoare. (1999). ''Oscar Wilde’s Last Stand: Decadence, Conspiracy, and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century''. Arcade Publishing, p.&nbsp;110.</ref> During the trial he described Wilde as \"the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years\". Douglas added that he intensely regretted having met Wilde, and having helped him with the translation of ''Salome'', which he described as \"a most pernicious and abominable piece of work\".

==''Plain English''==

In 1920 Douglas founded a [[Far-right politics|right-wing]], Catholic, and \"deeply anti-Jewish\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Toczek|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2015|isbn=978-1138853485|page=239}}</ref> weekly magazine called ''Plain English'', on which he collaborated with [[Harold Sherwood Spencer]], and to begin with [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland]]. It regarded itself as the successor to ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', to which Douglas had been a contributing editor. ''Plain English'' ran until the end of 1922. Douglas later admitted that its policy was \"strongly anti-Semitic\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p. 302</ref><ref>Brown, William Sorley ''The Life and Genius of T.W.H. Crosland'' (1928) p394</ref>

From August 1920 (issue No 8) ''Plain English'' began publishing a long running series of articles called \"The Jewish Peril\" by [[Arthur Cherep-Spiridovich|Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovitch]] the title of which was taken from the fore-title of [[George Shanks]]' version of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. ''Plain English'' advertised (from issue 20) [[The Britons]]' second edition of Shank's version of the ''Protocols''. Douglas challenged the ''Jewish Guardian'', published by the [[League of British Jews]], to take him to court suggesting they would not as they were \"well aware of the absolute truth of the allegations which we have made\".<ref>The \"Jewish Guardian\" Again, ''Plain English'' No 21, 27 November 1920</ref> The magazine suggested in 1921, \"we need a [[Ku Klux Klan]] in this country\",<ref>Lies, ''Plain English'' No 66, 8 October 1921</ref> but a promotion for ''[[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]'' magazine was generally not well received by readers.

Other regular targets of the magazine included [[David Lloyd George]], [[Lord Northcliffe|Alfred Viscount Northcliffe]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[Sinn Féin]]. In December 1920 the magazine was the first to publish the secret constitution of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].

From 25 December 1920 it began publishing regularly its most notorious series of articles alleging that a \"powerful individual in the Admiralty\" had alerted the Germans at the [[Battle of Jutland]] that the British had broken their code, and that [[Winston Churchill]] had falsified a report in return for a large sum of money from [[Ernest Cassel]] who thereby profited; in May 1921 Douglas would also insinuate that [[Herbert Kitchener|Herbert Earl Kitchener]] had been murdered by the Jews.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Heathorn|title=Haig and Kitchener in Twentieth-Century Britain: Remembrance, Representation and Appropriation|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2016|isbn=978-0754669654|pages=68–72}}</ref>

Douglas ceased to be editor after issue 67 in 1921 after a row with Spencer.<ref>Toczek, p. 34</ref> He then produced a short lived, almost identical, rival magazine called ''Plain Speech'' in 1921 with [[Herbert Moore Pim]]. Its first issue contained a letter from a correspondent in Germany praising \"[[Adolf Hitler|Herr Hittler]]\" (as spelled in original) and \"[[Nazi Party|The German White Labour Party]]\".

Douglas's view of a Jewish plot was nuanced. In 1920 he would, whilst recognizing \"the Jewish Peril\", noted that \"Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race\".<ref>Christian Charity and the Jews, ''Plain English'' No. 4, 31 July 1920, p. 78</ref> In 1921 he would state it was not acceptable to \"shift responsibility\" onto the Jews.<ref>\"The Jews, 'The Britons' and the ''Morning Post''\", ''Plain Speech'' No. 10, 24 December 1921, p. 149</ref> In his ''Autobiography'' in 1929 he wrote, \"I feel now that it is ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish\", and then indicated the country had only itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.<ref>''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) pp. 303–304</ref>

The historian [[Colin Holmes (historian)|Colin Holmes]] indicated that while \"Douglas had been to the forefront of anti-semitism in the early 1920s, he was quite unable to come to terms with the vicious racist anti-semitism in Germany\" under the Nazis.<ref>Holmes, Colin ''Anti-Semitism in British Society, 1876–1939'' Routledge (1979) p. 218</ref> Politically he described himself as \"a strong Conservative of the 'Diehard' variety\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p220</ref>

==Libel actions==
Douglas started his \"litigious and libellous career\" by obtaining an apology and fifty guineas each from the Oxford and Cambridge university magazines ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]'' and ''Cambridge'' for defamatory references to him in an article on Wilde.<ref>(Murray p&nbsp;152)</ref>

Douglas was either plaintiff or defendant in several trials for civil or [[criminal libel]]. In 1913 he was charged with libelling his father-in-law. Also in 1913 he accused [[Arthur Ransome]] of libelling him in his book ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study''. He saw this trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour and Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12530/page/77 The Edinburgh Gazette Publication date:17 January 1913 Issue: 12530, Page 77]</ref> Ransome did remove the offending passages from the second edition of his book.<ref>Ransome, Arthur, ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study'', 2nd edition, Methuen, 1913</ref>

In the most noted case, brought by the Crown on Winston Churchill's behalf in 1923, Douglas was found guilty of libelling Churchill and was sentenced to six months in prison. Churchill had been accused as cabinet minister, of falsifying an official report on the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 when, although suffering losses, the Royal Navy drove the German battle fleet off the high seas. Churchill was said to have reported that the British navy had in fact, been defeated; the motive was supposed to be that when this news was flashed, the prices of British securities would tumble on the world's stock exchanges, allowing a group of named Jewish financiers to snap them up cheaply. Churchill's reward was a houseful of furniture, valued at [[Pound sterling|£]]40,000.

The allegations were made by Douglas in his journal ''Plain English'' and later at a public meeting in London. A false report of a crushing British naval defeat had indeed been planted in the New York press by German interests but by this time (following the failure of his [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]]), Churchill was not connected with the Admiralty. As the attorney general asserted in court, on Churchill's behalf, there was \"no plot, no phoney communiqué, no stock market raid and no present of fine furniture\".<ref>http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727630,00.html accessed 10/2/2017</ref><ref>http://www.jta.org/1923/12/13/archive/churchill-wins-libel-suit-against-douglas accessed 10/2/2017</ref>

In 1924, while in prison, Douglas, in an echo of Wilde's composition of ''De Profundis'' ([[Latin]] for \"From the Depths\") during his incarceration, wrote his last major poetic work, ''In Excelsis'' (In the Highest), which contains 17 [[canto]]s. Since the prison authorities would not allow Douglas to take the manuscript with him when he was released, he had to rewrite the work from memory. Douglas maintained that his health never recovered from his harsh prison ordeal, which included sleeping on a plank bed without a mattress.

==Later life==
Following his incarceration in 1924, Douglas's feelings towards Wilde began to soften. He wrote in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' that \"Sometimes a sin is also a crime (for example, a murder or theft), but this is not the case with homosexuality, any more than with adultery\".<ref>(Murray pp 309–310)</ref> Throughout the 1930s and until his death Douglas maintained correspondence with many people, including [[Marie Stopes]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. [[Anthony Wynn]] wrote the play ''Bernard and Bosie: A Most Unlikely Friendship'' based on the letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas's final public appearances was his well-received lecture to the [[Royal Society of Literature]] on 2 September 1943, entitled ''The Principles of Poetry'', which was published in an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] and the talk was praised by [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[Augustus John]].<ref>(Murray pp 318–319)</ref>

Douglas's only child, Raymond, was diagnosed with [[schizoaffective disorder]] in 1927, at the age of 24 and entered [[St Andrew's Hospital]], a mental institution. He was decertified and discharged after five years but suffered another breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral and in June he was again decertified. His conduct rapidly deteriorated and he returned to St Andrew's in November. He stayed there until his death on 10 October 1964. He never married.<ref>[http://www.anthonywynn.com/bosietimeline/ \"Timeline to the Life of Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas\" anthonywynn.com] Retrieved 24 August 2011</ref>

==Writings==
Douglas published several volumes of poetry; two books about his relationship with Wilde, ''Oscar Wilde and Myself'' (1914, largely ghostwritten by [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland|T. W. H. Crosland]], the assistant editor of ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'' and later repudiated by Douglas), ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' (1940) and two memoirs, ''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) and ''Without Apology'' (1938).

Douglas also was the editor of a literary journal, ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', from 1907 to 1910 and during this time he had an affair with artist [[Romaine Brooks]], who was also [[bisexual]] (the main love of her life, [[Natalie Clifford Barney]], also had an affair with Wilde's niece [[Dorothy Wilde|Dorothy]] and even, in 1901, with Douglas's future wife [[Olive Custance]], the year before the couple married).

There are six biographies of Douglas. The earlier ones by Braybrooke and Freeman were not allowed to quote from Douglas's copyright work and ''De Profundis'' was unpublished. Later biographies were by Rupert Croft-Cooke, [[H. Montgomery Hyde]] (who also wrote about Wilde), [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] (who describes Braybrooke's biography as \"a rehash and exaggeration of Douglas's book\" [his autobiography]). The most recent is ''Alfred Douglas: A Poet's Life and His Finest Work'' by [[Caspar Wintermans]] in 2007.

'''Christopher Roy Sutton''' (born 10 March 1973) is an English former professional [[Association football|football]] player and [[manager (association football)|manager]]. He later became a pundit and commentator for [[BT Sport]], regularly working on their coverage of Scottish football. He is now also a pundit and occasional match co-commentator on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].

He played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1991 to 2007 for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the [[Premier League|English]] and [[Scottish Premier League]]s. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] once by [[England national football team|England]].

Sutton played principally in midfield or attack, although usually in the latter role as a striker. A very physical player, Sutton was a fairly prolific goalscorer throughout his career and was joint top goalscorer (with [[Dion Dublin]] and [[Michael Owen]]) in the [[FA Premier League 1997–98]] season. He was also known as being one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header. He scored many goals with this technique which made him particularly effective from set-pieces.

In September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], but he resigned due to personal reasons twelve months later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/9043871.stm |title=Manager Chris Sutton leaves Lincoln City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2012, he came out of retirement briefly and featured for non-league [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/276490/Former-England-striker-Chris-Sutton-comes-out-of-retirement|title=Former England striker Chris Sutton comes out of retirement|date=11 October 2012|work=Dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}}

==Playing career==

===Norwich City (1991–1994)===
He started his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager [[Dave Stringer]]. He made his debut on 4 May 1991 in a 1–0 home win over [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref name=\"sporting-heroes1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=43920 |title=Chris Sutton - Norwich City FC - Football-Heroes.net |publisher=Sporting-heroes.net |date= |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref>

In Stringer's final season as manager, [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]], Norwich were [[FA Cup]] semi-finalists and Sutton gradually broke into the first team. Sutton made 21 league appearances that season, scoring twice.<ref name=\"sporting-heroes1\"/>

He quickly found success in his new position as Norwich spent most of the first season of the new [[FA Premier League]], [[FA Premier League 1992–93|1992–93]], as league leaders, before eventually slipping back to third place under new manager [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]]. Sutton featured in 38 Premier League games that season, scoring eight goals – making him the club's second highest scorer behind [[Mark Robins]].<ref name=\"sporting-heroes1\"/>

In the autumn of 1993, he was part of the Norwich side which famously eliminated [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]]. He scored 25 Premier League goals that season, but after Walker defected to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in January to be succeeded by assistant [[John Deehan]], Norwich slipped out of the top five and finished a disappointing 12th in the final table.

By now, Sutton was being linked with some of the biggest clubs in the country, including Blackburn Rovers, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-sutton-will-choose-his-destination-today-1413757.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Henry | last=Winter | title=Football: Sutton will choose his destination today | date=14 July 1994}}</ref> and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ElBIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lhMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3963,3803900&dq=chris-sutton&hl=en|title=New Straits Times – Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}</ref>

===Blackburn Rovers (1994–1999)===
Sutton became the most expensive player in English football in July 1994, when he was transferred from Norwich City to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for £5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Eye injury forces Sutton to quit\">{{Cite news

In his first season at Ewood Park he developed a strong partnership (known as 'SAS') with [[Alan Shearer]] (who scored 34 times that season) and scored fifteen Premier League goals to help secure the club's first league title since 1914.<ref name=\"bblt\">{{cite web|title=English football's dying breed of strike partnerships|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20469693|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>

A succession of injuries, combined with a loss of form, saw him make just 13 Premier League appearances during [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]] and fail to score a single league goal. Shearer's regular strike partner that season was [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]], but at the end of the season both Shearer and Newell left the club, leaving Sutton and [[Kevin Gallacher]] as Blackburn's only major strikers.

He regained his form over the next three seasons and was the joint highest goalscorer in the Premier League in 1997–98, scoring 18 times.<ref name=\"sporting-heroes1\"/><ref name=\"gboot\">{{cite web|title=Premiership Golden Boot Awards|url=http://www.goldenboot.me.uk/premiership_golden_boot_awards/|publisher=Golden Boot|accessdate=2 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006093817/http://www.goldenboot.me.uk/premiership_golden_boot_awards/|archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

Sutton was involved in controversy in the final game of the [[FA Premier League 1996–97|1996–97]] season against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Late in the game with the \"Gunners\" leading by a single goal, the ball was kicked out of play by Arsenal to allow an injured teammate to receive treatment. Under the unwritten sportsmanship rule, Arsenal would expect the ball to be returned to them unhindered. However, Sutton chased the ball instead of allowing it to be thrown back to Arsenal and won a corner from his efforts. Blackburn scored from this corner and as a result Arsenal missed out on a lucrative place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on [[goal difference]]. Following the incident Blackburn's interim manager [[Tony Parkes]] described Sutton as \"a boy who was sometimes a bit dizzy ... a bit silly\",<ref>{{Cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629075146/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1997/12/13/phead.htm |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1997/12/13/phead.htm |title=Gunners urged to call truce with Sutton |work=Irish Examiner |date=13 December 1997 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}</ref> stating \"It was against the spirit of the game and he should not have done it\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/S-PLATT+GOES+THE+TITLE!%3B+Angry+Gunners+in+Sutton+%27cheat%27+storm%3A...-a061141639 |title=S-Platt goes the title! |work=Sunday Mirror |format=reprint hosted at The Free Library |date=20 April 1997 |accessdate=7 January 2013 | first=Jack | last=Steggles}}</ref> Sutton refused to apologise for his actions.<ref name=\"Sutton - the facts\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/825710.stm |title=Sutton – the facts |date=9 July 2000 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref>

Although Sutton's 18 goals helped Blackburn finish sixth and qualify for the [[UEFA Cup]] in 1998, he managed just 17 league games and 3 goals the following season as they were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] from the Premier League at the end of [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]], just four years after being crowned champions. His absences were the result of a series of injuries. Most notably, he was absent for the penultimate game of the season on 12 May 1999, which Blackburn had to win to keep their survival hopes alive. They could only manage a goalless draw at home to Manchester United, who went on to win the title four days later.

===Chelsea (1999–2000)===
Sutton was sold to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for £10&nbsp;million after Blackburn's relegation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chelsea seal £10m Sutton deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/386816.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 July 1999 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sutton joins Chelsea for pounds 10m |first=Alan |last=Nixon |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-sutton-joins-chelsea-for-pounds-10m-1104670.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=6 July 1999 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |location=London}}</ref> His time at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] proved an unhappy one, as he struggled both to live up to the price tag and to adapt to Chelsea's style of play, scoring just one league goal in a 5–0 win against Manchester United<ref>{{Cite news

===Celtic (2000–2006)===
After his disappointing season at Chelsea, Sutton quickly regained his goal-scoring form at Celtic. Sutton scored the winner on his league debut in a 2–1 against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in July 2000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Celtic new boys off to winning start |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/858625.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 July 2000 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> Sutton further endeared himself to Celtic fans four weeks later in his first [[Old Firm]] match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] – scoring the first and last goals in a dramatic 6–2 victory for Celtic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/898428.stm |title=Celtic's six of the best |date=27 August 2000 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> Sutton went on to form a prolific partnership with Swede [[Henrik Larsson]].

Sutton's goals helped Celtic win three SPL titles, three [[Scottish Cup]]s and one [[Scottish League Cup]], as well as reaching a [[2003 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final]]. Indeed, many of Sutton's most memorable goals for Celtic were scored in European competition; [[Ajax FC|Ajax]] away in 2001,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/aug/09/newsstory.ajax | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Walker | title=Fighting fans mar Celtic success | date=8 August 2001}}</ref> Juventus at Celtic Park the same year,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1627972.stm | work=BBC News | title=Celtic bow out in style | date=31 October 2001}}</ref> goals away at Blackburn Rovers and [[VfB Stuttgart]] during the UEFA Cup run to the final in Seville in 2003,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/2442877.stm | work=BBC News | title=Celtic win Battle of Britain | date=14 November 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/2798753.stm | work=BBC News | title=Celtic kill off Stuttgart | date=27 February 2003}}</ref> and also a thumping volley from close range against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] at Celtic Park in 2004.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3645872.stm | work=BBC News | title=Celtic 1–3 Barcelona | date=14 September 2004}}</ref> Sutton also holds the record for the quickest goal ever in an Old Firm Clash, scored at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] in 2002, scoring inside just 18 seconds.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/scottish-premier/3039361/Celtic-lose-way-after-Suttons-fastest-strike.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Roddy | last=Forsyth | title=Celtic lose way after Sutton's fastest strike | date=9 December 2002}}</ref>

Sutton's acerbic nature came to the fore again at the end of the [[2002–03 in Scottish football|2002–03]] season when he accused [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] of \"lying down\", in order for Celtic to lose the title.<ref>{{cite news |title=Death threat rekindles row |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/3044266.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=4 July 2003 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> He failed to apologise<ref>{{cite news |title= Chris Sutton: Jimmy Calderwood will NEVER get an apology from me.. only he will know why his Pars team put in such a weak display to hand Rangers the title|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/opinion/sport/chris-sutton-jimmy-calderwood-never-5577790|work=Daily Record|publisher= |date=27 April 2015 |accessdate=27 April 2015 }}</ref> and was charged with bringing the game into disrepute, and received a one-match ban to add to the four-match suspension he was serving for abusing match officials on the same day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/3090101.stm |title=Sutton gets further ban |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 July 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref>

His best season at Celtic was arguably the 2003–04 season, when he scored 19 SPL goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=43922 |title=Chris Sutton - Celtic FC - Football-Heroes.net |publisher=Sporting-heroes.net |date= |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> and was voted [[SPFA Players' Player of the Year|SPFA Player of the Year]].<ref name=\"poy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s2&newsid=7409 |title=Season review 2003/04 |publisher=Scottish Premier League |accessdate=4 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612194444/http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s2&newsid=7409 |archive-date=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Indeed, as 2003–04 drew to a conclusion, a superbly struck injury time winner by Sutton against Rangers at Celtic Park gave his side a clean sweep of victories against their old rivals that season (4 league wins and 1 Scottish Cup win).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3691469.stm|title=Celtic 1–0 Rangers|date=8 May 2004|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

In his five and half years at Celtic, Sutton showed his versatility on many occasions. Although considered primarily a striker, Sutton was often deployed in central midfield to allow Welsh striker [[John Hartson]] – another robust forward – to play up front alongside Larsson. On occasion Sutton was fielded in his original position of centre-half, notably against Rangers in a league game on 4 October 2003. Celtic won 1–0,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3161428.stm|title=Celtic take Old Firm spoils|date=4 October 2003|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> with Sutton turning in an assured performance in defence.

As [[Gordon Strachan]] took up the reins of managing Celtic in 2005–06, Sutton's appearances for Celtic became more sporadic. With doubts about his fitness and rumours of a fractious relationship with Strachan, it was little surprise when Sutton departed from Celtic on a free transfer in January 2006.

===Birmingham City (2006)===
He joined Premier League club [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer in January 2006,<ref>{{cite news |title=Birmingham seal Sutton free deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/birmingham_city/4583102.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> but injuries restricted him to just eleven appearances, scoring once in the [[Birmingham derby|derby]] defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in mid-April.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aston Villa 3–1 Birmingham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4890642.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 April 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> One of a number of players on high wages subjected to criticism by club owner [[David Sullivan (publisher)|David Sullivan]], Sutton was released at the end of the season following Birmingham's relegation to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4890642.stm |title=Aston Villa 3–1 Birmingham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref>

===Aston Villa (2006–2007)===
Sutton signed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in October 2006, until the end of the [[2006–07 Aston Villa F.C. season|2006–07 season]], where he linked up with former Celtic boss [[Martin O'Neill]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Striker Sutton joins Aston Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/5404102.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=3 October 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> Sutton scored his first goal for the club with the winner against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in November 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6116240.stm |title=Everton 0–1 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC |date=11 November 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2009 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}</ref>

However, in a game against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in December 2006, he suffered blurred vision, and despite having visited several specialists, did not recover. O'Neill said, \"Chris has got a genuine concern. No-one can give him any guarantees about what might be the consequences if he got cracked on the head again. Whatever eyesight Chris has now, he would obviously want to keep, so he must bear that in mind when deciding his whole future and career.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/6449487.stm |title=Sutton delays decision on future |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2007 |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> On 5 July 2007, Sutton retired from football due to the eye injury.<ref name=\"Eye injury forces Sutton to quit\"/>

===Wroxham (2012)===
In October 2012, Sutton made a surprise return to football with [[Isthmian League]] Division One North club [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]]. He made his debut for The Yachtsmen on 6 October 2012 against [[Tilbury F.C.|Tilbury]], coming on in the 63rd minute, 10 minutes after his goalkeeper son Oliver had also made his debut for the [[Norfolk]] side.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dockers no match for the Suttons |url=http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&newsmode=FULL&nid=88346 |website=NonLeagueDaily.com |date=7 October 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130032842/http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&newsmode=FULL&nid=88346 |archivedate=30 January 2013}}</ref>

==International career==
Sutton's form for Blackburn won him an [[England national football team|England]] cap on 15 November 1997, when he came on in the 79th minute against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], although he was left out of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] squad after a fall-out with national manager [[Glenn Hoddle]]. Having been relegated to the [[England B national football team|England B team]] Sutton refused to play, and Hoddle never selected Sutton for an England squad again.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lipton|first1=Martin|last2=Curtis|first2=John|title=Sutton snubs Hoddle by refusing his England B call|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-sutton-snubs-hoddle-by-refusing-his-england-b-call-1143198.html|accessdate=10 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=6 February 1998}}</ref>

==Management career==

===Lincoln City===
Sutton was interviewed in January 2009 by [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] for the post of manager, but was unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/7842208.stm |title=Butcher named as Inverness boss |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> On 28 September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], succeeding [[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1961)|Peter Jackson]] who was dismissed earlier in the month.

His first game as manager came at [[Sincil Bank]] against [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] on 3 October 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8273439.stm |title=BBC Sport &#124; Football &#124; League Two &#124; Lincoln City 1–0 Aldershot |publisher=BBC News |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> Lincoln were victorious through a second half [[Sergio Torres (footballer, born 1981)|Sergio Torres]] goal to give Sutton a winning start in management.

Football League survival was confirmed on 24 April 2010 when Sutton guided the Imps to a 1–0 victory over promotion-chasing Bury at [[Sincil Bank]], with two games remaining.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8620856.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lincoln City 1–0 Bury | date=24 April 2010}}</ref> Sutton left his post as Lincoln City manager on 29 September stating it was due to family reasons.

==Media career==
Sutton is one of [[BT Sport]]'s main pundits on their coverage of the [[SPFL]] and the [[Scottish League Cup]], regularly appearing alongside [[Darrell Currie]], [[Stephen Craigan]] and [[Ally McCoist]]. He acts as the main co-commentator, including on all of [[Celtic FC]]'s [[UEFA Champions League]] games, alongside either [[Rob MacLean]] or Rory Hamilton. He also appears on [[BT Sport Score]] most Saturday afternoons alongside [[Mark Pougatch]] and [[Robbie Savage]]. Sutton also works as a pundit for [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and [[BBC Sport]]. In January 2015 he attracted criticism for saying that Celtic's [[2014–15 Scottish League Cup|Scottish League Cup semi-final]] against Rangers would be so one-sided that Celtic could win it blindfolded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31073260|title=Rangers: Chris Sutton defended 'Celtic will win blindfold' remark|date=31 January 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 February 2016}}</ref>

Sutton was born in [[Nottingham]], the son of [[Mike Sutton (footballer)|Mike Sutton]], formerly a footballer with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].<ref name=\"Sutton - the facts\"/> His younger brother [[John Sutton (footballer)|John]] also became a footballer, and has played for a number of clubs in both England and Scotland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/rangers-wary-of-the-sutton-curse-443810.html |title=Rangers wary of the Sutton curse |work=The Independent |first=Phil |last=Gordon |date=8 April 2007 |accessdate=4 February 2009 | location=London}}</ref> As a child he moved from [[East Leake]] in Nottinghamshire to [[Horsford]] in Norfolk where his parents still live.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eBMjAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&lpg=PT23&dq=%22chris+sutton%22+horsford&source=bl&ots=IclfeVYIqZ&sig=q02cRAO32z0_1lIbEwg3ZB590zw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj146iihpDQAhWGB8AKHVgdD8EQ6AEIVTAN#v=onepage&q=%22chris%20sutton%22%20horsford&f=false Paradise And Beyond: My Autobiography – Chris Sutton – Google Books] Retrieved 4 November 2016.</ref>

'''Christopher Roy Sutton''' (born 10 March 1973) is an English former professional [[Association football|football]] player and [[manager (association football)|manager]]. He later became a pundit and commentator for [[BT Sport]], regularly working on their coverage of Scottish football. He in now also a pundit and occasional match co-commentator on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].

He played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1991 to 2007 for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the [[Premier League|English]] and [[Scottish Premier League]]s. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] once by [[England national football team|England]].

Sutton played principally in midfield or attack, although usually in the latter role as a striker. A very physical player, Sutton was a fairly prolific goalscorer throughout his career and was joint top goalscorer (with [[Dion Dublin]] and [[Michael Owen]]) in the [[FA Premier League 1997–98]] season. He was also known as being one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header. He scored many goals with this technique which made him particularly effective from set-pieces.

In September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], but he resigned due to personal reasons twelve months later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/9043871.stm |title=Manager Chris Sutton leaves Lincoln City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2012, he came out of retirement briefly and featured for non-league [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/276490/Former-England-striker-Chris-Sutton-comes-out-of-retirement|title=Former England striker Chris Sutton comes out of retirement|date=11 October 2012|work=Dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}}

==Playing career==

===Norwich City (1991–1994)===
He started his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager [[Dave Stringer]]. He made his debut on 4 May 1991 in a 1–0 home win over [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref name=\"sporting-heroes1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=43920 |title=Chris Sutton - Norwich City FC - Football-Heroes.net |publisher=Sporting-heroes.net |date= |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref>

In Stringer's final season as manager, [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]], Norwich were [[FA Cup]] semi-finalists and Sutton gradually broke into the first team. Sutton made 21 league appearances that season, scoring twice.<ref name=\"sporting-heroes1\"/>

He quickly found success in his new position as Norwich spent most of the first season of the new [[FA Premier League]], [[FA Premier League 1992–93|1992–93]], as league leaders, before eventually slipping back to third place under new manager [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]]. Sutton featured in 38 Premier League games that season, scoring eight goals – making him the club's second highest scorer behind [[Mark Robins]].<ref name=\"sporting-heroes1\"/>

In the autumn of 1993, he was part of the Norwich side which famously eliminated [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]]. He scored 25 Premier League goals that season, but after Walker defected to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in January to be succeeded by assistant [[John Deehan]], Norwich slipped out of the top five and finished a disappointing 12th in the final table.

By now, Sutton was being linked with some of the biggest clubs in the country, including Blackburn Rovers, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-sutton-will-choose-his-destination-today-1413757.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Henry | last=Winter | title=Football: Sutton will choose his destination today | date=14 July 1994}}</ref> and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ElBIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lhMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3963,3803900&dq=chris-sutton&hl=en|title=New Straits Times – Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}</ref>

===Blackburn Rovers (1994–1999)===
Sutton became the most expensive player in English football in July 1994, when he was transferred from Norwich City to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for £5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Eye injury forces Sutton to quit\">{{Cite news
| title = Eye injury forces Sutton to quit

In his first season at Ewood Park he developed a strong partnership (known as 'SAS') with [[Alan Shearer]] (who scored 34 times that season) and scored fifteen Premier League goals to help secure the club's first league title since 1914.<ref name=\"bblt\">{{cite web|title=English football's dying breed of strike partnerships|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20469693|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>

A succession of injuries, combined with a loss of form, saw him make just 13 Premier League appearances during [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]] and fail to score a single league goal. Shearer's regular strike partner that season was [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]], but at the end of the season both Shearer and Newell left the club, leaving Sutton and [[Kevin Gallacher]] as Blackburn's only major strikers.

He regained his form over the next three seasons and was the joint highest goalscorer in the Premier League in 1997–98, scoring 18 times.<ref name=\"sporting-heroes1\"/><ref name=\"gboot\">{{cite web|title=Premiership Golden Boot Awards|url=http://www.goldenboot.me.uk/premiership_golden_boot_awards/|publisher=Golden Boot|accessdate=2 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006093817/http://www.goldenboot.me.uk/premiership_golden_boot_awards/|archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

Sutton was involved in controversy in the final game of the [[FA Premier League 1996–97|1996–97]] season against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Late in the game with the \"Gunners\" leading by a single goal, the ball was kicked out of play by Arsenal to allow an injured teammate to receive treatment. Under the unwritten sportsmanship rule, Arsenal would expect the ball to be returned to them unhindered. However, Sutton chased the ball instead of allowing it to be thrown back to Arsenal and won a corner from his efforts. Blackburn scored from this corner and as a result Arsenal missed out on a lucrative place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on [[goal difference]]. Following the incident Blackburn's interim manager [[Tony Parkes]] described Sutton as \"a boy who was sometimes a bit dizzy ... a bit silly\",<ref>{{Cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629075146/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1997/12/13/phead.htm |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1997/12/13/phead.htm |title=Gunners urged to call truce with Sutton |work=Irish Examiner |date=13 December 1997 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}</ref> stating \"It was against the spirit of the game and he should not have done it\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/S-PLATT+GOES+THE+TITLE!%3B+Angry+Gunners+in+Sutton+%27cheat%27+storm%3A...-a061141639 |title=S-Platt goes the title! |work=Sunday Mirror |format=reprint hosted at The Free Library |date=20 April 1997 |accessdate=7 January 2013 | first=Jack | last=Steggles}}</ref> Sutton refused to apologise for his actions.<ref name=\"Sutton - the facts\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/825710.stm |title=Sutton – the facts |date=9 July 2000 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref>

Although Sutton's 18 goals helped Blackburn finish sixth and qualify for the [[UEFA Cup]] in 1998, he managed just 17 league games and 3 goals the following season as they were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] from the Premier League at the end of [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]], just four years after being crowned champions. His absences were the result of a series of injuries. Most notably, he was absent for the penultimate game of the season on 12 May 1999, which Blackburn had to win to keep their survival hopes alive. They could only manage a goalless draw at home to Manchester United, who went on to win the title four days later.

===Chelsea (1999–2000)===
Sutton was sold to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for £10&nbsp;million after Blackburn's relegation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chelsea seal £10m Sutton deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/386816.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 July 1999 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sutton joins Chelsea for pounds 10m |first=Alan |last=Nixon |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-sutton-joins-chelsea-for-pounds-10m-1104670.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=6 July 1999 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |location=London}}</ref> His time at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] proved an unhappy one, as he struggled both to live up to the price tag and to adapt to Chelsea's style of play, scoring just one league goal in a 5–0 win against Manchester United<ref>{{Cite news

===Celtic (2000–2006)===
After his disappointing season at Chelsea, Sutton quickly regained his goal-scoring form at Celtic.

Sutton's goals helped Celtic win three SPL titles, three [[Scottish Cup]]s and one [[Scottish League Cup]], as well as reaching a [[2003 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final]]. Indeed, many of Sutton's most memorable goals for Celtic were scored in European competition; [[Ajax FC|Ajax]] away in 2001,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/aug/09/newsstory.ajax | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Walker | title=Fighting fans mar Celtic success | date=8 August 2001}}</ref> Juventus at Celtic Park the same year,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1627972.stm | work=BBC News | title=Celtic bow out in style | date=31 October 2001}}</ref> goals away at Blackburn Rovers and [[VfB Stuttgart]] during the UEFA Cup run to the final in Seville in 2003,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/2442877.stm | work=BBC News | title=Celtic win Battle of Britain | date=14 November 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/2798753.stm | work=BBC News | title=Celtic kill off Stuttgart | date=27 February 2003}}</ref> and also a thumping volley from close range against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] at Celtic Park in 2004.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3645872.stm | work=BBC News | title=Celtic 1–3 Barcelona | date=14 September 2004}}</ref> Sutton also holds the record for the quickest goal ever in an Old Firm Clash, scored at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] in 2002, scoring inside just 18 seconds.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/scottish-premier/3039361/Celtic-lose-way-after-Suttons-fastest-strike.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Roddy | last=Forsyth | title=Celtic lose way after Sutton's fastest strike | date=9 December 2002}}</ref>

Sutton's acerbic nature came to the fore again at the end of the [[2002–03 in Scottish football|2002–03]] season when he accused [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] of \"lying down\", in order for Celtic to lose the title.<ref>{{cite news |title=Death threat rekindles row |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/3044266.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=4 July 2003 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> He failed to apologise<ref>{{cite news |title= Chris Sutton: Jimmy Calderwood will NEVER get an apology from me.. only he will know why his Pars team put in such a weak display to hand Rangers the title|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/opinion/sport/chris-sutton-jimmy-calderwood-never-5577790|work=Daily Record|publisher= |date=27 April 2015 |accessdate=27 April 2015 }}</ref> and was charged with bringing the game into disrepute, and received a one-match ban to add to the four-match suspension he was serving for abusing match officials on the same day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/3090101.stm |title=Sutton gets further ban |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 July 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref>

His best season at Celtic was arguably the 2003–04 season, when he scored 19 SPL goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=43922 |title=Chris Sutton - Celtic FC - Football-Heroes.net |publisher=Sporting-heroes.net |date= |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> and was voted [[SPFA Players' Player of the Year|SPFA Player of the Year]].<ref name=\"poy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s2&newsid=7409 |title=Season review 2003/04 |publisher=Scottish Premier League |accessdate=4 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612194444/http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s2&newsid=7409 |archive-date=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Indeed, as 2003–04 drew to a conclusion, a superbly struck injury time winner by Sutton against Rangers at Celtic Park gave his side a clean sweep of victories against their old rivals that season (4 league wins and 1 Scottish Cup win).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3691469.stm|title=Celtic 1–0 Rangers|date=8 May 2004|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

In his five and half years at Celtic, Sutton showed his versatility on many occasions. Although considered primarily a striker, Sutton was often deployed in central midfield to allow Welsh striker [[John Hartson]] – another robust forward – to play up front alongside Larsson. On occasion Sutton was fielded in his original position of centre-half, notably against Rangers in a league game on 4 October 2003. Celtic won 1–0,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3161428.stm|title=Celtic take Old Firm spoils|date=4 October 2003|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> with Sutton turning in an assured performance in defence.

As [[Gordon Strachan]] took up the reins of managing Celtic in 2005–06, Sutton's appearances for Celtic became more sporadic. With doubts about his fitness and rumours of a fractious relationship with Strachan, it was little surprise when Sutton departed from Celtic on a free transfer in January 2006.

===Birmingham City (2006)===
He joined Premier League club [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer in January 2006,<ref>{{cite news |title=Birmingham seal Sutton free deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/birmingham_city/4583102.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> but injuries restricted him to just eleven appearances, scoring once in the [[Birmingham derby|derby]] defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in mid-April.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aston Villa 3–1 Birmingham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4890642.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 April 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> One of a number of players on high wages subjected to criticism by club owner [[David Sullivan (publisher)|David Sullivan]], Sutton was released at the end of the season following Birmingham's relegation to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4890642.stm |title=Aston Villa 3–1 Birmingham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref>

===Aston Villa (2006–2007)===
Sutton signed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in October 2006, until the end of the [[2006–07 Aston Villa F.C. season|2006–07 season]], where he linked up with former Celtic boss [[Martin O'Neill]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Striker Sutton joins Aston Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/5404102.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=3 October 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref> Sutton scored his first goal for the club with the winner against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in November 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6116240.stm |title=Everton 0–1 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC |date=11 November 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2009 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}</ref>

However, in a game against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in December 2006, he suffered blurred vision, and despite having visited several specialists, did not recover. O'Neill said, \"Chris has got a genuine concern. No-one can give him any guarantees about what might be the consequences if he got cracked on the head again. Whatever eyesight Chris has now, he would obviously want to keep, so he must bear that in mind when deciding his whole future and career.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/6449487.stm |title=Sutton delays decision on future |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2007 |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> On 5 July 2007, Sutton retired from football due to the eye injury.<ref name=\"Eye injury forces Sutton to quit\"/>

===Wroxham (2012)===
In October 2012, Sutton made a surprise return to football with [[Isthmian League]] Division One North club [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]]. He made his debut for The Yachtsmen on 6 October 2012 against [[Tilbury F.C.|Tilbury]], coming on in the 63rd minute, 10 minutes after his goalkeeper son Oliver had also made his debut for the [[Norfolk]] side.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dockers no match for the Suttons |url=http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&newsmode=FULL&nid=88346 |website=NonLeagueDaily.com |date=7 October 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130032842/http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&newsmode=FULL&nid=88346 |archivedate=30 January 2013}}</ref>

==International career==
Sutton's form for Blackburn won him an [[England national football team|England]] cap on 15 November 1997, when he came on in the 79th minute against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], although he was left out of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] squad after a fall-out with national manager [[Glenn Hoddle]]. Having been relegated to the [[England B national football team|England B team]] Sutton refused to play, and Hoddle never selected Sutton for an England squad again.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lipton|first1=Martin|last2=Curtis|first2=John|title=Sutton snubs Hoddle by refusing his England B call|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-sutton-snubs-hoddle-by-refusing-his-england-b-call-1143198.html|accessdate=10 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=6 February 1998}}</ref>

==Management career==

===Lincoln City===
Sutton was interviewed in January 2009 by [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] for the post of manager, but was unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/7842208.stm |title=Butcher named as Inverness boss |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> On 28 September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], succeeding [[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1961)|Peter Jackson]] who was dismissed earlier in the month.

[[Caretaker manager]] [[Simon Clark (English footballer)|Simon Clark]] would take charge of the following day's game, with Sutton and assistant [[Ian Pearce]] to take over the day after.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/8278445.stm |title=Lincoln appoint Sutton as manager |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redimps.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10440~1810603,00.html |title=Chris Sutton Appointed New Manager |publisher=Lincoln City FC |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=28 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001173855/http://www.redimps.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10440~1810603%2C00.html |archivedate=1 October 2009}}</ref>

His first game as manager came at [[Sincil Bank]] against [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] on 3 October 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8273439.stm |title=BBC Sport &#124; Football &#124; League Two &#124; Lincoln City 1–0 Aldershot |publisher=BBC News |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> Lincoln were victorious through a second half [[Sergio Torres (footballer, born 1981)|Sergio Torres]] goal to give Sutton a winning start in management. Sutton took Lincoln to the [[FA Cup]] third round for the first time since 1999, but lost 4–0 to [[Premier League]] outfit [[Bolton Wanderers]].

Football League survival was confirmed on 24 April 2010 when Sutton guided the Imps to a 1–0 victory over promotion-chasing Bury at [[Sincil Bank]], with two games remaining.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8620856.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lincoln City 1–0 Bury | date=24 April 2010}}</ref> Sutton left his post as Lincoln City manager on 29 September stating it was due to family reasons.

==Media career==
Sutton is one of [[BT Sport]]'s main pundits on their coverage of the [[SPFL]] and the [[Scottish League Cup]], regularly appearing alongside [[Darrell Currie]], [[Stephen Craigan]] and [[Ally McCoist]]. He acts as the main co-commentator, including on all of [[Celtic FC]]'s [[UEFA Champions League]] games, alongside either [[Rob MacLean]] or Rory Hamilton. He also appears on [[BT Sport Score]] most Saturday afternoons alongside [[Mark Pougatch]] and [[Robbie Savage]]. Sutton also works as a pundit for [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and [[BBC Sport]]. In January 2015 he attracted criticism for saying that Celtic's [[2014–15 Scottish League Cup|Scottish League Cup semi-final]] against Rangers would be so one-sided that Celtic could win it blindfolded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31073260|title=Rangers: Chris Sutton defended 'Celtic will win blindfold' remark|date=31 January 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 February 2016}}</ref>

Sutton was born in [[Nottingham]], the son of [[Mike Sutton (footballer)|Mike Sutton]], formerly a footballer with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].<ref name=\"Sutton - the facts\"/> His younger brother [[John Sutton (footballer)|John]] also became a footballer, and has played for a number of clubs in both England and Scotland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/rangers-wary-of-the-sutton-curse-443810.html |title=Rangers wary of the Sutton curse |work=The Independent |first=Phil |last=Gordon |date=8 April 2007 |accessdate=4 February 2009 | location=London}}</ref> As a child he moved from [[East Leake]] in Nottinghamshire to [[Horsford]] in Norfolk where his parents still live.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eBMjAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&lpg=PT23&dq=%22chris+sutton%22+horsford&source=bl&ots=IclfeVYIqZ&sig=q02cRAO32z0_1lIbEwg3ZB590zw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj146iihpDQAhWGB8AKHVgdD8EQ6AEIVTAN#v=onepage&q=%22chris%20sutton%22%20horsford&f=false Paradise And Beyond: My Autobiography – Chris Sutton – Google Books] Retrieved 4 November 2016.</ref>

===Lithology===
[[File:Hellberg-Tongrube-Hängebrücke.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Brigde over the Schwinzer Hellberg clay pit.]]
The lithology of the Pits consists mostly on  Gray-yellow and red-brown [[Clay]] [[Marl]] follow over [[Pyrite]] and [[Gypsum]]-bearing clay stones of the upper part of the formation strata, that have abundant \"[[Marl]]\" concretions, called \"Amaltheentone\". The strata is filled with mostly marine fauna, [[Belemnites (genus)|Belemnites]], [[Bivalve]]s, [[Gastropod]]s, whose hard parts become lithified and part of the deposited grains. There is Silty to fine [[Sand]] and weakly carbonatic, [[Mica]]-bearing [[Posidonia Shale]] facies at the southernmost point.<ref name=\"Ernst\"/> Along that, there is abundance of  layered blue-gray, lime-free [[Clay]]s of the \"Green Series\" with lime concretions that contain a rich fauna, such as [[Ammonite]]s, Bivalves, Insects<ref>Ansorge, J., & Schlüter, T.

===History===
[[File:SZRozycki1966.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Professor Stefan Zbigniew Różycki in Hungary, 1966. Różycki named the Ciechocinek formation in 1958.]]
Several works were done in the 1920s on the Jurassic sediments of Poland, where the main stages, specially Lias and Dogger where stablished. At the same time, facies along the Town of [[Ciechocinek]] where classified as possible Lias-Dogger transition, without anything more clear after this.<ref>LEWIÑSKI J. 1928 – Jura i kajper w g³êbokim wierceniu w Czêstochowie.

It wasn't until 1958, when the eminent Geologist [[Stefan Zbigniew Różycki]] proposed the name Ciechocinek Series, that was left temporally as an informal unit.<ref name=RÓZYCKI></ref> Różycki was the first to study in depth the strata recovering the formation, that he called \"Seria Ciechocińska\" (Ciechocinek Series), and report a structure based on Clay rocks, represented  by mudstones, claystones, and shales with the found of clays with quite a high kaolin content. It also do the first comparation with the slightly younger Seria borucicka (Borurice Beds), and stimate that the rocks where approximately of Late liassic in age, with the possibility of find Dogger Sediments on the Uppermost parts.<ref name=RÓZYCKI></ref> Also suggest that where analogue to the Ostrowiec series of Świętokrzyskie Mountains.<ref name=RÓZYCKI></ref> Later works use the name Ciechocinek Series, doing studies about sedimentology on the layers already Drilled, or founding new Boreholes with similar composition of [[Kaolinite]] and related materials.<ref>Znosko, J.

[[File:Kamieniołom Wapienno 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, where strata of the Formation emerges. Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]
The Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization 
of Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Czêstochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>

Deposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P. (2011). Sedimentation of Lower Toarcian (Lower Jurassic) brackish deposits from the Częstochowa-Wieluń region (SW Poland). Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers 
is observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation. The sea left seashore lakes, lagoons, deltas, Mangrooves, with the emergence of the land confirmed by the occurrence of plant roots and [[Desiccation Cracks]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/>

==Paleoenvironment==
[[File:Ciechocinek Formation Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|450px|left|Environment reconstruction of the Polish realm, based on several footprints, fragmentary specimens and fossil plants reported]]

The presence of green facies in modern Polish Realm is related to an ancient ironstone paleoenvironment, with shallow marine facies that show a decreasing presence of iron.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The occurrence of this type of deposit in modern strata is related to intertropical regions on the vicinity of river mouths. Those relation made attribute the strata to a deposition on a warm and really humid climate, with  brackish-marine environments  consisting of [[lagoon]]s, [[embayment]]s, [[estuaries]], [[mangrove]]s, low-energy deltas and near sandwave fields or barrier islands, similar to modern [[Caribe Sea]] islands and seashore environments.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The Ciechocinek Formation on the Polish Basin mainly represents a large and shallow brackish embayment, with a lower part  deposited in a restricted offshore environment,  with lagoonal, deltaic and other seashore deposits, that translate to a deeper, nearly fully-marine environment in the Pomeranian region.<ref name=BRAŃSKI>BRAŃSKI, P.

Organic matter is of [[Type III Kerogen]], with fragments of microscopic plants and several traces of organic matter.

(2016). Fungal decomposition of terrestrial organic matter accelerated Early Jurassic climate warming. Scientific reports, 6(1), 1-11.</ref> Beyond that, by the use of clay mineral data was possible to stablish how the changes on the early Toarcian affected the [[Polish Basin]]: the increasing warming temperatures where measures by changes on the Kaolinite deposition on the polish margin of the Formation, where is exposed that the subtropical climate of the region was affected by runoffs from the Tethyan realms, with the super-greenhouse/[[Anoxic event]] event linked to methane expulsion. There was a decline in rainfalls towards the [[Tenuicostatum]]-[[Falciferum]] boundary, exposing a transition to less humid conditions, noted by the decreasing amount of Kaolinite.<ref name=BRAŃSKI/>

[[File:SZRozycki1966.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Professor Stefan Zbigniew Różycki in Hungary, 1966. Różycki named the Ciechocinek formation in 1958.]]
Several works were done in the 1920s on the Jurassic sediments of Poland, where the main stages, specially Lias and Dogger where stablished. At the same time, facies along the Town of [[Ciechocinek]] where classified as possible Lias-Dogger transition, without anything more clear after this.<ref>LEWIÑSKI J. 1928 – Jura i kajper w g³êbokim wierceniu w Czêstochowie.

===Lithology===
[[File:Kamieniołom Wapienno 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, where strata of the Formation emerges. Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]
The Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization 
of Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Czêstochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> 

===Stratigraphy===
[[File:Wapienno - kamieniołomy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]
Deposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P. (2011). Sedimentation of Lower Toarcian (Lower Jurassic) brackish deposits from the Częstochowa-Wieluń region (SW Poland). Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers 
is observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation. The sea left seashore lakes, lagoons, deltas, Mangrooves, with the emergence of the land confirmed by the occurrence of plant roots and [[Desiccation Cracks]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/>

==Paleoenvironment==
[[File:Ciechocinek Formation Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|450px|left|Environment reconstruction of the Polish realm, based on several footprints, fragmentary specimens and fossil plants reported]]

The presence of green facies in modern Polish Realm is related to an ancient ironstone paleoenvironment, with shallow marine facies that show a decreasing presence of iron.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The occurrence of this type of deposit in modern strata is related to intertropical regions on the vicinity of river mouths. Those relation made attribute the strata to a deposition on a warm and really humid climate, with  brackish-marine environments  consisting of [[lagoon]]s, [[embayment]]s, [[estuaries]], [[mangrove]]s, low-energy deltas and near sandwave fields or barrier islands, similar to modern [[Caribe Sea]] islands and seashore environments.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The Ciechocinek Formation on the Polish Basin mainly represents a large and shallow brackish embayment, with a lower part  deposited in a restricted offshore environment,  with lagoonal, deltaic and other seashore deposits, that translate to a deeper, nearly fully-marine environment in the Pomeranian region.<ref name=BRAŃSKI>BRAŃSKI, P.

Volumina Jurassica, 10(10), 1-24.</ref>  The Presence of abundant clay on the marine deposits suggest a great flux of terrestrial facies.<ref name=BRAŃSKI/> The high presence of Kaolinite on the strata of th formation suggest a biochemical weathering in Tropical or Humid-subtropical climate with perennial rainfall, as modern Kaolinite deposits are typically present Humid Jungle settings.<ref name=BRAŃSKI/> that develop as a result of intense The humidity of the environments was proved by the presence of several fossils and minerals on the strata outside the measurements of the iron precipitation. Organic matter is of [[Type III Kerogen]], with fragments of microscopic plants and several traces of organic matter. Fungal material is present, where is shown how an increase on the number of specimens can be linked to the climate change on the lower Toarcian.<ref>Pieńkowski, G., Hodbod, M., & Ullmann, C. V. (2016). Fungal decomposition of terrestrial organic matter accelerated Early Jurassic climate warming. Scientific reports, 6(1), 1-11.</ref> Beyond that, by the use of clay mineral data was possible to stablish how the changes on the early Toarcian affected the [[Polish Basin]]: the increasing warming temperatures where measures by changes on the Kaolinite deposition on the polish margin of the Formation, where is exposed that the subtropical climate of the region was affected by runoffs from the Tethyan realms, with the super-greenhouse/[[Anoxic event]] event linked to methane expulsion. There was a decline in rainfalls towards the [[Tenuicostatum]]-[[Falciferum]] boundary, exposing a transition to less humid conditions, noted by the decreasing amount of Kaolinite.<ref name=BRAŃSKI/>

==Early Chinese immigration to the United States==
{{main|Yellow Peril}}
Starting with the [[California Gold Rush]] in the middle 19th century, the United States—particularly the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] states—enlisted large numbers of Chinese migrant laborers. Early Chinese immigrant worked as gold miners, and later on subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The decline of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China, instability and poverty caused many Chinese, especially from the province of [[Guangdong]], to emigrate overseas in search of a more stable life, and this coincided with the rapid growth of American industry. The Chinese were considered by employers as \"reliable\" workers who would continue working, without complaint, even under destitute conditions.<ref>{{cite book| last=Norton|first=Henry K.|title=The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present|publisher=A.C. McClurg & Co.|year= 1924|location=Chicago|pages=283–296|url=http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist6/chinhate.html}}</ref>

Chinese migrant workers encountered considerable prejudice in the United States, especially by the people who occupied the lower layers in white society, and Chinese \"[[coolies]]\" were used as a scapegoat for depressed wage levels by politicians and labor leaders.<ref>See, e.g., http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5046/%7C</ref> Cases of physical assaults on Chinese include the [[Chinese massacre of 1871]] in [[Los Angeles]] and more recently the [[murder of Vincent Chin]] in [[Detroit]]. The 1909 murder of [[Elsie Sigel]] in New York, of which a Chinese person was suspected, was blamed on the Chinese in general and led to physical violence. \"The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to \"innocent\" and \"virtuous\" young white women.

During this period, the phrase \"yellow peril\" was popularized in the U.S. by [[newspapers]] owned by [[William Randolph Hearst]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746032,00.html | work=Time | title=Foreign News: Again, Yellow Peril | date=September 11, 1933}}</ref>  It was also the title of a popular book by an influential U.S. religious figure, [[G.

In the 1870s and 1880s various legal discriminatory measures were taken against the Chinese. The 1879 Constitution of the [[State of California]] prohibited employment of Chinese people by state and local governments, and by businesses incorporated in California. Also, it delegated power to local governments of California to remove Chinese people from within their borders.<ref>Article XIX of the [https://archives.cdn.sos.ca.gov/collections/1879/archive/1879-constitution.pdf Constitution of the State of California of 1879]</ref><ref>[[James Whitman]], \"Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law\" (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), p. 35</ref> These laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China.<ref name=\"yeefow\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink= |title=An Evidentiary Timeline on the History of Sacramento's Chinatown: 1882 - American Sinophobia, The Chinese Exclusion Act and \"The Driving Out\"|publisher=Friends of the Yee Fow Museum, [[Sacramento, California]]|date=|url=http://www.yeefow.com/past/1882.html |doi=|accessdate=2008-03-24 }}</ref> The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was repealed by the [[Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943]].

Another key piece of legislation was the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]], which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization on the grounds that they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed [[alien land laws]] that prohibited non-citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an \"unassimilable\" race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), then-[[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] wrote of the Chinese as: \"a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Chin|first=Gabriel J.|title=Harlan, Chinese and Chinese Americans|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/immigr10.htm|publisher=University of Dayton Law School}}</ref>

In the USA xenophobic fears against the alleged \"Yellow Peril\" led to the implementation of the [[Page Act of 1875]], the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]], expanded ten years later by the [[Geary Act]]. The [[Immigration Act of 1917]] then created an \"Asian Barred Zone\" under [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] influence.

The Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the most significant restrictions on free immigration in U.S. history. The Act excluded Chinese \"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining\" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. Many Chinese were relentlessly beaten just because of their race.<ref name=\"mem\">{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/immig/chinese6.html|title=Exclusion|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=September 1, 2003|accessdate=2010-01-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090810043800/http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/immig/chinese6.html| archivedate=August 10, 2009| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"usn\">[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm usnews.com: The People's Vote: Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328223654/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm |date=March 28, 2007 }}</ref> The few Chinese non-laborers who wished to immigrate had to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to immigrate, which tended to be difficult to prove.<ref name=\"usn\"/>

The 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]], and then the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], restricted immigration according to national origins. While the Emergency Quota Act used the [[census of the United States|census]] of 1910, xenophobic fears in the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] community lead to the adoption of the 1890 census, more favorable to [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] (WASP) population, for the uses of the Immigration Act of 1924, which responded to rising immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia.

One of the goal of this [[National Origins Formula]], established in 1929, was explicitly to keep the status quo distribution of [[ethnicity]], by allocating quotas in proportion to the actual population. The idea was that immigration would not be allowed to change the \"national character\". Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Asians were excluded but residents of nations in the Americas were not restricted, thus making official the racial discrimination in [[List of United States immigration legislation|immigration laws]]. This system was repealed with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].

===Chinese labor and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882===
{{main|Chinese Exclusion Act}}
According to statistics, between 1820 and 1840, only 11 Chinese people emigrated to the United States. However, many Chinese were living in distress due to the end of the Qing Dynasty. The United States offered a more stable life, thanks to the gold rush in California, the construction of railways, and the resulting large demand for labor. Beginning in 1848, many Chinese chose to immigrate to the US.

In order to recruit more laborers, the United States and China signed the [[Burlingame Treaty]] in 1868.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/187656110X523717 |first=John |last=Schrecker |title=\"For the Equality of Men - For the Equality of Nations\": Anson Burlingame and China's First Embassy to the United States, 1868. |journal=Journal of American-East Asian Relations |date=March 2010 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=9–34 |issn=1058-3947}}&nbsp;[https://burlingame.wikispaces.com/file/view/Burlingame+JAEAR.pdf Alternate URL]</ref> The Burlingame Treaty provided several rights, including that Chinese people can freely enter and leave the United States; the right of abode in the United States; and the United States most-favored treatment of Chinese nationals in the United States. The Treaty stimulated immigration for the 20 years between 1853 and 1873, and resulted in the immigration of nearly 105,000 Chinese to the United States by 1880.<ref name=Chin-2013 />

1882 was an election year in California. In order to secure more votes, California politicians adopted a staunch anti-China stance. In Congress, California Republican Senator [[John Franklin Miller (senator)|John Miller]] spoke at length in support of a bill to prohibit further Chinese immigrants, substantially the same as one from the prior session of Congress that had been vetoed by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. Senator Miller submitted a motion to ban the immigration Chinese laborers for 20 years, citing the passage of the 1879 anti-Chinese referendums in California and Nevada by huge margins as proof of popular support.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18820301.2.42 |title=Senator Miller's Great Anti-Chinese Speech |author= |date=March 1, 1882 |newspaper=Daily Alta California |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The motion was discussed in the Senate over the next eight days. All the Senators from western states and most of the southern Democratic Party supported Miller's proposal, strenuously objected to the eastern states senator. After intense debate, the motion eventually passed the Senate by a vote of 29 of 15; it would go on to pass in the House of Representatives on March 23, by 167 votes to 66 votes (55 abstentions).<ref name=Chin-2013 />

President [[Chester A. Arthur]] vetoed the bill on April 4, 1882, as it violated the provisions of the [[Angell Treaty]], which restricted but did not ban immigration from China. Congress was unable to overturn the veto, and passed a version of the bill that banned immigration for ten years in lieu of the original twenty-year ban. On May 6, 1882, Miller's proposal was signed by President Arthur, and became the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]].<ref name=Chin-2013>{{cite journal |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/85234407/chinese-exclusion-act-1882 |author=Chin, Philip |title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 |journal=Chinese American Forum |date=January 2013 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=8–13}}&nbsp;Direct URLs: [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%201.pdf Part 1] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%202.pdf Part 2] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%203.pdf Part 3]</ref>

==Cold War==
{{main|Red Scare}}
Anti-Chinese sentiment during the Cold War was largely the result of the Red Scare and [[McCarthyism]], which coincided with increased popular fear of communist [[espionage]] because of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and China's involvement in the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Schr\">{{cite book| last = Schrecker| first = Ellen| year = 1998| title = Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America| publisher = Little, Brown| isbn = 0-316-77470-7| page = xiii| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/manyarecrimesmcc00schr}}</ref> During the era, suspected Communists were imprisoned in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs.<ref name=\"Schr\"/> Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees, had a real past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party.

===Deportation of Qian Xuesen===
The most notable example is that of the top Chinese scientist [[Qian Xuesen]]. Allegations were made that he was a communist, and his security clearance was revoked in June 1950.<ref name=\"caltech1\">{{cite web|url=http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id%3D39604|title=Tsien Hsue-Shen Dies|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=October 2, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928124208/http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=39604|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] located an [[American Communist Party]] document from 1938 with his name on it, and used it as justification for the revocation. Without his clearance, Qian found himself unable to pursue his career, and within two weeks, he announced plans to return to [[mainland China]], which had come under the government of Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]]. The [[Undersecretary of the Navy]] at the time, [[Dan A. Kimball]], tried to keep Qian in the US: 
<blockquote>It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go.<ref name=\"autogenerated57\">Perrett, B. (January 7, 2008), Sea Change, Aviation Week and Space Technology, Vol. 168, No. 1, p.57-61.</ref></blockquote>

Qian would spend the next five years under house arrest, which included constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any research (classified) duties.<ref name=\"caltech1\"/> Caltech appointed attorney [[Grant Cooper (attorney)|Grant Cooper]] to defend Qian. In 1955, the United States deported him to China in exchange for five American pilots captured during the [[Korean War]]. Later, he became the father of the modern [[Chinese space program]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-02-06/us-trained-scientist-was-deported-then-became-father-chinese-rocketry |title=Meet the US-trained scientist who was deported to China, and became a national hero |work=Pri.org |date=February 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/asia/04qian.html |title=Qian Xuesen, Father of China's Space Program, Dies at 98 |work=The New York Times |date=November 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-me-qian-xuesen1-2009nov01-story.html | title=Qian Xuesen dies at 98; rocket scientist helped establish Jet Propulsion Laboratory| date=September 17, 2014}}</ref>

==21st century==
Modern anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States may originate from American fears of China's role as a rising power. Perceptions of China's rise have been so widespread that 'rise of China' has been named the top news story of the 21st century by the [[Global Language Monitor]], as measured by number of appearances in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet and blogosphere, and in Social Media.<ref>{{cite web|language=zh|url=http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/xkb/html/2011-05/07/content_1105830.htm|title=21世纪新闻排行中国崛起居首位|access-date=2011-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927095901/http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/xkb/html/2011-05/07/content_1105830.htm|archive-date=2011-09-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Early Chinese immigration to the United States==
{{main|Yellow Peril}}
Starting with the [[California Gold Rush]] in the middle 19th century, the United States—particularly the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] states—enlisted large numbers of Chinese migrant laborers. Early Chinese immigrant worked as gold miners, and later on subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The decline of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China, instability and poverty caused many Chinese, especially from the province of [[Guangdong]], to emigrate overseas in search of a more stable life, and this coincided with the rapid growth of American industry. The Chinese were considered by employers as \"reliable\" workers who would continue working, without complaint, even under destitute conditions.<ref>{{cite book| last=Norton|first=Henry K.|title=The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present|publisher=A.C.

Chinese migrant workers encountered considerable prejudice in the United States, especially by the people who occupied the lower layers in white society, and Chinese \"[[coolies]]\" were used as a scapegoat for depressed wage levels by politicians and labor leaders.<ref>See, e.g., http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5046/%7C</ref> Cases of physical assaults on Chinese include the [[Chinese massacre of 1871]] in [[Los Angeles]] and more recently the [[murder of Vincent Chin]] in [[Detroit]]. The 1909 murder of [[Elsie Sigel]] in New York, of which a Chinese person was suspected, was blamed on the Chinese in general and led to physical violence. \"The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to \"innocent\" and \"virtuous\" young white women.

In the 1870s and 1880s various legal discriminatory measures were taken against the Chinese. The 1879 Constitution of the [[State of California]] prohibited employment of Chinese people by state and local governments, and by businesses incorporated in California. Also, it delegated power to local governments of California to remove Chinese people from within their borders.<ref>Article XIX of the [https://archives.cdn.sos.ca.gov/collections/1879/archive/1879-constitution.pdf Constitution of the State of California of 1879]</ref><ref>[[James Whitman]], \"Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law\" (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), p. 35</ref> These laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China.<ref name=\"yeefow\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink= |title=An Evidentiary Timeline on the History of Sacramento's Chinatown: 1882 - American Sinophobia, The Chinese Exclusion Act and \"The Driving Out\"|publisher=Friends of the Yee Fow Museum, [[Sacramento, California]]|date=|url=http://www.yeefow.com/past/1882.html |doi=|accessdate=2008-03-24 }}</ref> The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was repealed by the [[Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943]].

Another key piece of legislation was the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]], which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization on the grounds that they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed [[alien land laws]] that prohibited non-citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an \"unassimilable\" race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), then-[[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] wrote of the Chinese as: \"a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Chin|first=Gabriel J.|title=Harlan, Chinese and Chinese Americans|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/immigr10.htm|publisher=University of Dayton Law School}}</ref>

In the USA xenophobic fears against the alleged \"Yellow Peril\" led to the implementation of the [[Page Act of 1875]], the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]], expanded ten years later by the [[Geary Act]]. The [[Immigration Act of 1917]] then created an \"Asian Barred Zone\" under [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] influence.

The Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the most significant restrictions on free immigration in U.S. history. The Act excluded Chinese \"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining\" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. Many Chinese were relentlessly beaten just because of their race.<ref name=\"mem\">{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/immig/chinese6.html|title=Exclusion|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=September 1, 2003|accessdate=2010-01-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090810043800/http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/immig/chinese6.html| archivedate=August 10, 2009| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"usn\">[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm usnews.com: The People's Vote: Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328223654/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm |date=March 28, 2007 }}</ref> The few Chinese non-laborers who wished to immigrate had to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to immigrate, which tended to be difficult to prove.<ref name=\"usn\"/>

The 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]], and then the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], restricted immigration according to national origins. While the Emergency Quota Act used the [[census of the United States|census]] of 1910, xenophobic fears in the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] community lead to the adoption of the 1890 census, more favorable to [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] (WASP) population, for the uses of the Immigration Act of 1924, which responded to rising immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia.

One of the goal of this [[National Origins Formula]], established in 1929, was explicitly to keep the status quo distribution of [[ethnicity]], by allocating quotas in proportion to the actual population. The idea was that immigration would not be allowed to change the \"national character\". Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Asians were excluded but residents of nations in the Americas were not restricted, thus making official the racial discrimination in [[List of United States immigration legislation|immigration laws]]. This system was repealed with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].

===Chinese labor and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882===
{{main|Chinese Exclusion Act}}
According to statistics, between 1820 and 1840, only 11 Chinese people emigrated to the United States. However, many Chinese were living in distress due to the end of the Qing Dynasty. The United States offered a more stable life, thanks to the gold rush in California, the construction of railways, and the resulting large demand for labor. Beginning in 1848, many Chinese chose to immigrate to the US.

In order to recruit more laborers, the United States and China signed the [[Burlingame Treaty]] in 1868.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/187656110X523717 |first=John |last=Schrecker |title=\"For the Equality of Men - For the Equality of Nations\": Anson Burlingame and China's First Embassy to the United States, 1868. |journal=Journal of American-East Asian Relations |date=March 2010 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=9–34 |issn=1058-3947}}&nbsp;[https://burlingame.wikispaces.com/file/view/Burlingame+JAEAR.pdf Alternate URL]</ref> The Burlingame Treaty provided several rights, including that Chinese people can freely enter and leave the United States; the right of abode in the United States; and the United States most-favored treatment of Chinese nationals in the United States. The Treaty stimulated immigration for the 20 years between 1853 and 1873, and resulted in the immigration of nearly 105,000 Chinese to the United States by 1880.<ref name=Chin-2013 />

1882 was an election year in California. In order to secure more votes, California politicians adopted a staunch anti-China stance. In Congress, California Republican Senator [[John Franklin Miller (senator)|John Miller]] spoke at length in support of a bill to prohibit further Chinese immigrants, substantially the same as one from the prior session of Congress that had been vetoed by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. Senator Miller submitted a motion to ban the immigration Chinese laborers for 20 years, citing the passage of the 1879 anti-Chinese referendums in California and Nevada by huge margins as proof of popular support.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18820301.2.42 |title=Senator Miller's Great Anti-Chinese Speech |author= |date=March 1, 1882 |newspaper=Daily Alta California |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The motion was discussed in the Senate over the next eight days. All the Senators from western states and most of the southern Democratic Party supported Miller's proposal, strenuously objected to the eastern states senator. After intense debate, the motion eventually passed the Senate by a vote of 29 of 15; it would go on to pass in the House of Representatives on March 23, by 167 votes to 66 votes (55 abstentions).<ref name=Chin-2013 />

President [[Chester A. Arthur]] vetoed the bill on April 4, 1882, as it violated the provisions of the [[Angell Treaty]], which restricted but did not ban immigration from China. Congress was unable to overturn the veto, and passed a version of the bill that banned immigration for ten years in lieu of the original twenty-year ban. On May 6, 1882, Miller's proposal was signed by President Arthur, and became the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]].<ref name=Chin-2013>{{cite journal |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/85234407/chinese-exclusion-act-1882 |author=Chin, Philip |title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 |journal=Chinese American Forum |date=January 2013 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=8–13}}&nbsp;Direct URLs: [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%201.pdf Part 1] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%202.pdf Part 2] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%203.pdf Part 3]</ref>

==Cold War==
{{main|Red Scare}}
Anti-Chinese sentiment during the Cold War was largely the result of the Red Scare and [[McCarthyism]], which coincided with increased popular fear of communist [[espionage]] because of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and China's involvement in the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Schr\">{{cite book| last = Schrecker| first = Ellen| year = 1998| title = Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America| publisher = Little, Brown| isbn = 0-316-77470-7| page = xiii| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/manyarecrimesmcc00schr}}</ref> During the era, suspected Communists were imprisoned in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs.<ref name=\"Schr\"/> Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees, had a real past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party.

===Deportation of Qian Xuesen===
The most notable example is that of the top Chinese scientist [[Qian Xuesen]]. Allegations were made that he was a communist, and his security clearance was revoked in June 1950.<ref name=\"caltech1\">{{cite web|url=http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id%3D39604|title=Tsien Hsue-Shen Dies|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=October 2, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928124208/http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=39604|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] located an [[American Communist Party]] document from 1938 with his name on it, and used it as justification for the revocation. Without his clearance, Qian found himself unable to pursue his career, and within two weeks, he announced plans to return to [[mainland China]], which had come under the government of Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]]. The [[Undersecretary of the Navy]] at the time, [[Dan A. Kimball]], tried to keep Qian in the US: 
<blockquote>It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go.<ref name=\"autogenerated57\">Perrett, B. (January 7, 2008), Sea Change, Aviation Week and Space Technology, Vol. 168, No. 1, p.57-61.</ref></blockquote>

Qian would spend the next five years under house arrest, which included constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any research (classified) duties.<ref name=\"caltech1\"/> Caltech appointed attorney [[Grant Cooper (attorney)|Grant Cooper]] to defend Qian. In 1955, the United States deported him to China in exchange for five American pilots captured during the [[Korean War]]. Later, he became the father of the modern [[Chinese space program]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-02-06/us-trained-scientist-was-deported-then-became-father-chinese-rocketry |title=Meet the US-trained scientist who was deported to China, and became a national hero |work=Pri.org |date=February 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/asia/04qian.html |title=Qian Xuesen, Father of China's Space Program, Dies at 98 |work=The New York Times |date=November 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-me-qian-xuesen1-2009nov01-story.html | title=Qian Xuesen dies at 98; rocket scientist helped establish Jet Propulsion Laboratory| date=September 17, 2014}}</ref>

==21st century==
Modern anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States may originate from American fears of China's role as a rising power. Perceptions of China's rise have been so widespread that 'rise of China' has been named the top news story of the 21st century by the [[Global Language Monitor]], as measured by number of appearances in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet and blogosphere, and in Social Media.<ref>{{cite web|language=zh|url=http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/xkb/html/2011-05/07/content_1105830.htm|title=21世纪新闻排行中国崛起居首位|access-date=2011-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927095901/http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/xkb/html/2011-05/07/content_1105830.htm|archive-date=2011-09-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The current deterioration of relations has led to a spike in anti-Chinese sentiment in the US.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/us/politics/china-red-scare-washington.html|title=A New Red Scare Is Reshaping Washington|last=Swanson|first=Ana|date=2019-07-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2165704/caught-crossfire-chinese-americans-feel-heat-tensions-flare|title=Caught in the middle: Chinese-Americans feel heat as tensions flare|date=2018-09-25|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref> According to a [[Pew Research Center]] poll released in August 2019, 60 percent of Americans have negative opinions about China, with only 26 percent holding positive views.

In March 2020, Trump referred to the [[coronavirus]] outbreak in the United States as the [[Racial views of Donald Trump#\"Chinese Virus\"|\"Chinese Virus\"]].  In February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] advised the public to not refer to Coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" or \"Wuhan virus\".<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/18/coronavirus-sen-john-cornyn-says-chinese-eating-bats-spread-virus/2869342001/</ref><ref>https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-pandemic-drumbeat-coronavirus-135392</ref><ref>https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-china-wuhan-republicans-e9c2cd35-c5bb-42df-9e30-94364548d1fb.html</ref><ref>https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/18/opinions/trumps-malicious-use-of-chinese-virus-filipovic/index.html</ref>
Additionally, the terms Wuflu and Kung Flu emerged in the United States during this period as alternative ways of referring to [[COVID-19]]. These terms are linked to [[Wuhan]], where the virus was first detected, or China in general, via [[portmanteau]] with terms from traditional [[Chinese Martial Arts]], ''Wushu'' and ''Kung Fu''. Despite their playfulness, use of such terms mockingly implies the virus (which is not a [[flu]]) is China's aggressive gift to the world, and distracts from the fact that thousands of Chinese have suffered and died from the virus, particularly in Wuhan, thereby belittling the widespread suffering of Chinese under pandemic conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-fluh|title=Trump doubles down on 'China virus,' demands to know who in White House used phrase 'Kung Flu\"|date=2020-03-18|website=Fox News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|title=A last, desperate pivot: Trump and his allies go full racist on coronavirus|date=2020-03-19|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>
