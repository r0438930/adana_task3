The limestone caves were first described by [[Frederick Courtney Selous]] in 1888.\n\n==History==\nChinhoyi was called '''Sinoia''' during the colonial era. It derives its name from Tjinoyi, a Lozwi/Rozwi Chief who is believed to have been a son of Lukuluba [corrupted to Mukuruva by the Zezuru] who was the third son of Emperor Netjasike. The Kalanga[Lozwi/Rozwi name] was changed to Sinoia by the white settlers and later Chinhoyi by the Zezuru. Sinoia was established in 1906 as a group settlement scheme by a wealthy Italian called Lieutenant '''Margherito Guidotti''' who encouraged ten Italian families to settle here.The Second Chimurenga War (War of Liberation) started in this town in the area occupied by the Chinhoyi Provincial hospital.\n\n==Transport==\nTransport to and from Chinhoyi is mainly by road.

The main cave contains a pool of cobalt blue water, which is popularly called ''Sleeping Pool'' or ''Chirorodziva'' (\"Pool of the Fallen\").<ref name=\"readersnatural\">{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=345|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}</ref>. Natives who practise African Traditional Religion attach a spiritual value to these caves as they claim that the caves were a spot where spirit mediums perform rituals to connect with the non-material. Historically, the first white man believed to have discovered the Caves was Frederick Selous, the famous European hunter, during his wanderings in 1887. It was believed that prior to that the Caves were being used as a stronghold by an outlaw called Nyamakwere who murdered many victims by throwing them into the Silent Pool. The notorious Nyamakwere was eventually defeated and killed by a Headman called Chinhoyi who became a Mashona Chief, hence the name Chinhoyi given to the nearby town. Chief Chinhoyi and his followers used the Caves as a refuge from raiding tribes such as the Matebele. Until a few years ago the remains of Chief Chinhoyi\u2019s grain bins could be seen in some of the underground passages. The traditional name for the Caves is \u201cChirorodziva\u201d which means the \u201cPool of the Fallen\u201d. The name was derived from an incident which took place in the 1830s when the Angoni Tribe, who were moving northwards surprised people living near the Caves and flung them into the pool. world<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zimparks.org/parks/national-parks/chinhoyi-caves/|title=Chinhoyi Caves - Zimparks|publisher=}}</ref>. They have been designated as a [[National Park]] and they are managed by the Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Management Authority.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Railway stations in Zimbabwe]]\n* [[Districts of

The Kalanga[Lozwi/Rozwi name] was changed to Sinoia by the white settlers and later Chinhoyi by the Zezuru.

The main cave contains a pool of cobalt blue water, which is popularly called ''Sleeping Pool'' or ''Chirorodziva'' (\"Pool of the Fallen\").<ref name=\"readersnatural\">{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=345|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}</ref>. Natives who practise African Traditional Religion attach a spiritual value to these caves as they claim that the caves were a spot where spirit mediums perform rituals to connect with the non-material. Historically, the first white man believed to have discovered the Caves was Frederick Selous, the famous European hunter, during his wanderings in 1887. It was believed that prior to that the Caves were being used as a stronghold by an outlaw called Nyamakwere who murdered many victims by throwing them into the Silent Pool. The notorious Nyamakwere was eventually defeated and killed by a Headman called Chinhoyi who became a Mashona Chief, hence the name Chinhoyi given to the nearby town. Chief Chinhoyi and his followers used the Caves as a refuge from raiding tribes such as the Matebele. Until a few years ago the remains of Chief Chinhoyi\u2019s grain bins could be seen in some of the underground passages. The traditional name for the Caves is \u201cChirorodziva\u201d which means the \u201cPool of the Fallen\u201d. The name was derived from an incident which took place in the 1830s when the Angoni Tribe, who were moving northwards surprised people living near the Caves and flung them into the pool. world<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zimparks.org/parks/national-parks/chinhoyi-caves/|title=Chinhoyi Caves - Zimparks|publisher=}}</ref>.
