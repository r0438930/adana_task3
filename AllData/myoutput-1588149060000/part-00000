{"title_page": "List of federal political scandals in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates | date=November 2017}}\n{{dynamic list}}\n{{Political corruption sidebar}}\n\nThis article provides a list of [[political scandal]]s that involve officials from the government of the [[United States]], sorted from oldest to most recent.\n\n==Scope and organization of political scandals==\nThis article is fart organized by presidential terms in order, older to recent, and then divided into scandals of the federal executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. Members of both parties are listed under the term of the president in office at the time the scandal took place, even though they may not be connected with the or office, their staffs and appointees. Please note that every president directly selects, appoints or hires several thousand people. Each of them selects thousands more. Private citizens should only be mentioned when they are closely linked to the scandal or politician, such as [[Jack Abramoff]]. This list also does not include crimes that occur outside the politician's tenure (such as before or after his tenure) unless they specifically stem from acts made while in office and discovered later.\n\nScandal is defined as \"loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety\". Scandals are separate from 'controversies', (which implies two differing points of view) and 'unpopularity'. Many decisions are controversial, many decisions are unpopular, that alone does not make them scandals. Breaking the law is a scandal. The finding of a court is the sole method used to determine a violation of law, but it is not the sole method of determining a scandal. Also included as scandals are politicians who resign, quit, run, or commit suicide while being investigated or threatened with investigation.\n\nNotoriety is a major determinant of a scandal, that is, the amount of press dedicated to it. Misunderstandings, breaches of ethics, unproven crimes or cover-ups may or may not result in inclusion depending on the standing of the accused, the amount of publicity generated, and the seriousness of the crime, if any. Drunk driving may be a conviction, but is usually too minor and too common to mention unless there are multiple convictions and/or jail time.\n\nGiven the political nature of Congress in which the leading party has determining power, politicians who are rebuked, denounced, censured, admonished, condemned, suspended, reprimanded, found in contempt, found to have acted improperly, or used poor judgement are ''not'' included unless the scandal is exceptional or leads to expulsion or conviction.\n\n==Scandals during government under the Articles of Confederation (1777\u20131789)==\n\n=== Executive branch ===\n* [[Conway Cabal]] created a movement or conspiracy to remove George Washington as commander of the Continental Army by [[Thomas Conway]] and [[Horatio Gates]].

Bush administration controversies]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates | date=November 2017}}\n{{dynamic list}}\n{{Political corruption sidebar}}\n\nThis article provides a list of [[political scandal]]s that involve officials from the government of the [[United States]], sorted from oldest to most recent.\n\n==Scope and organization of political scandals==\nThis article is organized by presidential terms in order, older to recent, and then divided into scandals of the federal executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. Members of both parties are listed under the term of the president in office at the time the scandal took place, even though they may not be connected with the presiding president.\n\nIn this article, the term \"[[politician]]\" (a person who is professionally involved in politics) includes not only those elected, but also party officials, candidates for office, their staffs and appointees. Please note that every president directly selects, appoints or hires several thousand people. Each of them selects thousands more. Private citizens should only be mentioned when they are closely linked to the scandal or politician, such as [[Jack Abramoff]]. This list also does not include crimes that occur outside the politician's tenure (such as before or after his tenure) unless they specifically stem from acts made while in office and discovered later.\n\nScandal is defined as \"loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety\". Scandals are separate from 'controversies', (which implies two differing points of view) and 'unpopularity'. Many decisions are controversial, many decisions are unpopular, that alone does not make them scandals. Breaking the law is a scandal. The finding of a court is the sole method used to determine a violation of law, but it is not the sole method of determining a scandal. Also included as scandals are politicians who resign, quit, run, or commit suicide while being investigated or threatened with investigation.\n\nNotoriety is a major determinant of a scandal, that is, the amount of press dedicated to it. Misunderstandings, breaches of ethics, unproven crimes or cover-ups may or may not result in inclusion depending on the standing of the accused, the amount of publicity generated, and the seriousness of the crime, if any. Drunk driving may be a conviction, but is usually too minor and too common to mention unless there are multiple convictions and/or jail time.\n\nGiven the political nature of Congress in which the leading party has determining power, politicians who are rebuked, denounced, censured, admonished, condemned, suspended, reprimanded, found in contempt, found to have acted improperly, or used poor judgement are ''not'' included unless the scandal is exceptional or leads to expulsion or conviction.\n\n==Scandals during government under the Articles of Confederation (1777\u20131789)==\n\n=== Executive branch ===\n* [[Conway Cabal]] created a movement or conspiracy to remove George Washington as commander of the Continental Army by [[Thomas Conway]] and [[Horatio Gates]].
