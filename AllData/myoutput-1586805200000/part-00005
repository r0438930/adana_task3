Goodrich]] (1847\u20131925), and his son, Lieutenant [[Caspar Goodrich]] (died 1907).\n\n''Goodrich'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 February 1945 by the [[Bath Iron Works]] Co., [[Bath, Maine]]; sponsored by Mrs. Caspar F. Goodrich, widow of Admiral Goodrich and mother of Lt. Goodrich; and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 24 April 1945, Commander Dale R. Frakes in command.\n\n==Service history==\nAfter shakedown training in the [[Caribbean]], ''Goodrich'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 12 November 1945 to support the [[occupation of Japan]]. She patrolled between principal [[Japan]]ese ports until October 1946; then she based at [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]], [[China]], for patrol along the coast of [[Korea]]. The destroyer returned to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], on 21 December 1946 and departed on 7 January 1947 to base at [[Naval Station Newport|Newport, Rhode Island]], as a unit of the [[United States Atlantic Fleet]].\n\n''Goodrich'' overhauled in the [[New York Naval Shipyard]], then served in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (2 February - 22 May 1948). This was her first of many annual tours with the \"steel gray stabilizers\" of the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]], of actively countering the repeated threats of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s to overrun the defenseless nations of the [[Balkans]] and the [[Middle East]].\n\n''Goodrich'' was reclassified a [[radar picket]] destroyer, DDR-831, on 18 March 1949.\n\n[[File:USS Goodrich (DD-831) underway in 1945.jpg|thumb|left|''Goodrich'' in 1945.]]\n\nHer service included patrol along the [[Israel]]i-[[Egypt]]ian border of the [[Red Sea]] in February 1956 to help stem the [[Suez Crisis|Mid-East crisis]] that finally culminated in the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]]. When fighting erupted, she sped back to the Mediterranean in November 1956 to protect Americans in that area and serve notice that the United States was determined to contain and terminate the conflict. The destroyer supported the landing of [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Marines at Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], on 14 July 1958, as the Navy again met and checked a [[Communist]] thrust against the Western democracies.\n\n''Goodrich'' shifted her home port in June 1959 from Newport to [[Naval Station Mayport|Mayport, Florida]]. Thereafter her annual deployments to the Mediterranean included intensive training in all forms of naval welfare with [[NATO]] units and a constant readiness with the 6th Fleet to meet any threat to peace in the Mediterranean region. She interrupted her schedule in January 1960, entering the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] for an eight-month modernization overhaul (FRAM II) which included complete renovation and latest weapons and shipboard equipment. She was on [[Project Mercury]] recovery station on 12 February 1962 as Lieutenant Colonel [[John H. Glenn]], USMC, made his successful [[Friendship 7|orbital space flight]].\n\n''Goodrich'' went on alert again with the 6th Fleet during 24 October to 20 November 1962 when the Navy responded to President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for a [[Cuban missile crisis|quarantine of Cuba]] that choked off the flow of military supplies and enforced the American demands for the withdrawal of the Soviet missile experts and equipment. On 22 July 1966 the destroyer got underway from Mayport on her 13th 6th Fleet deployment. She cruised throughout the Mediterranean for five months, unobtrusively patrolling with the 6th Fleet and taking part in combined naval warfare exercises with units of the [[Turkish Navy|Turkish]], [[Hellenic Navy|Greek]], [[Royal Navy|British]], and [[Italian Navy|Italian Navies]]. She returned to Mayport on 20 December 1966 for upkeep and type training.\n\n''Goodrich'' was reclassified DD-831 on 1 January 1969, and was decommissioned on 30 November 1969. Berthed at Orange, Texas, ''Goodrich'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 February 1974. She was sold on 12 September 1977, and broken up for scrap.\n\n== References ==\n{{DANFS|https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/g/goodrich.html|http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/destroy/dd831txt.htm}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|USS Goodrich (DD-831)}}\n* {{navsource|05/831|USS Goodrich}}\n\n{{Gearing class destroyer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goodrich (DD-831)}}\n[[Category:World War II destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Bath, Maine]]\n[[Category:1945 ships]]\n[[Category:Gearing-class destroyers of the United States Navy]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n|+USS ''Goodrich'' (DD-831)\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image= [[File:USS Goodrich (DDR-831) underway at sea in the 1960s.jpg|300px|USS Goodrich (DDR-831)]] \n|Ship caption=''Goodrich'' underway in the 1960s\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=United States \n|Ship flag={{USN flag|1974}}\n|Ship name=\n|Ship namesake= \n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=[[Bath Iron Works]], [[Bath, Maine]]\n|Ship laid down=18 September 1944\n|Ship launched=25 February 1945\n|Ship sponsor=Mrs. Caspar F.
