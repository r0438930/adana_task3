Mac Liamm\u00f3ir was born to a Protestant family living in the [[Kensal Green]] district of London. He co-founded the Gate Theatre with his partner [[Hilton Edwards]]. He is one of the most recognizable figures in the arts in twentieth-century Ireland.\n\n==Life and work==\nAs Alfred Willmore, he was one of the leading child actors on the English stage, in the company of [[No\u00ebl Coward]]. He appeared for several seasons in [[Peter Pan]]. He studied painting at London's [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade School of Art]], continuing to paint throughout his lifetime. In the 1920s he travelled all over Europe. Willmore was captivated by Irish culture: he learnt [[Irish language|Irish]] which he spoke and wrote fluently and he changed his name to an Irish version, presenting himself in Ireland as a descendant of Irish Catholics from Cork.<ref name=\"cemd\">The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama, Columbia University Press, New York (2007), p. 851. {{ISBN|978-0-231-14032-4}}.</ref> Later in his life, he wrote three autobiographies in Irish and translated them into English.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/plastic-paddies-25963747.html|title=Plastic Paddies |date=29 October 2005 |first=Ian |last=O'Doherty |newspaper =[[Irish Independent]] }}</ref>\n\nWhile acting in Ireland with the touring company of his brother-in-law Anew MacMaster, Mac Liamm\u00f3ir met the man who would become his partner and lover, [[Hilton Edwards]].<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/20/obituaries/hilton-edwards-79-is-dead-founder-of-theater-in-dublin.html|title=HILTON EDWARDS, 79, IS DEAD; FOUNDER OF THEATER IN DUBLIN\n|first=Eleanor |last=Blau |date=20 November 1982 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref> Their first meeting took place in the Athenaeum, [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]].

Dublin: Liffey Press</ref>\n\nMac Liamm\u00f3ir and Edwards then threw themselves into their own venture, co-founding the [[Gate Theatre]] in Dublin in 1928. The Gate became a showcase for modern plays and design (even as Mac Liamm\u00f3ir himself maintained an ongoing fascination with [[Celtic mythology|Celticism]]). Mac Liamm\u00f3ir's set and costume designs were key elements of the Gate's success. His many notable acting roles included Robert Emmet/The Speaker in [[Denis Johnston]]'s ''The Old Lady Says \"No!\"'' and the title role in ''Hamlet.''\n\nIn 1948, he appeared in the [[NBC]] television production of ''Great Catherine'' with [[Gertrude Lawrence]]. In 1951, during a break in the making of ''Othello'', Mac Liamm\u00f3ir produced [[Orson Welles]]'s ghost-story ''[[Return to Glennascaul]]'' which was directed by Hilton Edwards. He played [[Iago]] in Welles's film version of ''[[Othello (1952 film)|Othello]]'' (1952). His Iago is unusual in that Mac Liamm\u00f3ir was about fifty (and looked older) when he played the role, while the play gives Iago's age as 28. This may have been because of Welles' intended interpretation \u2013 he wanted Iago played as an older \"impotent\" consumed by envy for the younger Othello.<ref>Miche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir, ''Put Money in thy purse \u2013 the Making of Othello.'' 1952. p. 26</ref> The following year, he went on to play 'Poor Tom' in another Welles project, the TV film of ''[[King Lear (1953 TV drama)|King Lear]]'' (1953) for [[CBS]].\n\nMac Liamm\u00f3ir wrote and performed a one-man show, ''[[The Importance of Being Oscar]]'', based on the life and work of [[Oscar Wilde]]. The [[RT\u00c9 One|Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] production won him a [[Jacob's Award]] in December 1964. It was later filmed by the [[BBC]] with Mac Liamm\u00f3ir reprising the role.\n\nHe narrated the 1963 film ''[[Tom Jones (1963 film)|Tom Jones]]'' and was the Irish storyteller in ''[[30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia]]'' (1968) which starred [[Dudley Moore]].\n\nIn 1969 he had a supporting role in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Kremlin Letter]]''. In 1970 Mac Liamm\u00f3ir performed the role of narrator on the cult album ''Peace on Earth'' by the Northern Irish [[showband]], [[The Freshmen (Irish showband)|the Freshmen]] and in 1971 he played an elocution teacher in [[Curtis Harrington]]'s ''[[What's the Matter with Helen?]]''.\n\nMac Liamm\u00f3ir's homosexual relationship with General [[Eoin O'Duffy]], former [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] Commissioner and head of the paramilitary [[Blueshirts]] in Ireland, during the 1920s was obliquely referenced by Christopher Fitz-Simon in his biography The Boys and substantiated by Irish playwright [[Mary Manning (writer)|Mary Manning]],  in a documentary, ''Dear Boy'', directed by Donald Taylor Black and broadcast on Raidio Teilefis Eireann in 1999. \n\nMac Liamm\u00f3ir's early life and artistic development are the subject of a study by Tom Madden, ''The Making of an Artist''. Edwards and Mac Liamm\u00f3ir were the subject of a biography, titled ''The Boys'' by Christopher Fitz-Simon.
