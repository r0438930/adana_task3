It is a collaboration of 29 non-profit conservation organisations, both Australian and international. SOML was initially founded in 2008 to raise awareness of the need for the Australian Government to establish a network of large marine sanctuaries in the country's South West marine region.<ref>[http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/20090225912/business-briefing/uwa-ecologist-worldwide-campaign-protect-our-marine-life  University of Western Australia, \"UWA ecologist worldwide campaign to protect our marine life\", published 25 February 2009, retrieved 18 January 2010]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49620 |title=Save Our Marine Life |date=23 February 2009 |access-date=2018-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506004539/http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49620 |archive-date=2011-05-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2010 SOML became a national campaign in order to drive the completion of Australia's National Network of Marine Parks.\n\nAs a result of the SOML campaign and the long-standing Australian Government NRSMPA program (National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas) in 2012 the Gillard Labor Government declared 44 new federal marine parks in the South-west, North-west, North, Coral Sea and Temperate East marine regions, bringing Australia's federal marine park total to 60, covering a total area of 3.3million square kilometers (36% of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)) - the largest marine parks network in the world.\n\nIn December 2013 the incoming Abbott Coalition Government suspended the operation of the 44 new parks before they could commence operation (which was scheduled for July 2014), and commenced an independent review. That review provided its findings to the then Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt in December 2015. The findings were released to the public in September 2016. Whilst endorsing the process undertaken by previous governments to develop the 44 marine parks, the Review recommended changes to zoning in a number of the new parks.\n\nIn September 2016 the Turnbull Coalition Government commenced a further public consultation process to develop new management plans for the marine parks in order to change the zoning. In March 2018 the revised management plans were tabled in the Australian Parliament for consideration. Changes to the original 2012 zoning in the parks included removal of almost half the high level protective green \u2018sanctuary\u2019 zoning across the network - an area almost twice the size of the state of Victoria and equivalent in area to the loss of half of Australia's national parks on land - the biggest single windback of conservation area in Australia's history.\n\nThe alliance groups include:\n* [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]\n* [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]]\n* [[Conservation Council of Western Australia]]\n* [[Cairns and Far North Environment Centre]]\n* [[Conservation Council of WA]]\n* [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]\n* [[Environment Centre of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Environment Tasmania]]\n* [[Environment Victoria]]\n* [[Environs Kimberley]]\n* [[Greenpeace Asia Pacific]]\n* [[Humane Society International]]\n* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]\n* [[National Parks Association of NSW]]\n* [[National Parks Association of Qld]]\n* [[Nature Conservation Council of NSW]]\n* [[North Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Project AWARE|Project AWARE Foundation]]\n* [[Sealife Trust]]\n* [[Sea Shepherd]]\n* [[Surfrider]]\n* [[The Nature Conservancy]]\n* [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]]\n* [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]]\n* [[Victorian National Parks Association]]\n* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]\n* [[Wildlife Preservation Council of Qld]]\n* [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund \u2013 Australia]]\n\n'''What's at stake'''\n\nMarine sanctuaries (green zones) are proven to work alongside sensible fisheries management to provide safe havens for fish and marine life to recover and rebuild. Sanctuaries have been shown to prevent local extinctions and help make coral reefs more resilient to the impacts of climate change.\n \nIn 2012, Australia made history by creating the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries \u2013 protecting our incredible marine life, safeguarding our enviable coastal lifestyle, and giving fish populations across Australia the chance to rebuild and thrive.\n\nThe creation of the national network crossed political divides and received bi-partisan political support. It was initiated by John Howard's Coalition Government in 1998, and finalised by the federal Labor Government in 2012. In 2014 the Abbott Coalition Government suspended the parks from operation pending a review.\n\nIn 1 July 2018 the 44 federal/Commonwealth waters parks created in 2012 commenced operation with revised zoning amidst great concern at the loss of almost half the highly protective green zoning.\n\nThe SOML campaign to ensure Australia's unique and important marine environment has a science based network of marine parks and sanctuaries, continues.\n\nTo save marine life we need to:\nStop littering\nTake care of animals \nPlant trees\nClean the sea\nPick up trash on the beach\n\n\nOpen main menu\n\nEndangered species\n\nLanguageDownload PDFWatchEdit\n\nFor other uses, see\u00a0Endangered species (disambiguation).\n\n\"Endangered\" redirects here.

Note the\u00a0wing tags\u00a0used for population monitoring.\n\nAn\u00a0endangered species\u00a0is a\u00a0species\u00a0that is very likely to become\u00a0extinct\u00a0in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as\u00a0habitat loss,\u00a0poaching\u00a0and\u00a0invasive species. The\u00a0International Union for Conservation of Nature\u00a0(IUCN)\u00a0Red List\u00a0lists the global\u00a0conservation status\u00a0of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have\u00a0laws\u00a0that protect\u00a0conservation-reliant species\u00a0which, for example, forbid\u00a0hunting, restrict\u00a0land development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as\u00a0captive breeding\u00a0and\u00a0habitat restoration.\n\nContents\n\nConservation statusEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Conservation status\n\nThe\u00a0conservation status\u00a0of a\u00a0species\u00a0indicates the likelihood that it will become\u00a0extinct. Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.[1]\u00a0The\u00a0IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u00a0is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.[2]\n\nOver 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.[3]\u00a0Internationally, 195 countries have signed an accord to create\u00a0Biodiversity Action Plans\u00a0that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the\u00a0United States, such plans are usually called\u00a0Species Recovery Plans.\n\nIUCN Red ListEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Endangered species (IUCN status)\n\nThe\u00a0Siberian tiger\u00a0is an Endangered\u00a0(EN)\u00a0tiger subspecies. Three tiger subspecies are already extinct (see\u00a0List of carnivorans by population).[4]\n\nBlue-throated macaw, an endangered species\n\nBrown spider monkey, an endangered species\n\nSiamese crocodile, an endangered species\n\nAmerican burying beetle, an endangered species\n\n\u00a0\n\nKemp's ridley sea turtle, an endangered species\n\n\u00a0\n\nMexican Wolf, the most endangered subspecies of the North American\u00a0Grey Wolf. Approximately 143 are living wild.\n\nThough labeled a list, the\u00a0IUCN Red List\u00a0is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes \"Data Deficient\"\u00a0(DD) species\u00a0\u2013 species for which more data and assessment is required before their situation may be determined\u00a0\u2013 as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. Those species of \"Near Threatened\"\u00a0(NT) and \"Least Concern\"\u00a0(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms \"endangered species\" and \"threatened species\" with particular meanings: \"Endangered\"\u00a0(EN) species lie between \"Vulnerable\"\u00a0(VU) and \"Critically Endangered\"\u00a0(CR) species. In 2012, the IUCN Red List listed 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered (EN) worldwide.[1]\n\nEndangered species in the United StatesEdit\n\nThere is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the\u00a0Endangered Species Act\u00a0(ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.[5]\n\n\u00a0\n\nA proportional symbol map of each state's endangered species count.\n\nEndangered Species ActEdit\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Endangered\" in relation to \"threatened\" under the ESA.\n\nUnder the\u00a0Endangered Species Act of 1973\u00a0in the\u00a0United States, species may be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\". The\u00a0Salt Creek tiger beetle\u00a0(Cicindela nevadica lincolniana) is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. Also, they are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p.\u00a0414).\n\nSome endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and rules for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered. Whether restrictions on land development constitute a \"taking\" of land by the\u00a0government; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their areas; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from\u00a0hunters\u00a0and various industries like the\u00a0petroleum industry,\u00a0construction\u00a0industry, and\u00a0logging, has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.\n\nThe\u00a0Bush administration\u00a0lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the\u00a0Obama administration, this policy has been reinstated.[6]\n\nBeing listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.[7]\u00a0This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species.[8]\n\nAnother problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the \"shoot, shovel, and shut-up\" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat silently. Thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species.[9]\u00a0The effectiveness of the\u00a0Endangered Species Act\u00a0\u2013 which coined the term \"endangered species\"\u00a0\u2013 has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered[10]\u00a0and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population.[11]\n\nCurrently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law. This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws like the Endangered Species Act. According to\u00a0NatureServe's global conservation status, approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.[12]:415\u00a0Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.[12]:416\u00a0This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBald eagle\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmerican bison\n\nEver since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing have been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the\u00a0dodo,\u00a0passenger pigeon,\u00a0great auk,\u00a0Tasmanian tiger\u00a0and\u00a0Steller's sea cow\u00a0are some of the more well known examples; with the\u00a0bald eagle,\u00a0grizzly bear,\u00a0American bison,\u00a0Eastern timber wolf\u00a0and\u00a0sea turtle\u00a0having been poached to near-extinction. Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or\u00a0Haliaeetus leucocephalus\u00a0is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.[13]\u00a0A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale, and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes. The actions include prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as\u00a0Japan\u00a0continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of \"scientific purposes\".[14]\u00a0Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list. It could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.\n\nInvasive speciesEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Introduced species\n\nThe introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases, the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases, a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.[15]\n\nConservationEdit\n\nWe need to stop killing animals. We aren't just killing them we are killing the environment and if we kill the environment we kill are kind! This rubbish is effecting everyone. We can stop this now! I say \"you are never to small to make a difference. \"we all can make a change never to small never to big.\n\n\nWe can not live with a different   ocean.\n\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Towie, Narelle (18 May 2009), [http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/hopes-rise-for-wa-marine-parks/story-0-1225713460815 Better protection for 1.4m sq km of WA marine parks], ''PerthNow'', (Perth, Australia), retrieved 28 January 2010\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.saveourmarinelife.org.au/ Save Our Marine Life official site]\n\n[[Category:Conservation organisations based in Australia]]\n[[Category:Conservation in Western Australia]]\n[[Category:2009 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox organization\n| name = Save Our Marine Life\n| logo =\n| founded_date    = 2008\n| location          = [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], [[Australia]]\n| area_served     = Australia\n| focus           = [[Conservation movement|Conservation]]\n| method          = [[Lobbying]], [[Research]], [[Activism]]\n| homepage        = [http://www.saveourmarinelife.org.au/ Save Our Marine Life official website]\n}}\n'''Save Our Marine Life''' (SOML) is an Australian [[not-for-profit]], [[non-governmental organisation|non-governmental]] environmental advocacy alliance working to protect and secure Australia's marine life.

Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered[10]\u00a0and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population.[11]\n\nCurrently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law. This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws like the Endangered Species Act. According to\u00a0NatureServe's global conservation status, approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.[12]:415\u00a0Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.[12]:416\u00a0This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBald eagle\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmerican bison\n\nEver since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing have been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the\u00a0dodo,\u00a0passenger pigeon,\u00a0great auk,\u00a0Tasmanian tiger\u00a0and\u00a0Steller's sea cow\u00a0are some of the more well known examples; with the\u00a0bald eagle,\u00a0grizzly bear,\u00a0American bison,\u00a0Eastern timber wolf\u00a0and\u00a0sea turtle\u00a0having been poached to near-extinction. Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or\u00a0Haliaeetus leucocephalus\u00a0is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.[13]\u00a0A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale, and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes. The actions include prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as\u00a0Japan\u00a0continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of \"scientific purposes\".[14]\u00a0Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list. It could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.\n\nInvasive speciesEdit\n\nMain article:\u00a0Introduced species\n\nThe introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases, the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases, a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.[15]\n\nConservationEdit\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Towie, Narelle (18 May 2009), [http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/hopes-rise-for-wa-marine-parks/story-0-1225713460815 Better protection for 1.4m sq km of WA marine parks], ''PerthNow'', (Perth, Australia), retrieved 28 January 2010\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.saveourmarinelife.org.au/ Save Our Marine Life official site]\n\n[[Category:Conservation organisations based in Australia]]\n[[Category:Conservation in Western Australia]]\n[[Category:2009 establishments in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "2.103.97.40", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_Our_Marine_Life"}
