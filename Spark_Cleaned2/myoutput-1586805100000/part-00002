Hiroki Marukawa, the main character and a schoolmate of Miki, is so intimidated by the other characters that he outs Sachiko when she attempts to hide, and she fails to disclose his information to Miki, despite being prompted by Miki. Despite the hazards to her life, Miki is led to the house by gangsters, and, along with Sachiko, is rescued by police following on a tip before the gangsters attempt to kill her.
