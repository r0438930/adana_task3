'''Shipbuilders''', also called '''shipwrights''', follow a specialized occupation that traces its roots to before [[recorded history]].\n\nShipbuilding and ship repairs, both commercial and military, are referred to as \"[[naval engineering]]\".  The construction of [[boat]]s is a similar activity called [[boat building]].\n\nThe dismantling of ships is called [[ship breaking]].<!--spacing, please do not remove-->\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-history===\nArchaeological evidence indicates that anatomically modern humans arrived on [[Borneo]] at least 120,000&nbsp;years ago, probably by sea from the [[Asia]]n mainland during an [[ice age]] period when the sea was lower and distances between islands shorter (See [[Papua New Guinea#History|History of Papua New Guinea]]).

''The Book of Michael of Rhodes: A Fifteenth-Century Maritime Manuscript'', 3 vols. (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2009)</ref>\n\nOutside Medieval Europe, great advances were being made in shipbuilding. The shipbuilding industry in [[Imperial China]] reached its height during the [[Song Dynasty]], [[Yuan Dynasty]], and early [[Ming Dynasty]]. The mainstay of China's merchant and naval fleets was the [[junk (ship)|junk]], which had existed for centuries, but it was at this time that the large ships based on this design were built. During the Sung period (960\u20131279 AD), the establishment of China's first official standing navy in 1132 AD and the enormous increase in maritime trade abroad (from [[Heian period|Heian]] [[Japan]] to [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]]) allowed the shipbuilding industry in provinces like [[Fujian]] to thrive as never before. The  largest [[seaport]]s in the world were in China and included [[Guangzhou]], [[Quanzhou]], and [[Xiamen]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the Islamic world, shipbuilding thrived at [[Basra]] and [[Alexandria]], the [[dhow]], [[felucca]], [[baghlah]] and the [[sambuk]], became symbols of successful maritime trade around the [[Indian Ocean]]; from the ports of [[East Africa]] to [[Southeast Asia]] and the ports of [[Sindh]] and [[Al-Hind|Hind]] (India) during the [[Abbasid]] period.\n\nAt this time islands spread over vast distances across the [[Pacific Ocean]] were being colonised by the Melanesians and Polynesians, who built giant canoes and progressed to great catamarans.\n\n=== Ming China ===\nShipbuilders in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368~1644) were not the same as the shipbuilders in other Chinese dynasties, due to hundreds of years of accumulated experiences and rapid changes in the Ming dynasty. Basically, shipbuilders in the Ming dynasty mostly work for the government, under command of the [[Ministry of Works (imperial China)|Ministry of Public Works]].\n\n====Early Ming (1368~1476)====\nDuring the early years of the Ming dynasty, the Ming government maintained an open policy towards sailing. Between 1405 and 1433, the government conducted seven diplomatic [[Ming treasure voyages]] to over thirty countries in Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. The voyages were initiated by the [[Yongle Emperor]], and led by the Admiral [[Zheng He]]. Six voyages were conducted under the Yongle Emperor's reign, the last of which returned to China in 1422. After the Yongle Emperor's death in 1424, his successor the [[Hongxi Emperor]] ordered the suspension of the voyages. The seventh and final voyage began in 1430, sent by the [[Xuande Emperor]]. Although the Hongxi and Xuande Emperors did not emphasize sailing as much as the Yongle Emperor, they were not against it. This led to a high degree of commercialization and an increase in trade. Large numbers of ships were built to meet the demand.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=Ming China: Courts and Contacts 1400-1450|last=Clunas|first=Craig|last2=Sally K.

''Shachuan'', or 'sand-ships', are ships used primarily for inland transport.<ref name=\":03\" /> However, in recent years, some researchers agree that the treasure ships were more of the ''Fuchuan'' type. It is said in vol.176 of ''San Guo Bei Meng Hui Bian'' (\u4e09\u671d\u5317\u76df\u6c47\u7f16) that ships made in Fujian are the best ones.<ref name=\":2\" /> Therefore, the best shipbuilders and laborers were brought from these places to support Zheng He's expedition.\n\nThe shipyard was under the command of [[Ministry of Works (imperial China)|Ministry of Public Works]]. The shipbuilders had no control over their lives. The builders, commoner's doctors, cooks and errands had lowest social status.<ref>Chan, Alan Kam-leung, et al. ''Historical Perspectives on East Asian Science, Technology and Medicine''. VII, World Scientific, Singapore University Press, 2003. p. 107</ref> The shipbuilders were forced to move away from their hometown to the shipyards. There were two major ways to enter the shipbuilder occupation: family tradition, or apprenticeship. If a shipbuilder entered the occupation due to family tradition, the shipbuilder learned the techniques of shipbuilding from his family and is very likely to earn a higher status in the shipyard. Additionally, the shipbuilder had access to [[business networking]] that could help to find clients. If a shipbuilder entered the occupation through an apprenticeship, the shipbuilder was likely a farmer before he was hired as a shipbuilder, or he was previously an experienced shipbuilder.\n\nMany shipbuilders working in the shipyard were forced into the occupation. The ships built for Zheng He's voyages needed to be waterproof, solid, safe, and have ample room to carry large amounts of trading goods. Therefore, due to the highly commercialized society that was being encouraged by the expeditions, trades, and government policies, the shipbuilders needed to acquire the skills to build ships that fulfil these requirements.\n\nShipbuilding was not the sole industry utilising Chinese lumber at that time; the new capital was being built in Beijing from approximately 1407 onwards,<ref name=\":03\" /> which required huge amounts of high-quality wood. These two ambitious projects commissioned by Emperor Yongle would have had enormous environmental and economic effects, even if the ships were half the dimensions given in the ''[[History of Ming]]''. Considerable pressure would also have been placed on the infrastructure required to transport the trees from their point of origin to the shipyards.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nShipbuilders were usually divided into different groups and had separate jobs. Some were responsible for fixing old ships; some were responsible for making the keel and some were responsible for building the helm.\n\n* It was the [[keel]] that determined the shape and the structure of the hull of ''Fuchuan'' Ships. The keel is the middle of the bottom of the hull, constructed by connecting three sections; stern keel, main keel and poop keel. The hull spreads in the arc towards both sides forming the keel.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* The [[Ship's wheel|helm]] was the device that controls direction when sailing. It was a critical invention in shipbuilding technique in ancient China and was only used by the Chinese for a fairly long time. With a developing recognition of its function, the shape and configuration of the helm was continually improved by shipbuilders.<ref name=\":2\" /> The shipbuilders not only needed to build the ship according to design, but needed to acquire the skills to improve the ships.\n\n==== Late Ming (1478\u20131644)====\nAfter 1477, the Ming government reversed its open maritime policies, enacting a series of isolationist policies in response to [[wokou|piracy]]. The policies, called ''[[Haijin]]'' (sea ban), lasted until the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644. During this period, Chinese navigation technology did not make any progress and even declined in some aspect.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n===Early modern===\nWith the development of the [[carrack]], the west moved into a new era of ship construction by building the first regular oceangoing vessels. In a relatively short time, these ships grew to an unprecedented size, complexity and cost.\n\nShipyards became large industrial complexes and the ships built were financed by consortia of investors. These considerations led to the documentation of design and construction practices in what had previously been a secretive trade run by master shipwrights, and ultimately led to the field of [[naval architecture]], where professional designers and draftsmen played an increasingly important role.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tipping |first=Colin |date=November 1998 |title=Technical Change and the Ship Draughtsman |journal=The Mariner's Mirror |volume=84 |issue=4 |page=458 foll. |doi=10.1080/00253359.1998.10656717}}</ref> Even so, construction techniques changed only very gradually. The ships of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were still built more or less to the same basic plan as those of the [[Spanish Armada]] of two centuries earlier but there had been numerous subtle improvements in ship design and construction throughout this period. For instance, the introduction of [[tumblehome]]; adjustments to the shapes of sails and hulls; the introduction of the wheel; the introduction of hardened copper fastenings below the waterline; the introduction of copper sheathing as a deterrent to shipworm and fouling; etc.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mccarthy |first1=Michael |year=2005 |title=Ships' Fastenings: From Sewn Boat to Steamship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g273FGUNIFQC |location=College Station |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |page= |isbn=978-1-60344-621-1}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n[[File:Shipbuilding England 1858.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration of some shipbuilding methods in England, 1858]]\n[[File:BT Babbitts Rotary Engine.jpg|thumb|left|Babbitt's [[rotary engine]]]]\nThe industrial revolution made possible the use of new materials and designs that radically altered shipbuilding. [[Iron]] was gradually adopted in ship construction, initially in discrete areas in a wooden hull needing greater strength, (e.g. as deck knees, hanging knees, knee riders and the other sharp joints, ones in which a curved, progressive joint could not be achieved).

Despite her success,  and the great savings in cost and space provided by the iron hull, compared to  a copper sheathed counterpart, there remained problems with fouling due to the adherence of weeds and barnacles. As a result, [[composite construction]] remained the dominant approach where fast ships were required, with wooden timbers laid over an iron frame (''[[Cutty Sark]]'' is a famous example). Later ''Great Britain''{{'}}s iron hull  was sheathed in wood to enable it to  carry a [[Copper sheathing|copper-based sheathing]].  Brunel's {{SS|Great Eastern||2}} represented the next great development in shipbuilding. Built in association with [[John Scott Russell]], it used longitudinal [[wikt:stringer|stringer]]s for strength, inner and outer hulls, and [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] to form multiple watertight compartments. [[Steel]] also supplanted [[wrought iron]] when it became readily available in the latter half of the 19th century, providing great savings when compared with iron in cost and weight. Wood continued to be favored for the decks.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the need for cargo ships was so great that construction time for [[Liberty ship]]s went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. They employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today. The total number of dry-cargo ships built in the United States in a 15-year period just before the war was a grand total of two. During the war, thousands of Liberty ships and [[Victory ship]]s were built, many of them in shipyards that didn't exist before the war. And, they were built by a workforce consisting largely of women and other inexperienced workers who had never seen a ship before (or even the ocean).<ref>Sawyer, L.A. and Mitchell, W. H.

This importance stems from:\n* The large number of [[skilled workers]] required directly by the shipyard, along with supporting industries such as [[steel mills]], railroads and [[engine]] manufacturers; and\n* A nation's need to manufacture and repair its own [[navy]] and vessels that support its [[primary industries]]\n\nHistorically, the industry has suffered from the absence of [[International trade law|global rules]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and a tendency towards ([[Government|state]]-[[Subsidy|supported]]) over-investment due to the fact that shipyards offer a wide range of technologies, employ a significant number of workers, and generate income as the shipbuilding market is [[World economy|global]].\n\n[[Japan]] used shipbuilding in the 1950s and 1960s to rebuild its industrial structure; [[South Korea]] started to make shipbuilding a strategic industry in the 1970s, and China is now in the process of repeating these models with large state-supported investments in this industry. Conversely, Croatia is privatising its shipbuilding industry.\n\nAs a result, the world shipbuilding market suffers from over-capacities, depressed prices (although the industry experienced a price increase in the period 2003\u20132005 due to strong demand for new ships which was in excess of actual cost increases), low profit margins, trade distortions and widespread subsidisation. All efforts to address the problems in the OECD have so far failed, with the 1994 international shipbuilding agreement never entering into force and the 2003\u20132005 round of negotiations being paused in September 2005 after no agreement was possible. After numerous efforts to restart the negotiations these were formally terminated in December 2010.  The OECD's Council Working Party on Shipbuilding (WP6) will continue its efforts to identify and progressively reduce factors that distort the shipbuilding market.\n\nWhere [[Government|state]] [[Subsidy|subsidies]] have been removed and domestic [[industrial policies]] do not provide support in high labor cost countries, shipbuilding has gone into decline. The British shipbuilding industry is a prime example of this with its industries suffering badly from the 1960s. In the early 1970s British yards still had the capacity to build all types and sizes of merchant ships but today they have been reduced to a small number specialising in defence contracts, luxury yachts and repair work. Decline has also occurred in other European countries, although to some extent this has reduced by protective measures and industrial support policies. In the US, the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]] (which places restrictions on the ships that can be used for moving domestic cargoes) has meant that merchant shipbuilding has continued, albeit at a reduced rate, but such protection has failed to penalise shipbuilding inefficiencies. The consequence of this is that contract prices are far higher than those of any other country building oceangoing ships.\n\n===Present day shipbuilding===\n[[South Korea]] is the world's largest shipbuilder, followed by [[People's Republic of China|China]].<ref name=\":3\" /> South Korea's \"big three\" shipbuilders, [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]], [[Samsung Heavy Industries]], and [[Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering]], dominate the global market for large container ships.\n\nThe market share of [[Europe]]an ship builders began to decline in the 1960s as they lost work to Japan in the same way Japan most recently lost their work to China and South Korea. Over the four years from 2007, the total number of employees in the European shipbuilding industry declined from 150,000 to 115,000.<ref name=ifr>[http://www.ijf.hr/upload/files/file/ENG/newsletter/64.pdf Zagreb Institute of Public Finance], Newsletter No. 64, December 2011, {{ISSN|1333-4263}}</ref>  The output of the United States also underwent a similar change.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/05/business/worldbusiness/05iht-ships.html?_r=0| title=Korea reigns in shipbuilding, for now| author=James Brooke| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2005-01-06| accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shipbuilding.or.kr/Report/Foreign/Foreign_Review/Foreign_Review.html |title=\uae30\ud68d\ud2b9\uc9d1/ 1\ub4f1 \uc870\uc120.\ud574\uc591 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc678 \uad6d\uac00\ubcc4 \uc870\uc120\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud604\ud669: 1)\uc77c\ubcf8, \uc911\uad6d, \uc778\ub3c4, \ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8, \ube0c\ub77c\uc9c8, \ud3f4\ub780\ub4dc, \ud130\ud0a4, \ub3c5\uc77c \uc870\uc120\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \uc804\ub9dd/(\uc6d4\uac04 \ud574\uc591\uacfc\uc870\uc120 2008\ub144 11\uc6d4\ud638) |publisher=Shipbuilding.or.kr |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> Key shipbuilders in Europe are Fincantieri, Navantia, Naval Group and BAE Systems.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align=center; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"5\"|'''Global Shipbuilding Industry'''\n|-\n!

Early welded steel ships used steels with inadequate [[fracture toughness]], which resulted in some ships suffering catastrophic [[brittle fracture]] structural cracks (see [[problems of the Liberty ship]]). Since roughly 1950, specialized steels such as [[ABS Steels]] with good properties for ship construction have been used. Although it is commonly accepted that modern steel has eliminated brittle fracture in ships, some controversy still exists.<ref>Drouin, P: \"Brittle Fracture in ships \u2013 a lingering problem\", page 229.

The shipbuilding industry in [[Imperial China]] reached its height during the [[Song Dynasty]], [[Yuan Dynasty]], and early [[Ming Dynasty]]. The mainstay of China's merchant and naval fleets was the [[junk (ship)|junk]], which had existed for centuries, but it was at this time that the large ships based on this design were built. During the Sung period (960\u20131279 AD), the establishment of China's first official standing navy in 1132 AD and the enormous increase in maritime trade abroad (from [[Heian period|Heian]] [[Japan]] to [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]]) allowed the shipbuilding industry in provinces like [[Fujian]] to thrive as never before. The  largest [[seaport]]s in the world were in China and included [[Guangzhou]], [[Quanzhou]], and [[Xiamen]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the Islamic world, shipbuilding thrived at [[Basra]] and [[Alexandria]], the [[dhow]], [[felucca]], [[baghlah]] and the [[sambuk]], became symbols of successful maritime trade around the [[Indian Ocean]]; from the ports of [[East Africa]] to [[Southeast Asia]] and the ports of [[Sindh]] and [[Al-Hind|Hind]] (India) during the [[Abbasid]] period.\n\nAt this time islands spread over vast distances across the [[Pacific Ocean]] were being colonised by the Melanesians and Polynesians, who built giant canoes and progressed to great catamarans.\n\n=== Ming China ===\nShipbuilders in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368~1644) were not the same as the shipbuilders in other Chinese dynasties, due to hundreds of years of accumulated experiences and rapid changes in the Ming dynasty. Basically, shipbuilders in the Ming dynasty mostly work for the government, under command of the [[Ministry of Works (imperial China)|Ministry of Public Works]].\n\n====Early Ming (1368~1476)====\nDuring the early years of the Ming dynasty, the Ming government maintained an open policy towards sailing. Between 1405 and 1433, the government conducted seven diplomatic [[Ming treasure voyages]] to over thirty countries in Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. The voyages were initiated by the [[Yongle Emperor]], and led by the Admiral [[Zheng He]]. Six voyages were conducted under the Yongle Emperor's reign, the last of which returned to China in 1422. After the Yongle Emperor's death in 1424, his successor the [[Hongxi Emperor]] ordered the suspension of the voyages. The seventh and final voyage began in 1430, sent by the [[Xuande Emperor]]. Although the Hongxi and Xuande Emperors did not emphasize sailing as much as the Yongle Emperor, they were not against it. This led to a high degree of commercialization and an increase in trade. Large numbers of ships were built to meet the demand.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=Ming China: Courts and Contacts 1400-1450|last=Clunas|first=Craig|last2=Sally K.

''Shachuan'', or 'sand-ships', are ships used primarily for inland transport.<ref name=\":03\" /> However, in recent years, some researchers agree that the treasure ships were more of the ''Fuchuan'' type. It is said in vol.176 of ''San Guo Bei Meng Hui Bian'' (\u4e09\u671d\u5317\u76df\u6c47\u7f16) that ships made in Fujian are the best ones.<ref name=\":2\" /> Therefore, the best shipbuilders and laborers were brought from these places to support Zheng He's expedition.\n\nThe shipyard was under the command of [[Ministry of Works (imperial China)|Ministry of Public Works]]. The shipbuilders had no control over their lives. The builders, commoner's doctors, cooks and errands had lowest social status.<ref>Chan, Alan Kam-leung, et al. ''Historical Perspectives on East Asian Science, Technology and Medicine''. VII, World Scientific, Singapore University Press, 2003. p. 107</ref> The shipbuilders were forced to move away from their hometown to the shipyards. There were two major ways to enter the shipbuilder occupation: family tradition, or apprenticeship. If a shipbuilder entered the occupation due to family tradition, the shipbuilder learned the techniques of shipbuilding from his family and is very likely to earn a higher status in the shipyard. Additionally, the shipbuilder had access to [[business networking]] that could help to find clients. If a shipbuilder entered the occupation through an apprenticeship, the shipbuilder was likely a farmer before he was hired as a shipbuilder, or he was previously an experienced shipbuilder.\n\nMany shipbuilders working in the shipyard were forced into the occupation. The ships built for Zheng He's voyages needed to be waterproof, solid, safe, and have ample room to carry large amounts of trading goods. Therefore, due to the highly commercialized society that was being encouraged by the expeditions, trades, and government policies, the shipbuilders needed to acquire the skills to build ships that fulfil these requirements.\n\nShipbuilding was not the sole industry utilising Chinese lumber at that time; the new capital was being built in Beijing from approximately 1407 onwards,<ref name=\":03\" /> which required huge amounts of high-quality wood. These two ambitious projects commissioned by Emperor Yongle would have had enormous environmental and economic effects, even if the ships were half the dimensions given in the ''[[History of Ming]]''. Considerable pressure would also have been placed on the infrastructure required to transport the trees from their point of origin to the shipyards.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nShipbuilders were usually divided into different groups and had separate jobs. Some were responsible for fixing old ships; some were responsible for making the keel and some were responsible for building the helm.\n\n* It was the [[keel]] that determined the shape and the structure of the hull of ''Fuchuan'' Ships. The keel is the middle of the bottom of the hull, constructed by connecting three sections; stern keel, main keel and poop keel. The hull spreads in the arc towards both sides forming the keel.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* The [[Ship's wheel|helm]] was the device that controls direction when sailing. It was a critical invention in shipbuilding technique in ancient China and was only used by the Chinese for a fairly long time. With a developing recognition of its function, the shape and configuration of the helm was continually improved by shipbuilders.<ref name=\":2\" /> The shipbuilders not only needed to build the ship according to design, but needed to acquire the skills to improve the ships.\n\n==== Late Ming (1478\u20131644)====\nAfter 1477, the Ming government reversed its open maritime policies, enacting a series of isolationist policies in response to [[wokou|piracy]]. The policies, called ''[[Haijin]]'' (sea ban), lasted until the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644. During this period, Chinese navigation technology did not make any progress and even declined in some aspect.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n===Early modern===\nWith the development of the [[carrack]], the west moved into a new era of ship construction by building the first regular oceangoing vessels. In a relatively short time, these ships grew to an unprecedented size, complexity and cost.\n\nShipyards became large industrial complexes and the ships built were financed by consortia of investors. These considerations led to the documentation of design and construction practices in what had previously been a secretive trade run by master shipwrights, and ultimately led to the field of [[naval architecture]], where professional designers and draftsmen played an increasingly important role.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tipping |first=Colin |date=November 1998 |title=Technical Change and the Ship Draughtsman |journal=The Mariner's Mirror |volume=84 |issue=4 |page=458 foll. |doi=10.1080/00253359.1998.10656717}}</ref> Even so, construction techniques changed only very gradually. The ships of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were still built more or less to the same basic plan as those of the [[Spanish Armada]] of two centuries earlier but there had been numerous subtle improvements in ship design and construction throughout this period. For instance, the introduction of [[tumblehome]]; adjustments to the shapes of sails and hulls; the introduction of the wheel; the introduction of hardened copper fastenings below the waterline; the introduction of copper sheathing as a deterrent to shipworm and fouling; etc.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mccarthy |first1=Michael |year=2005 |title=Ships' Fastenings: From Sewn Boat to Steamship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g273FGUNIFQC |location=College Station |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |page= |isbn=978-1-60344-621-1}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n[[File:Shipbuilding England 1858.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration of some shipbuilding methods in England, 1858]]\n[[File:BT Babbitts Rotary Engine.jpg|thumb|left|Babbitt's [[rotary engine]]]]\nThe industrial revolution made possible the use of new materials and designs that radically altered shipbuilding. [[Iron]] was gradually adopted in ship construction, initially in discrete areas in a wooden hull needing greater strength, (e.g. as deck knees, hanging knees, knee riders and the other sharp joints, ones in which a curved, progressive joint could not be achieved). Then, in the form of plates riveted together and made watertight, it was used to form the hull itself.\n\nSailing ship technology vastly improved during the early Industrial Revolution (between 1760 and 1825), as \"the risk of being wrecked for Atlantic shipping fell by one third, and of foundering by two thirds, reflecting improvements in seaworthiness and navigation respectively.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/t4cms/WP17_11.pdf|title=Technological Dynamism in a Stagnant Sector: Safety at Sea during the Early Industrial Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The improvements in seaworthiness have been credited to \"replacing the traditional stepped deck ship with stronger flushed decked ones derived from [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] designs, and the increasing use of iron reinforcement.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The design originated from [[Bengal]] rice ships,<ref name=\":0\" /> with Bengal being famous for its shipbuilding industry at the time.<ref>{{cite book |author=Indrajit Ray |year=2011 |title=Bengal Industries and the British Industrial Revolution (1757-1857) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHOrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA178 |publisher=Routledge |pages=178, 186\u2013188 |isbn=978-1-136-82552-1}}</ref> One study finds that there were considerable improvements in ship speed from 1750 to 1850: \"we find that average sailing speeds of British ships in moderate to strong winds rose by nearly a third. Driving this steady progress seems to be continuous evolution of sails and rigging, and improved hulls that allowed a greater area of sail to be set safely in a given wind. By contrast, looking at every voyage between the Netherlands and East Indies undertaken by the Dutch East India Company from 1595 to 1795, we find that journey time fell only by 10 per cent, with no improvement in the heavy mortality, averaging six per cent per voyage, of those aboard.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kelly |first1=Morgan |last2=\u00f3 Gr\u00e1da |first2=Cormac |year=2017 |title=Speed under Sail, 1750\u20131830 |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/ucnwpaper/201710.htm |work=Working Papers 201710 |publisher=School of Economics, University College Dublin |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nInitially copying wooden construction traditions with a frame over which the hull was fastened,  [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s {{SS|Great Britain||2}} of 1843 was the first radical new design, being built entirely of wrought iron. Despite her success,  and the great savings in cost and space provided by the iron hull, compared to  a copper sheathed counterpart, there remained problems with fouling due to the adherence of weeds and barnacles. As a result, [[composite construction]] remained the dominant approach where fast ships were required, with wooden timbers laid over an iron frame (''[[Cutty Sark]]'' is a famous example). Later ''Great Britain''{{'}}s iron hull  was sheathed in wood to enable it to  carry a [[Copper sheathing|copper-based sheathing]].  Brunel's {{SS|Great Eastern||2}} represented the next great development in shipbuilding. Built in association with [[John Scott Russell]], it used longitudinal [[wikt:stringer|stringer]]s for strength, inner and outer hulls, and [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] to form multiple watertight compartments. [[Steel]] also supplanted [[wrought iron]] when it became readily available in the latter half of the 19th century, providing great savings when compared with iron in cost and weight. Wood continued to be favored for the decks.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the need for cargo ships was so great that construction time for [[Liberty ship]]s went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. They employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today. The total number of dry-cargo ships built in the United States in a 15-year period just before the war was a grand total of two. During the war, thousands of Liberty ships and [[Victory ship]]s were built, many of them in shipyards that didn't exist before the war. And, they were built by a workforce consisting largely of women and other inexperienced workers who had never seen a ship before (or even the ocean).<ref>Sawyer, L.A. and Mitchell, W. H.

This importance stems from:\n* The large number of [[skilled workers]] required directly by the shipyard, along with supporting industries such as [[steel mills]], railroads and [[engine]] manufacturers; and\n* A nation's need to manufacture and repair its own [[navy]] and vessels that support its [[primary industries]]\n\nHistorically, the industry has suffered from the absence of [[International trade law|global rules]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and a tendency towards ([[Government|state]]-[[Subsidy|supported]]) over-investment due to the fact that shipyards offer a wide range of technologies, employ a significant number of workers, and generate income as the shipbuilding market is [[World economy|global]].\n\n[[Japan]] used shipbuilding in the 1950s and 1960s to rebuild its industrial structure; [[South Korea]] started to make shipbuilding a strategic industry in the 1970s, and China is now in the process of repeating these models with large state-supported investments in this industry. Conversely, Croatia is privatising its shipbuilding industry.\n\nAs a result, the world shipbuilding market suffers from over-capacities, depressed prices (although the industry experienced a price increase in the period 2003\u20132005 due to strong demand for new ships which was in excess of actual cost increases), low profit margins, trade distortions and widespread subsidisation. All efforts to address the problems in the OECD have so far failed, with the 1994 international shipbuilding agreement never entering into force and the 2003\u20132005 round of negotiations being paused in September 2005 after no agreement was possible. After numerous efforts to restart the negotiations these were formally terminated in December 2010.  The OECD's Council Working Party on Shipbuilding (WP6) will continue its efforts to identify and progressively reduce factors that distort the shipbuilding market.\n\nWhere [[Government|state]] [[Subsidy|subsidies]] have been removed and domestic [[industrial policies]] do not provide support in high labor cost countries, shipbuilding has gone into decline. The British shipbuilding industry is a prime example of this with its industries suffering badly from the 1960s. In the early 1970s British yards still had the capacity to build all types and sizes of merchant ships but today they have been reduced to a small number specialising in defence contracts, luxury yachts and repair work. Decline has also occurred in other European countries, although to some extent this has reduced by protective measures and industrial support policies. In the US, the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]] (which places restrictions on the ships that can be used for moving domestic cargoes) has meant that merchant shipbuilding has continued, albeit at a reduced rate, but such protection has failed to penalise shipbuilding inefficiencies. The consequence of this is that contract prices are far higher than those of any other country building oceangoing ships.\n\n===Present day shipbuilding===\n[[South Korea]] is the world's largest shipbuilder, followed by [[People's Republic of China|China]].<ref name=\":3\" /> South Korea's \"big three\" shipbuilders, [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]], [[Samsung Heavy Industries]], and [[Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering]], dominate the global market for large container ships.\n\nThe market share of [[Europe]]an ship builders began to decline in the 1960s as they lost work to Japan in the same way Japan most recently lost their work to China and South Korea. Over the four years from 2007, the total number of employees in the European shipbuilding industry declined from 150,000 to 115,000.<ref name=ifr>[http://www.ijf.hr/upload/files/file/ENG/newsletter/64.pdf Zagreb Institute of Public Finance], Newsletter No. 64, December 2011, {{ISSN|1333-4263}}</ref>  The output of the United States also underwent a similar change.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/05/business/worldbusiness/05iht-ships.html?_r=0| title=Korea reigns in shipbuilding, for now| author=James Brooke| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2005-01-06| accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shipbuilding.or.kr/Report/Foreign/Foreign_Review/Foreign_Review.html |title=\uae30\ud68d\ud2b9\uc9d1/ 1\ub4f1 \uc870\uc120.\ud574\uc591 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc678 \uad6d\uac00\ubcc4 \uc870\uc120\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud604\ud669: 1)\uc77c\ubcf8, \uc911\uad6d, \uc778\ub3c4, \ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8, \ube0c\ub77c\uc9c8, \ud3f4\ub780\ub4dc, \ud130\ud0a4, \ub3c5\uc77c \uc870\uc120\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \uc804\ub9dd/(\uc6d4\uac04 \ud574\uc591\uacfc\uc870\uc120 2008\ub144 11\uc6d4\ud638) |publisher=Shipbuilding.or.kr |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> Key shipbuilders in Europe are Fincantieri, Navantia, Naval Group and BAE Systems.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align=center; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"5\"|'''Global Shipbuilding Industry'''\n|-\n!

Entire multi-deck segments of the hull or [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] will be built elsewhere in the yard, transported to the building dock or slipway, then lifted into place. This is known as \"block construction\". The most modern shipyards pre-install equipment, pipes, electrical cables, and any other components within the blocks, to minimize the effort needed to assemble or install components deep within the hull once it is welded together. {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nShip design work, also called [[naval architecture]], may be conducted using a [[ship model basin]]. Previously, loftsmen at the [[mould loft]]s of [[shipyard]]s were responsible for taking the dimensions, and details from drawings and plans and translating this information into templates, battens, ordinates, cutting sketches, profiles, margins and other data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leithshipyards.com/mould-loft/lofting.html|title=The Mould Loft|publisher=The Loftsman|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728185517/http://www.leithshipyards.com/mould-loft/lofting.html|archivedate=28 July 2016}}</ref> However, since the early 1970s [[computer-aided design]] became normal for the shipbuilding design and lofting process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leithshipyards.com/mould-loft/computer-aided-design.html#|title=CAD-Computer Aided Design|publisher=The Loftsman|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802025720/http://www.leithshipyards.com/mould-loft/computer-aided-design.html|archivedate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nModern ships, since roughly 1940, have been produced almost exclusively of [[welding|welded]] steel. Early welded steel ships used steels with inadequate [[fracture toughness]], which resulted in some ships suffering catastrophic [[brittle fracture]] structural cracks (see [[problems of the Liberty ship]]). Since roughly 1950, specialized steels such as [[ABS Steels]] with good properties for ship construction have been used. Although it is commonly accepted that modern steel has eliminated brittle fracture in ships, some controversy still exists.<ref>Drouin, P: \"Brittle Fracture in ships \u2013 a lingering problem\", page 229. Ships and Offshore Structures, Woodhead Publishing, 2006.</ref> Brittle fracture of modern vessels continues to occur from time to time because grade A and grade B steel of unknown toughness or fracture appearance transition temperature (FATT) in ships' side shells can be less than adequate for all ambient conditions.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Transportation Safety Board of Canada| url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/marine/2002/m02l0021/m02l0021.asp| title=Marine Investigation Report \u2013 Hull Fracture Bulk Carrier Lake Carling| date=19 March 2002| accessdate=8 October 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015204241/http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/marine/2002/m02l0021/m02l0021.asp| archivedate=15 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Ship repair industry===\n[[File:Haj\u00f3gy\u00e1r1.JPG|thumb|River shipyard in [[Kom\u00e1rno]] ([[Slovakia]]).]]\nAll ships need repair work at some point in their working lives.
