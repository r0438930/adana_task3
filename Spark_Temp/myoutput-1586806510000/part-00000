The character's [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|age was accelerated]] from a toddler between seasons for plotting purposes. By the time she was 12, Johnson had been in the casts of eight TV series. She later reprised her role as Chrissy in ''[[The Growing Pains Movie]]'' and ''[[Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers]]''. In the one season series ''[[Phenom (TV series)|Phenom]]'' (1993\u201394), she played the mischievous younger sister of a rising teenage tennis star. Johnson appeared in the 1994 sitcom ''[[All-American Girl (1994 TV series)|All-American Girl]]'', which also lasted for only one season. She played DJ's overbearing girlfriend Lisa in the 1995 ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' episode \"The Blaming of the Shrew\".  During the 1995\u20131996 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] lineup, she played Gracie Wallace in the sitcom ''[[Maybe This Time (TV series)|Maybe This Time]]'' as the daughter of [[Marie Osmond]] and granddaughter of [[Betty White]] and love interest of [[Dane Cook]].

She was intended to appear in future films as his newest love interest (as implied in a brief scene in the film), but that plan was shelved and instead actress [[Emily VanCamp]]'s [[Sharon Carter]] character became involved with Rogers. Although her role was minor, the [[Blu-ray]] edition of ''The Avengers'' contains some deleted scenes that expand her role in the movie and further her interactions with Rogers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2012/08/the-avengers-deleted-scene-sees-captain.html|website=Flickeringmyth.com|title=The Avengers deleted scene sees Captain America as a man out of time|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/former-growing-pains-child-star-small-important-avengers-172437386.html|website=Movies.yahoo.com|title=Former 'Growing Pains' child star has small-but-important 'Avengers' role|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs a voice actress, she played Sean on the cartoon movie ''[[The First Snow of Winter]]'' in the US version in 1998, Gretchen Grundler on the [[Walt Disney Television|Walt Disney TV]] animated series ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series during the show's second and fifth season, Jinmay Rayfield in ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]'' and [[List of characters in Ben 10#Gwen Tennyson|Gwen Tennyson]] on ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]'' and in future variations of the ''[[Ben 10]]'' franchise.

She later reprised her role as Chrissy in ''[[The Growing Pains Movie]]'' and ''[[Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers]]''. In the one season series ''[[Phenom (TV series)|Phenom]]'' (1993\u201394), she played the mischievous younger sister of a rising teenage tennis star.

She was intended to appear in future films as his newest love interest (as implied in a brief scene in the film), but that plan was shelved and instead actress [[Emily VanCamp]]'s [[Sharon Carter]] character became involved with Rogers. Although her role was minor, the [[Blu-ray]] edition of ''The Avengers'' contains some deleted scenes that expand her role in the movie and further her interactions with Rogers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2012/08/the-avengers-deleted-scene-sees-captain.html|website=Flickeringmyth.com|title=The Avengers deleted scene sees Captain America as a man out of time|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/former-growing-pains-child-star-small-important-avengers-172437386.html|website=Movies.yahoo.com|title=Former 'Growing Pains' child star has small-but-important 'Avengers' role|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs a voice actress, she played Sean on the cartoon movie ''[[The First Snow of Winter]]'' in the US version in 1998, Gretchen Grundler on the [[Walt Disney Television|Walt Disney TV]] animated series ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series during the show's second and fifth season, Jinmay Rayfield in ''[[Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!]]'' and [[List of characters in Ben 10#Gwen Tennyson|Gwen Tennyson]] on ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]'' and in future variations of the ''[[Ben 10]]'' franchise.
