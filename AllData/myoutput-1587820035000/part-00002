Medeiros]</ref>\n\nThese modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro-gallic compounds and are also more likely to have a formulation which is [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometrically]] optimised. Historical inks often contained excess acid which was not consumed in the oxidation of the ferro-gallic compounds. Modern formulations also tend to use [[hydrochloric acid]] whereas many historical inks used [[sulfuric acid]]. Hydrochloric acid is a gas in solution, which will evaporate. As a result, modern fountain pen iron gall inks are less likely to damage paper than historical inks and are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still cause problems if left in a pen for a long period. Manufacturers or retailers of modern iron gall inks intended for fountain pens sometimes advise a more thorough than usual cleaning regimen \u2013 which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water \u2013 to avoid clogging or corrosion on delicate pen parts. For more thoroughly cleaning iron gall ink out of a fountain pen, sequential flushes of the pen with water, diluted vinegar or citric acid (to flush out residual iron gall compounds), water, diluted ammonia (if needed to flush out residual colour dye stains), then finally water are often recommended.\n\nThe colour [[dye]] in these modern iron gall formulas functions as a temporary colourant to make these inks clearly visible whilst writing. The ferro-gallic compounds through a gradual oxidation process cause an observable gradual colour change to grey/black whilst these inks completely dry and makes the writing waterproof. The colour-changing property of the ink also depends on the [[paper chemicals|properties]] of the used paper. In general, the darkening process will progress more quickly and visibly on papers containing relatively high [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching agent residues]].\n\nThough not in mainstream 21st-century use like dye-based [[fountain pen ink]]s, modern iron gall inks are still used in fountain pens where permanence is required. In the United Kingdom the use of special blue-black archival quality Registrars' Ink containing ferro-gallic compounds is required in [[register office]]s for official documents such as [[birth certificate]]s, [[marriage certificate]]s, [[death certificate]]s and on clergy rolls and ships' [[logbook]]s.<ref>[http://www.registrarsink.co.uk/about.html Registrars' Ink]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog11b.shtml Henry 'Inky' Stephens \u2013 the inventor of blue-black ink (Stephens Blue-Black Registrar's Ink) at BBC Radio 4]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408482/APsGuideFebruary15final.pdf A Guide for Authorised Persons, HM Passport Office, General Register Office, Issued: 2012, Last Updated: February 2015, Registration stock, 1.18, Page 5]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408375/GuidebookClergyFeb15final.pdf Guidebook for The Clergy, HM Passport Office, General Register Office, Issued: 2011, Last Updated: February 2015, Ink, 1.9, Page 7]</ref><br>\nIn Germany the use of special blue or black ''urkunden- oder dokumentenechte Tinte'' or documentary use permanent inks is required in ''notariellen Urkunden'' ([[Civil law notary]] [[legal instrument]]s).<ref>[http://www.bnotk.de/Notar/Berufsrecht/DONot.php Dienstordnung f\u00fcr Notarinnen und Notare (DONot), Abschnitt Herstellung der notariellen Urkunden \u00a7 29 {{in lang|de}}]</ref>\n\n=== German regulation for ''Urkundentinte'' inks (1933) ===\n* In a litre of ink there must be at least 27&nbsp;g of tannic acid and gallic acid, and at least 4&nbsp;g of iron content.

Medeiros]</ref>\n\nThese modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro-gallic compounds and are also more likely to have a formulation which is [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometrically]] optimised. Historical inks often contained excess acid which was not consumed in the oxidation of the ferro-gallic compounds. Modern formulations also tend to use [[hydrochloric acid]] whereas many historical inks used [[sulfuric acid]]. Hydrochloric acid is a gas in solution, which will evaporate. As a result, modern fountain pen iron gall inks are less likely to damage paper than historical inks and are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still cause problems if left in a pen for a long period. Manufacturers or retailers of modern iron gall inks intended for fountain pens sometimes advise a more thorough than usual cleaning regimen \u2013 which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water \u2013 to avoid clogging or corrosion on delicate pen parts. For more thoroughly cleaning iron gall ink out of a fountain pen, sequential flushes of the pen with water, diluted vinegar or citric acid (to flush out residual iron gall compounds), water, diluted ammonia (if needed to flush out residual colour dye stains), then finally water are often recommended.\n\nThe colour [[dye]] in these modern iron gall formulas functions as a temporary colourant to make these inks clearly visible whilst writing. The ferro-gallic compounds through a gradual oxidation process cause an observable gradual colour change to grey/black whilst these inks completely dry and makes the writing waterproof. The colour-changing property of the ink also depends on the [[paper chemicals|properties]] of the used paper. In general, the darkening process will progress more quickly and visibly on papers containing relatively high [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching agent residues]].\n\nThough not in mainstream 21st-century use like dye-based [[fountain pen ink]]s, modern iron gall inks are still used in fountain pens where permanence is required. In the United Kingdom the use of special blue-black archival quality Registrars' Ink containing ferro-gallic compounds is required in [[register office]]s for official documents such as [[birth certificate]]s, [[marriage certificate]]s, [[death certificate]]s and on clergy rolls and ships' [[logbook]]s.<ref>[http://www.registrarsink.co.uk/about.html Registrars' Ink]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog11b.shtml Henry 'Inky' Stephens \u2013 the inventor of blue-black ink (Stephens Blue-Black Registrar's Ink) at BBC Radio 4]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408482/APsGuideFebruary15final.pdf A Guide for Authorised Persons, HM Passport Office, General Register Office, Issued: 2012, Last Updated: February 2015, Registration stock, 1.18, Page 5]</ref><ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408375/GuidebookClergyFeb15final.pdf Guidebook for The Clergy, HM Passport Office, General Register Office, Issued: 2011, Last Updated: February 2015, Ink, 1.9, Page 7]</ref><br>\nIn Germany the use of special blue or black ''urkunden- oder dokumentenechte Tinte'' or documentary use permanent inks is required in ''notariellen Urkunden'' ([[Civil law notary]] [[legal instrument]]s).<ref>[http://www.bnotk.de/Notar/Berufsrecht/DONot.php Dienstordnung f\u00fcr Notarinnen und Notare (DONot), Abschnitt Herstellung der notariellen Urkunden \u00a7 29 {{in lang|de}}]</ref>\n\n=== German regulation for ''Urkundentinte'' inks (1933) ===\n* In a litre of ink there must be at least 27&nbsp;g of tannic acid and gallic acid, and at least 4&nbsp;g of iron content.
