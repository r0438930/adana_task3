Her novels are known for their wit and intelligence, and one in particular is scathingly autobiographical in describing her unhappy childhood.\n\nShe was born into an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family from [[Ulster]] at 4 Hans Crescent in [[Knightsbridge]], her parents' London home. She was, she admitted, \"scantily educated\" at, among other schools, [[Rockport School]] ([[County Down]]) and [[Downham, Essex|Downham]] ([[Essex]]). After a [[finishing school]] in [[Oxford]] she was presented as a [[debutante]] in 1949 at a ball held at [[Londonderry House]].\n\n==Career==\nBlackwood's first job was with [[Hulton Press]] as a secretary, but she was soon given small reporting jobs by [[Claud Cockburn]]. [[Ann Fleming]], the wife of \"[[James Bond]]\" author [[Ian Fleming]], introduced Lady Caroline to [[Lucian Freud]], and the two eloped to Paris in 1952. In Paris she met [[Picasso]] (and reportedly refused to wash for three days after he drew on her hands and nails). She married Freud on 9 December 1953 and became a striking figure in London's bohemian circles; the [[Gargoyle Club]] and [[Colony Room]] replaced [[Belgravia]] [[drawing room]]s as her haunts. She sat for several of Freud's finest portraits, including ''Girl in Bed'', which testifies to her alluring beauty. She was impressed by the ruthless vision of Freud and [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and her later fiction was a literary version of their view of humanity.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Blackwood began contributing to ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'', ''[[The London Magazine#1954.E2.80.93present|London Magazine]]'', and other periodicals on subjects such as [[beatniks]], [[the Troubles|Ulster sectarianism]], [[political_theatre#feminist_theatre|feminist theatre]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Free school movement|free schools]]. Although these articles were elegant, minutely observed and sometimes wickedly funny, they had, according to [[Christopher Isherwood]], a persistent flaw: \"she is only capable of thinking negatively.

He encouraged her to write her first book, ''For All That I Found There'' (1973), the title of which is a line from the [[Percy French]] song \"The Mountains of Mourne\", and which includes a mordant memoir of her daughter's treatment in a burns unit. Blackwood's first novel ''The Stepdaughter'' (1976) appeared three years later to much acclaim, and is a concise and gripping monologue by a rich, self-pitying woman deserted by her husband in a plush New York apartment and tormented by her fat stepdaughter. It won the [[David Higham Prize]] for best first novel. ''Great Granny Webster''  followed in 1977 and was partly derived on her own miserable childhood, and depicted an austere and loveless old woman's destructive impact on her daughter and granddaughter. It was short-listed for the [[Booker Prize]].\n\nIn 1980 came ''The Last of the Duchess'', a study of the relations between the [[Duchess of Windsor]] and her cunning lawyer, [[Suzanne Blum (lawyer)|Suzanne Blum]]; it could not be published until after Blum's death in 1995. Her third novel ''The Fate of Mary Rose'' (1981) describes the effect on a Kent village of the rape and torture of a ten-year-old girl named Maureen and is narrated by a selfish historian whose obsessions destroy his domestic life. After this came a collection of five short stories, ''Good Night Sweet Ladies'' (1983), followed by her final novel, ''Corrigan'' (1984), which was the least successful and depicts the effects on a depressed widow of a charming, energetic but sinister cripple who erupts into her life.\n\nBlackwood's later books were based on interviews and vignettes, including ''On The Perimeter'' (1984), which focused her attentions on the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]] at [[RAF Greenham Common]] in [[Berkshire]], and ''In The Pink'' (1987), which was a reflective, ghoulish book looking at the hunting and the [[hunt saboteur]] fraternities and exposed the many obsessive personalities of both fox-hunters and [[animal rights]] activists.\n\n==Personal life==\nBlackwood's marriage to Lucian Freud disintegrated soon after they married in 1953; it was dissolved in 1958, in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 1957, Blackwood moved to New York City and studied acting at the [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting|Stella Adler school]].

They lived in London and at [[Milgate House, Thurnham|Milgate House]] in Kent. The sequence of poems in Lowell's ''The Dolphin'' (1973) provides a disrupted narrative of his involvement with Blackwood and the birth of their son (Lowell's friend [[Elizabeth Bishop]] strongly advised Lowell not to publish the book, advice he ignored).\n\nLowell suffered from [[bipolar disorder]], and his manic episodes prompted in Blackwood distress, confusion, feelings of uselessness, and fear about the effects on their children.
