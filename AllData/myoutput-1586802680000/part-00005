Its history goes back to the building of a Roman fort called [[Concangis]]. This Roman fort is the \"Chester\" (from the Latin ''[[castra]]'') of the town's name; the \"Street\" refers to the paved Roman road that ran north\u2013south through the town, and which is now called Front Street.\n\nChester-le-Street is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} south of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} west of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the [[River Wear]]. The parish church of [[St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street|St Mary and St Cuthbert]] is where the body of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St Cuthbert]] remained for 112 years before being transferred to [[Durham Cathedral]], and the site of the first translation of the [[Gospels]] into English, [[Aldred the Scribe|Aldred]] writing the Old English [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]] between the lines of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 339\u201340</ref>\n\nA [[market town]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|title=Towns in County Durham: Chester-le-Street|accessdate=13 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328011245/http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the town holds markets Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nFrom 1894 until 2009 the town had its own local government district. Originally from 1894, this was the [[Chester-le-Street Rural District]], which covered the town and several outlying villages. In 1909 the inner part of the Rural District was separated out to form the new Chester-le-Street Urban District Council, which covered the town as it was at that time. By 1974, however, the town of Chester-le-Street had expanded far beyond the boundary of the Urban District and during that year's Local Government reorganisation, the Urban District was amalgamated with parts of the remaining Rural District to form the new [[Chester-le-Street (district)|Chester-le-Street District]]. The Chester-le-Street District Council was abolished in 2009 when County Durham became a unitary authority as part of the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/newsediting/1884450.Unitary_authority_for_County_Durham_confirmed|title=Unitary authority for County Durham confirmed|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6915882.stm|title=Durham unitary authority approved|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> a move that was controversial at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/1436760.Public_misled_over_unitary_authority_support___claim\n|title=Public misled over unitary authority support \u2013 claim|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6767917.stm|title=Thumbs down for unitary authority|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThere is evidence of [[Iron Age]] use of the [[River Wear]] near the town,<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 6</ref> but the history of Chester-le-Street starts with the Roman fort of [[Concangis]]. This was built alongside the Roman road [[Cade's Road]] (now Front Street) and close to the River Wear, around 100 A.D., and was occupied till the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D. At the time the Wear was navigable to at least Concangis, and may also have provided food for the garrisons stationed there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 45\u201392</ref>\n\nAfter the Romans left there is no record of who lived there (apart from some wounded soldiers from wars who had to live there), until 883 when a group of monks, driven out of [[Lindisfarne]] seven years earlier, stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them. While they were there the town was the centre of Christianity for much of the northeast, because it was the seat of the [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], making the church a cathedral. There the monks translated into English the Lindisfarne Gospels, which they had brought with them. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in 995 for the safer and more permanent home at Durham.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 337\u201340</ref>  The title has been revived as the Roman Catholic [[titular see]] of [[Cuncacestre]].\n\nThe church was rebuilt in stone in 1054, and despite the loss of its [[Diocese|bishopric]] seems to have retained a degree of wealth and influence. In 1080 most of the huts in the town were burned and many people killed in retaliation for the death of [[William Walcher]], the first [[prince-bishop]], at the hands of an English mob. After this devastation wrought by the [[Normans]] the region was left out of the [[Domesday Book]]; there was little left to record, and the region was by then being run from Durham by the prince-bishops so held little interest for London.<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 354</ref>\n\nCade's Road did not fall out of use but was hidden beneath later roads which became the Great North Road, the main route from London and the south to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]]. The town's location on the road played a significant role in its development, as well as its name, as [[Public house#Inns|inn]]s sprang up to cater for the travelling trade: both riders and horses needed to rest on journeys usually taking days to complete. This trade reached a peak in the early 19th century as more and more people and new mail services were carried by [[stagecoach]], before falling off with the coming of the railways. The town was bypassed when the [[A167]] was routed around the town, and this was later supplanted by the faster [[A1(M)]].<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 16</ref>\n\nThe coal industry also left its mark on the town. From the late 17th century onwards coal was dug in increasing quantities in the region. Mining was centred around the rivers, for transportation by sea to other parts of the country, and Chester-le-Street was at the centre of the coal being dug and shipped away down the Wear, so a centre of coal related communication and commerce. At the same time the growth of the mines and the influx of miners supported local businesses, not just the many inns but new shops and services, themselves bringing in more people to work in them. These people would later work in new industries established in the town to take advantage of its good communications and access to raw materials.<ref>Selkirk (2001) pp. 391\u2013427</ref>\n\nOne of the most tragic episodes in the town's history and that of the coal industry in NE England occurred during a miners' strike during the winter of 1811/12.<ref>William Page, ''The Victorian History of the County of Durham'' 3 volumes (London, 1907), vol II, p. 153</ref> Collieries owned by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral were brought to a standstill by the strike, causing much hardship amongst the people of the town. The strike was broken on New Year's Day, 1 January 1812, when the Bishop of Durham, [[Shute Barrington]], sent a detachment of troops from Durham Castle to force a return to work. It is thought that this uncharacteristic act by Barrington was due to pressure from the national government in Westminster who were concerned that the strike was affecting industrial output of essential armaments for the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===The Jarrow March===\nOn the evening of 5 October 1936 the [[Jarrow March]]ers stopped at the town centre after their first day's walk. The church hall was used to house them before they continued onward the following day.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jarrow crusade: protest and legend|author=Matt Perry|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LVKyAAAAIAAJ|isbn=1-873757-60-3|year=2005|page=31}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Romans called their fort ''Concangis'' or ''Concagium'', a Latinisation of the [[Celts|Celtic]] name for the area, which also gave name to the waterway through the town, [[Cong Burn]]. The precise name is uncertain as it does not appear in Roman records, but ''Concangis'' is the name most cited today.<ref>Selkirk (2001) p. 45</ref><ref>Purdon (1992) p. 8</ref> Although a meaning \"Place of the horse people\" has been given,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} scholarly authorities consider the meaning of the name obscure.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html|title=Fox\u2014The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html|title=Fox\u2014P-Celtic Place-Names\u2014Appendix|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Old English]] forms of the name include ''Cuneceastra''<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 10</ref> and ''Conceastre'',<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 337</ref> which takes its first two syllables from the Roman name, with the addition of the Old English word ''ceaster'' 'Roman fortification'.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\"/> This was shortened over time to Chester, the name used locally for the town ([[Latin]]ised as ''Cestria'').<ref group=\"nb\">For example the old bell in St Mary and St Cuthbert is inscribed in Latin {{quote|{{smallcaps|Magister Robertus Aschbern, Decanus Cestriae, me fecit. Hac campana data Cuthbertus sic cocitata}}<br>Master Robert Ashburn, Dean of Chester, made me. This bell given is thus named Cuthbert}}</ref> But \"Chester\" is a common name for towns in England, and in the Middle Ages \"Street\", for the Roman road, was added. The Universal etymological English dictionary of 1749 gives the town as \"Chester upon Street\" (and describes it as \"a Village in the Bishoprick of Durham\").<ref>{{cite book|title=An universal etymological English dictionary|author=Bailey, Nathan|year=1749|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UucIAAAAQAAJ|page=168}}</ref> At some point this was shortened to the modern form.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:ChesterleStreetFlood.JPG|thumb|Flooding on Front Street in 2007]]\n\nThe town has a mild climate and gets well below average rainfall relative to the UK. It does though experience occasional [[flood]]s. To the east of the town lies the Riverside cricket ground and [[Riverside Park (Chester-le-Street)|Riverside Park]]. They were built on the flood plains of the River Wear, and are often flooded when the river bursts its banks. The town centre is subject to occasional [[flash flooding]], usually after very heavy rain over the town and surrounding areas, if the rain falls too quickly for it to be drained away by Cong Burn. The flooding occurs at the bottom of Front Street where the Cong Burn passes under the street, after it was enclosed in concrete in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|title=The Great Flood|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024092636/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml|title=Market Refurbishment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024014620/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml| archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:St Mary and St Cuthbert's Church, Chester-le-Street, County Durham.jpg|thumb|left|Parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert]]\n\n[[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described Chester-le-Street in the 1530s as \"Chiefly one main street of very mean building in height.\", a sentiment echoed by [[Daniel Defoe]].\n\n===St Mary and St Cuthbert church===\n{{main| St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street}}\nSt Mary and St Cuthbert church possesses a rare surviving anchorage, one of the best-preserved in the country.

It was occupied by six anchorites from 1383 to c. 1538, and is now a museum known as the Anker's House. The north aisle is occupied by a line of Lumley family effigies, only five genuine, assembled circa 1590. Some have been chopped off to fit and resemble a casualty station at Agincourt, according to [[Sir Simon Jenkins]] in his ''England's Thousand Best Churches''.

However, when the Gateshead-Newcastle Western Bypass of the [[A1(M)]] was opened, many roads in this area were renumbered, following the convention that roads originating between single digit A roads take their first digit from the single digit A road in an anticlockwise direction from their point of origin, and Newcastle Road, which was formerly designated [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], is now unclassified.

Its history goes back to the building of a Roman fort called [[Concangis]]. This Roman fort is the \"Chester\" (from the Latin ''[[castra]]'') of the town's name; the \"Street\" refers to the paved Roman road that ran north\u2013south through the town, and which is now called Front Street.\n\nChester-le-Street is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} south of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} west of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the [[River Wear]]. The parish church of [[St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street|St Mary and St Cuthbert]] is where the body of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St Cuthbert]] remained for 112 years before being transferred to [[Durham Cathedral]], and the site of the first translation of the [[Gospels]] into English, [[Aldred the Scribe|Aldred]] writing the Old English [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]] between the lines of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 339\u201340</ref>\n\nA [[market town]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|title=Towns in County Durham: Chester-le-Street|accessdate=13 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328011245/http://www.4durhamcounty.co.uk/towns.php?town=Chester-le-Street|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the town holds markets Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nFrom 1894 until 2009 the town had its own local government district. Originally from 1894, this was the [[Chester-le-Street Rural District]], which covered the town and several outlying villages. In 1909 the inner part of the Rural District was separated out to form the new Chester-le-Street Urban District Council, which covered the town as it was at that time. By 1974, however, the town of Chester-le-Street had expanded far beyond the boundary of the Urban District and during that year's Local Government reorganisation, the Urban District was amalgamated with parts of the remaining Rural District to form the new [[Chester-le-Street (district)|Chester-le-Street District]]. The Chester-le-Street District Council was abolished in 2009 when County Durham became a unitary authority as part of the [[2009 structural changes to local government in England]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/newsediting/1884450.Unitary_authority_for_County_Durham_confirmed|title=Unitary authority for County Durham confirmed|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6915882.stm|title=Durham unitary authority approved|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> a move that was controversial at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/1436760.Public_misled_over_unitary_authority_support___claim\n|title=Public misled over unitary authority support \u2013 claim|accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6767917.stm|title=Thumbs down for unitary authority|accessdate=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThere is evidence of [[Iron Age]] use of the [[River Wear]] near the town,<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 6</ref> but the history of Chester-le-Street starts with the Roman fort of [[Concangis]]. This was built alongside the Roman road [[Cade's Road]] (now Front Street) and close to the River Wear, around 100 A.D., and was occupied till the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D. At the time the Wear was navigable to at least Concangis, and may also have provided food for the garrisons stationed there.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 45\u201392</ref>\n\nAfter the Romans left there is no record of who lived there (apart from some wounded soldiers from wars who had to live there), until 883 when a group of monks, driven out of [[Lindisfarne]] seven years earlier, stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them. While they were there the town was the centre of Christianity for much of the northeast, because it was the seat of the [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], making the church a cathedral. There the monks translated into English the Lindisfarne Gospels, which they had brought with them. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in 995 for the safer and more permanent home at Durham.<ref>Selkirk (2000) pp. 337\u201340</ref>  The title has been revived as the Roman Catholic [[titular see]] of [[Cuncacestre]].\n\nThe church was rebuilt in stone in 1054, and despite the loss of its [[Diocese|bishopric]] seems to have retained a degree of wealth and influence. In 1080 most of the huts in the town were burned and many people killed in retaliation for the death of [[William Walcher]], the first [[prince-bishop]], at the hands of an English mob. After this devastation wrought by the [[Normans]] the region was left out of the [[Domesday Book]]; there was little left to record, and the region was by then being run from Durham by the prince-bishops so held little interest for London.<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 354</ref>\n\nCade's Road did not fall out of use but was hidden beneath later roads which became the Great North Road, the main route from London and the south to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]]. The town's location on the road played a significant role in its development, as well as its name, as [[Public house#Inns|inn]]s sprang up to cater for the travelling trade: both riders and horses needed to rest on journeys usually taking days to complete. This trade reached a peak in the early 19th century as more and more people and new mail services were carried by [[stagecoach]], before falling off with the coming of the railways. The town was bypassed when the [[A167]] was routed around the town, and this was later supplanted by the faster [[A1(M)]].<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 16</ref>\n\nThe coal industry also left its mark on the town. From the late 17th century onwards coal was dug in increasing quantities in the region. Mining was centred around the rivers, for transportation by sea to other parts of the country, and Chester-le-Street was at the centre of the coal being dug and shipped away down the Wear, so a centre of coal related communication and commerce. At the same time the growth of the mines and the influx of miners supported local businesses, not just the many inns but new shops and services, themselves bringing in more people to work in them. These people would later work in new industries established in the town to take advantage of its good communications and access to raw materials.<ref>Selkirk (2001) pp. 391\u2013427</ref>\n\nOne of the most tragic episodes in the town's history and that of the coal industry in NE England occurred during a miners' strike during the winter of 1811/12.<ref>William Page, ''The Victorian History of the County of Durham'' 3 volumes (London, 1907), vol II, p. 153</ref> Collieries owned by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral were brought to a standstill by the strike, causing much hardship amongst the people of the town. The strike was broken on New Year's Day, 1 January 1812, when the Bishop of Durham, [[Shute Barrington]], sent a detachment of troops from Durham Castle to force a return to work. It is thought that this uncharacteristic act by Barrington was due to pressure from the national government in Westminster who were concerned that the strike was affecting industrial output of essential armaments for the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===The Jarrow March===\nOn the evening of 5 October 1936 the [[Jarrow March]]ers stopped at the town centre after their first day's walk. The church hall was used to house them before they continued onward the following day.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jarrow crusade: protest and legend|author=Matt Perry|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LVKyAAAAIAAJ|isbn=1-873757-60-3|year=2005|page=31}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Romans called their fort ''Concangis'' or ''Concagium'', a Latinisation of the [[Celts|Celtic]] name for the area, which also gave name to the waterway through the town, [[Cong Burn]]. The precise name is uncertain as it does not appear in Roman records, but ''Concangis'' is the name most cited today.<ref>Selkirk (2001) p. 45</ref><ref>Purdon (1992) p. 8</ref> Although a meaning \"Place of the horse people\" has been given,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} scholarly authorities consider the meaning of the name obscure.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html|title=Fox\u2014The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html|title=Fox\u2014P-Celtic Place-Names\u2014Appendix|website=www.heroicage.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Old English]] forms of the name include ''Cuneceastra''<ref>Purdon (1992) p. 10</ref> and ''Conceastre'',<ref>Selkirk (2000) p. 337</ref> which takes its first two syllables from the Roman name, with the addition of the Old English word ''ceaster'' 'Roman fortification'.<ref name=\"heroicage.org\"/> This was shortened over time to Chester, the name used locally for the town ([[Latin]]ised as ''Cestria'').<ref group=\"nb\">For example the old bell in St Mary and St Cuthbert is inscribed in Latin {{quote|{{smallcaps|Magister Robertus Aschbern, Decanus Cestriae, me fecit.

This bell given is thus named Cuthbert}}</ref> But \"Chester\" is a common name for towns in England, and in the Middle Ages \"Street\", for the Roman road, was added. The Universal etymological English dictionary of 1749 gives the town as \"Chester upon Street\" (and describes it as \"a Village in the Bishoprick of Durham\").<ref>{{cite book|title=An universal etymological English dictionary|author=Bailey, Nathan|year=1749|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UucIAAAAQAAJ|page=168}}</ref> At some point this was shortened to the modern form.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:ChesterleStreetFlood.JPG|thumb|Flooding on Front Street in 2007]]\n\nThe town has a mild climate and gets well below average rainfall relative to the UK. It does though experience occasional [[flood]]s. To the east of the town lies the Riverside cricket ground and [[Riverside Park (Chester-le-Street)|Riverside Park]]. They were built on the flood plains of the River Wear, and are often flooded when the river bursts its banks. The town centre is subject to occasional [[flash flooding]], usually after very heavy rain over the town and surrounding areas, if the rain falls too quickly for it to be drained away by Cong Burn. The flooding occurs at the bottom of Front Street where the Cong Burn passes under the street, after it was enclosed in concrete in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|title=The Great Flood|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024092636/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page17.phtml|archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml|title=Market Refurbishment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024014620/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page25.phtml| archivedate=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:St Mary and St Cuthbert's Church, Chester-le-Street, County Durham.jpg|thumb|left|Parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert]]\n\n[[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described Chester-le-Street in the 1530s as \"Chiefly one main street of very mean building in height.\", a sentiment echoed by [[Daniel Defoe]].\n\n===St Mary and St Cuthbert church===\n{{main| St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street}}\nSt Mary and St Cuthbert church possesses a rare surviving anchorage, one of the best-preserved in the country.

It was occupied by six anchorites from 1383 to c. 1538, and is now a museum known as the Anker's House. The north aisle is occupied by a line of Lumley family effigies, only five genuine, assembled circa 1590. Some have been chopped off to fit and resemble a casualty station at Agincourt, according to [[Sir Simon Jenkins]] in his ''England's Thousand Best Churches''.

The centre of the street was the dividing line and the winner was the side where the ball was (Up or Down) at 6&nbsp;pm. It was played from the Middle Ages until 1932, when it was outlawed by the police and people trying to carry on the tradition were arrested.<ref>Purdon (1992) pp. 21\u201322</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page24.phtml|title=Shrove Tide Football|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111025115/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/chesterlestreetheritage/page24.phtml|archivedate=11 November 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  [[Chester-le-Street Town F.C.]] were founded in 1972 and compete in the [[Northern Football League]] Division Two.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nAt the time of the football matches 'Front Street' was actually the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]] from London to [[Edinburgh]]. A bypass was built in the 1950s, which still exists today as the [[A167 road|A167]]. The bypass road itself was partly bypassed by, and partly incorporated in, the [[A1(M)]] motorway in the 1970s.\n\nThe northern end of Front Street used to be the start of the A6127, which is the road that would continue through [[Birtley, Tyne and Wear|Birtley]], [[Gateshead]], and eventually over the [[Tyne Bridge]] and become the A6127(M) central motorway in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. However, when the Gateshead-Newcastle Western Bypass of the [[A1(M)]] was opened, many roads in this area were renumbered, following the convention that roads originating between single digit A roads take their first digit from the single digit A road in an anticlockwise direction from their point of origin, and Newcastle Road, which was formerly designated [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], is now unclassified. The A6127 was renamed the [[A167 road|A167]]. Car traffic is now banned from the northern part of Front Street and it is restricted to buses, cyclists and delivery vehicles for the shops.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Chester-le-Street Railway Station.jpg|thumb|left|Chester-le-Street Railway Station]]\n[[Chester-le-Street railway station]], on the [[East Coast Main Line]] of the [[National Rail]] network, between Newcastle and Durham, opened in 1868. It offers local connections and cross-country train services. {{As of|2008}}, train operators serving the station are [[CrossCountry]], [[TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]].\n\nA local independent company, Chester-le-Track, has operated the station since 1999, as an agent for [[Arriva Trains Northern]] and Northern Rail, but ceased trading from close of business on Saturday 31 March 2018. The station is now staffed on a part-time basis by Northern Rail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/CLS/details.aspx|title=National Rail Enquiries - Station facilities for Chester-le-Street|website=www.nationalrail.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref>\n\nThe town is mentioned in the 1963 song \"Slow Train\" by Flanders and Swann: <blockquote>''<poem>\nNo churns, no porter, no cat on a seat,\nAt Chorlton-cum-Hardy or Chester-le-Street.<ref>{{cite web|title=At the Drop of Another Hat: Slow Train|website=Flanders and Swann Online|url=http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/anotherhat_slow.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413054716/http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/anotherhat_slow.html|archivedate=13 April 2013}}</ref></poem>''</blockquote>\n\n===Bus===\nThe town is the original home of The Northern General Transport [Bus] Company, nowadays [[Go North East]], and the company still operates from the Picktree Lane Depot.
