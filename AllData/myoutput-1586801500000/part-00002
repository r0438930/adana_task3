At that time the area was inhabited by the [[Western Confederacy|Miami Confederation of Indians]]. Through White settlement, encroachment, and confrontation, the various indigenous groups were forced to cede their claim to the area. In October 1818, the Pottawattamies, Weas, and Delawares ceded their lands west of the [[Tippecanoe River]] to the government. In a treaty dated 23 October 1826, the Pottawattamies and Miamis ceded all their lands east of the Tippecanoe. A treaty dated 26 October 1832 with the Pottawattamies ceded control of the northwestern part of Indiana; on 27 October the Pottawattamies of Indiana and Michigan also relinquished all claim to any remaining land in those states.\n\nUntil the 1832 treaty of 1832, the future Jasper County area was not open to settlement; those who did come to Indiana before that time had flooded the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois through the [[Ohio Valley]]. Northwestern Indiana was also less desirable for initial settlement, the land being described as alternate swamps, sterile sand ridges and flat, wet prairies. It did proliferate in game, however, and eventually settlers found it. The first recorded settler was William Donahue, who located in present-day [[Gillam Township, Jasper County, Indiana|Gillam Township]]. He was a justice of the peace during the period prior to the county's establishment.\n\nAlthough the settlers were sparse, the state legislature provided for two counties to be established in the area. An act dated 7 February 1835 described the boundaries of [[Newton County, Indiana|Newton]] and Jasper counties, although their governing structures were not established at that time. The area was attached to [[White County, Indiana|White County]] for political and civil purposes.\n\nIn 1836 all the area north of the [[Kankakee River]] was partitioned from Jasper as [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter County]]. By 1837 preparations were being made to create the Jasper County governing structure, with a county commission being elected that year. They first met in January 1838 at the house of Robert Alexander in [[Parish Grove Township, Benton County, Indiana|present-day Benton County]]. After that, the pro tem county seat was designated as the residence of George W. Spitler, in [[Iroquois Township, Newton County, Indiana|present-day Iroquois Township, Newton County]], where the first meeting was held in March 1839.<ref name=SHJC/> The official date of formation of the Jasper County government is given as 15 March 1838.<ref name=OICN/>\n\nJasper County was named for Sgt. [[William Jasper]], a famous scout for the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=Govt.

In 1840 the [[Benton County, Indiana|county of Benton]] was formed from Jasper's area. In 1859 the county of Newton was revived but with smaller area than before, leaving Jasper in its present form.\n\n===The Civil War===\nAs early as 1825, the majority of the population were against slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=Scudder, Horace E|publisher=Boston & New York: The Riverside Press, Cambridge|year=1888|location=Cambridge|title=Indiana: American Commonwealths|pages=235, 237, 438-400}}</ref> By the time of the [[American Civil War|War]], Jasper County was one of the few counties of Indiana that had a military organization under the law of 1855.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamilton Louis H. & William Darroch|publisher=Lewis Publishing Co.|year=1916|location=Chicago & New York|title=A Standard History of Jasper and Newton Counties Indiana, Vol. 1|page=159}}</ref> The war greatly affected Jasper County when 935 soldiers were enlisted on behalf of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. This was considered an impressive amount at the time with the average population around 5,000. Although there were several companies from Indiana, the [[9th Indiana Infantry Regiment]] produced [[Robert H. Milroy]], the \"Gray Eagle of the Army\". Milroy became famous for suppressing Confederate mountain rangers, which caused the [[Confederate Congress]] to declare a $100,000 bounty on his head. The 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment became known for its involvement in the [[Battle of Philippi (West Virginia)|Battle of Philippi]], one of the earliest battles of the Civil War at [[Laurel Mountain (West Virginia)|Laurel Hill]] (now known as Laurel Mountain).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamilton Louis H. & William Darroch|publisher=Lewis Publishing Co.|year=1916|location=Chicago & New York|title=A Standard History of Jasper and Newton Counties Indiana, Volume 1|page= 115,118}}</ref> In comparing the proportions of men able to fight, Indiana contributed more soldiers than any other state to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hoover Dwight W.|publisher=the Indiana University Press|year=1980|location=Bloomington|title=A Pictorial History of Indiana|page=93}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of {{convert|561.39|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|559.62|sqmi}} (or 99.68%) is land and {{convert|1.76|sqmi}} (or 0.31%) is water.<ref name=DC/> Until the middle of the 19th century when it was drained to make farmland, this county was part of the 2nd largest freshwater wetland in the US, with abundant flora and fauna.<ref>{{IMDb title|2522274|Everglades of the North}}</ref> This is caused by the [[Iroquois River]], one of the main tributaries of the [[Kankakee River]] that flows throughout Jasper County, a major water source for the area.<ref>{{cite book|author=Battle J.H.|publisher=F.A.

The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name=inc2102/>\n\n'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]], elected to four-year terms.

At that time the area was inhabited by the [[Western Confederacy|Miami Confederation of Indians]]. Through White settlement, encroachment, and confrontation, the various indigenous groups were forced to cede their claim to the area. In October 1818, the Pottawattamies, Weas, and Delawares ceded their lands west of the [[Tippecanoe River]] to the government. In a treaty dated 23 October 1826, the Pottawattamies and Miamis ceded all their lands east of the Tippecanoe. A treaty dated 26 October 1832 with the Pottawattamies ceded control of the northwestern part of Indiana; on 27 October the Pottawattamies of Indiana and Michigan also relinquished all claim to any remaining land in those states.\n\nUntil the 1832 treaty of 1832, the future Jasper County area was not open to settlement; those who did come to Indiana before that time had flooded the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois through the [[Ohio Valley]]. Northwestern Indiana was also less desirable for initial settlement, the land being described as alternate swamps, sterile sand ridges and flat, wet prairies. It did proliferate in game, however, and eventually settlers found it. The first recorded settler was William Donahue, who located in present-day [[Gillam Township, Jasper County, Indiana|Gillam Township]]. He was a justice of the peace during the period prior to the county's establishment.\n\nAlthough the settlers were sparse, the state legislature provided for two counties to be established in the area. An act dated 7 February 1835 described the boundaries of [[Newton County, Indiana|Newton]] and Jasper counties, although their governing structures were not established at that time. The area was attached to [[White County, Indiana|White County]] for political and civil purposes.\n\nIn 1836 all the area north of the [[Kankakee River]] was partitioned from Jasper as [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter County]]. By 1837 preparations were being made to create the Jasper County governing structure, with a county commission being elected that year. They first met in January 1838 at the house of Robert Alexander in [[Parish Grove Township, Benton County, Indiana|present-day Benton County]]. After that, the pro tem county seat was designated as the residence of George W. Spitler, in [[Iroquois Township, Newton County, Indiana|present-day Iroquois Township, Newton County]], where the first meeting was held in March 1839.<ref name=SHJC/> The official date of formation of the Jasper County government is given as 15 March 1838.<ref name=OICN/>\n\nJasper County was named for Sgt. [[William Jasper]], a famous scout for the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|publisher=Govt.

In 1840 the [[Benton County, Indiana|county of Benton]] was formed from Jasper's area. In 1859 the county of Newton was revived but with smaller area than before, leaving Jasper in its present form.\n \n===The Civil War===\nAs early as 1825, the majority of the population were against slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=Scudder, Horace E|publisher=Boston & New York: The Riverside Press, Cambridge|year=1888|location=Cambridge|title=Indiana: American Commonwealths|pages=235, 237, 438-400}}</ref> By the time of the [[American Civil War|War]], Jasper County was one of the few counties of Indiana that had a military organization under the law of 1855.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamilton Louis H. & William Darroch|publisher=Lewis Publishing Co.|year=1916|location=Chicago & New York|title=A Standard History of Jasper and Newton Counties Indiana, Vol. 1|page=159}}</ref> The war greatly affected Jasper County when 935 soldiers were enlisted on behalf of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].

Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title=Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=16 September 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>\n\n'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name=inc2102/>\n\n'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]], elected to four-year terms.
