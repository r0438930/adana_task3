Richter has produced [[Abstract art|abstract]] as well as [[photorealistic]] paintings, and also [[photographs]] and [[Glass_art|glass]] pieces. He is widely regarded as one of the most important contemporary German artists and several of his works have set record prices at auction. \n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Childhood and education===\nRichter was born in Hospital Dresden-Neustadt in [[Dresden]], [[Saxony]],<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=3}}</ref> and grew up in Reichenau, [[Lower Silesia]] (now [[Bogatynia]], Poland), and in Waltersdorf (Zittauer Gebirge), in the [[Upper Lusatia]]n countryside, where his father worked as a village teacher. Gerhard's mother, Hildegard Sch\u00f6nfelder, gave birth to him at the age of 25. Hildegard's father, Ernst Alfred Sch\u00f6nfelder, at one time was considered a gifted pianist. Ernst moved the family to Dresden after taking up the family enterprise of brewing and eventually went bankrupt. Once in Dresden, Hildegard trained as a bookseller, and in doing so realized a passion for literature and music. Gerhard's father, Horst Richter, was a mathematics and physics student at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. The two were married in 1931.<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=4}}</ref>\n\nAfter struggling to maintain a position in the new Nationalist Socialist education system, Horst found a position in Reichenau. Gerhard's younger sister, Gisela, was born there in 1936. Horst and Hildegard were able to remain primarily apolitical due to Reichenau's location in the countryside.<ref name=ElgerP4>{{harv|Elger|2009|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Horst, being a teacher, was eventually forced to join the National Socialist Party. He never became an avid supporter of Nazism, and was not required to attend party rallies.<ref name=ElgerP4 /> In 1942, Gerhard was conscripted into the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]'', but by the end of the war he was still too young to be an official member of the [[Hitler Youth]].<ref>{{harv|Richter|Harten|1986|p=9}}</ref> In 1943, Hildegard moved the family to Waltersdorf, and was later forced to sell her piano.<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=6}}</ref> Two brothers of Hildegard died as soldiers in the war and a sister, who was schizophrenic, was starved to death in the [[Nazi Euthanasia Programme|Nazi euthanasia]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/biography|title=Early Years \u00bb Biography \u00bb Gerhard Richter|website=www.gerhard-richter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-27}}</ref>\n\nRichter left school after 10th grade and apprenticed as an advertising and stage-set painter, before studying at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. In 1948, he finished vocational high school in [[Zittau]], and, between 1949 and 1951, successively worked as an apprentice with a sign painter and as a painter.<ref name=\"Elgerp10\">{{harv|Elger|2009|p=10}}</ref> In 1950, his application for study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts was rejected as \"too bourgeois\".<ref name=\"Elgerp10\" /> He finally began his studies at the Academy in 1951. His teachers there were [[Karl von Appen]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinz Lohmar|de}} and [[Will Grohmann]].\n\n===Relationships===\nRichter married Marianne Eufinger in 1957; she gave birth to his first daughter. He married his second wife, the sculptor [[Isa Genzken]], in 1982. Richter had two sons and a daughter with his third wife, [[Sabine Moritz]] after they were married in 1995.<!-- See [[WP:BLPNAME]] for guidelines about family -->\n\n===Early career===\nIn the early days of his career, he prepared a wall painting (''Communion with Picasso'', 1955) for the [[refectory]] of his Academy of Arts as part of his [[B.A.]] Another mural entitled ''Lebensfreude'' (Joy of life) followed at the [[German Hygiene Museum]] for his diploma.

During this time, he worked intensively on murals like ''{{Lang|de|Arbeiterkampf}}'' (Workers' struggle), on oil paintings (e.g. portraits of the East German actress [[Angelica Domr\u00f6se]] and of Richter's first wife Ema), on various self-portraits and on a panorama of Dresden with the neutral name ''{{Lang|de|Stadtbild}}'' (Townscape, 1956).\n\nTogether with his wife Marianne, Richter escaped from [[East germany|East]] to [[West Germany]] two months before the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961. Both his wall paintings in the Academy of Arts and the Hygiene Museum were then painted over for ideological reasons. Much later, after [[German reunification]], two \"windows\" of the wall painting ''Joy of life'' (1956) would be uncovered in the stairway of the German Hygiene Museum, but these were later covered over when it was decided to restore the Museum to its original 1930 state. \n\nIn West Germany Richter began to study at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] under [[Karl Otto G\u00f6tz]] together with [[Sigmar Polke]], Werner Hilsing, [[HA Schult]],<ref>[http://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/private-finanzen/Euro-Interview-Exklusiv-Muellkuenstler-HA-Schult-Ich-moechte-Unsterblichkeit-Und-die-ist-nicht-kaeuflich-1853055 Axel Griesch, \"M\u00fcllk\u00fcnstler HA Schult: Ich m\u00f6chte Unsterblichkeit.

Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press, 1995. 13.</ref>\n\n===Photo-paintings and the \"blur\"===\nRichter created various painting pictures from black-and-white photographs during the 1960s and early 1970s, basing them on a variety of sources: newspapers and books, sometimes incorporating their captions, (as in ''Helga Matura'' (1966)); private snapshots; aerial views of towns and mountains, (''Cityscape Madrid'' (1968) and Alps (1968)); seascapes (1969\u201370); and a large multipart work made for the German Pavilion in the 1972 [[Venice Biennale]]. For ''[[48 Portraits|Forty-eight Portraits]]'' (1971\u201372), he chose mainly the faces of composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Jean Sibelius]], and of writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Franz Kafka]].<ref name=\"MOMA4907\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4907 Gerhard Richter] MoMA | The Collection</ref>\n\nFrom his \"Writings\", the following refer to quotations regarding photography, its relationship with painting, and the \"blur\":\n* \"The photograph is the most perfect picture. It does not change; it is absolute, and therefore autonomous, unconditional, devoid of style. Both in its ways of informing, and in what it informs of, it is my source.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. ''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews, 1962\u20131993''. Cambridge, Massachusetts.: MIT Press, 1995. 31.</ref>\n* \"I\u2019m not trying to imitate a photograph; I\u2019m trying to make one. And if I disregard the assumption that a photograph is a piece of paper exposed to light, then I am practicing photography by other means.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. ''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews, 1962\u20131993''. Cambridge, Massachusetts.: MIT Press, 1995. 73.</ref>\n* \"I don't create blurs. Blurring is not the most important thing; nor is it an identity tag for my pictures. When I dissolve demarcations and create transition, this is not in order to destroy the representation, or to make it more artistic or less precise. The flowing transitions, the smooth equalizing surface, clarify the content and make the representation credible (an \"alla prima\" impasto would be too reminiscent of painting, and would destroy the illusion).\"<ref name=\"Richter, Gerhard 1995\"/>\n* \"I blur things to make everything equally important and equally unimportant. I blur things so that they do not look artistic or craftsmanlike but technological, smooth and perfect. I blur things to make all the parts a closer fit. Perhaps I also blur out the excess of unimportant information.\"<ref name=\"Richter, Gerhard 1995\"/>\n\nMany of these paintings are made in a multi-step process of representations. He starts with a [[photograph]], which he has found or taken himself, and projects it onto his [[canvas]], where he traces it for exact form. Taking his color palette from the photograph, he paints to replicate the look of the original picture. His hallmark \"blur\" is achieved sometimes with a light touch of a soft brush, sometimes a hard smear by an aggressive pull with a squeegee.\n\nFrom around 1964, Richter made a number of portraits of dealers, collectors, artists and others connected with his immediate professional circle. Richter's two portraits of ''Betty'', his daughter, were made in 1977 and 1988 respectively; the three portraits titled ''IG'' were made in 1993 and depict the artist's second wife, [[Isa Genzken]].

Each composition is most commonly based on a photograph taken by Richter in his own studio. Influenced by old master vanitas painters such as [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n]], the artist began to experiment with arrangements of candles and skulls placed in varying degrees of natural light, sitting atop otherwise barren tables.

The photographs, not all taken by Richter himself, are mostly snapshots of daily life: family vacations, pictures of friends, mountains, buildings and streetscapes.\n\nRichter was flying to New York on 11 September 2001, but due to the [[9/11 attacks]], including on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], his plane was diverted to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

Buchloch in 1986, Richter was asked about his \"Monochrome Grey Pictures and Abstract Pictures\" and their connection with the artists [[Yves Klein]] and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. The following are Richter's answers:\n<blockquote>The Grey Pictures were done at a time when there were monochrome paintings everywhere. I painted them nonetheless. ... Not Kelly, but Bob Ryman, [[Brice Marden]], [[Alan Charlton]], [[Yves Klein]] and many others.<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. ''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews'', 1962\u20131993.

Despite unnatural palettes, spaceless sheets of color, and obvious trails of the artist's tools, the abstract pictures often act like windows through which we see the landscape outside. As in his representational paintings, there is an equalization of illusion and paint. In those paintings, he reduces worldly images to mere incidents of Art. Similarly, in his abstract pictures, Richter exalts spontaneous, intuitive mark-making to a level of spatial logic and believability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''Firenze'' continues a cycle of 99 works conceived in the autumn of 1999 and executed in the same year and thereafter.

This work was published in 2004 as a book entitled ''War Cut''.\n\nIn November 2008, Richter began a series in which he applied ink droplets to wet paper, using alcohol and lacquer to extend and retard the ink's natural tendency to bloom and creep. The resulting ''November'' sheets are regarded as a significant departure from his previous watercolours in that the pervasive soaking of ink into wet paper produced double-sided works.

When he began to make these paintings, Richter had his friend [[Blinky Palermo]] randomly call out colors, which Richter then adopted for his work. Chance thus plays its role in the creation of his first series.\n\nReturning to color charts in the 1970s, Richter changed his focus from the readymade to the conceptual system, developing mathematical procedures for mixing colours and chance operations for their placement.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/colour-chart-reinventing-colour-1950-today ''Colour Chart: Reinventing Colour, 1950 to Today''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031023902/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/colour-chart-reinventing-colour-1950-today |date=31 October 2014 }} Tate Liverpool, 29 May through 13 September 2009</ref> The range of the colors he employed was determined by a mathematical system for mixing the primary colors in graduated amounts. Each color was then randomly ordered to create the resultant composition and form of the painting. Richter's second series of Color Charts was begun in 1971 and consisted of only five paintings. In the final series of Color Charts which preoccupied Richter throughout 1973 and 1974, additional elements to this permutational system of color production were added in the form of mixes of a light grey, a dark gray and later, a green.\n\nRichter's ''4900 Colours'' from 2007 consisted of bright monochrome squares that have been randomly arranged in a grid pattern to create stunning fields of kaleidoscopic color. It was produced at the same time he developed his design for the south transept window of [[Cologne Cathedral]]. ''4900 Colours'' consists of 196 panels in 25 colors that can be reassembled in 11 variations \u2013 from a single expansive surface to multiple small-format fields.

Today, many call Gerhard Richter the best living painter. In part, this comes from his ability to explore the medium at a time when many were heralding its death. Richter has been the recipient of numerous prominent awards, including the State Prize of the state North Rhine-Westphalia in 2000; the Wexner Prize, 1998; the [[Praemium Imperiale]], Japan, 1997; the [[Golden Lion]] of the 47th Biennale, Venice, 1997; the [[Wolf Prize]] in Israel in 1994/5; the Kaiserring Prize der Stadt Goslar, M\u00f6nchehaus-Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Goslar, Germany, 1988; the [[Oskar Kokoschka]] Prize, Vienna, 1985; the [[Arnold Bode]] Prize, Kassel, 1981; and the Junger Western Art Prize, Germany, 1961. He was made an honorary citizen of Cologne in April 2007.\n\n===Influence===\nAmong the students who studied with Richter at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] between 1971 and 1994 were [[Ludger Gerdes]], [[Hans-J\u00f6rg Holubitschka]], [[Bernard Lokai]], [[Thomas Sch\u00fctte]], [[Thomas Struth]], Katrin Kneffel, Michael van Ofen, and Richter's second wife, [[Isa Genzken]]. He is known to have influenced [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Christopher Wool]] and [[Johan Andersson (artist) | Johan Andersson]].\n\nHe has also served as source of inspiration for writers and musicians. [[Sonic Youth]] used a painting of his for the cover art for their album ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' in 1988. He was a fan of the band and did not charge for the use of his image.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The original, over {{convert|7|m}} square, is now showcased in Sonic Youth's studio in NYC.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Don DeLillo]]'s short story \"Baader-Meinhof\" describes an encounter between two strangers at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Once obsessed, one ultimately carries it to the point of believing that one might change human beings through painting. But if one lacks this passionate commitment, there is nothing left to do. Then it is best to leave it alone. For basically painting is idiocy.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. ''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews, 1962\u20131993''. Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press, 1995. 78.</ref>\n* \"Perhaps because I'm sorry for the photograph, because it has such a miserable existence even though it is such a perfect picture, I would like to make it valid, make it visible \u2013 just ''make'' it (even if what I make is worse than the photograph). And this making is something that I can't grasp, or figure out and plan. That is why I keep on and on painting from photographs, because I can't make it out, because the only thing to do with photographs is paint from them. Because it attracts me to be so much at the mercy of a thing, to be so far from mastering it.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist.

Nor is it meant to be like any other, but the same: the same, though each was painted individually and by itself, not all together and all of a piece, like Multiples. I intended them to look the same but not be the same, and I intended this to be visible.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist.

Richter has produced [[Abstract art|abstract]] as well as [[photorealistic]] paintings, and also [[photographs]] and [[Glass_art|glass]] pieces. He is widely regarded as one of the most important contemporary German artists and several of his works have set record prices at auction. \n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Childhood and education===\nRichter was born in Hospital Dresden-Neustadt in [[Dresden]], [[Saxony]],<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=3}}</ref> and grew up in Reichenau, [[Lower Silesia]] (now [[Bogatynia]], Poland), and in Waltersdorf (Zittauer Gebirge), in the [[Upper Lusatia]]n countryside, where his father worked as a village teacher. Gerhard's mother, Hildegard Sch\u00f6nfelder, gave birth to him at the age of 25. Hildegard's father, Ernst Alfred Sch\u00f6nfelder, at one time was considered a gifted pianist. Ernst moved the family to Dresden after taking up the family enterprise of brewing and eventually went bankrupt. Once in Dresden, Hildegard trained as a bookseller, and in doing so realized a passion for literature and music. Gerhard's father, Horst Richter, was a mathematics and physics student at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. The two were married in 1931.<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=4}}</ref>\n\nAfter struggling to maintain a position in the new Nationalist Socialist education system, Horst found a position in Reichenau. Gerhard's younger sister, Gisela, was born there in 1936. Horst and Hildegard were able to remain primarily apolitical due to Reichenau's location in the countryside.<ref name=ElgerP4>{{harv|Elger|2009|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Horst, being a teacher, was eventually forced to join the National Socialist Party. He never became an avid supporter of Nazism, and was not required to attend party rallies.<ref name=ElgerP4 /> In 1942, Gerhard was conscripted into the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]'', but by the end of the war he was still too young to be an official member of the [[Hitler Youth]].<ref>{{harv|Richter|Harten|1986|p=9}}</ref> In 1943, Hildegard moved the family to Waltersdorf, and was later forced to sell her piano.<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=6}}</ref> Two brothers of Hildegard died as soldiers in the war and a sister, who was schizophrenic, was starved to death in the [[Nazi Euthanasia Programme|Nazi euthanasia]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/biography|title=Early Years \u00bb Biography \u00bb Gerhard Richter|website=www.gerhard-richter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-27}}</ref>\n\nRichter left school after 10th grade and apprenticed as an advertising and stage-set painter, before studying at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. In 1948, he finished vocational high school in [[Zittau]], and, between 1949 and 1951, successively worked as an apprentice with a sign painter and as a painter.<ref name=\"Elgerp10\">{{harv|Elger|2009|p=10}}</ref> In 1950, his application for study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts was rejected as \"too bourgeois\".<ref name=\"Elgerp10\" /> He finally began his studies at the Academy in 1951. His teachers there were [[Karl von Appen]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinz Lohmar|de}} and [[Will Grohmann]].\n\n===Relationships===\nRichter married Marianne Eufinger in 1957; she gave birth to his first daughter. He married his second wife, the sculptor [[Isa Genzken]], in 1982. Richter had two sons and a daughter with his third wife, [[Sabine Moritz]] after they were married in 1995.<!-- See [[WP:BLPNAME]] for guidelines about family -->\n\n===Early career===\nIn the early days of his career, he prepared a wall painting (''Communion with Picasso'', 1955) for the [[refectory]] of his Academy of Arts as part of his [[B.A.]] Another mural entitled ''Lebensfreude'' (Joy of life) followed at the [[German Hygiene Museum]] for his diploma.

During this time, he worked intensively on murals like ''{{Lang|de|Arbeiterkampf}}'' (Workers' struggle), on oil paintings (e.g. portraits of the East German actress [[Angelica Domr\u00f6se]] and of Richter's first wife Ema), on various self-portraits and on a panorama of Dresden with the neutral name ''{{Lang|de|Stadtbild}}'' (Townscape, 1956).\n\nTogether with his wife Marianne, Richter escaped from [[East germany|East]] to [[West Germany]] two months before the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961. Both his wall paintings in the Academy of Arts and the Hygiene Museum were then painted over for ideological reasons. Much later, after [[German reunification]], two \"windows\" of the wall painting ''Joy of life'' (1956) would be uncovered in the stairway of the German Hygiene Museum, but these were later covered over when it was decided to restore the Museum to its original 1930 state. \n\nIn West Germany Richter began to study at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] under [[Karl Otto G\u00f6tz]] together with [[Sigmar Polke]], Werner Hilsing, [[HA Schult]],<ref>[http://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/private-finanzen/Euro-Interview-Exklusiv-Muellkuenstler-HA-Schult-Ich-moechte-Unsterblichkeit-Und-die-ist-nicht-kaeuflich-1853055 Axel Griesch, \"M\u00fcllk\u00fcnstler HA Schult: Ich m\u00f6chte Unsterblichkeit.

For ''[[48 Portraits|Forty-eight Portraits]]'' (1971\u201372), he chose mainly the faces of composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Jean Sibelius]], and of writers such as [[H. G.

Blurring is not the most important thing; nor is it an identity tag for my pictures. When I dissolve demarcations and create transition, this is not in order to destroy the representation, or to make it more artistic or less precise.

He starts with a [[photograph]], which he has found or taken himself, and projects it onto his [[canvas]], where he traces it for exact form. Taking his color palette from the photograph, he paints to replicate the look of the original picture. His hallmark \"blur\" is achieved sometimes with a light touch of a soft brush, sometimes a hard smear by an aggressive pull with a squeegee.\n\nFrom around 1964, Richter made a number of portraits of dealers, collectors, artists and others connected with his immediate professional circle. Richter's two portraits of ''Betty'', his daughter, were made in 1977 and 1988 respectively; the three portraits titled ''IG'' were made in 1993 and depict the artist's second wife, [[Isa Genzken]].

Despite unnatural palettes, spaceless sheets of color, and obvious trails of the artist's tools, the abstract pictures often act like windows through which we see the landscape outside. As in his representational paintings, there is an equalization of illusion and paint. In those paintings, he reduces worldly images to mere incidents of Art. Similarly, in his abstract pictures, Richter exalts spontaneous, intuitive mark-making to a level of spatial logic and believability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''Firenze'' continues a cycle of 99 works conceived in the autumn of 1999 and executed in the same year and thereafter.

In the final series of Color Charts which preoccupied Richter throughout 1973 and 1974, additional elements to this permutational system of color production were added in the form of mixes of a light grey, a dark gray and later, a green.\n\nRichter's ''4900 Colours'' from 2007 consisted of bright monochrome squares that have been randomly arranged in a grid pattern to create stunning fields of kaleidoscopic color.

Today, many call Gerhard Richter the best living painter. In part, this comes from his ability to explore the medium at a time when many were heralding its death. Richter has been the recipient of numerous prominent awards, including the State Prize of the state North Rhine-Westphalia in 2000; the Wexner Prize, 1998; the [[Praemium Imperiale]], Japan, 1997; the [[Golden Lion]] of the 47th Biennale, Venice, 1997; the [[Wolf Prize]] in Israel in 1994/5; the Kaiserring Prize der Stadt Goslar, M\u00f6nchehaus-Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Goslar, Germany, 1988; the [[Oskar Kokoschka]] Prize, Vienna, 1985; the [[Arnold Bode]] Prize, Kassel, 1981; and the Junger Western Art Prize, Germany, 1961. He was made an honorary citizen of Cologne in April 2007.\n\n===Influence===\nAmong the students who studied with Richter at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] between 1971 and 1994 were [[Ludger Gerdes]], [[Hans-J\u00f6rg Holubitschka]], [[Bernard Lokai]], [[Thomas Sch\u00fctte]], [[Thomas Struth]], Katrin Kneffel, Michael van Ofen, and Richter's second wife, [[Isa Genzken]]. He is known to have influenced [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Christopher Wool]] and [[Johan Andersson (artist) | Johan Andersson]].\n\nHe has also served as source of inspiration for writers and musicians.

Then it is best to leave it alone. For basically painting is idiocy.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. ''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews, 1962\u20131993''.

And this making is something that I can't grasp, or figure out and plan. That is why I keep on and on painting from photographs, because I can't make it out, because the only thing to do with photographs is paint from them. Because it attracts me to be so much at the mercy of a thing, to be so far from mastering it.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist.
