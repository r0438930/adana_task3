In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of [[primary producer]]s. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny [[phytoplankton]] which grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of [[primary production]]. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as [[climax forest|mature forests]], grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the [[zooplankton]] that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, zooplankton  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

Phytoplankton autotrophically produces biomass by converting [[inorganic compound]]s into [[organic compound|organic]] ones.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached [[seaweeds]], while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the [[seagrass]]es. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the [[littoral]] zone and shallow waters, where they [[holdfast|attach]] to the underlying substrate and are still within the [[photic zone]]. But most of the primary production by algae is performed by the phytoplankton.\n\nThus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by [[phytoplankton]], microscopic drifting organisms, mostly [[one-celled]] [[algae]], that float in the sea. Most phytoplankton are too small to be seen individually with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]]. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer ([[Photic zone|euphotic zone]]) of the sea.\n\nThe most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where according to some estimates they contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production.<ref name=mann99>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1 | last1 = Mann | first1 = D.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=170px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility. This element is found in a number of chemical forms in the seabird fecal material, but the most mobile and bioavailable is [[orthophosphate]], which can be [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by subterranean or superficial waters (5).<ref name=Otero2018 />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 550\n | header            = Estuaries\n | header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n | image1    = Food web of the Venice lagoon.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Example food web from an [[estuary]], the [[Venice Lagoon]], involving 27 nodes or functional groups.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached [[seaweeds]], while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the [[seagrass]]es. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the [[littoral]] zone and shallow waters, where they [[holdfast|attach]] to the underlying substrate and are still within the [[photic zone]]. But most of the primary production by algae is performed by the phytoplankton.\n\nThus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by [[phytoplankton]], microscopic drifting organisms, mostly [[one-celled]] [[algae]], that float in the sea. Most phytoplankton are too small to be seen individually with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]]. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer ([[Photic zone|euphotic zone]]) of the sea.\n\nThe most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where according to some estimates they contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production.<ref name=mann99>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1 | last1 = Mann | first1 = D.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=170px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility. This element is found in a number of chemical forms in the seabird fecal material, but the most mobile and bioavailable is [[orthophosphate]], which can be [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by subterranean or superficial waters (5).<ref name=Otero2018 />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 550\n | header            = Estuaries\n | header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n | image1    = Food web of the Venice lagoon.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Example food web from an [[estuary]], the [[Venice Lagoon]], involving 27 nodes or functional groups.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted. [[Energy pyramid]]s, however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included, since this is dictated by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].\"<ref name=\"Odum05\">{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=E.
