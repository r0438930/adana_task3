It is the fourth major installment of the ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' series and seventh overall, and a sequel to the [[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|2015 reboot of the series]]. It was developed by [[EA DICE]], in collaboration with [[Criterion Games]] and [[Motive Studios]], and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was released worldwide on November 17, 2017 for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nUpon release, ''Battlefront II'' received mixed reviews from critics. The game was also subject to [[List of video games notable for negative reception|widespread criticism]] regarding the status of its [[loot box]]es, which could give players [[Pay to win|substantial gameplay advantages]] if purchased with real money. A response from EA's community team on [[Reddit]] on the topic became the single most down-voted comment in the site's history<ref name=\"Salinis\">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/13/ea-star-wars-game-is-so-unpopular-the-developer-is-getting-threats.html | title = EA's new Star Wars game is so unpopular a developer is apparently getting death threats | first = Sara | last = Salinis | date = November 13, 2017 | accessdate = November 13, 2017 | publisher = [[CNBC]] }}</ref> \u2013 and in response, EA decided to temporarily remove [[microtransaction]]s from the game until a later date.

The game offers a variety of unique game modes, most of which have the player take control of four main ground classes (Assault, Heavy, Officer and Specialist), aligned to either the [[Galactic Republic]] (represented by [[clone trooper]]s), the Separatists ([[battle droids]]), the Rebel Alliance (Rebel troopers), the Empire ([[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]]), the Resistance (Resistance troopers), or the First Order (First Order stormtroopers), and compete in large or small scale battles against other players (or, in some cases, enemies controlled by an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]).\n\nIn space battles, the players take control of space ships rather than ground troopers or vehicles, but the play style is more or less the same, also being class-based. The are a total of three base classes for the space battles:\n\n*'''Fighter''' - represented by the [[ARC-170]] Starfighter and, on Naboo only, the [[Naboo starfighter|N-1]] Starfighter for the Republic; the [[Vulture droid|Vulture Droid]] for the Separatists; the [[X-wing fighter|T-65B X-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; the [[TIE fighter|TIE/ln Fighter]] for the Empire; the T-70 X-Wing for the Resistance; and the TIE/fo Fighter for the First Order.\n*'''Interceptor''' - the [[V-Wing Starfighter|V-Wing]] for the Republic; the [[Droid tri-fighter|Droid Tri-Fighter]] for the Separatists; the [[A-wing|RZ-1 A-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; the [[TIE interceptor|TIE/IN Interceptor]] for the Empire; the RZ-2 A-Wing for the Resistance; and the TIE/sf Fighter for the First Order\n*'''Bomber''' - the [[Y-wing|BTL-B Y-Wing]] for the Republic; the ''Hyena''-class bomber for the Separatists; the BTL-A4 Y-Wing for the Rebel Alliance; and the [[TIE Bomber|TIE/sa Bomber]] for the Empire\n\nThere are also six additional \"reinforcement\" classes, that are unlocked during every match by acquiring battlepoints (earned from defeating enemies or completing specific objectives during each match). For the ground troopers, there are three reinforcement classes:\n\n*'''Enforcer''' - the [[Wookiee]] Warrior and [[Clone commando|Clone Commando]] for the Republic; the [[Super Battle Droid|B2 Super Battle Droid]] and the [[Droideka (Star Wars)|Droideka]] for the Separatists; the Wookie Warrior for the Rebel Allaince; the [[Deathtrooper|Death Trooper]] for the Empire; the Ovissian Gunner for the Resistance; and the First Order Flametrooper.\n*'''Aerial''' - the Jet Trooper for the Republic; B2-RP Rocket Droid for the Separatists; the Rebel Rocket-Jumper; the Imperial Rocket Trooper; the Resistance Rocket-Jumper; and the First Order Jet Trooper.\n*'''Infiltrator''' - the [[Advanced Recon Commando]] / ARC Trooper for the Republic; the Commando Droid for the Separatists; the [[Ewok]] Hunter for the Rebel Alliance; the ISB Agent for the Empire; the Caphex Spy for the Resistance; and the Sith Trooper for the First Order.\n\nThe other three reinforcements are vehicles:\n\n*'''Speeder''' - the [[BARC Speeder]] for the Republic; the [[Speeder bike|STAP]] for the Separatists; the T-47 Airspeeder / [[Snowspeeder]], X-34 [[Landspeeder]] and 74-Z [[Speeder bike|Speeder Bike]] for the Rebel Alliance; the 74-Z Speeder Bike for the Empire; a stolen LIUV / First Order Snowspeeder and the V-4X-D Ski Speeder for the Resistance; and the LIUV for the First Order.\n*'''Artillery''' - the [[LAAT]] Gunship and the [[AT-TE]] for the Republic; the [[MTT (Star Wars)|MTT]] for the Separatists; the [[U-wing|U-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; and the [[At at|AT-AT]] for the Empire.\n*'''Armor''' - the [[AT-RT]] and the [[TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank|TX-130]] for the Republic; the [[Armored Assault Tank|AAT]] for the Separatists; the AT-RT for the Rebel Alliance; the [[AT-ST]] for the Empire; a stolen First Order AT-ST for the Resistance; and the First Order AT-ST.\n\n=== Heroes ===\n''Battlefront II'' allows the players to take control of several heroes and villains based on iconic characters from across all the ''Star Wars'' movies. At launch, the hero roster included [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] ([[Misty Lee]]), [[Han Solo]] (John Armstrong), [[Chewbacca]], [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), [[Yoda]] ([[Tom Kane]]), and [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]), while the villain roster included [[Darth Vader]] ([[Matt Sloan (voice actor)|Matt Sloan]]), [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Sam Witwer]]), [[Boba Fett]] ([[Temuera Morrison]]), [[Bossk (Star Wars)|Bossk]] ([[Dee Bradley Baker]]), [[Iden Versio]] ([[Janina Gavankar]]), [[Darth Maul]] (Sam Witwer), and [[Kylo Ren]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]/[[Roger Craig Smith]]).\n\nThere are also several hero and villain ships, which at launch included Boba Fett's ''[[Slave I]]'', Darth Maul's ''[[Sith Infiltrator|Scimitar]]'', Darth Vader's [[TIE Advanced|TIE Advanced x1]], Han Solo and Chewbacca's ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', Iden Versio's [[TIE fighter|TIE/in Fighter]], Kylo Ren's TIE Silencer, Luke Skywalker's T-65B [[X-wing fighter|X-Wing]], [[Poe Dameron]]'s T-70 X-Wing, Rey and Chewbacca's ''Millennium Falcon'', and Yoda's [[Jedi interceptor|Actis-class Light Interceptor]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kae-JjbLsgA|title=Star Wars Battlefront II: Full Length Reveal Trailer|date=April 15, 2017|last=EA Star Wars|accessdate=April 16, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nNew heroes and hero ships from across all eras were added later on, including [[Tallie Lintra]]'s RZ-2 A-Wing, Lando Calrissian and [[L3-37]]'s ''Millennium Falcon'' (from ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''), [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[James Arnold Taylor]]), Anakin Skywalker ([[Matt Lanter]]), [[General Grievous]] (Matthew Wood), [[Count Dooku]] ([[Corey Burton]]), [[BB-8]] and [[BB-9E]].\n\n=== Progression System ===\nThe game features a progression system based on \"Star Cards\", which are unlocked as the player levels up with a specific class or hero and grant them specific benefits. Players level up by defeating enemies or completing objectives during each match. Each class or hero can have a maximum of three Star Cards equipped, and each Star Card can be leveled up to level 4, each level further increasing its benefits. There are also milestones, which grant the player rewards for completing specific tasks, or for simply leveling up with a class or a hero.\n\nFor the four base trooper classes, there are up to four unlockable weapons, which are unlocked by completing specific milestones and each have their particular advantages, such as improved range, damage or fire rate. Each weapon also comes with modifications, which improve specific stats and are also unlocked by completing milestones.\n\n=== Multiplayer modes ===\nThere are a total of twelve online multiplayer game modes, some of which are available to play only for a limited time, with the largest supporting up to 40 simultaneous players with 24 additional AI-controlled players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/26/star-wars-battlefront-2-multiplayer-maps-and-modes-revealed|title=Star Wars Battlefront 2: Multiplayer Maps and Modes Revealed|last=Osborn|first=Alex|date=September 26, 2017|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n*'''Galactic Assault''': This game mode is centered around unique set pieces set across the thirteen planets and locations featuring all three ''Star Wars'' eras involving a team of 20 attackers against 20 defenders, with the attackers having to complete a specific objective in order to progress, whereas the defenders have to stop them.\n*'''Supremacy''': This mode pits two teams of twenty players, with an additional 12 AI bots per team, against each other as they fight to capture and hold a majority of Command Posts which increase reinforcement count in order to attack the enemy team's capital ship and destroy it from within by capturing and destroying objectives. It is a new mode that was introduced in March 2019. The mode is currently available in the \"Age of the Republic\" and the \" Age of the Resistance\" eras, and will soon be available in as the \"Age of the Rebellion\".\n*'''Heroes vs. Villains''': This mode involves all the heroes and villains in ''Star Wars Battlefront II'', where four light side heroes fight four dark side villains.

This comes with an improvement in Battlefront's AI as the enemy bots can play as heroes and some reinforcements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/20/star-wars-battlefront-ii-2-update-new-modes-dlc-rise-of-skywalker/|title=Star Wars Battlefront II adding co-op, new maps and modes \u2013 TheSixthAxis|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n*'''Hero Showdown''': This mode involves teams of two heroes and two villains facing off in round-based duels with no respawn after defeat until the next round begins.

To win, the player's team must control the battlefront by securing the most command posts, thereby accruing points. Unlike the similar multiplayer mode \u2018Supremacy\u2019, the match ends when a team accrues the maximum number of points.\n*'''Custom Arcade:''' A smaller scale mode where players take on AI in a choice of Team Battles, Starfighter Battles, Onslaught or Starfighter Onslaught. Team Battles are where the player faces a small team of AI Troopers, while Starfighter Battles is where the player takes on a team of AI ships. Onslaught is where you pick a hero or villain, and you must wipe out the enemy team of AI Troopers in the time limit you choose, while Starfighter Onslaught is the same but with ships.\n*'''Battle Scenarios:''' A set of classic encounters across all eras of ''Star Wars'', which also grant the player rewards for the multiplayer experience.\n\nUnlike 2015's [[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|''Battlefront'']], the game also offers a single-player campaign. Its protagonist is Iden Versio, leader of an Imperial Special Forces group known as Inferno Squad, who participates in multiple events in the 30 years leading up to [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|''The Force Awakens'']]. There are segments in the campaign where the player is able to control other characters such as Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. Players can also play in the Arcade mode \u2013 an offline single player or local co-op where players can choose which side to play on and which battle to play in. Battles vary from team battles to onslaughts. Alternatively, players can choose to do a custom match, where they can change some of the settings and locations.\n\n=== Downloadable content ===\nInstead of the paid Season Pass [[downloadable content]] (DLC) seen in the game's 2015 predecessor, ''Battlefront II'' is expanded via free DLC provided to all players with a free EA account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2s-dlc-plans-hinted-in-origi/1100-6450714/|title=Star Wars Battlefront 2's DLC Plans Hinted in Origin Store Page|last=Strawhun|first=Aiden|date=June 10, 2017|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mash\" /> The DLC uses a seasonal structure similar to ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege|Rainbow Six Siege]]'', according to Gavankar.

The next set of content was announced on June 9, 2018, during EA Play and was released throughout both 2018 and 2019. It featured content from the prequel trilogy of ''Star Wars'', centering on the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists known as the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], and added the planets Geonosis and Felucia as ground maps, new games modes \"Capital Supremacy\" (inspired by Conquest from the original ''Battlefront'' games), \"Instant Action\" and \"Co-op\" (which were eventually added to all eras), new reinforcements for the Enforcer class (the Clone Commando and the Droideka) and vehicles for the Speeder (the BARC Speeder and the STAP), Armor (the TX-130), and Artillery (the AT-TE, available only on the Geonosis Galactic Assault map) classes, the Infiltrator reinforcement class (initially available only for the Republic and Separatists and represented by the ARC Trooper and the Commando Droid, respectively, but it was eventually added to all three eras), skins for both clone troopers and battle droids, and new Republic heroes Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and Separatists villains General Grievous and Count Dooku.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/09/e3-2018-star-wars-battlefront-2-clone-wars-content-revealed|title=E3 2018: Star Wars Battlefront 2 Clone Wars Content Revealed|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Andrew|date=June 9, 2018|website=IGN|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-clone-wars-voice-actors/|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars Voice Actors Returning for Battlefront II Content|last1=Fiduccia|first1=Christopher|date=October 18, 2018|website=ScreenRant|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, a \"Celebration Edition\" of the game was released, which included all cosmetics (skins, emotes, voice lines and victory poses ) for both troopers and heroes released up until then.

Starting with February 2020, new content for the original trilogy era was also released, including new reinforcements for the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire (the Ewok Hunter and the ISB Agent) and new weapons for all four base classes (the E-11D for the Assault, T-21 for Heavy, DL-18 for Officer and Cycler Rifle for Specialist, all of them returning from 2015's ''Battlefront''). A Scarif ground map, inspired by the movie ''[[Rogue One]]'', was also teased and is set to be released in \"mid-April\".<ref name=\"thesixthaxis.com\">https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/23/star-wars-battlefront-2-battle-of-scarif-update-delay-april-coronavirus-covid19/</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\nThe single-player story mode campaign in ''Star Wars Battlefront II'' takes place in the [[Star Wars galaxy|''Star Wars'' galaxy]], beginning around the time of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', but is mostly set between it and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''. The player assumes the role of [[Iden Versio]], the commander of an Imperial Special Forces [[commando]] unit called Inferno Squad, which consists of fellow members Del Meeko and Gideon Hask and is supervised by Iden's father, Admiral Garrick Versio. The campaign begins with the Battle of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]], where [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] plots to lure an unsuspecting [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] fleet into a trap using himself and the [[Death Star|Death Star II]] as bait, seeking to crush the [[Galactic Civil War|Rebellion]] against his [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] once and for all. Inferno Squad is crucial to the success of this plan, but the Empire underestimates the strength of the Rebellion, as its fleet gathers at [[Sullust]].\n\n===Plot===\n[[Iden Versio]] ([[Janina Gavankar]]) is being interrogated for the codes to unlock an Imperial transmission aboard a Rebel [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]]. She activates her [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]], which sneaks to her cell and frees her. Iden had allowed herself to be captured in order to erase the Imperial transmission, which would reveal the Emperor's plan at Endor. She successfully erases it, then escapes the ship by launching herself into space where she is intercepted by the ''Corvus'', the flagship of Inferno Squad. Iden confirms the mission's success to Gideon Hask ([[Paul Blackthorne]]) and Del Meeko ([[TJ Ramini]]), other members of her squad.\n\nLater on Endor, Iden, Hask, and Del secure the perimeter around the ruined shield generator, and watch with shock and horror as the Death Star II explodes. Vice Admiral [[Rae Sloane|Sloane]] orders a full retreat, and Inferno Squad recovers [[TIE fighter]]s to escape the moon, which is being overrun by Rebel forces. The ''Corvus'' is attacked during their escape, but Inferno fends off the Rebel bombers. Iden then meets with her father, Admiral Garrick Versio ([[Anthony Skordi]]), on his [[Star Destroyer]], the ''Eviscerator''. Admiral Versio confirms to Iden that the Emperor has died, before a messenger droid displays a hologram of the late Emperor issuing his last command: to begin Operation: Cinder. Admiral Versio sends Iden to an Imperial shipyard over Fondor to protect Moff Raythe and his Star Destroyer, the ''Dauntless'', which hosts experimental satellites vital to the success of Operation: Cinder. The ''Dauntless'' comes under attack from a Rebel Star Cruiser, but Iden is able to board it with Hask and disable its ion cannons. Afterwards, they are ordered to attack the Imperial shipyard in order to free the Star Destroyer from the locked clamps, allowing it to open fire on the Rebel cruiser and destroy it.\n\nDel is sent to Pillio and ordered to destroy one of the Emperor's hidden bases. He encounters [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), who helps him disarm the base's defenses and fend off the local wildlife, before eventually entering the base and discovering that it contains the Emperor's spoils of conquest. Del and Luke part amicably, and the former begins to question the Empire's goals and motives. Following this, Iden and Inferno Squad are sent to the Imperial-controlled world of Vardos (and Iden's homeworld), in order to retrieve Protectorate Gleb. As the satellites for Operation Cinder begin destroying the planet with terrible storms, Iden and Meeko go against their orders and try to evacuate the civilians in addition to Gleb, causing Hask to betray them. Disillusioned by the Empire's attack on Vardos, Iden and Meeko escape off world, now traitors to the Empire. They seek out the Rebel Alliance and are taken to General [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), who gives them the choice to help stop Operation: Cinder, or to escape and make new lives for themselves. Choosing to help, they aid [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] ([[Misty Lee]]) in protecting [[Naboo]], destroying the satellites for Operation: Cinder and reactivating the planet's defenses. After Naboo is liberated, Inferno Squad joins the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]].\n\nSeveral months later, Inferno Squad, now consisting of Iden, Del and Shriv Suurgav (Dan Donohue), are sent by Leia to [[Takodana]] to find [[Han Solo]] (John Armstrong), who was extracting an Imperial defector carrying critical data in hopes of liberating [[Kashyyyk]] and freeing the [[Wookiee]]s. The data also reveals that Admiral Versio is commanding Imperial operations on [[Bespin]] and Sullust. Iden and Del infiltrate Bespin with the intent of capturing Admiral Versio, but are led into a trap by Hask, who escapes along with the Admiral. Iden and Del soon manage to escape from Bespin as well, destroying a Star Destroyer fuelling station in the process. Meanwhile, Lando and Shriv investigate the hidden Imperial weapons cache on Sullust, only to find a weapons factory, which they destroy.\n\nThese operations cripple the Imperial fleet, which makes a last stand at [[Jakku]]. During the battle, Iden shoots down Hask and boards the ''Eviscerator'', intending to rescue her father. Admiral Versio decides to [[The captain goes down with the ship|go down with his ship]], feeling obligated to die with the Empire he fought to protect, and urges Iden to escape and live a new life, commending her for seeing the weakness of the Empire. Iden takes an escape pod and reunites with Del at the end of the battle. The two embrace and kiss, as the battle marks the end of the Galactic Empire.\n\nThree decades later, Del is captured on Pillio by Protectorate Gleb, who hands him over to [[Kylo Ren]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]) and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]]. Ren uses the Force to interrogate Del about the location of the map leading to Luke Skywalker. After succeeding, he leaves Del in the custody of Hask, who survived getting shot down at Jakku years prior. Hask expresses disgust at Del choosing to father a daughter with Iden instead of becoming a soldier and kills him, but not before Del warns him not to confront Iden. Hask then warns Gleb that the Republic cannot find out about \"Project Resurrection\" and orders her to leave the ''Corvus'' on Pillio as bait to lure Iden out of hiding.\n\n===Resurrection===\nShriv Suurgav, now an agent for the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]], discovers the abandoned ''Corvus'' and informs Iden and her daughter, Zay (Brittany Volcy). Shriv also reveals that Del had been helping the Resistance investigate rumors of mass disappearances that may be connected to Project Resurrection before disappearing himself. They head to Athulla, where Del was last seen, to investigate. However, they are ambushed by a Jinata Security fleet. Iden and Zay destroy the fleet and capture the flagship. The surviving Jinata Security crew admit that they had been kidnapping children on the behalf of the First Order, and that Project Resurrection had been moved to Vardos.\n\nThe group travels to Vardos, where Iden has Zay stay behind on the ''Corvus'' while she and Shriv investigate the surface. After seeing a bright streak of red light appear in the sky, Iden and Shriv discover Gleb's dead body and are then captured by Hask, who taunts them by telling them that he killed Gleb and Del and that the First Order has already destroyed the Senate and the Hosnian system (the capital of the New Republic), revealing that the red streak of light seen earlier was actually the deadly blast of [[Starkiller Base]] (as seen in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens#Plot|The Force Awakens]]''). He then orders his Star Destroyer, the ''Retribution'', to destroy the ''Corvus'' along with Zay. Jinata Security personnel, angry at the First Order for betraying them, attack Hask's men, giving Iden and Shriv an opportunity to escape. They rescue Zay, who managed to eject in an escape pod before the ''Corvus'' was destroyed.\n\nIden fights her desire to get revenge on Hask, then resolves to board the ''Retribution'' to investigate what the First Order had been up to. After getting aboard by flying stolen TIE Fighters into its engine, Iden, Shriv and Zay search the ''Retribution'' for any useful data from the ship to aid the Resistance, fending off the ship's personnel along the way. They hack a computer terminal and discover that Project Resurrection is an operation by the First Order to kidnap children from across the galaxy and indoctrinate them into [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]]. In addition, they discover that the First Order has built up a massive fleet large enough to retake the galaxy. Finally, they find the plans for a First Order Dreadnought and steal them. Shriv then goes to secure an escape craft while Iden and Zay plant explosive charges on the ''Retribution'''s hyperspace generators. Hask ambushes them but is killed by Iden. The destruction of the hyperspace generators pulls the ''Retribution'' out of hyperspace near Starkiller Base just as the Resistance destroys it. Iden reveals that she had been mortally wounded during the battle with Hask and gives the Dreadnought plans to Zay, ordering her to escape without her before dying.\n\nZay and Shriv link up with the Resistance and transmit the Dreadnought plans to General Leia. She then orders them to head to the Outer Rim to gather more allies.\n\n==Post-launch content==\nIt was confirmed during EA Play 2017 that there would not be a season pass; rather, all downloadable content will be free for all players and will be included in events called Seasons.<ref name=\"EAPlayLive\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Bta5UNTHw|title=E3 2017: EA Press Conference and EA Play \u2013 IGN LIVE|accessdate=June 11, 2017|author=IGN|date=June 10, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Last Jedi'' Season ===\nThe first Season expansion, ''The Last Jedi'' Season, was released on December 5 and is centered around [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']], the eighth film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga which was released on December 15, 2017.

game]] based on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film franchise. It is the fourth major installment of the ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' series and seventh overall, and a sequel to the [[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|2015 reboot of the series]]. It was developed by [[EA DICE]], in collaboration with [[Criterion Games]] and [[Motive Studios]], and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was released worldwide on November 17, 2017 for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nUpon release, ''Battlefront II'' received mixed reviews from critics. The game was also subject to [[List of video games notable for negative reception|widespread criticism]] regarding the status of its [[loot box]]es, which could give players [[Pay to win|substantial gameplay advantages]] if purchased with real money.

The available maps at launch included [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]], [[Kashyyyk]], [[Naboo]] (for the prequel trilogy), the [[Death Star|Death Star II]], [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]], [[Yavin IV]], [[Hoth]], the [[Mos Eisley|Mos Eisley Spaceport]] on [[Tatooine]] (for the original trilogy), [[Jakku]], [[Takodana]] and [[Starkiller Base]] (for the sequel trilogy), as well as a smaller-scale Cloud City map on [[Bespin]] and space maps over Kamino, [[Ryloth]] (for the prequel trilogy), Fondor, Endor (for the original trilogy) and the Unknown Regions (for the sequel trilogy).

The game offers a variety of unique game modes, most of which have the player take control of four main ground classes (Assault, Heavy, Officer and Specialist), aligned to either the [[Galactic Republic]] (represented by [[clone trooper]]s), the Separatists ([[battle droids]]), the Rebel Alliance (Rebel troopers), the Empire ([[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]]), the Resistance (Resistance troopers), or the First Order (First Order stormtroopers), and compete in large or small scale battles against other players (or, in some cases, enemies controlled by an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]).\n\nIn space battles, the players take control of space ships rather than ground troopers or vehicles, but the play style is more or less the same, also being class-based. The are a total of three base classes for the space battles:\n\n*'''Fighter''' - represented by the [[ARC-170]] Starfighter and, on Naboo only, the [[Naboo starfighter|N-1]] Starfighter for the Republic; the [[Vulture droid|Vulture Droid]] for the Separatists; the [[X-wing fighter|T-65B X-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; the [[TIE fighter|TIE/ln Fighter]] for the Empire; the T-70 X-Wing for the Resistance; and the TIE/fo Fighter for the First Order.\n*'''Interceptor''' - the [[V-Wing Starfighter|V-Wing]] for the Republic; the [[Droid tri-fighter|Droid Tri-Fighter]] for the Separatists; the [[A-wing|RZ-1 A-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; the [[TIE interceptor|TIE/IN Interceptor]] for the Empire; the RZ-2 A-Wing for the Resistance; and the TIE/sf Fighter for the First Order\n*'''Bomber''' - the [[Y-wing|BTL-B Y-Wing]] for the Republic; the ''Hyena''-class bomber for the Separatists; the BTL-A4 Y-Wing for the Rebel Alliance; and the [[TIE Bomber|TIE/sa Bomber]] for the Empire\n\nThere are also six additional \"reinforcement\" classes, that are unlocked during every match by acquiring battlepoints (earned from defeating enemies or completing specific objectives during each match). For the ground troopers, there are three reinforcement classes:\n\n*'''Enforcer''' - the [[Wookiee]] Warrior and [[Clone commando|Clone Commando]] for the Republic; the [[Super Battle Droid|B2 Super Battle Droid]] and the [[Droideka (Star Wars)|Droideka]] for the Separatists; the Wookie Warrior for the Rebel Allaince; the [[Deathtrooper|Death Trooper]] for the Empire; the Ovissian Gunner for the Resistance; and the First Order Flametrooper.\n*'''Aerial''' - the Jet Trooper for the Republic; B2-RP Rocket Droid for the Separatists; the Rebel Rocket-Jumper; the Imperial Rocket Trooper; the Resistance Rocket-Jumper; and the First Order Jet Trooper.\n*'''Infiltrator''' - the [[Advanced Recon Commando]] / ARC Trooper for the Republic; the Commando Droid for the Separatists; the [[Ewok]] Hunter for the Rebel Alliance; the ISB Agent for the Empire; the Caphex Spy for the Resistance; and the Sith Trooper for the First Order.\n\nThe other three reinforcements are vehicles:\n\n*'''Speeder''' - the [[BARC Speeder]] for the Republic; the [[Speeder bike|STAP]] for the Separatists; the T-47 Airspeeder / [[Snowspeeder]], X-34 [[Landspeeder]] and 74-Z [[Speeder bike|Speeder Bike]] for the Rebel Alliance; the 74-Z Speeder Bike for the Empire; a stolen LIUV / First Order Snowspeeder and the V-4X-D Ski Speeder for the Resistance; and the LIUV for the First Order.\n*'''Artillery''' - the [[LAAT]] Gunship and the [[AT-TE]] for the Republic; the [[MTT (Star Wars)|MTT]] for the Separatists; the [[U-wing|U-Wing]] for the Rebel Alliance; and the [[At at|AT-AT]] for the Empire.\n*'''Armor''' - the [[AT-RT]] and the [[TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank|TX-130]] for the Republic; the [[Armored Assault Tank|AAT]] for the Separatists; the AT-RT for the Rebel Alliance; the [[AT-ST]] for the Empire; a stolen First Order AT-ST for the Resistance; and the First Order AT-ST.\n\n=== Heroes ===\n''Battlefront II'' allows the players to take control of several heroes and villains based on iconic characters from across all the ''Star Wars'' movies. At launch, the hero roster included [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] ([[Misty Lee]]), [[Han Solo]] (John Armstrong), [[Chewbacca]], [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), [[Yoda]] ([[Tom Kane]]), and [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]), while the villain roster included [[Darth Vader]] ([[Matt Sloan (voice actor)|Matt Sloan]]), [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Sam Witwer]]), [[Boba Fett]] ([[Temuera Morrison]]), [[Bossk (Star Wars)|Bossk]] ([[Dee Bradley Baker]]), [[Iden Versio]] ([[Janina Gavankar]]), [[Darth Maul]] (Sam Witwer), and [[Kylo Ren]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]/[[Roger Craig Smith]]).\n\nThere are also several hero and villain ships, which at launch included Boba Fett's ''[[Slave I]]'', Darth Maul's ''[[Sith Infiltrator|Scimitar]]'', Darth Vader's [[TIE Advanced|TIE Advanced x1]], Han Solo and Chewbacca's ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', Iden Versio's [[TIE fighter|TIE/in Fighter]], Kylo Ren's TIE Silencer, Luke Skywalker's T-65B [[X-wing fighter|X-Wing]], [[Poe Dameron]]'s T-70 X-Wing, Rey and Chewbacca's ''Millennium Falcon'', and Yoda's [[Jedi interceptor|Actis-class Light Interceptor]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kae-JjbLsgA|title=Star Wars Battlefront II: Full Length Reveal Trailer|date=April 15, 2017|last=EA Star Wars|accessdate=April 16, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nNew heroes and hero ships from across all eras were added later on, including [[Tallie Lintra]]'s RZ-2 A-Wing, Lando Calrissian and [[L3-37]]'s ''Millennium Falcon'' (from ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''), [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[James Arnold Taylor]]), Anakin Skywalker ([[Matt Lanter]]), [[General Grievous]] (Matthew Wood), [[Count Dooku]] ([[Corey Burton]]), [[BB-8]] and [[BB-9E]].\n\n=== Progression System ===\nThe game features a progression system based on \"Star Cards\", which are unlocked as the player levels up with a specific class or hero and grant them specific benefits. Players level up by defeating enemies or completing objectives during each match. Each class or hero can have a maximum of three Star Cards equipped, and each Star Card can be leveled up to level 4, each level further increasing its benefits. There are also milestones, which grant the player rewards for completing specific tasks, or for simply leveling up with a class or a hero.\n\nFor the four base trooper classes, there are up to four unlockable weapons, which are unlocked by completing specific milestones and each have their particular advantages, such as improved range, damage or fire rate. Each weapon also comes with modifications, which improve specific stats and are also unlocked by completing milestones.\n\n=== Multiplayer modes ===\nThere are a total of twelve online multiplayer game modes, some of which are available to play only for a limited time, with the largest supporting up to 40 simultaneous players with 24 additional AI-controlled players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/26/star-wars-battlefront-2-multiplayer-maps-and-modes-revealed|title=Star Wars Battlefront 2: Multiplayer Maps and Modes Revealed|last=Osborn|first=Alex|date=September 26, 2017|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n*'''Galactic Assault''': This game mode is centered around unique set pieces set across the thirteen planets and locations featuring all three ''Star Wars'' eras involving a team of 20 attackers against 20 defenders, with the attackers having to complete a specific objective in order to progress, whereas the defenders have to stop them.\n*'''Supremacy''': This mode pits two teams of twenty players, with an additional 12 AI bots per team, against each other as they fight to capture and hold a majority of Command Posts which increase reinforcement count in order to attack the enemy team's capital ship and destroy it from within by capturing and destroying objectives. It is a new mode that was introduced in March 2019. The mode is currently available in the \"Age of the Republic\" and the \" Age of the Resistance\" eras, and will soon be available in as the \"Age of the Rebellion\".\n*'''Heroes vs. Villains''': This mode involves all the heroes and villains in ''Star Wars Battlefront II'', where four light side heroes fight four dark side villains. A deathmatch mode which involves one team of four hero's fighting against a team of four villains, with the first team to 35 kills wins. In the original game mode, one of the four heroes and one of the four villains are selected to be the target to attack. The first team to defeat the enemy team's chosen targets 10 times wins, however the target system was removed in May 2019 in favor of a new mode.\n*'''Co-op''': This game mode is a Player vs. Entity mode, pitting a team of four players and AI bots against another team of AI bots, the aim being to capture one of between one and three command posts on each of the three or four stages (depending on the map). The players can either attack or defend. This comes with an improvement in Battlefront's AI as the enemy bots can play as heroes and some reinforcements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/20/star-wars-battlefront-ii-2-update-new-modes-dlc-rise-of-skywalker/|title=Star Wars Battlefront II adding co-op, new maps and modes \u2013 TheSixthAxis|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n*'''Hero Showdown''': This mode involves teams of two heroes and two villains facing off in round-based duels with no respawn after defeat until the next round begins.

The first team to win three rounds wins. The mode was introduced to the game in July 2018.\n*'''Strike''': Strike has players battling in close quarter scenarios involving a team of eight attackers aiming to either capture a unique objective from a team of eight defenders \u2013 essentially one team [[capture the flag]] \u2013 or arm and destroy two objectives.\n*'''Blast''': Blast is a standard [[team deathmatch]] between two teams of eight players in which teams try to reach 100 total combined eliminations before the enemy team can.\n*'''Ewok Hunt''': This mode, introduced as part of the game's April update, has two Ewoks hunt down a group of eighteen stormtroopers; each stormtrooper defeated spawns as another Ewok.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/ewok-hunt-is-battlefront-2s-best-mode/|title=Ewok Hunt is Battlefront 2's best mode|last=Petitte|first=Omri|date=June 10, 2018|work=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref> It was on rotation with Jetpack Cargo originally as a limited time mode but was later made permanent.\n*'''Extraction''': This game mode, which was released on June 12, 2018, has an attacking team escort cargo through several checkpoints to their final destination while the defending team tries to stop them.

To win, the player's team must control the battlefront by securing the most command posts, thereby accruing points. Unlike the similar multiplayer mode \u2018Supremacy\u2019, the match ends when a team accrues the maximum number of points.\n*'''Custom Arcade:''' A smaller scale mode where players take on AI in a choice of Team Battles, Starfighter Battles, Onslaught or Starfighter Onslaught. Team Battles are where the player faces a small team of AI Troopers, while Starfighter Battles is where the player takes on a team of AI ships. Onslaught is where you pick a hero or villain, and you must wipe out the enemy team of AI Troopers in the time limit you choose, while Starfighter Onslaught is the same but with ships.\n*'''Battle Scenarios:''' A set of classic encounters across all eras of ''Star Wars'', which also grant the player rewards for the multiplayer experience.\n\nUnlike 2015's [[Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)|''Battlefront'']], the game also offers a single-player campaign. Its protagonist is Iden Versio, leader of an Imperial Special Forces group known as Inferno Squad, who participates in multiple events in the 30 years leading up to [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|''The Force Awakens'']]. There are segments in the campaign where the player is able to control other characters such as Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. Players can also play in the Arcade mode \u2013 an offline single player or local co-op where players can choose which side to play on and which battle to play in. Battles vary from team battles to onslaughts. Alternatively, players can choose to do a custom match, where they can change some of the settings and locations.\n\n=== Downloadable content ===\nInstead of the paid Season Pass [[downloadable content]] (DLC) seen in the game's 2015 predecessor, ''Battlefront II'' is expanded via free DLC provided to all players with a free EA account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2s-dlc-plans-hinted-in-origi/1100-6450714/|title=Star Wars Battlefront 2's DLC Plans Hinted in Origin Store Page|last=Strawhun|first=Aiden|date=June 10, 2017|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mash\" /> The DLC uses a seasonal structure similar to ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege|Rainbow Six Siege]]'', according to Gavankar.

Furthermore, a fourth season was released, based on the movie ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|The Rise of Skywalker]]'', and added the planet Ajan Kloss as a new ground map, new reinforcements for the Resistance and the First Order (the Ovissian Gunner, the Caphex Spy, a new First Order Jet Trooper, and the Sith Trooper), and later, in January 2020, BB-8 as a new hero and BB-9E as a villain. Starting with February 2020, new content for the original trilogy era was also released, including new reinforcements for the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire (the Ewok Hunter and the ISB Agent) and new weapons for all four base classes (the E-11D for the Assault, T-21 for Heavy, DL-18 for Officer and Cycler Rifle for Specialist, all of them returning from 2015's ''Battlefront''). A Scarif ground map, inspired by the movie ''[[Rogue One]]'', was also teased and is set to be released in \"mid-April\".<ref name=\"thesixthaxis.com\">https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/23/star-wars-battlefront-2-battle-of-scarif-update-delay-april-coronavirus-covid19/</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\nThe single-player story mode campaign in ''Star Wars Battlefront II'' takes place in the [[Star Wars galaxy|''Star Wars'' galaxy]], beginning around the time of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', but is mostly set between it and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''. The player assumes the role of [[Iden Versio]], the commander of an Imperial Special Forces [[commando]] unit called Inferno Squad, which consists of fellow members Del Meeko and Gideon Hask and is supervised by Iden's father, Admiral Garrick Versio. The campaign begins with the Battle of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]], where [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] plots to lure an unsuspecting [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] fleet into a trap using himself and the [[Death Star|Death Star II]] as bait, seeking to crush the [[Galactic Civil War|Rebellion]] against his [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] once and for all. Inferno Squad is crucial to the success of this plan, but the Empire underestimates the strength of the Rebellion, as its fleet gathers at [[Sullust]].\n\n===Plot===\n[[Iden Versio]] ([[Janina Gavankar]]) is being interrogated for the codes to unlock an Imperial transmission aboard a Rebel [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser]]. She activates her [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]], which sneaks to her cell and frees her. Iden had allowed herself to be captured in order to erase the Imperial transmission, which would reveal the Emperor's plan at Endor. She successfully erases it, then escapes the ship by launching herself into space where she is intercepted by the ''Corvus'', the flagship of Inferno Squad. Iden confirms the mission's success to Gideon Hask ([[Paul Blackthorne]]) and Del Meeko ([[TJ Ramini]]), other members of her squad.\n\nLater on Endor, Iden, Hask, and Del secure the perimeter around the ruined shield generator, and watch with shock and horror as the Death Star II explodes. Vice Admiral [[Rae Sloane|Sloane]] orders a full retreat, and Inferno Squad recovers [[TIE fighter]]s to escape the moon, which is being overrun by Rebel forces. The ''Corvus'' is attacked during their escape, but Inferno fends off the Rebel bombers. Iden then meets with her father, Admiral Garrick Versio ([[Anthony Skordi]]), on his [[Star Destroyer]], the ''Eviscerator''. Admiral Versio confirms to Iden that the Emperor has died, before a messenger droid displays a hologram of the late Emperor issuing his last command: to begin Operation: Cinder. Admiral Versio sends Iden to an Imperial shipyard over Fondor to protect Moff Raythe and his Star Destroyer, the ''Dauntless'', which hosts experimental satellites vital to the success of Operation: Cinder. The ''Dauntless'' comes under attack from a Rebel Star Cruiser, but Iden is able to board it with Hask and disable its ion cannons. Afterwards, they are ordered to attack the Imperial shipyard in order to free the Star Destroyer from the locked clamps, allowing it to open fire on the Rebel cruiser and destroy it.\n\nDel is sent to Pillio and ordered to destroy one of the Emperor's hidden bases. He encounters [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Matthew Mercer]]), who helps him disarm the base's defenses and fend off the local wildlife, before eventually entering the base and discovering that it contains the Emperor's spoils of conquest. Del and Luke part amicably, and the former begins to question the Empire's goals and motives. Following this, Iden and Inferno Squad are sent to the Imperial-controlled world of Vardos (and Iden's homeworld), in order to retrieve Protectorate Gleb. As the satellites for Operation Cinder begin destroying the planet with terrible storms, Iden and Meeko go against their orders and try to evacuate the civilians in addition to Gleb, causing Hask to betray them. Disillusioned by the Empire's attack on Vardos, Iden and Meeko escape off world, now traitors to the Empire. They seek out the Rebel Alliance and are taken to General [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), who gives them the choice to help stop Operation: Cinder, or to escape and make new lives for themselves. Choosing to help, they aid [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] ([[Misty Lee]]) in protecting [[Naboo]], destroying the satellites for Operation: Cinder and reactivating the planet's defenses. After Naboo is liberated, Inferno Squad joins the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]].\n\nSeveral months later, Inferno Squad, now consisting of Iden, Del and Shriv Suurgav (Dan Donohue), are sent by Leia to [[Takodana]] to find [[Han Solo]] (John Armstrong), who was extracting an Imperial defector carrying critical data in hopes of liberating [[Kashyyyk]] and freeing the [[Wookiee]]s. The data also reveals that Admiral Versio is commanding Imperial operations on [[Bespin]] and Sullust. Iden and Del infiltrate Bespin with the intent of capturing Admiral Versio, but are led into a trap by Hask, who escapes along with the Admiral. Iden and Del soon manage to escape from Bespin as well, destroying a Star Destroyer fuelling station in the process. Meanwhile, Lando and Shriv investigate the hidden Imperial weapons cache on Sullust, only to find a weapons factory, which they destroy.\n\nThese operations cripple the Imperial fleet, which makes a last stand at [[Jakku]]. During the battle, Iden shoots down Hask and boards the ''Eviscerator'', intending to rescue her father. Admiral Versio decides to [[The captain goes down with the ship|go down with his ship]], feeling obligated to die with the Empire he fought to protect, and urges Iden to escape and live a new life, commending her for seeing the weakness of the Empire. Iden takes an escape pod and reunites with Del at the end of the battle. The two embrace and kiss, as the battle marks the end of the Galactic Empire.\n\nThree decades later, Del is captured on Pillio by Protectorate Gleb, who hands him over to [[Kylo Ren]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]) and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]]. Ren uses the Force to interrogate Del about the location of the map leading to Luke Skywalker. After succeeding, he leaves Del in the custody of Hask, who survived getting shot down at Jakku years prior. Hask expresses disgust at Del choosing to father a daughter with Iden instead of becoming a soldier and kills him, but not before Del warns him not to confront Iden. Hask then warns Gleb that the Republic cannot find out about \"Project Resurrection\" and orders her to leave the ''Corvus'' on Pillio as bait to lure Iden out of hiding.\n\n===Resurrection===\nShriv Suurgav, now an agent for the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]], discovers the abandoned ''Corvus'' and informs Iden and her daughter, Zay (Brittany Volcy). Shriv also reveals that Del had been helping the Resistance investigate rumors of mass disappearances that may be connected to Project Resurrection before disappearing himself. They head to Athulla, where Del was last seen, to investigate. However, they are ambushed by a Jinata Security fleet. Iden and Zay destroy the fleet and capture the flagship. The surviving Jinata Security crew admit that they had been kidnapping children on the behalf of the First Order, and that Project Resurrection had been moved to Vardos.\n\nThe group travels to Vardos, where Iden has Zay stay behind on the ''Corvus'' while she and Shriv investigate the surface. After seeing a bright streak of red light appear in the sky, Iden and Shriv discover Gleb's dead body and are then captured by Hask, who taunts them by telling them that he killed Gleb and Del and that the First Order has already destroyed the Senate and the Hosnian system (the capital of the New Republic), revealing that the red streak of light seen earlier was actually the deadly blast of [[Starkiller Base]] (as seen in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens#Plot|The Force Awakens]]''). He then orders his Star Destroyer, the ''Retribution'', to destroy the ''Corvus'' along with Zay. Jinata Security personnel, angry at the First Order for betraying them, attack Hask's men, giving Iden and Shriv an opportunity to escape. They rescue Zay, who managed to eject in an escape pod before the ''Corvus'' was destroyed.\n\nIden fights her desire to get revenge on Hask, then resolves to board the ''Retribution'' to investigate what the First Order had been up to. After getting aboard by flying stolen TIE Fighters into its engine, Iden, Shriv and Zay search the ''Retribution'' for any useful data from the ship to aid the Resistance, fending off the ship's personnel along the way. They hack a computer terminal and discover that Project Resurrection is an operation by the First Order to kidnap children from across the galaxy and indoctrinate them into [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]]. In addition, they discover that the First Order has built up a massive fleet large enough to retake the galaxy. Finally, they find the plans for a First Order Dreadnought and steal them. Shriv then goes to secure an escape craft while Iden and Zay plant explosive charges on the ''Retribution'''s hyperspace generators. Hask ambushes them but is killed by Iden. The destruction of the hyperspace generators pulls the ''Retribution'' out of hyperspace near Starkiller Base just as the Resistance destroys it. Iden reveals that she had been mortally wounded during the battle with Hask and gives the Dreadnought plans to Zay, ordering her to escape without her before dying.\n\nZay and Shriv link up with the Resistance and transmit the Dreadnought plans to General Leia. She then orders them to head to the Outer Rim to gather more allies.\n\n==Post-launch content==\nIt was confirmed during EA Play 2017 that there would not be a season pass; rather, all downloadable content will be free for all players and will be included in events called Seasons.<ref name=\"EAPlayLive\">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Bta5UNTHw|title=E3 2017: EA Press Conference and EA Play \u2013 IGN LIVE|accessdate=June 11, 2017|author=IGN|date=June 10, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Last Jedi'' Season ===\nThe first Season expansion, ''The Last Jedi'' Season, was released on December 5 and is centered around [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']], the eighth film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga which was released on December 15, 2017.

Progression for player abilities, or \"Star Cards,\" is now linear as players must play a certain class or hero in order to unlock a \"Skill Point\" for that trooper or hero, which can then be used to purchase a new card or upgrade one the player already owns.
