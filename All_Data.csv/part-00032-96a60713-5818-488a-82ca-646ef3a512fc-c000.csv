==Early life==
Tanveer “Tan” Wasim Safdar was born and raised in [[Doncaster, South Yorkshire]], England, to Muslim [[Pakistani]] parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/money/5162475/queer-eye-tan-france/|title='Queer Eye' Star Says Getting Dumped Helped Launch His Career|first=Kristen|last=Bahler|work=Time|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> France was raised in a very strict [[Muslims|Muslim]] household where homosexuality was  viewed negatively in his upbringing. \"The word gay was never mentioned in my parents' home\". France discussed how the lack of representation in media and everyday life by his community and specifically LGBTQ south Asian people caused alienation. France’s interest in fashion began at a young age, inspired by the [[Disney]] clothing that was made in his grandparents' [[denim]] factory in Bury, England.<ref name=\"herald\" /><ref name=\"omika\">{{cite web|url=https://www.omika.com.au/blog/tan-safdar-owner-designer-at-kingdom-state/|title=An interview with Tan Safdar, Owner and Designer at Kingdom & State|author=Melody|website=Omika|date=8 December 2014|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>  By age thirteen, he had learned how to construct and embellish a denim jacket; in 2019, he learned his grandfather had to close the factory due to the products being Disney [[knockoffs]].<ref>Interview, Wednesday, 06 January 2020 episode with [[Jane Fonda]]; [[The Late Show With Stephen Colbert]].</ref> He attended [[Hall Cross School]] and later [[Doncaster College]] where he studied fashion,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.out.com/television/2017/12/08/meet-five-fab-men-netflixs-queer-eye-reboot|title=Meet the Five Fab Men of Netflix's ''Queer Eye'' Reboot|first=Chris|last=Thomas|journal=Out|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> before moving to [[Manchester]], and then to London.<ref name=mic>{{cite journal|url=https://mic.com/articles/188056/tan-france-on-his-hopes-for-a-second-season-of-queer-eye-and-the-thousands-of-dms-about-his-hair#.Nhbi7vgbZ|title=Tan France on his hopes for a second season of Queer Eye and the thousands of DMs about his hair|first=Tim|last=Mulkerin|journal=Mic|date=21 February 2018|accessdate=10 March 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating from college, France began working for [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]]<ref name=\"omika\" />, [[Selfridges]] & [[Bershka]], among other retailers, to improve his knowledge of the wholesale business of retail, later progressing to work at [[Chanel]] in order to learn more about manufacturing. \"I wanted to diversify my experience, learning everything from design to delivery to wholesale.\" He became managing director in his early twenties.<ref name=\"herald\" /> France was company director at Shade Clothing before he opened his solo company.<ref name=\"omika\" />

France began working in the United States in 2008 and [[emigrated]] to the US in 2015<ref name=\"mic\" />. In late 2011, France founded a women's clothing line, Kingdom & State<ref>{{cite web|title=Kingdom & State – About|url=http://www.kingdomandstate.com/about/|website=Kingdom & State|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> which included clothing designed to meet [[Mormons|Mormon]] clothing guidelines. “I wanted to create a brand that you couldn’t tell was modest clothing for Mormons,” France says. “These girls were cute and wanted to be fashionable. I wanted to create a London look for them that just so happened to cover the areas of their bodies they had to cover as Mormon women. And that’s where it took off really well [in Utah], really quickly.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crummy |first1=Colin |title=Queer Eye's Tan France: 'The word gay was never mentioned in my parents' home' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/09/queer-eye-tan-france-the-word-gay-was-never-mentioned-in-my-parents-home |website=The Guardian |accessdate=4 March 2020 |date=9 March 2019}}</ref>.

==Books==
France released a memoir, ''Naturally Tan'', in June 2019 through [[St. Martin's Press]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Amazon.ca |title=Naturally Tan |id={{ASIN|1250208661|country=ca}} }}</ref> It is about his experience growing up \"gay in a traditional [[Muslim]] family, as one of the few people of colour in [[Doncaster, England]]\". The memoir starts with Tan's childhood in England where episodes of racism were an everyday occurrence, like having to run back to school to avoid getting beat up by racist thugs. The book follows up with heavy topics such as colorism within the south Asian community and the islamophobia he faced before and after the [[September 11 attacks]]. For more lighthearted episodes of Tan's life he describes his first trip to NYC, how he got involved in fashion, how he secretly and hilariously switched major course and how he fell in love with his husband. He also writes about \"his winding journey of coming of age, finding his voice (and style!), and how he finally came out to his family at the age of 34, revealing that he was happily married to the love of his life: a Mormon cowboy from [[Salt Lake City]].\" <ref>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40174034-naturally-tan</ref>

==Early life==
Tanveer “Tan” Wasim Safdar was born and raised in [[Doncaster, South Yorkshire]], England, to Muslim [[Pakistani]] parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/money/5162475/queer-eye-tan-france/|title='Queer Eye' Star Says Getting Dumped Helped Launch His Career|first=Kristen|last=Bahler|work=Time|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> France was raised in a very strict [[Muslims|Muslim]] household where homosexuality was  viewed negatively in his upbringing. \"The word gay was never mentioned in my parents' home\". France discussed how the lack of representation in media and everyday life by his community and specifically LGBTQ south Asian people caused alienation. France’s interest in fashion began at a young age, inspired by the [[Disney]] clothing that was made in his grandparents' [[denim]] factory in Bury, England.<ref name=\"herald\" /><ref name=\"omika\">{{cite web|url=https://www.omika.com.au/blog/tan-safdar-owner-designer-at-kingdom-state/|title=An interview with Tan Safdar, Owner and Designer at Kingdom & State|author=Melody|website=Omika|date=8 December 2014|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>  By age thirteen, he had learned how to construct and embellish a denim jacket; in 2019, he learned his grandfather had to close the factory due to the products being Disney [[knockoffs]].<ref>Interview, Wednesday, 06 January 2020 episode with [[Jane Fonda]]; [[The Late Show With Stephen Colbert]].</ref> He attended [[Hall Cross School]] and later [[Doncaster College]] where he studied fashion,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.out.com/television/2017/12/08/meet-five-fab-men-netflixs-queer-eye-reboot|title=Meet the Five Fab Men of Netflix's ''Queer Eye'' Reboot|first=Chris|last=Thomas|journal=Out|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> before moving to [[Manchester]], and then to London.<ref name=mic>{{cite journal|url=https://mic.com/articles/188056/tan-france-on-his-hopes-for-a-second-season-of-queer-eye-and-the-thousands-of-dms-about-his-hair#.Nhbi7vgbZ|title=Tan France on his hopes for a second season of Queer Eye and the thousands of DMs about his hair|first=Tim|last=Mulkerin|journal=Mic|date=21 February 2018|accessdate=10 March 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating from college, France began working for [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]]<ref name=\"omika\" />, [[Selfridges]] & [[Bershka]], among other retailers, to improve his knowledge of the wholesale business of retail, later progressing to work at [[Chanel]] in order to learn more about manufacturing. \"I wanted to diversify my experience, learning everything from design to delivery to wholesale.\" He became managing director in his early twenties.<ref name=\"herald\" /> France was company director at Shade Clothing before he opened his solo company.<ref name=\"omika\" />

France began working in the United States in 2008 and [[emigrated]] to the US in 2015<ref name=\"mic\" />. In late 2011, France founded a women's clothing line, Kingdom & State<ref>{{cite web|title=Kingdom & State – About|url=http://www.kingdomandstate.com/about/|website=Kingdom & State|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> which included clothing designed to meet [[Mormons|Mormon]] clothing guidelines. “I wanted to create a brand that you couldn’t tell was modest clothing for Mormons,” France says. “These girls were cute and wanted to be fashionable. I wanted to create a London look for them that just so happened to cover the areas of their bodies they had to cover as Mormon women. And that’s where it took off really well [in Utah], really quickly.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crummy |first1=Colin |title=Queer Eye's Tan France: 'The word gay was never mentioned in my parents' home' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/09/queer-eye-tan-france-the-word-gay-was-never-mentioned-in-my-parents-home |website=The Guardian |accessdate=4 March 2020 |date=9 March 2019}}</ref>.

==Books==
France released a memoir, ''Naturally Tan'', in June 2019 through [[St. Martin's Press]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Amazon.ca |title=Naturally Tan |id={{ASIN|1250208661|country=ca}} }}</ref> It is about his experience growing up \"gay in a traditional [[Muslim]] family, as one of the few people of colour in [[Doncaster, England]]\". The memoir starts with Tan's childhood in England where episodes of racism were an everyday occurrence, like having to run back to school to avoid getting beat up by racist thugs. The book follows up with heavy topics such as colorism within the south Asian community and the islamophobia he faced before and after the [[September 11 attacks]]. For more lighthearted episodes of Tan's life he describes his first trip to NYC, how he got involved in fashion, how he secretly and hilariously switched major course and how he fell in love with his husband. He also writes about \"his winding journey of coming of age, finding his voice (and style!), and how he finally came out to his family at the age of 34, revealing that he was happily married to the love of his life: a Mormon cowboy from [[Salt Lake City]].\" <ref>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40174034-naturally-tan</ref>

==History==
[[File:Lakeville MA Ancient House.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient House in Lakeville]]
Lakeville was settled in 1717 as a western parish of [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]].  It was incorporated as a separate town in 1853.  The town's name comes from the system of lakes in the town, including [[Assawompset Pond]], [[Great Quittacas Pond]], [[Little Quittacas Pond]], [[Pocksha Pond]], and [[Long Pond (Lakeville, Massachusetts)|Long Pond]].  Long Pond is the source of the [[Acushnet River]], and Assawompsett Pond is the source of the [[Nemasket River]], which feeds the [[Taunton River]]. [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] is headquartered in Lakeville.  Lakeville is also commonly referred to as \"The Promised Land.\"

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|93.6|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|76.6|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|17.0|km2|order=flip}}, or 18.17%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Kingston town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>  Lakeville is irregularly shaped, bordered by [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] to the northeast and east, [[Rochester, Massachusetts|Rochester]] to the southeast, [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] to the south and southwest, and [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]] and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] to the west.  Its borders with Taunton, Berkley and Freetown are also a central section of the western borders of Plymouth County.  Lakeville is roughly at the center of what is considered Southeastern Massachusetts, and is approximately {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], {{convert|20|mi}} north of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], {{convert|30|mi}} east of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and {{convert|40|mi}} south of [[Boston]].

The town's geography is dominated by its namesake lakes, which are referred to as \"ponds\" in general usage.  In addition to the main bodies of water and their feeder brooks and rivers, there are also several smaller ponds, as well as many brooks and swamps, including the Casual Swamp and the Cedar Swamp, which is protected as a part of the Assonet Cedar Swamp Wildlife Management Area, which is operated by the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]].  There are also several small conservation areas, four country clubs and two parks, including the Ted Williams Camp, which was once the site of a summer baseball camp run by [[Ted Williams]]. According to \"Lakeville, Massachusetts Gravestone Inscriptions 1711-2003\" by Jean Douillette, there are 31 known cemeteries in Lakeville, or almost 1 per square mile.

The body of [[John Sassamon]], advisor to Governor [[Josiah Winslow]], was discovered beneath the ice of Assawompsett Pond. He was believed to have been murdered, and three Native Americans were arrested. On the testimony of only one witness (contrary to English law, which required the testimony of at least two witnesses in a murder trial), the three were sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. When the sentence was carried out, Tobias, senior counselor to the [[Pokanoket]] sachem [[Metacomet|King Philip]], and a second supposed accomplice died. When the attempt was made to carry out the sentence on the third \"accomplice\" - Tobias's son - the rope broke and he was imprisoned, having first confessed to the killings. His confession is widely believed to have been coerced.

The death of John Sassamon and the subsequent trial and execution of the Native Americans - while not the cause of [[King Philip's War]] and the bloodshed that followed - nonetheless probably contributed to the ardor of the participants.

[[File:Lakeville MA Town Hall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lakeville Town Hall]]
Lakeville is governed with the [[Open Town Meeting]] form of government, and is led by a town administrator and a [[board of selectmen]].  The town has its own police department and a single [[fire station]], located next to the town hall.  The \"new\" library is located behind the old town hall, just across Route 18 from its former location at the junction of Routes 18 and 105.  The town of Lakeville also has other services, such as a Council on Aging and a historical commission.

On the state level, Lakeville is represented in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] as a part of the Twelfth Bristol District.  The town is represented by Senator [[Michael J. Rodrigues]] (D-Westport), as a part of the First Bristol and Plymouth District, which also includes Fall River, Freetown, Rochester, Somerset, Swansea and Westport.<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/legis/citytown.htm Index of Legislative Representation by City and Town, from Mass.gov]</ref><ref>[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&L=5&L0=Home&L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&L2=Law+Enforcement&L3=State+Police+Troops&L4=Troop+D&sid=Eeops&b=terminalcontent&f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_d_msp_field_troop_d_station_d4&csid=Eeops Station D-4, SP Middleborough]</ref>

On the national level, Lakeville is a part of [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district]], and is currently represented by [[Joseph P. Kennedy III]].  The state's senior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class I]]) member of the [[United States Senate]], elected in 2012, is [[Elizabeth Warren]]. The junior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class II]]) senator, elected in 2013, is [[Ed Markey]].

==Education==
Since 1959, Lakeville has shared its school department with Freetown, creating the Freetown - Lakeville Regional School District. Lakeville operates several schools for its school aged population.  [[Assawompsett Elementary School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grades K-3.  The [[George R. Austin Intermediate School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grade 4 and 5.  [[Freetown-Lakeville Middle School]] is operated jointly with Freetown for grades 6-8, and [[Apponequet Regional High School]] is jointly operated with Freetown for grades 9-12.  Apponequet's colors are navy, white, and red, their nickname is the \"Lakers,\" and their mascot was a [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] brave, but after a sensitivity issue among the faculty at Apponequet, it was changed to an \"A\".  The school, like several others in the region, used to use the spear logo made famous by [[Florida State University]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] for its athletics marks, but this was deemed to promote violence, so it was replaced with the \"A\".  Their teams compete in the South Coast Conference, and their chief rival is Old Rochester Regional High School in Mattapoisett.

==Transportation==
[[Massachusetts Route 140]], a four-lane divided highway, passes through the town on its trip between [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] in nearby [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] and [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island–Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The town is also crossed by [[Massachusetts Route 18|Route 18]], [[Massachusetts Route 79|Route 79]] and [[Massachusetts Route 105|Route 105]], as well as a short, {{convert|0.4|mi|adj=on}} stretch of [[U.S. Route 44]] in the far northern point of town.  Route 79's eastern terminus is at its intersection with Route 105 on the town line.  Additionally, three exits of [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] are located just over the town line in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]], granting access to Routes 44, 18 and 105 (from north to south in order).

In addition to its highways, the terminus of the Middleborough-Lakeville Line of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA's]] commuter rail is along the town's border (the rail itself passes along the town line; the parking lots are entirely within Lakeville).  There is also a spur off that line, heading due west to Taunton, which is operated by [[CSX Transportation]].  This spur links the two main lines of the railroad in southeastern Massachusetts; the easternmost heads to [[Cape Cod]] via the line used by the MBTA, and the westernmost proceeds to split in Taunton, sending two lines towards [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and New Bedford, respectively.  The New Bedford line also passes through the town on its west side.  The town has no air facilities of its own.  The nearest private airfield is in Taunton; the nearest regional airport is in New Bedford, and the nearest national and international airport is [[T. F. Green Airport]] in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]].

'''Lakeville''' is a town in [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]], [[Massachusetts]], United States. The population was 10,602 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Lakeville town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Lakeville MA Ancient House.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient House in Lakeville]]
Lakeville was settled in 1717 as a western parish of [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]].  It was incorporated as a separate town in 1853.  The town's name comes from the system of lakes in the town, including [[Assawompset Pond]], [[Great Quittacas Pond]], [[Little Quittacas Pond]], [[Pocksha Pond]], and [[Long Pond (Lakeville, Massachusetts)|Long Pond]].  Long Pond is the source of the [[Acushnet River]], and Assawompsett Pond is the source of the [[Nemasket River]], which feeds the [[Taunton River]]. [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] is headquartered in Lakeville.  Lakeville is also commonly referred to as \"The Promised Land.\"

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|93.6|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|76.6|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|17.0|km2|order=flip}}, or 18.17%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Kingston town, Plymouth County, Massachusetts| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>  Lakeville is irregularly shaped, bordered by [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] to the northeast and east, [[Rochester, Massachusetts|Rochester]] to the southeast, [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] to the south and southwest, and [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]] and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] to the west.  Its borders with Taunton, Berkley and Freetown are also a central section of the western borders of Plymouth County.  Lakeville is roughly at the center of what is considered Southeastern Massachusetts, and is approximately {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], {{convert|20|mi}} north of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], {{convert|30|mi}} east of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and {{convert|40|mi}} south of [[Boston]].

The town's geography is dominated by its namesake lakes, which are referred to as \"ponds\" in general usage.  In addition to the main bodies of water and their feeder brooks and rivers, there are also several smaller ponds, as well as many brooks and swamps, including the Casual Swamp and the Cedar Swamp, which is protected as a part of the Assonet Cedar Swamp Wildlife Management Area, which is operated by the [[Massachusetts Audubon Society]].  There are also several small conservation areas, four country clubs and two parks, including the Ted Williams Camp, which was once the site of a summer baseball camp run by [[Ted Williams]]. According to \"Lakeville, Massachusetts Gravestone Inscriptions 1711-2003\" by Jean Douillette, there are 31 known cemeteries in Lakeville, or almost 1 per square mile.

The body of [[John Sassamon]], advisor to Governor [[Josiah Winslow]], was discovered beneath the ice of Assawompsett Pond. He was believed to have been murdered, and three Native Americans were arrested. On the testimony of only one witness (contrary to English law, which required the testimony of at least two witnesses in a murder trial), the three were sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. When the sentence was carried out, Tobias, senior counselor to the [[Pokanoket]] sachem [[Metacomet|King Philip]], and a second supposed accomplice died. When the attempt was made to carry out the sentence on the third \"accomplice\" - Tobias's son - the rope broke and he was imprisoned, having first confessed to the killings. His confession is widely believed to have been coerced.

The death of John Sassamon and the subsequent trial and execution of the Native Americans - while not the cause of [[King Philip's War]] and the bloodshed that followed - nonetheless probably contributed to the ardor of the participants.

==Government==
[[File:Lakeville MA Town Hall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lakeville Town Hall]]
Lakeville is governed with the [[Open Town Meeting]] form of government, and is led by a town administrator and a [[board of selectmen]].  The town has its own police department and a single [[fire station]], located next to the town hall.  The \"new\" library is located behind the old town hall, just across Route 18 from its former location at the junction of Routes 18 and 105.  The town of Lakeville also has other services, such as a Council on Aging and a historical commission.

On the state level, Lakeville is represented in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] as a part of the Twelfth Bristol District.  The town is represented by Senator [[Michael J. Rodrigues]] (D-Westport), as a part of the First Bristol and Plymouth District, which also includes Fall River, Freetown, Rochester, Somerset, Swansea and Westport.<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/legis/citytown.htm Index of Legislative Representation by City and Town, from Mass.gov]</ref><ref>[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&L=5&L0=Home&L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&L2=Law+Enforcement&L3=State+Police+Troops&L4=Troop+D&sid=Eeops&b=terminalcontent&f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_d_msp_field_troop_d_station_d4&csid=Eeops Station D-4, SP Middleborough]</ref>

On the national level, Lakeville is a part of [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district]], and is currently represented by [[Joseph P. Kennedy III]].  The state's senior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class I]]) member of the [[United States Senate]], elected in 2012, is [[Elizabeth Warren]]. The junior ([[Classes of United States Senators#Class I|Class II]]) senator, elected in 2013, is [[Ed Markey]].

==Education==
Since 1959, Lakeville has shared its school department with Freetown, creating the Freetown - Lakeville Regional School District. Lakeville operates several schools for its school aged population.  [[Assawompsett Elementary School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grades K-3.  The [[George R. Austin Intermediate School]] is operated jointly with [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] for grade 4 and 5.  [[Freetown-Lakeville Middle School]] is operated jointly with Freetown for grades 6-8, and [[Apponequet Regional High School]] is jointly operated with Freetown for grades 9-12.  Apponequet's colors are navy, white, and red, their nickname is the \"Lakers,\" and their mascot was a [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] brave, but after a sensitivity issue among one of the faculty at Apponequet, it was changed to an \"A\".  The school, like several others in the region, used to use the spear logo made famous by [[Florida State University]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] for its athletics marks, but this was deemed to promote violence, so it was replaced with the \"A\".  Their teams compete in the South Coast Conference, and their chief rival is Old Rochester Regional High School in Mattapoisett.

==Transportation==
[[Massachusetts Route 140]], a four-lane divided highway, passes through the town on its trip between [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] in nearby [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] and [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island–Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The town is also crossed by [[Massachusetts Route 18|Route 18]], [[Massachusetts Route 79|Route 79]] and [[Massachusetts Route 105|Route 105]], as well as a short, {{convert|0.4|mi|adj=on}} stretch of [[U.S. Route 44]] in the far northern point of town.  Route 79's eastern terminus is at its intersection with Route 105 on the town line.  Additionally, three exits of [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] are located just over the town line in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]], granting access to Routes 44, 18 and 105 (from north to south in order).

In addition to its highways, the terminus of the Middleborough-Lakeville Line of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA's]] commuter rail is along the town's border (the rail itself passes along the town line; the parking lots are entirely within Lakeville).  There is also a spur off that line, heading due west to Taunton, which is operated by [[CSX Transportation]].  This spur links the two main lines of the railroad in southeastern Massachusetts; the easternmost heads to [[Cape Cod]] via the line used by the MBTA, and the westernmost proceeds to split in Taunton, sending two lines towards [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and New Bedford, respectively.  The New Bedford line also passes through the town on its west side.  The town has no air facilities of its own.  The nearest private airfield is in Taunton; the nearest regional airport is in New Bedford, and the nearest national and international airport is [[T. F. Green Airport]] in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]].

==Early life==
Tanveer “Tan” Wasim Safdar was born and raised in [[Doncaster, South Yorkshire]], England, to Muslim [[Pakistani]] parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/money/5162475/queer-eye-tan-france/|title='Queer Eye' Star Says Getting Dumped Helped Launch His Career|first=Kristen|last=Bahler|work=Time|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> France was raised in a very strict [[Muslims|Muslim]] household where homosexuality was  viewed negatively in his upbringing. \"The word gay was never mentioned in my parents' home\". France discussed how the lack of representation in media and everyday life by his community and specifically LGBTQ south Asian people caused alienation. France’s interest in fashion began at a young age, inspired by the [[Disney]] clothing that was made in his grandparents' [[denim]] factory in Bury, England.<ref name=\"herald\" /><ref name=\"omika\">{{cite web|url=https://www.omika.com.au/blog/tan-safdar-owner-designer-at-kingdom-state/|title=An interview with Tan Safdar, Owner and Designer at Kingdom & State|author=Melody|website=Omika|date=8 December 2014|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>  By age thirteen, he had learned how to construct and embellish a denim jacket; in 2019, he learned his grandfather had to close the factory due to the products being Disney [[knockoffs]].<ref>Interview, Wednesday, 06 January 2020 episode with [[Jane Fonda]]; [[The Late Show With Stephen Colbert]].</ref> He attended [[Hall Cross School]] and later [[Doncaster College]] where he studied fashion,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.out.com/television/2017/12/08/meet-five-fab-men-netflixs-queer-eye-reboot|title=Meet the Five Fab Men of Netflix's ''Queer Eye'' Reboot|first=Chris|last=Thomas|journal=Out|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> before moving to [[Manchester]], and then to London.<ref name=mic>{{cite journal|url=https://mic.com/articles/188056/tan-france-on-his-hopes-for-a-second-season-of-queer-eye-and-the-thousands-of-dms-about-his-hair#.Nhbi7vgbZ|title=Tan France on his hopes for a second season of Queer Eye and the thousands of DMs about his hair|first=Tim|last=Mulkerin|journal=Mic|date=21 February 2018|accessdate=10 March 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating from college, France began working for [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]]<ref name=\"omika\" />, [[Selfridges]] & [[Bershka]], among other retailers, to improve his knowledge of the wholesale business of retail, later progressing to work at [[Chanel]] in order to learn more about manufacturing. \"I wanted to diversify my experience, learning everything from design to delivery to wholesale.\" He became managing director in his early twenties.<ref name=\"herald\" /> France was company director at Shade Clothing before he opened his solo company.<ref name=\"omika\" />

France began working in the United States in 2008 and [[emigrated]] to the US in 2015<ref name=\"mic\" />. In late 2011, France founded a women's clothing line, Kingdom & State<ref>{{cite web|title=Kingdom & State – About|url=http://www.kingdomandstate.com/about/|website=Kingdom & State|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> which included clothing designed to meet [[Mormons|Mormon]] clothing guidelines. “I wanted to create a brand that you couldn’t tell was modest clothing for Mormons,” France says. “These girls were cute and wanted to be fashionable. I wanted to create a London look for them that just so happened to cover the areas of their bodies they had to cover as Mormon women.

==Books==
France released a memoir, ''Naturally Tan'', in June 2019 through [[St. Martin's Press]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Amazon.ca |title=Naturally Tan |id={{ASIN|1250208661|country=ca}} }}</ref> It is about his experience growing up \"gay in a traditional [[Muslim]] family, as one of the few people of colour in [[Doncaster, England]]\". The memoir starts with Tan's childhood in England where episodes of racism were an everyday occurrence, like having to run back to school to avoid getting beat up by racist thugs. The book follows up with heavy topics such as colorism within the south Asian community and the islamophobia he faced before and after the [[September 11 attacks]]. For more lighthearted episodes of Tan's life he describes his first trip to NYC, how he got involved in fashion, how he secretly and hilariously switched major course and how he fell in love with his husband. He also writes about \"his winding journey of coming of age, finding his voice (and style!), and how he finally came out to his family at the age of 34, revealing that he was happily married to the love of his life: a Mormon cowboy from [[Salt Lake City]].\" <ref>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40174034-naturally-tan</ref>

==Early life==
Tanveer “Tan” Wasim Safdar was born and raised in [[Doncaster, South Yorkshire]], England, to Muslim [[Pakistani]] parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/money/5162475/queer-eye-tan-france/|title='Queer Eye' Star Says Getting Dumped Helped Launch His Career|first=Kristen|last=Bahler|work=Time|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> France was raised in a very strict [[Muslims|Muslim]] household where homosexuality was  viewed negatively in his upbringing. \"The word gay was never mentioned in my parents' home\". France discussed how the lack of representation in media and everyday life by his community and specifically LGBTQ south Asian people caused alienation. France’s interest in fashion began at a young age, inspired by the [[Disney]] clothing that was made in his grandparents' [[denim]] factory in Bury, England.<ref name=\"herald\" /><ref name=\"omika\">{{cite web|url=https://www.omika.com.au/blog/tan-safdar-owner-designer-at-kingdom-state/|title=An interview with Tan Safdar, Owner and Designer at Kingdom & State|author=Melody|website=Omika|date=8 December 2014|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>  By age thirteen, he had learned how to construct and embellish a denim jacket; in 2019, he learned his grandfather had to close the factory due to the products being Disney [[knockoffs]].<ref>Interview, Wednesday, 06 January 2020 episode with [[Jane Fonda]]; [[The Late Show With Stephen Colbert]].</ref> He attended [[Hall Cross School]] and later [[Doncaster College]] where he studied fashion,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.out.com/television/2017/12/08/meet-five-fab-men-netflixs-queer-eye-reboot|title=Meet the Five Fab Men of Netflix's ''Queer Eye'' Reboot|first=Chris|last=Thomas|journal=Out|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> before moving to [[Manchester]], and then to London.<ref name=mic>{{cite journal|url=https://mic.com/articles/188056/tan-france-on-his-hopes-for-a-second-season-of-queer-eye-and-the-thousands-of-dms-about-his-hair#.Nhbi7vgbZ|title=Tan France on his hopes for a second season of Queer Eye and the thousands of DMs about his hair|first=Tim|last=Mulkerin|journal=Mic|date=21 February 2018|accessdate=10 March 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating from college, France began working for [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]].<ref name=\"omika\" /> He has also worked for [[Selfridges]], [[Bershka]], among other retailers to learn more about the wholesale business side, and finally [[Chanel]] to learn more about manufacturing. \"I wanted to diversify my experience, learning everything from design to delivery to wholesale.\" He became managing director in his early twenties.<ref name=\"herald\" /> France was company director at Shade Clothing before he opened his solo company.<ref name=\"omika\" />

France started working in the United States in 2008 and moved to the US in 2015.<ref name=\"mic\" /> In late 2011, France founded a women's clothing line, Kingdom & State.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kingdom & State – About|url=http://www.kingdomandstate.com/about/|website=Kingdom & State|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> The clothing designed by France includes items that meet [[Mormons|Mormon]] clothing guidelines. “I wanted to create a brand that you couldn’t tell was modest clothing for Mormons,” France says. “These girls were cute and wanted to be fashionable. I wanted to create a London look for them that just so happened to cover the areas of their bodies they had to cover as Mormon women. And that’s where it took off really well [in Utah], really quickly.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crummy |first1=Colin |title=Queer Eye's Tan France: 'The word gay was never mentioned in my parents' home' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/09/queer-eye-tan-france-the-word-gay-was-never-mentioned-in-my-parents-home |website=The Guardian |accessdate=4 March 2020 |date=9 March 2019}}</ref>

==Books==
France released a memoir, ''Naturally Tan'', in June 2019 through [[St. Martin's Press]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Amazon.ca |title=Naturally Tan |id={{ASIN|1250208661|country=ca}} }}</ref> It is about his experience growing up \"gay in a traditional [[Muslim]] family, as one of the few people of colour in [[Doncaster, England]]\". The memoir starts with Tan's childhood in England where episodes of racism were an everyday occurrence, like having to run back to school to avoid getting beat up by racist thugs. The book follows up with heavy topics such as colorism within the south Asian community and the islamophobia he faced before and after the [[September 11 attacks]]. For more lighthearted episodes of Tan's life he describes his first trip to NYC, how he got involved in fashion, how he secretly and hilariously switched major course and how he fell in love with his husband. He also writes about \"his winding journey of coming of age, finding his voice (and style!), and how he finally came out to his family at the age of 34, revealing that he was happily married to the love of his life: a Mormon cowboy from [[Salt Lake City]].\" <ref>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40174034-naturally-tan</ref>

== Name ==
Beitar Illit, (lit. Upper Beitar) is named after the ancient Jewish city of [[Betar (fortress)|Betar]], whose ruins lie {{convert|1|km|mi}} away.

== History ==
According to the [[Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem|ARIJ]], Beitar Illit was established in 1985 on land which Israel had confiscated from two nearby [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] villages: 3,140 [[dunam]]s from [[Husan]]<ref>[http://vprofile.arij.org/bethlehem/pdfs/VP/Husan_vp_en.pdf Husan Village Profile], ARIJ, p. 17</ref> and 1,166 dunams from [[Nahalin]].<ref>[http://vprofile.arij.org/bethlehem/pdfs/VP/Nahhalin_vp_en.pdf Nahhalin Village Profile], ARIJ, p. 18</ref>

It was established by a small group of young families from the [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]] [[yeshiva]] of [[Machon Meir]]. The first residents settled in 1990.<ref name=tzoren>Tzoren, Moshe Michael. \"Some Talk Peace, Others Live It\". ''[[Hamodia]]'' Israel News, November 21, 2018, pp. A18-A19.</ref> As Beitar Illit began to grow, an influx of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobover]] families came to predominate, while the original group moved on. The city is now home to many [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups, including Bobov, [[Boston (Hasidic dynasty)|Boston]], [[Boyan (Hasidic dynasty)|Boyan]], [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], [[Karlin-Stolin (Hasidic dynasty)|Karlin-Stolin]] and [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonim]]. The city has expanded to three adjacent hills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Geography ==
Beitar Illit lies in the northern Judean Hills<ref name=\"govisitisrael1\"/> at about 700 m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It is located just west of the intersection of [[Highway 60 (Israel–Palestine)|Route 60]], the north–south artery which roughly follows the [[Water divide|watershed]] from [[Nazareth]] through Jerusalem to [[Beersheba]], and Route 375, which descends west into the [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]] to the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|coastal plain]] and [[Gush Dan|Tel Aviv area]]. It takes about 10 minutes to get to [[Jerusalem]]; [[Tel Aviv]] is around 60 minutes away. Beitar Illit is connected to West Jerusalem by the [[Highway 60 (Israel–Palestine)#Bypass roads|Tunnels Highway]], which passes directly underneath the Arab town of [[Beit Jala]] and allows access to Jerusalem without coming within view of Arabs.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=25164857|journal=Middle East Report|title=Dromocratic Palestine|author=John Collins|pages=8–13|number=248|date=Fall 2008}}</ref>

== Status under international law ==
{{Main|International law and Israeli settlements}}
Like all settlements in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], Beitar Illit is considered illegal under international law,<ref name=\"Agence France-Presse\"/><ref name=\"docs.newsbank.com\"/> though Israel disputes this while the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] in November 2019 shifted its position<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50468025|title=Jewish settlements no longer illegal - US|date=2019-11-18|access-date=2019-11-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> declaring \"the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not ''per se'' inconsistent with international law.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-to-deliver-statement/|title=Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces reversal of Obama-era stance on Israeli settlements|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]'s prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory. The Israeli government disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them.<ref name=\"BBC_GC4\"/> This view has been rejected by the [[International Court of Justice]] and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }} International Court of Justice, 9 July 2004. pp. 44-45</ref>

At an international conference in Karlsruhe in November 2010, Jawad Hasan claimed that sewage and urban runoff from Beitar Illit have contaminated the local hydrological system.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jawad Hasan|author2=Amer Marie|author3=Haneen Froukh|title=Integrated water resources management Karlsruhe 2010 : international conference, 24 - 25 November 2010; conference proceedings|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEJAnpzb8kgC&pg=PA50|access-date=21 August 2012|year=2010|publisher=KIT Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-3-86644-545-1|pages=50–6|chapter=Watershed Management Under Terms of Depletive Water Balance and High Vulnerability in Wadi Fuqeen: West Bank Palestine}}</ref> The [[Palestinian Authority]] claims that sewage flows into neighboring Palestinian fields and orchards.<ref name=wafa>{{cite news|title=Settlers Drown Palestinians' Land with Wastewater in Bethlehem |url=http://english.wafa.ps/index.php?action=detail&id=16268 |access-date=19 July 2011 |newspaper=Wafa |date=29 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601170953/http://english.wafa.ps/index.php?action=detail&id=16268 |archive-date=1 June 2011 }}</ref> Farmers from [[Wadi Fukin]] have complained that since the establishment of Beitar Illit in 1985, 11 natural wells have gone dry and they have suffered from overflow from the settlement's backed up sewers.

Beitar Illit was one of four cities named in a petition to the [[Israeli High Court]] in December 2010 alleging a pattern of discrimination against [[Sephardi]] girls in the local Haredi schools.

== Name ==
Beitar Illit, (lit. Upper Beitar) is named after the ancient Jewish city of [[Betar (fortress)|Betar]], whose ruins lie {{convert|1|km|mi}} away.

== History ==
According to the [[Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem|ARIJ]], Beitar Illit was established in 1985 on land which Israel had confiscated from two nearby [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] villages; 3,140 [[dunam]]s from [[Husan]]<ref>[http://vprofile.arij.org/bethlehem/pdfs/VP/Husan_vp_en.pdf Husan Village Profile], ARIJ, p. 17</ref> and 1,166 dunams from [[Nahalin]].<ref>[http://vprofile.arij.org/bethlehem/pdfs/VP/Nahhalin_vp_en.pdf Nahhalin Village Profile], ARIJ, p. 18</ref>

It was established by a small group of young families from the [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]] [[yeshiva]] of [[Machon Meir]]. The first residents settled in 1990.<ref name=tzoren>Tzoren, Moshe Michael. \"Some Talk Peace, Others Live It\". ''[[Hamodia]]'' Israel News, November 21, 2018, pp. A18-A19.</ref> As Beitar Illit began to grow, an influx of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobover]] families came to predominate, while the original group moved on. The city is now home to many [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups, including Bobov, [[Boston (Hasidic dynasty)|Boston]], [[Boyan (Hasidic dynasty)|Boyan]], [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], [[Karlin-Stolin (Hasidic dynasty)|Karlin-Stolin]] and [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonim]]. The city has expanded to three adjacent hills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Geography ==
Beitar Illit lies in the northern Judean Hills<ref name=\"govisitisrael1\"/> at about 700 m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It is located just west of the intersection of [[Highway 60 (Israel–Palestine)|Route 60]], the north–south artery which roughly follows the [[Water divide|watershed]] from [[Nazareth]] through Jerusalem to [[Beersheba]], and Route 375, which descends west into the [[Valley of Elah|Elah Valley]] to the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|coastal plain]] and [[Gush Dan|Tel Aviv area]]. It takes about 10 minutes to get to [[Jerusalem]]; [[Tel Aviv]] is around 60 minutes away. Beitar Illit is connected to West Jerusalem by the [[Highway 60 (Israel–Palestine)#Bypass roads|Tunnels Highway]], which passes directly underneath the Arab town of [[Beit Jala]] and allows access to Jerusalem without coming within view of Arabs.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=25164857|journal=Middle East Report|title=Dromocratic Palestine|author=John Collins|pages=8–13|number=248|date=Fall 2008}}</ref>

== Status under international law ==
{{Main|International law and Israeli settlements}}
Like all settlements in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], Beitar Illit is considered illegal under international law,<ref name=\"Agence France-Presse\"/><ref name=\"docs.newsbank.com\"/> though Israel disputes this while the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] in November 2019 shifted its position<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50468025|title=Jewish settlements no longer illegal - US|date=2019-11-18|access-date=2019-11-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> declaring \"the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not ''per se'' inconsistent with international law.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-to-deliver-statement/|title=Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces reversal of Obama-era stance on Israeli settlements|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]'s prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory.

The '''1998 United States Capitol shooting incident''' was an attack on July 24, 1998, which led to the deaths of two [[United States Capitol Police]] officers. Officer [[Jacob Chestnut]] and Detective [[John Gibson (police officer)|John Gibson]] were killed when Russell Eugene Weston, Jr., entered the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and opened fire.<ref name=CNN>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/24/dc.shooting.03/ | title = 2 dead, 2 hurt in U.S. Capitol shooting | publisher = CNN.com | accessdate = January 19, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029233005/http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/24/dc.shooting.03/ |archivedate = October 29, 2006}}</ref> Chestnut was killed instantly and Gibson died during surgery at [[George Washington University Hospital]]. Weston's exact motives are unknown, but he has a [[mental disorder]] and maintains a strong distrust of the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government of the United States]]. He remains in a mental institution due to [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and has yet to be tried in court.

==Shooting==
On the day of the shooting, Officer Chestnut and an unarmed, civilian security aide were assigned to operate the X-ray machine and magnetometer at the Document Door entrance located on the East Front of the Capitol, which was open only to [[Member of Congress|Members of Congress]] and their staff. Detective Gibson was assigned to the dignitary protection detail of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX) and was in his suite of offices near this door. Weston, armed with a [[.38 S&W|.38 caliber]] [[Smith & Wesson]] six-shot revolver, entered the Document Door at 3:40&nbsp;p.m. At the same time, Officer Chestnut was providing directions to a tourist and his son.<ref name=buried/> Weston walked through the [[metal detector]],  causing the alarm to go off. Chestnut requested he go back through the detector.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/shooting/stories/main072598.htm | title = Gunman Shoots His Way Into Capitol; Two Officers Killed, Suspect Captured | publisher = Washingtonpost.com | accessdate = January 12, 2007 | date=January 30, 1999}}</ref> Weston suddenly produced the gun and without warning, shot Chestnut in the back of the head at point-blank range.  At this time, Officer Douglas McMillan, normally working outside the Capitol, was nearby retrieving keys to get a wheelchair for a tourist. As Weston shot Officer Chestnut, Officer McMillan immediately returned fire, causing Weston to shoot toward McMillan. Weston then ran away from McMillan, turning into the first nearby open door that he found. Unfortunately, Officer McMillan was unable to successfully hit Weston, due to the many civilians in the immediate area.  According to witnesses, Weston turned down a short corridor and pushed through a door which leads to a group of offices used by senior Republican representatives including then [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]] and Representative [[Dennis Hastert]], future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and a close [[Mentorship|protégé]] of then [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emergency.com/capshoot.htm | title = Attack on Capitol Hill | publisher = EmergencyNet News | accessdate = January 11, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061208155832/http://emergency.com/capshoot.htm |archivedate = December 8, 2006}}</ref>

Upon hearing the gunfire, Detective Gibson, who was in plainclothes, told the office staff to hide under their desks. Within seconds, Gibson was shot after the suspect entered DeLay's office. Despite being mortally wounded, Detective Gibson was able to return fire,  and wound the suspect hitting him with 4 rounds, severely wounding him and causing him to be apprehended in that office by Officer Vincent Farri and Sergeant John Planchart.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/25/us/capitol-hill-slayings-the-overview-gunman-invades-capitol-killing-2-guards.html | title = Capitol Hill Slayings: The Overview; Gunman Invades Capitol, Killing 2 Guards | publisher = Newyorktimes.com | accessdate = January 11, 2007 | first=Francis X. | last=Clines | date=July 25, 1998}}</ref> A female tourist was grazed by shrapnel on her face and shoulder, from a marble wall, as Officer McMillan's rounds impacted on the wall, while he was attempting to hit the fleeing Weston.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_19980726/ai_n10434376 \"Horrifying Capitol ordeal began with officer's execution\"].

Weston attended Valmeyer High School, the only high school in a town of 900 people. Shortly after graduating from high school in 1974, Weston moved to [[Rimini, Montana]], rarely returning to Valmeyer.

[[Image:Russellwestonhome.jpg|thumb|left|Weston's cabin next to the lower [[Tenmile Creek (Lewis and Clark County, Montana)|Tenmile Creek]] in [[Montana]] following a search by the police]]

He was diagnosed with [[Schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenia]] six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else.<ref name=access/> Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, he was known to compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the [[Great Flood of 1993|Mississippi River floods of 1993]]. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees.<ref name=access>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/shooting/stories/weston081098.htm | title = Before the Shootings, a String of Excesses | publisher = Washingtonpost.com | accessdate = January 11, 2007 | date=January 30, 1999}}</ref> Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby [[cat]]s which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.<ref name=access/>

Following the Capitol shooting, Weston was transferred to a psychiatric center at [[Butner Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Butner, North Carolina]]. In an interview with a court-appointed psychiatrist he explained that he stormed the Capitol to prevent the United States from being annihilated by disease and legions of cannibals.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/shooting/stories/weston042399.htm | title = Capitol Shooter's Mind-Set Detailed | publisher = Washingtonpost.com | accessdate = January 26, 2010 | date=April 23, 1999}}</ref>

He has never been charged with any crime due to apparent mental [[culpability|inculpability]]. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication.

The '''1998 United States Capitol shooting incident''' was an attack on July 24, 1998, which led to the deaths of two [[United States Capitol Police]] officers. Officer [[Jacob Chestnut]] and Detective [[John Gibson (police officer)|John Gibson]] were killed when Russell Eugene Weston, Jr., entered the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and opened fire.<ref name=CNN>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/24/dc.shooting.03/ | title = 2 dead, 2 hurt in U.S. Capitol shooting | publisher = CNN.com | accessdate = January 19, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029233005/http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/24/dc.shooting.03/ |archivedate = October 29, 2006}}</ref> Chestnut was killed instantly and Gibson died during surgery at [[George Washington University Hospital]]. Weston's exact motives are unknown, but he has a [[mental disorder]] and maintains a strong distrust of the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government]]. He remains in a mental institution due to [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and has yet to be tried in court.

==Shooting==
On the day of the shooting, Officer Chestnut and an unarmed, civilian security aide were assigned to operate the X-ray machine and magnetometer at the Document Door entrance located on the East Front of the Capitol, which was open only to [[Member of Congress|Members of Congress]] and their staff. Detective Gibson was assigned to the dignitary protection detail of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX) and was in his suite of offices near this door. Weston, armed with a [[.38 S&W|.38 caliber]] [[Smith & Wesson]] six-shot revolver, entered the Document Door at 3:40&nbsp;p.m. At the same time, Officer Chestnut was providing directions to a tourist and his son.<ref name=buried/> Weston walked through the [[metal detector]],  causing the alarm to go off. Chestnut requested he go back through the detector.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/shooting/stories/main072598.htm | title = Gunman Shoots His Way Into Capitol; Two Officers Killed, Suspect Captured | publisher = Washingtonpost.com | accessdate = January 12, 2007 | date=January 30, 1999}}</ref> Weston suddenly produced the gun and without warning, shot Chestnut in the back of the head at point-blank range.  At this time, Officer Douglas McMillan, normally working outside the Capitol, was nearby retrieving keys to get a wheelchair for a tourist. As Weston shot Officer Chestnut, Officer McMillan immediately returned fire, causing Weston to shoot toward McMillan. Weston then ran away from McMillan, turning into the first nearby open door that he found. Unfortunately, Officer McMillan was unable to successfully hit Weston, due to the many civilians in the immediate area.  According to witnesses, Weston turned down a short corridor and pushed through a door which leads to a group of offices used by senior Republican representatives including then [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]] and Representative [[Dennis Hastert]], future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and a close [[Mentorship|protégé]] of then [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emergency.com/capshoot.htm | title = Attack on Capitol Hill | publisher = EmergencyNet News | accessdate = January 11, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061208155832/http://emergency.com/capshoot.htm |archivedate = December 8, 2006}}</ref>

Upon hearing the gunfire, Detective Gibson, who was in plainclothes, told the office staff to hide under their desks. Within seconds, Gibson was shot after the suspect entered DeLay's office. Despite being mortally wounded, Detective Gibson was able to return fire,  and wound the suspect hitting him with 4 rounds, severely wounding him and causing him to be apprehended in that office by Officer Vincent Farri and Sergeant John Planchart.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/25/us/capitol-hill-slayings-the-overview-gunman-invades-capitol-killing-2-guards.html | title = Capitol Hill Slayings: The Overview; Gunman Invades Capitol, Killing 2 Guards | publisher = Newyorktimes.com | accessdate = January 11, 2007 | first=Francis X. | last=Clines | date=July 25, 1998}}</ref> A female tourist was grazed by shrapnel on her face and shoulder, from a marble wall, as Officer McMillan's rounds impacted on the wall, while he was attempting to hit the fleeing Weston.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_19980726/ai_n10434376 \"Horrifying Capitol ordeal began with officer's execution\"].

Once home, he was known to compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the [[Great Flood of 1993|Mississippi River floods of 1993]].

Tags and links,safe,Iveagh Gardens,"There have been three sets of [[coins of Ireland|coins in Ireland]] since independence. In all three, the [[coin]] showed a [[Celtic harp]] on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]. The [[£sd|pre-decimal]] coins of the [[Irish pound]]  had realistic animals on the reverse; the [[Decimal Day|decimal]] coins retained some of these but featured ornamental birds on the lower denominations; and the [[Irish euro coins|euro coins]] used the common design of the euro currencies. The pre-decimal and original decimal coins were of the same dimensions as the same-denomination [[British coins]], as the Irish pound was in [[currency union]] with the British [[pound sterling]]. British coins were widely accepted in Ireland, and conversely to a lesser extent. In 1979 Ireland joined the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] and the Irish pound left parity with sterling; coin designs introduced after this differed between the two countries.

==Background==

{{See also|Coins of Ireland}}

The first coins minted in [[Ireland]] were produced in about 995&nbsp;AD in [[Dublin]] for King [[Sitric (disambiguation)|Sitric]], the [[Hibernia|Hiberno]]-[[Norsemen|Norse]] [[Kings of Dublin|King of Dublin]]. These penny coins bore the head and name of the king and the word ''Dyflin'' for Dublin. [[John of England]] was among the first [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[monarch]]s to mint coins in Ireland; these were farthings, halfpennies and pennies. It was not until the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] that Irish coins bore the [[harp]] and, later in Henry's reign, the year. In the following centuries [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[copper]] coins were issued, and at one time, metal from melted-down gun barrels was used; this was called \"gun money\". Coins issued in the 18th and 19th centuries often included the word [[Hibernia]] on the harp side. The last Irish coins issued prior to independence were during the reign of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], in 1823. Irish coins were withdrawn in 1826 following the full political union of Ireland and Britain in the [[Act of Union 1800|1800 Act of Union]]. Occasional \"fantasy\" coins were minted in the next century but these were neither [[circulation (currency)|circulated]] nor [[legal tender]].

The [[Irish Free State]] decided soon after its foundation in the 1920s to design its own [[coin]]s and [[banknote]]s. It was decided that the Irish currency would be pegged to the [[pound sterling]]. The Coinage Act, 1926<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1926/en/act/pub/0014/index.html Coinage Act, 1926]</ref> was passed as a legislative basis for the minting of coins for the state and these new coins commenced circulation on 12 December 1928. The decision was mainly for [[economic]] reasons because, in 1924, 98% of Irish exports went to [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]], while 80% of imports were from those territories. Additionally, the stability and backing of the pound sterling reassured the government that the new currency was on [[store of value|a firm foundation]] and did not weaken efforts to rebuild the country socially and economically, which was the government's first commitment. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

As is common with [[numismatic]] [[terminology]] the side of the [[Coat of Arms of the Republic of Ireland|seal of the state]] is termed the \"[[obverse]]\"; this is often called the common side; the \"[[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]\" is the side with the denomination specific design.

Coins are issued by the [[central bank]] which acts as an agent of the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]].

==The pound==

==={{anchor|Free State}}<!--[[Coins of the Irish Free State]] redirects here--> Pre-decimal coins===

[[File:Irish shilling coin.png|thumb|150px|Shilling coins featured a bull design. They continued to be used after decimalisation as [[Five pence (Irish coin)|five pence]] until the early 1990s when the 5p coin was reduced in size.]]

In the early 1920s, the [[Irish government]] created a committee headed by [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senator]] [[W. B. Yeats]] to determine designs suitable for the coins. The committee members were [[Thomas Bodkin]], Dermot O'Brien, Lucius O'Callaghan and [[Barry Egan (politician)|Barry Egan]].

Some decisions were made at the outset. The [[harp]] was to be on most if not all coins, and all lettering would be in Irish. The committee decided that people associated with \"the present time\" should not feature in any designs, no doubt {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} due to the political divisions which had led to the [[Irish Civil War]]. They decided later that religious or cultural themes should be avoided in case coins became relics or medals. [[Agriculture]] was essential to the [[economy of the Republic of Ireland|economy of Ireland]] and this theme was chosen for the coins, which used designs featuring animals and birds.

Finally, the harp and the words {{lang|ga|Saorstát Éireann}} (\"[[Irish Free State]]\") were chosen for the obverse side of coins. Images of animals and birds were presented to the chosen artists to design the reverse and they were also given pictures of the [[Dalway harp]] and [[Trinity College harp]] for guidance. Later, the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] decided that the value of the coins should be written in numerals as well as in words, and he suggested using plants; this latter suggestion was rejected because the competition was at an advanced stage and due to the difficulty of obtaining good facsimiles of plants.

Three Irish artists [[Jerome Connor]], Albert Power and [[Oliver Sheppard]] were chosen, and also the foreign artists [[Paul Manship]] (American), [[Percy Metcalfe]] (English) [[Carl Milles]] (Swedish) and Publio Morbiducci (Italian); a number of other artists were invited but did not take part. Each artist was paid and allowed to produce designs in [[plaster]] or [[metal]], with a prize for the winner. Identifying marks were removed from the designs so the committee did not know whose designs were being judged. Percy Metcalfe's designs were chosen and design modifications were added with assistance from [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|civil servants]] at the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture]].

The first coins were struck in 1928 and were minted at the [[Royal Mint]] in [[London]]. In 1938, following the introduction of the [[Constitution of Ireland]], the obverse of the coins was modified with the [[Irish language]] name of the State, \"[[Éire]]\", and the harp was also modified so that it wore better. The Central Bank Act, 1942 Section 58<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1942/en/act/pub/0022/index.html Central Bank Act, 1942]</ref> allowed pure [[nickel]] to be substituted with a [[cupro-nickel]] [[alloy]]. The description of the state as the \"[[Republic of Ireland]]\" did not require any change in the name on coins issued after 1948. The Coinage Act, 1950<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1950/en/act/pub/0032/index.html Coinage Act, 1950]</ref> changed the law on coinage principally with the removal of silver from coins then in existence. The final piece of primary legislation for predecimal coins was the Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0005/index.html Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966]</ref> which allowed for a [[Ten shilling (Irish coin)|ten shilling coin]] to be minted and circulated. The ten shilling was the only modern circulating Irish coin not to feature the harp, to incorporate edge lettering, and to depict an actual Irishman ([[Patrick Pearse|Pádraig Pearse]]), and to depict a political subject (Pearse was an Irish revolutionary and the edge lettering referred to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]).

While many of the Irish coins are common, particularly in lower grades, there are some notable rarities.  Most of the 1943 Florins and Half Crowns were melted down at the mint, and only small numbers were released.  Only one and two specimens, respectively, are known of the 1938 Half Crown and Penny.<ref>[http://www.irishcoinage.com/MODCAT.HTM#modhcr Catalogue of Irish Coin Prices Modern Coins 1928-1969]</ref>

===Decimal coins===

[[File:Irish ten pence (decimal coin).png|thumb|left|200px|The ten pence piece featured a salmon, as the [[Irish florin coin|florin]] had previously. The redesigned smaller 10p of the 1990s is shown on the right.]]

Three new designs were created in [[bronze]] for the new decimal currency by the artist [[Gabriel Hayes]], and were based upon [[manuscript]] designs of ornamental birds in [[Celtic knot]]work style. The designs of Percy Metcalfe were retained for the new five and ten pence coins, taken from the shilling and florin, respectively. The new fifty pence piece bore the image of the woodcock from the old [[Farthing (Irish coin)|farthing]]. The designs were quite simple using only figures and symbols to indicate the value; using only the letter \"P\" to denote both ''penny'' and ''pingin'' (the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for penny). 

In 1978, the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] opened the [[Currency Centre]] at [[Sandyford]] in Dublin for the production of coins and banknotes. Irish coins had previously been produced in Great Britain at the [[Royal Mint]]. 

The rising expense of minting coins necessitated the introduction of the [[Irish twenty pence (decimal coin)|twenty pence coin]] in 1986; the [[Irish halfpenny (decimal coin)|halfpenny coin]] was withdrawn at this time as [[inflation]] had reduced its buying power. The introduction of the [[Irish pound]] [[coin]] required the Decimal Currency Act, 1990<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0002/index.html Decimal Currency Act, 1990]</ref> and this law provided for certain other matters including the issue of [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) coins which were specifically stated not to be [[legal tender]] in the legislation, instead intended as [[Collecting|collectors]] items. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} These ECU coins were issued in 50 ECU, 10 ECU and 5 ECU denominations, in [[gold]], [[silver]] and silver respectively. These coins used the Irish red deer design from the Irish pound coin with a mountain relief in the background and other notable differences such as the [[European symbols|12 stars of the European Flag]] surrounding the [[harp]], quite similar to the [[Irish euro coins]].

The coins issued under the Decimal Currency Acts were finally [[Legal tender#Demonetisation|withdrawn from circulation]] in 2002 by the Irish Pound Coinage (Calling In) (No. 2) Order, 2001<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0311.html S.I. No. 311/2001—Irish Pound Coinage (Calling In) Order, 2001]</ref> which revoked an earlier similar order; the date was set for 10 February 2002.

==The euro==

{{Main|Irish euro coins}}

The introduction of the [[euro]] was overseen by the ''Euro Changeover Board of Ireland'' which was a special agency created on May 5, 1998 by the Minister for Finance; this agency provided a wide variety of information including converters, training packs, images and public advertisements on a wide range of media to ensure a successful transfer. As with all [[eurozone]] countries, Ireland continued to mint its own coins after the currency changeover to the euro. One side of euro coins is common across the eurozone, it is the obverse which has a design unique to Ireland. Although some other countries used more than one design, or even a separate design for each of the eight coins (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, €1 and €2), Ireland used only one design. A redesigned [[Irish harp|harp]] (superficially identical to that used on earlier coins) was used, having been designed by Jarlath Hayes. Some other eurozone members have unique lettering around the €2 coin. The edge on Irish €2 coins merely has the sequence \"[[File:2€ edge inv2.svg|155px|2 * * (upside down 2) * *]]\", repeated three times.

The first collectors' commemorative coin issued since the changeover was a €10 silver coin to mark the [[Special Olympics]] in 2003. This was struck in [[Sterling silver|sterling .925 silver]] and hand finished to create a distinctive gold logo and harp. A €5 coin was also produced. Since then a number of commemorative coins have been issued including one for the accession of the ten new [[European Union]] member states on 1 May 2004. One side of the €10 coin depicts a [[swan]] sitting on ten eggs, with the reverse depicting the harp and the names of all ten members in their native language.  The first gold coin ever issued by the Central Bank was a €20 issued in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Samuel Beckett]].  These commemorative coins are only legal tender in Ireland, and are not valid elsewhere in the eurozone.

In 2007, Ireland issued a €2 common coin for general circulation, together with the others countries of the Eurozone, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]] followed by a €2 common commemorative coin in 2009 celebrating the tenth anniversary of the birth of the euro currency in 1999, by another €2 common commemorative coin in 2012 for the tenth anniversary of the introduction of coins and banknotes denominated in euro and, finally, by another €2 common commemorative dedicated to the thirtieth anniversary of the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] in 2015. For the first time since it adopted the euro, Ireland will issue on its own, in 2016, a €2 commemorative coin in honour of the hundredth anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916.

In 2013 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] issued a silver €10 commemorative coin in honour of [[James Joyce]] that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0410/380758-central-bank-coin/ | work=RTÉ News | date=10 April 2013 | title=Error in Ulysses line on special €10 coin issued by Central Bank}}</ref> despite being warned on at least two occasions by the Department of Finance over difficulties with copyright and design.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.herald.ie/news/bank-alerted-to-joyce-coin-risk-29296231.html  | work= Evening Herald  |date=25 May 2013 | title=Bank alerted to Joyce coin risk}}</ref>

All pre-euro Irish coins may be exchanged for their equivalent in euro any weekday morning at the [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] in Dublin.

The Coinage Act, 1926<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1926/en/act/pub/0014/index.html Coinage Act, 1926]</ref> was passed as a legislative basis for the minting of coins for the state and these new coins commenced circulation on 12 December 1928. The decision was mainly for [[economic]] reasons because, in 1924, 98% of Irish exports went to [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]], while 80% of imports were from those territories. Additionally, the stability and backing of the pound sterling reassured the government that the new currency was on [[store of value|a firm foundation]] and did not weaken efforts to rebuild the country socially and economically, which was the government's first commitment. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

As is common with [[numismatic]] [[terminology]] the side of the [[Coat of Arms of the Republic of Ireland|seal of the state]] is termed the \"[[obverse]]\"; this is often called the common side; the \"[[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]\" is the side with the denomination specific design.

Coins are issued by the [[central bank]] which acts as an agent of the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]].

[[File:Irish shilling coin.png|thumb|150px|Shilling coins featured a bull design. They continued to be used after decimalisation as [[Five pence (Irish coin)|five pence]] until the early 1990s when the 5p coin was reduced in size.]]

In the early 1920s, the [[Irish government]] created a committee headed by [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senator]] [[W. B. Yeats]] to determine designs suitable for the coins. The committee members were [[Thomas Bodkin]], Dermot O'Brien, Lucius O'Callaghan and [[Barry Egan (politician)|Barry Egan]].

Some decisions were made at the outset. The [[harp]] was to be on most if not all coins, and all lettering would be in Irish. The committee decided that people associated with \"the present time\" should not feature in any designs, no doubt {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} due to the political divisions which had led to the [[Irish Civil War]]. They decided later that religious or cultural themes should be avoided in case coins became relics or medals. [[Agriculture]] was essential to the [[economy of the Republic of Ireland|economy of Ireland]] and this theme was chosen for the coins, which used designs featuring animals and birds.

Finally, the harp and the words {{lang|ga|Saorstát Éireann}} (\"[[Irish Free State]]\") were chosen for the obverse side of coins. Images of animals and birds were presented to the chosen artists to design the reverse and they were also given pictures of the [[Dalway harp]] and [[Trinity College harp]] for guidance. Later, the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] decided that the value of the coins should be written in numerals as well as in words, and he suggested using plants; this latter suggestion was rejected because the competition was at an advanced stage and due to the difficulty of obtaining good facsimiles of plants.

Three Irish artists [[Jerome Connor]], Albert Power and [[Oliver Sheppard]] were chosen, and also the foreign artists [[Paul Manship]] (American), [[Percy Metcalfe]] (English) [[Carl Milles]] (Swedish) and Publio Morbiducci (Italian); a number of other artists were invited but did not take part. Each artist was paid and allowed to produce designs in [[plaster]] or [[metal]], with a prize for the winner. Identifying marks were removed from the designs so the committee did not know whose designs were being judged. Percy Metcalfe's designs were chosen and design modifications were added with assistance from [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|civil servants]] at the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture]].

The first coins were struck in 1928 and were minted at the [[Royal Mint]] in [[London]]. In 1938, following the introduction of the [[Constitution of Ireland]], the obverse of the coins was modified with the [[Irish language]] name of the State, \"[[Éire]]\", and the harp was also modified so that it wore better. The Central Bank Act, 1942 Section 58<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1942/en/act/pub/0022/index.html Central Bank Act, 1942]</ref> allowed pure [[nickel]] to be substituted with a [[cupro-nickel]] [[alloy]]. The description of the state as the \"[[Republic of Ireland]]\" did not require any change in the name on coins issued after 1948. The Coinage Act, 1950<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1950/en/act/pub/0032/index.html Coinage Act, 1950]</ref> changed the law on coinage principally with the removal of silver from coins then in existence. The final piece of primary legislation for predecimal coins was the Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0005/index.html Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966]</ref> which allowed for a [[Ten shilling (Irish coin)|ten shilling coin]] to be minted and circulated. The ten shilling was the only modern circulating Irish coin not to feature the harp, to incorporate edge lettering, and to depict an actual Irishman ([[Patrick Pearse|Pádraig Pearse]]), and to depict a political subject (Pearse was an Irish revolutionary and the edge lettering referred to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]).

While many of the Irish coins are common, particularly in lower grades, there are some notable rarities.  Most of the 1943 Florins and Half Crowns were melted down at the mint, and only small numbers were released.  Only one and two specimens, respectively, are known of the 1938 Half Crown and Penny.<ref>[http://www.irishcoinage.com/MODCAT.HTM#modhcr Catalogue of Irish Coin Prices Modern Coins 1928-1969]</ref>

===Decimal coins===

[[File:Irish ten pence (decimal coin).png|thumb|left|200px|The ten pence piece featured a salmon, as the [[Irish florin coin|florin]] had previously. The redesigned smaller 10p of the 1990s is shown on the right.]]

Three new designs were created in [[bronze]] for the new decimal currency by the artist [[Gabriel Hayes]], and were based upon [[manuscript]] designs of ornamental birds in [[Celtic knot]]work style. The designs of Percy Metcalfe were retained for the new five and ten pence coins, taken from the shilling and florin, respectively. The new fifty pence piece bore the image of the woodcock from the old [[Farthing (Irish coin)|farthing]]. The designs were quite simple using only figures and symbols to indicate the value; using only the letter \"P\" to denote both ''penny'' and ''pingin'' (the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for penny). 

In 1978, the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] opened the [[Currency Centre]] at [[Sandyford]] in Dublin for the production of coins and banknotes. Irish coins had previously been produced in Great Britain at the [[Royal Mint]]. 

The rising expense of minting coins necessitated the introduction of the [[Irish twenty pence (decimal coin)|twenty pence coin]] in 1986; the [[Irish halfpenny (decimal coin)|halfpenny coin]] was withdrawn at this time as [[inflation]] had reduced its buying power. The introduction of the [[Irish pound]] [[coin]] required the Decimal Currency Act, 1990<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0002/index.html Decimal Currency Act, 1990]</ref> and this law provided for certain other matters including the issue of [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) coins which were specifically stated not to be [[legal tender]] in the legislation, instead intended as [[Collecting|collectors]] items. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} These ECU coins were issued in 50 ECU, 10 ECU and 5 ECU denominations, in [[gold]], [[silver]] and silver respectively. These coins used the Irish red deer design from the Irish pound coin with a mountain relief in the background and other notable differences such as the [[European symbols|12 stars of the European Flag]] surrounding the [[harp]], quite similar to the [[Irish euro coins]].

The coins issued under the Decimal Currency Acts were finally [[Legal tender#Demonetisation|withdrawn from circulation]] in 2002 by the Irish Pound Coinage (Calling In) (No. 2) Order, 2001<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0311.html S.I. No. 311/2001—Irish Pound Coinage (Calling In) Order, 2001]</ref> which revoked an earlier similar order; the date was set for 10 February 2002.

==The euro==

{{Main|Irish euro coins}}

The introduction of the [[euro]] was overseen by the ''Euro Changeover Board of Ireland'' which was a special agency created on May 5, 1998 by the Minister for Finance; this agency provided a wide variety of information including converters, training packs, images and public advertisements on a wide range of media to ensure a successful transfer. As with all [[eurozone]] countries, Ireland continued to mint its own coins after the currency changeover to the euro. One side of euro coins is common across the eurozone, it is the obverse which has a design unique to Ireland. Although some other countries used more than one design, or even a separate design for each of the eight coins (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, €1 and €2), Ireland used only one design. A redesigned [[Irish harp|harp]] (superficially identical to that used on earlier coins) was used, having been designed by Jarlath Hayes. Some other eurozone members have unique lettering around the €2 coin. The edge on Irish €2 coins merely has the sequence \"[[File:2€ edge inv2.svg|155px|2 * * (upside down 2) * *]]\", repeated three times.

The first collectors' commemorative coin issued since the changeover was a €10 silver coin to mark the [[Special Olympics]] in 2003. This was struck in [[Sterling silver|sterling .925 silver]] and hand finished to create a distinctive gold logo and harp. A €5 coin was also produced. Since then a number of commemorative coins have been issued including one for the accession of the ten new [[European Union]] member states on 1 May 2004. One side of the €10 coin depicts a [[swan]] sitting on ten eggs, with the reverse depicting the harp and the names of all ten members in their native language.  The first gold coin ever issued by the Central Bank was a €20 issued in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Samuel Beckett]].  These commemorative coins are only legal tender in Ireland, and are not valid elsewhere in the eurozone.

In 2007, Ireland issued a €2 common coin for general circulation, together with the others countries of the Eurozone, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]] followed by a €2 common commemorative coin in 2009 celebrating the tenth anniversary of the birth of the euro currency in 1999, by another €2 common commemorative coin in 2012 for the tenth anniversary of the introduction of coins and banknotes denominated in euro and, finally, by another €2 common commemorative dedicated to the thirtieth anniversary of the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] in 2015. For the first time since it adopted the euro, Ireland will issue on its own, in 2016, a €2 commemorative coin in honour of the hundredth anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916.

In 2013 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] issued a silver €10 commemorative coin in honour of [[James Joyce]] that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0410/380758-central-bank-coin/ | work=RTÉ News | date=10 April 2013 | title=Error in Ulysses line on special €10 coin issued by Central Bank}}</ref> despite being warned on at least two occasions by the Department of Finance over difficulties with copyright and design.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.herald.ie/news/bank-alerted-to-joyce-coin-risk-29296231.html  | work= Evening Herald  |date=25 May 2013 | title=Bank alerted to Joyce coin risk}}</ref>

All pre-euro Irish coins may be exchanged for their equivalent in euro any weekday morning at the [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] in Dublin.

{{italic title}}
\"'''A Witch Shall Be Born'''\" is one of the original [[sword and sorcery]] [[novellas]] by [[Robert E. Howard]] about [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]. It was written in only a few days in spring of 1934 and first published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in December 1934. A book edition was published in 1975 by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher]] with illustrations by [[Alicia Austin]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/witch-shall-be-born/oclc/2967501 ''A Witch Shall Be Born''] at [[Worldcat]]</ref>

The story concerns a witch replacing her twin sister as queen of a city state, which brings her into conflict with Conan who had been the captain of the queen's guard. Themes of paranoia, and the duality of the twin sisters, are paramount in this story but it also includes elements of the conflict between barbarism and civilization that is common to the entire Conan series. The novella as a whole is considered an average example of the series, but one scene stands out. Conan's crucifixion early on in the story during the second chapter (\"The Tree of Death\") is considered one of the most memorable scenes in the entire series. A variation of this scene was included in the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

==Plot==
[[Queen Taramis]] of Khauran awakens one day to find her identical twin sister, Salome, staring her in the face. As an infant, [[Salome]] was deemed a witch due to a crescent-shaped birthmark on her chest. This birthmark was believed to be a sign of evil, so she was left in the desert to die. However, a magician from Khitai (China) found Salome, brought her up, and instructed her in the art of sorcery.

Salome has conspired with a [[voivode]] named Constantius, also known as \"The Falcon\", the Kothic leader for an army of Shemitish mercenaries, to take over the city of Khauran. Queen Taramis is sent to the palace dungeon, with the implications of torture and rape. Salome assumes Taramis' identity as the queen of Khauran and names Constantius as her royal consort. The Khaurani army is disbanded and replaced by Constantius' Shemitish mercenaries, an event which turns violent when the captain of the queen's guard, Conan the Cimmerian, refuses to obey Salome's order.

After putting his back against a wall while killing a number of Constantius' warriors, Conan is finally captured and crucified for his defiance. Olgerd [[Vladislav]], the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporoskan]] leader of a band of Zuagir desert raiders, is riding by with his scouting party and discovers a crucified Conan a mile outside the city walls. Vladislav doesn't entirely help Conan. He has the base of the cross cut, leaving it to fate and Conan's hardiness that he isn't crushed by the heavy wood. Vladislav then refuses to give Conan any water, claiming the Cimmerian must wait until after a ten-mile trek towards their outlaw camp to prove himself worthy of his band.

In Khauran, Salome's reign as \"Taramis\" has plunged the city into ruin. Citizens are killed, tortured, or sold as slaves; heavy taxes are imposed; and women are frequently [[wikt:debauch|debauched]] by the Shemites. Salome desecrates the temple of Ishtar in the center of her city and summons a demon, Thaug, to live inside it. Soon, the citizens of Khauran are routinely sacrificed to Thaug.

Conan has been expanding the numbers of Zuagirs as Vladislav's lieutenant, while also secretly establishing communication with the Khaurani Knights who had become refugees. When he has a sufficient force, Conan deposes Vladislav's leadership of the Zuagirs, but doesn't kill him in repayment for Vladislav having saved his life from the cross. Conan fakes the construction of siege engines with palm trees and painted silk. Soon, Constantius is fooled by this as his scouts cannot get close enough to see them properly and Conan is known for his experience in all manner of warfare. The Shemitish mercenaries ride out of their city for an open-field battle, with Constantius expecting only the lightly armed Zuagirs, but are taken by surprise by the Khaurani cavalry hidden amongst them. Conan's forces are victorious, ruthlessly taking no prisoners. The Zuagirs, Shemite nomads, are hereditary enemies of the Western Shemite city dwellers from whom Constantius' mercenaries were drawn, while the Khaurani exiles are full of bitterness over the Shemites' oppression of their city; neither are inclined to be merciful to their defeated enemies.

Meanwhile, Valerius, a former member of the Khaurani army, has discovered the secret of Salome's masquerade, and the fact that Salome is holding the real Taramis within her dungeon. With Conan's forces approaching Khauran, Valerius plans to rescue Taramis and reveal the conspiracy to his people or to escape with the true queen. Conan's victory is not certain to the Khauranis and they are nervous about his intentions if he does take Khauran. When it becomes apparent that Conan has defeated Constantius' Shemites, Salome decides to kill Taramis before his army can reclaim the city. She thwarts Valerius' rescue attempt and sends Taramis to the former temple of Ishtar to sacrifice her to Thaug. Valerius saves Taramis and kills Salome, but not before she unleashes Thaug. Conan arrives with his Khaurani allies and some Zuagir warriors, who kill the demon with two flights of arrows.

Soon, Taramis offers to make Conan her royal councillor and captain. However, he declines the queen's offer and nominates Valerius instead. Conan, as chief of the Zuagirs, drives away the remaining Shemites (capturing Constantius in the process) and leaves to raid the nearby kingdom of Turan. Before leaving Khauran, he crucifies Constantius at the site where he'd been crucified, commenting with irony to a crucified Constantius the difference between their respective situations: \"I hung there on a cross as you are hanging, and I lived, thanks to circumstances and a stamina peculiar to barbarians. But you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown. And so, Falcon, I leave you to the companionship of [[Vulture|another bird of the desert]].\"

Salome's words at the beginning - \"'Every century a witch shall be born.' So ran the ancient curse. And so it has come to pass. Each was named Salome. I too am Salome. It was always Salome, the witch. It will always be Salome, the witch, even when the mountains of ice have roared down from the pole and ground the civilizations to ruin, and a new world has risen from the ashes and dust—even then there shall be Salomes to walk the earth, to trap men's hearts by their sorcery, to dance before the kings of the world, and see the heads of the wise men fall at their pleasure\" - clearly imply that the witch Salome of this story is an earlier incarnation of the notorious [[Salome]] of the [[New Testament]], who instigated the beheading of [[John the Baptist]].

A theme of paranoia runs through the story.  Howard uses a theme common to his works in having evil hide behind innocent features. Similarly, Vladislav is unaware of Conan's plans until it's too late. Of all the characters, only Conan is aware of all the facts.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The twin sisters, Taramis and Salome, are an instance of Howard's interest in siblings and the theme of duality, which appeared in several other works.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

Howard may have been experimenting with style in this novella, leaving behind any standard pulp formula. Conan dominates the story, but he is only actually present in two chapters.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The narrative instead builds the plot by following others, such as Valerius, Salome, and a wandering savant named Astreas.

Louinet suggests that Conan becomes figuratively immortal and superhuman following his crucifixion: \"How can anybody kill a character—literarily or literally—who can survive such a scene as that one?\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

The supernatural elements of the story are minor and may only have been included to justify publication in ''Weird Tales''.<ref name=\"Weinberg\">{{Citation |last = Weinberg |first = Robert |authorlink = Robert Weinberg |year = 1976 |title = The Annotated Guide to Robert E.

The ongoing theme of Barbarism vs. Civilization, which pervades the entire Conan series, is present in this story in two crucifixions. Conan is able to endure and survive his crucifixion, as well as the subsequent journey without water, thanks to his barbarian stamina.

==Reception==
Howard scholar Patrice Louinet refers to this as a rather forgettable Conan story but one that contains the most memorable scene of the entire series: Conan's [[crucifixion]] at the hands of Constantius.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He goes on to say that, while of average quality, it \"exudes Howard's confidence in his creation.\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

[[Robert Weinberg]] concurs, mentioning the \"best scene in the entire Conan series\" but comments that the remainder of the story in only average.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  Of the crucifixion, Weinberg writes, \"Only Howard could have given the scene life.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  He states that this scene, the \"blood and passion\", is an indicator of why Howard is better than any of his imitators.  The violence is \"graphic and elemental\" while the torture \"barbaric, primitive and real\" not allowing the hero a chance to escape.  Instead, Conan survives by sheer endurance, even killing an overeager vulture with his teeth. The passion in the text and strength of the prose suspends disbelief in Conan's survival on the cross.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  However, Weinberg criticizes the fact that much of the action takes place offstage, for instance, being related to the reader through a letter from the otherwise unseen Astreas or through a priest communicating with Salome.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />

On the same subject, Rev. Austin Spencer noted <ref>Rev. Austin James Spencer, \"Christianity and Twentieth Century American Culture\", p. 45-47, Spiritual Guidance Press, Kansas City, 1983</ref> that: \"The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] has left a deep mark on all members of Western culture, regardless of whether or not one be a Christian believer. Robert E. Howard is certainly no exception. (...) When I was preparing the present volume, a colleague drew my attention to ''A Witch Shall be Born''. I was both impressed and appalled by Howard's achievement - creating a full-fledged Pagan counterpart and total antithesis to the New Testament account.(...) The crucified Conan does not feel forsaken by his god, Crom. This god, Crom, offers neither physical deliverance not spiritual solace -  he merely endows Cimmerians with enormous strength and tenacity to fight. Conan, killing a vulture with his teeth while pinioned to the cross, is a true votary of his savage god. There are no thieves crucified at Conan's side - the thieves remove him from the cross in exchange for his joining their thievery. (...) Conan does not forgive his enemies, and certainly does not ask Crom to do so; he takes direct and ruthless revenge. For Conan, the rule is simple and straightforward - \"Crucify Or Be Crucified\". (...) One need not take literally the grim tribal god on his mountain to recognize in today's America the votaries and prophets of Crom, who would take spiritual guidance from the Crucifixion of Conan rather than the Crucifixion of Jesus\".

{{italic title}}
\"'''A Witch Shall Be Born'''\" is one of the original [[sword and sorcery]] [[novellas]] by [[Robert E. Howard]] about [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]. It was written in only a few days in spring of 1934 and first published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in December 1934. A book edition was published in 1975 by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher]] with illustrations by [[Alicia Austin]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/witch-shall-be-born/oclc/2967501 ''A Witch Shall Be Born''] at [[Worldcat]]</ref>

The story concerns a witch replacing her twin sister as queen of a city state, which brings her into conflict with Conan who had been the captain of the queen's guard. Themes of paranoia, and the duality of the twin sisters, are paramount in this story but it also includes elements of the conflict between barbarism and civilization that is common to the entire Conan series. The novella as a whole is considered an average example of the series, but one scene stands out. Conan's crucifixion early on in the story during the second chapter (\"The Tree of Death\") is considered one of the most memorable scenes in the entire series. A variation of this scene was included in the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

==Plot==
[[Queen Taramis]] of Khauran awakens one day to find her identical twin sister, Salome, staring at her in the face. As an infant, [[Salome]] was deemed a witch due to a crescent-shaped birthmark on her chest. This birthmark was believed to be a sign of evil, so she was left in the desert to die. However, a magician from Khitai (China) found Salome, brought her up, and instructed her in the art of sorcery.

Salome has conspired with a [[voivode]] named Constantius, also known as \"The Falcon\", the Kothic leader for an army of Shemitish mercenaries, to take over the city of Khauran. Queen Taramis is sent to the palace dungeon, with the implications of torture and rape. Salome assumes Taramis' identity as the queen of Khauran and names Constantius as her royal consort. The Khaurani army is disbanded and replaced by Constantius' Shemitish mercenaries, an event which turns violent when the captain of the queen's guard, Conan the Cimmerian, refuses to obey Salome's order.

After putting his back against a wall while killing a number of Constantius' warriors, Conan is finally captured and crucified for his defiance. Olgerd [[Vladislav]], the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporoskan]] leader of a band of Zuagir desert raiders, is riding by with his scouting party and discovers a crucified Conan a mile outside the city walls. Vladislav doesn't entirely help Conan. He has the base of the cross cut, leaving it to fate and Conan's hardiness that he isn't crushed by the heavy wood. Vladislav then refuses to give Conan any water, claiming the Cimmerian must wait until after a ten-mile trek towards their outlaw camp to prove himself worthy of his band.

In Khauran, Salome's reign as \"Taramis\" has plunged the city into ruin. Citizens are killed, tortured, or sold as slaves; heavy taxes are imposed; and women are frequently [[wikt:debauch|debauched]] by the Shemites. Salome desecrate the temple of Ishtar in the center of her city and summons a demon, Thaug, to live inside it. Soon, the citizens of Khauran are routinely sacrificed to Thaug.

Conan has been expanding the numbers of Zuagirs as Vladislav's lieutenant, while also secretly establishing communication with the Khaurani Knights who had become refugees. When he has a sufficient force, Conan deposes Vladislav's leadership of the Zuagirs, but doesn't kill him in repayment for Vladislav having saved his life from the cross. Conan fakes the construction of siege engines with palm trees and painted silk. Soon, Constantius is fooled by this as his scouts cannot get close enough to see them properly and Conan is known for his experience in all manner of warfare. The Shemitish mercenaries ride out of their city for an open-field battle, with Constantius expecting only the lightly armed Zuagirs, but are taken by surprise by the Khaurani cavalry hidden amongst them. Conan's forces are victorious, ruthlessly taking no prisoners. The Zuagirs, Semite nomads, are hereditary enemies of the Western Semite city dwellers from whom Constantius' mercenaries were drawn, while the Khaurani exiles are full of bitterness over the Semites' oppression of their city; neither are inclined to be merciful to their defeated enemies.

Meanwhile, Valerius, a former member of the Khaurani army, has discovered the secret of Salome's masquerade, and the fact that Salome is holding the real Taramis within her dungeon. With Conan's forces approaching Khauran, Valerius plans to rescue Taramis and reveal the conspiracy to his people or to escape with the true queen. Conan's victory is not certain to the Khauranis and they are nervous about his intentions if he does take Khauran. When it becomes apparent that Conan has defeated Constantius' Shemites, Salome decides to kill Taramis before his army can reclaim the city. She thwarts Valerius' rescue attempt and sends Taramis to the former temple of Ishtar to sacrifice her to Thaug. Valerius saves Taramis and kills Salome, but not before she unleashes Thaug. Conan arrives with his Khaurani allies and some Zuagir warriors, who kill the demon with two flights of arrows.

Soon, Taramis offers to make Conan her royal councillor and captain. However, he declines the queen's offer and nominates Valerius instead. Conan, as chief of the Zuagirs, drives away the remaining Shemites (capturing Constantius in the process) and leaves to raid the nearby kingdom of Turan. Before leaving Khauran, he crucifies Constantius at the site where he'd been crucified, commenting with irony to a crucified Constantius the difference between their respective situations: \"I hung there on a cross as you are hanging, and I lived, thanks to circumstances and a stamina peculiar to barbarians. But you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown. And so, Falcon, I leave you to the companionship of [[Vulture|another bird of the desert]].\"

Salome's words at the beginning - \"'Every century a witch shall be born.' So ran the ancient curse. And so it has come to pass. Each was named Salome. I too am Salome. It was always Salome, the witch. It will always be Salome, the witch, even when the mountains of ice have roared down from the pole and ground the civilizations to ruin, and a new world has risen from the ashes and dust—even then there shall be Salomes to walk the earth, to trap men's hearts by their sorcery, to dance before the kings of the world, and see the heads of the wise men fall at their pleasure\" - clearly imply that the witch Salome of this story is an earlier incarnation of the notorious [[Salome]] of the [[New Testament]], who instigated the beheading of [[John the Baptist]].

==Style==
[[File:Avon Fantasy Reader 10.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of ''Avon Fantasy Reader'' #10 (1949). The first reprinting of the story. Unknown artist.]]

A theme of paranoia runs through the story.  Howard uses a theme common to his works in having evil hide behind innocent features. Similarly, Vladislav is unaware of Conan's plans until it's too late. Of all the characters, only Conan is aware of all the facts.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The twin sisters, Taramis and Salome, are an instance of Howard's interest in siblings and the theme of duality, which appeared in several other works.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

Howard may have been experimenting with style in this novella, leaving behind any standard pulp formula. Conan dominates the story, but he is only actually present in two chapters.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The narrative instead builds the plot by following others, such as Valerius, Salome, and a wandering savant named Astreas.

Louinet suggests that Conan becomes figuratively immortal and superhuman following his crucifixion: \"How can anybody kill a character—literarily or literally—who can survive such a scene as that one?\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

The supernatural elements of the story are minor and may only have been included to justify publication in ''Weird Tales''.<ref name=\"Weinberg\">{{Citation |last = Weinberg |first = Robert |authorlink = Robert Weinberg |year = 1976 |title = The Annotated Guide to Robert E. Howard's Sword and Socrcery |publisher = Starmont House |isbn = 0-916732-00-2 |pages = 114–117}}</ref>

{{italic title}}
\"'''A Witch Shall Be Born'''\" is one of the original [[sword and sorcery]] [[novellas]] by [[Robert E. Howard]] about [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]. It was written in only a few days in spring of 1934 and first published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in December 1934. A book edition was published in 1975 by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher]] with illustrations by [[Alicia Austin]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/witch-shall-be-born/oclc/2967501 ''A Witch Shall Be Born''] at [[Worldcat]]</ref>

The story concerns a witch replacing her twin sister as queen of a city state, which brings her into conflict with Conan who had been the captain of the queen's guard. Themes of paranoia, and the duality of the twin sisters, are paramount in this story but it also includes elements of the conflict between barbarism and civilization that is common to the entire Conan series. The novella as a whole is considered an average example of the series, but one scene stands out. Conan's crucifixion early on in the story during the second chapter (\"The Tree of Death\") is considered one of the most memorable scenes in the entire series. A variation of this scene was included in the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

==Plot==
[[Queen Taramis]] of Khauran awakens one day to find her identical twin sister, Salome, staring her in the face. As an infant, [[Salome]] was deemed a witch due to a crescent-shaped birthmark on her chest. This birthmark was believed to be a sign of evil, so she was left in the desert to die. However, a magician from Khitai (China) found Salome, brought her up, and instructed her in the art of sorcery.

Salome has conspired with a [[voivode]] named Constantius, also known as \"The Falcon\", the Kothic leader for an army of Shemitish mercenaries, to take over the city of Khauran. Queen Taramis is sent to the palace dungeon, with the implications of torture and rape. Salome assumes Taramis' identity as the queen of Khauran and names Constantius as her royal consort. The Khaurani army is disbanded and replaced by Constantius' Shemitish mercenaries, an event which turns violent when the captain of the queen's guard, Conan the Cimmerian, refuses to obey Salome's order.

After putting his back against a wall while killing a number of Constantius' warriors, Conan is finally captured and crucified for his defiance. Olgerd [[Vladislav]], the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporoskan]] leader of a band of Zuagir desert raiders, is riding by with his scouting party and discovers a crucified Conan a mile outside the city walls. Vladislav doesn't entirely help Conan. He has the base of the cross cut, leaving it to fate and Conan's hardiness that he isn't crushed by the heavy wood. Vladislav then refuses to give Conan any water, claiming the Cimmerian must wait until after a ten-mile trek towards their outlaw camp to prove himself worthy of his band.

In Khauran, Salome's reign as \"Taramis\" has plunged the city into ruin. Citizens are killed, tortured, or sold as slaves; heavy taxes are imposed; and women are frequently [[wikt:debauch|debauched]] by the Shemites. Salome desecrates the temple of Ishtar in the center of her city and summons a demon, Thaug, to live inside it. Soon, the citizens of Khauran are routinely sacrificed to Thaug.

Conan has been expanding the numbers of Zuagirs as Vladislav's lieutenant, while also secretly establishing communication with the Khaurani Knights who had become refugees. When he has a sufficient force, Conan deposes Vladislav's leadership of the Zuagirs, but doesn't kill him in repayment for Vladislav having saved his life from the cross. Conan fakes the construction of siege engines with palm trees and painted silk. Soon, Constantius is fooled by this as his scouts cannot get close enough to see them properly and Conan is known for his experience in all manner of warfare. The Shemitish mercenaries ride out of their city for an open-field battle, with Constantius expecting only the lightly armed Zuagirs, but are taken by surprise by the Khaurani cavalry hidden amongst them. Conan's forces are victorious, ruthlessly taking no prisoners. The Zuagirs, Shemite nomads, are hereditary enemies of the Western Shemite city dwellers from whom Constantius' mercenaries were drawn, while the Khaurani exiles are full of bitterness over the Shemites' oppression of their city; neither are inclined to be merciful to their defeated enemies.

Meanwhile, Valerius, a former member of the Khaurani army, has discovered the secret of Salome's masquerade, and the fact that Salome is holding the real Taramis within her dungeon. With Conan's forces approaching Khauran, Valerius plans to rescue Taramis and reveal the conspiracy to his people or to escape with the true queen. Conan's victory is not certain to the Khauranis and they are nervous about his intentions if he does take Khauran. When it becomes apparent that Conan has defeated Constantius' Shemites, Salome decides to kill Taramis before his army can reclaim the city. She thwarts Valerius' rescue attempt and sends Taramis to the former temple of Ishtar to sacrifice her to Thaug. Valerius saves Taramis and kills Salome, but not before she unleashes Thaug. Conan arrives with his Khaurani allies and some Zuagir warriors, who kill the demon with two flights of arrows.

Soon, Taramis offers to make Conan her royal councillor and captain. However, he declines the queen's offer and nominates Valerius instead. Conan, as chief of the Zuagirs, drives away the remaining Shemites (capturing Constantius in the process) and leaves to raid the nearby kingdom of Turan. Before leaving Khauran, he crucifies Constantius at the site where he'd been crucified, commenting with irony to a crucified Constantius the difference between their respective situations: \"I hung there on a cross as you are hanging, and I lived, thanks to circumstances and a stamina peculiar to barbarians. But you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown. And so, Falcon, I leave you to the companionship of [[Vulture|another bird of the desert]].\"

Salome's words at the beginning - \"'Every century a witch shall be born.' So ran the ancient curse. And so it has come to pass. Each was named Salome. I too am Salome. It was always Salome, the witch. It will always be Salome, the witch, even when the mountains of ice have roared down from the pole and ground the civilizations to ruin, and a new world has risen from the ashes and dust—even then there shall be Salomes to walk the earth, to trap men's hearts by their sorcery, to dance before the kings of the world, and see the heads of the wise men fall at their pleasure\" - clearly imply that the witch Salome of this story is an earlier incarnation of the notorious [[Salome]] of the [[New Testament]], who instigated the beheading of [[John the Baptist]].

A theme of paranoia runs through the story.  Howard uses a theme common to his works in having evil hide behind innocent features. Similarly, Vladislav is unaware of Conan's plans until it's too late. Of all the characters, only Conan is aware of all the facts.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The twin sisters, Taramis and Salome, are an instance of Howard's interest in siblings and the theme of duality, which appeared in several other works.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

Howard may have been experimenting with style in this novella, leaving behind any standard pulp formula. Conan dominates the story, but he is only actually present in two chapters.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The narrative instead builds the plot by following others, such as Valerius, Salome, and a wandering savant named Astreas.

Louinet suggests that Conan becomes figuratively immortal and superhuman following his crucifixion: \"How can anybody kill a character—literarily or literally—who can survive such a scene as that one?\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

The supernatural elements of the story are minor and may only have been included to justify publication in ''Weird Tales''.<ref name=\"Weinberg\">{{Citation |last = Weinberg |first = Robert |authorlink = Robert Weinberg |year = 1976 |title = The Annotated Guide to Robert E. Howard's Sword and Socrcery |publisher = Starmont House |isbn = 0-916732-00-2 |pages = 114–117}}</ref>
The demon Thaug is similar to that in Howard's unfinished novel ''[[Almuric]]'', which he had abandoned only a few months before starting this story.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  The quick reveal and defeat of the demon may indicate that Howard was embarrassed by its inclusion.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />

The ongoing theme of Barbarism vs. Civilization, which pervades the entire Conan series, is present in this story in two crucifixions. Conan is able to endure and survive his crucifixion, as well as the subsequent journey without water, thanks to his barbarian stamina. When Constantius is finally crucified, Conan states \"You are more fit to inflict torture than endure it. ...You civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as ours.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />

This story was written in late May or early June 1934.<ref name=\"Louinet\">{{Citation |last = Louinet |first = Patrice |year = 2003 |title = The Bloody Crown of Conan |chapter = Hyborian Genesis Part II |publisher = Del Rey Books |isbn = 0-345-46152-5 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 358–359] |chapter-url-access = registration |chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 }}</ref>  [[Farnsworth Wright]], editor of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', was running out of Conan stories which were growing in popularity and attracting new readers to the magazine.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  Howard had recently finished the Conan novel ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', which was not intended for publication in ''Weird Tales'' and the story previous to that, \"[[The People of the Black Circle]]\" was already scheduled for August.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He finished \"A Witch Shall Be Born\" in only two drafts over a period of days in order to meet this deadline.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> Wright accepted it without hesitation, telling Howard it was his best Conan story to date, and made it the cover story for the December issue.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

==Reception==
Howard scholar Patrice Louinet refers to this as a rather forgettable Conan story but one that contains the most memorable scene of the entire series: Conan's [[crucifixion]] at the hands of Constantius.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He goes on to say that, while of average quality, it \"exudes Howard's confidence in his creation.\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

[[Robert Weinberg]] concurs, mentioning the \"best scene in the entire Conan series\" but comments that the remainder of the story is only average.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  Of the crucifixion, Weinberg writes, \"Only Howard could have given the scene life.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  He states that this scene, the \"blood and passion\", is an indicator of why Howard is better than any of his imitators.  The violence is \"graphic and elemental\" while the torture \"barbaric, primitive and real\" not allowing the hero a chance to escape.  Instead, Conan survives by sheer endurance, even killing an overeager vulture with his teeth. The passion in the text and strength of the prose suspends disbelief in Conan's survival on the cross.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  However, Weinberg criticizes the fact that much of the action takes place offstage, for instance, being related to the reader through a letter from the otherwise unseen Astreas or through a priest communicating with Salome.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />

On the same subject, Rev. Austin Spencer noted <ref>Rev. Austin James Spencer, \"Christianity and Twentieth Century American Culture\", p. 45-47, Spiritual Guidance Press, Kansas City, 1983</ref> that: \"The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] has left a deep mark on all members of Western culture, regardless of whether or not one be a Christian believer. Robert E. Howard is certainly no exception. (...) When I was preparing the present volume, a colleague drew my attention to ''A Witch Shall be Born''. I was both impressed and appalled by Howard's achievement - creating a full-fledged Pagan counterpart and total antithesis to the New Testament account.(...) The crucified Conan does not feel forsaken by his god, Crom. This god, Crom, offers neither physical deliverance not spiritual solace -  he merely endows Cimmerians with enormous strength and tenacity to fight. Conan, killing a vulture with his teeth while pinioned to the cross, is a true votary of his savage god. There are no thieves crucified at Conan's side - the thieves remove him from the cross in exchange for his joining their thievery. (...) Conan does not forgive his enemies, and certainly does not ask Crom to do so; he takes direct and ruthless revenge. For Conan, the rule is simple and straightforward - \"Crucify Or Be Crucified\". (...) One need not take literally the grim tribal god on his mountain to recognize in today's America the votaries and prophets of Crom, who would take spiritual guidance from the Crucifixion of Conan rather than the Crucifixion of Jesus\".

==Publication history==
The story was first published in the December 1934 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]''.<ref name=\"howardworks\">{{cite web |url=http://howardworks.com/storyw.htm#witc2 |title=A Witch Shall Be Born |work=HowardWorks |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref>  The first reprint followed in 1949, when the story was published in the digest anthology ''[[Avon Fantasy Reader]]'' #10.<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  The novella was the cover story and main feature of both publications.

A version of the story that was edited and altered by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] appeared in the collection ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1955 collection)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' ([[Gnome Press]], 1954).  This was reprinted several times, including the collection ''[[Conan the Freebooter]]'' ([[Lancer Books]], 1968).<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  It was first published by itself in book form by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc.]], titled ''A Witch Shall Be Born'', in 1975, which did not use the de Camp version.<ref name=\"howardworks\" /><ref>{{cite book | last=Chalker | first=Jack L. | authorlink=Jack L.

The novella has more recently been published in the collections ''[[The Conan Chronicles, 1|The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle]]'' ([[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]], 2000), ''[[The Bloody Crown of Conan]]'' (Del Rey, 2005). It was selected by [[John Clute]] as part of the [[Penguin Modern Classics]] collection ''[[Heroes in the Wind]]'' ([[Penguin Books]], 2009).  All versions used pure-Howard texts with de Camp's alterations excised.<ref name=\"howardworks\" />

==Adaptation==
The story was adapted for comic books by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]] in ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' #5 (1975). The crucifixion scene was adapted for the first Conan film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982). The original script for the film, written by [[Oliver Stone]], was based on this novella and another Conan story, \"[[Black Colossus]]\", and re-set in a post-apocalyptic future.<ref name=\"vongunden\">{{cite book |last=Von Gunden |first=Kenneth |title=Flights of Fancy |url=https://archive.org/details/flightsoffancygr00vong |url-access=registration |pages = [https://archive.org/details/flightsoffancygr00vong/page/20 20–22] |publisher=McFarland |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7864-1214-3 }}</ref> When [[John Milius]] took over directing the film, he had the script changed but retained the crucifixion scene, described by Kenneth Von Gunden as \"Howard's quintessential Conan scene: the mighty Cimmerian, hanging on a cross, nails driven through his hands and feet, tearing out the throat of a vulture which comes to peck out his eyes.\"<ref name=\"vongunden\" />

The name \"[[Queen Taramis]]\" was also used in the second Conan movie, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984), played by actress [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]].  The mark of Salome also appears in this film, with the character Jehnna, but it is not used in the same way.

The Czech [[death metal]] band [[Animal Hate]] released the album ''...A Witch Shall Be Born'' in 2008 based on this story.

Another comics adaptation was done in 2015-2016 by [[Fred Van Lente]] and [[Brian Ching]] in ''Conan the Avenger'' #20-25.

==Plot==
[[Queen Taramis]] of Khauran awakens one day to find her identical twin sister, Salome, staring her in the face. As an infant, [[Salome]] was deemed a witch due to a crescent-shaped birthmark on her chest. This birthmark was believed to be a sign of evil, so she was left in the desert to die. However, a magician from Khitai (China) found Salome, brought her up, and instructed her in the art of sorcery.

Queen Taramis is sent to the palace dungeon, with the implications of torture and rape. Salome assumes Taramis' identity as the queen of Khauran and names Constantius as her royal consort.

==Reception==
Howard scholar Patrice Louinet refers to this as a rather forgettable Conan story but one that contains the most memorable scene of the entire series: Conan's [[crucifixion]] at the hands of Constantius.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He goes on to say that, while of average quality, it \"exudes Howard's confidence in his creation.\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />

[[Robert Weinberg]] concurs, mentioning the \"best scene in the entire Conan series\" but comments that the remainder of the story in only average.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  Of the crucifixion, Weinberg writes, \"Only Howard could have given the scene life.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  He states that this scene, the \"blood and passion\", is an indicator of why Howard is better than any of his imitators.  The violence is \"graphic and elemental\" while the torture \"barbaric, primitive and real\" not allowing the hero a chance to escape.  Instead, Conan survives by sheer endurance, even killing an overeager vulture with his teeth. The passion in the text and strength of the prose suspends disbelief in Conan's survival on the cross.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  However, Weinberg criticizes the fact that much of the action takes place offstage, for instance, being related to the reader through a letter from the otherwise unseen Astreas or through a priest communicating with Salome.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />

On the same subject, Rev. Austin Spencer noted <ref>Rev. Austin James Spencer, \"Christianity and Twentieth Century American Culture\", p. 45-47, Spiritual Guidance Press, Kansas City, 1983</ref> that: \"The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] has left a deep mark on all members of Western culture, regardless of whether or not one be a Christian believer. Robert E. Howard is certainly no exception. (...) When I was preparing the present volume, a colleague drew my attention to ''A Witch Shall be Born''. I was both impressed and appalled by Howard's achievement - creating a full-fledged Pagan counterpart and total antithesis to the New Testament account.(...) The crucified Conan does not feel forsaken by his god, Crom. This god, Crom, offers neither physical deliverance not spiritual solace -  he merely endows Cimmerians with enormous strength and tenacity to fight. Conan, killing a vulture with his teeth while pinioned to the cross, is a true votary of his savage god. There are no thieves crucified at Conan's side - the thieves remove him from the cross in exchange for his joining their thievery. (...) Conan does not forgive his enemies, and certainly does not ask Crom to do so; he takes direct and ruthless revenge. For Conan, the rule is simple and straightforward - \"Crucify Or Be Crucified\". (...) One need not take literally the grim tribal god on his mountain to recognize in today's America the votaries and prophets of Crom, who would take spiritual guidance from the Crucifixion of Conan rather than the Crucifixion of Jesus\".

==Publication history==
The story was first published in the December 1934 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]''.<ref name=\"howardworks\">{{cite web |url=http://howardworks.com/storyw.htm#witc2 |title=A Witch Shall Be Born |work=HowardWorks |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref>  The first reprint followed in 1949, when the story was published in the digest anthology ''[[Avon Fantasy Reader]]'' #10.<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  The novella was the cover story and main feature of both publications.

A version of the story that was edited and altered by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] appeared in the collection ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1955 collection)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' ([[Gnome Press]], 1954).  This was reprinted several times, including the collection ''[[Conan the Freebooter]]'' ([[Lancer Books]], 1968).<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  It was first published by itself in book form by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc.]], titled ''A Witch Shall Be Born'', in 1975, which did not use the de Camp version.<ref name=\"howardworks\" /><ref>{{cite book | last=Chalker | first=Jack L. | authorlink=Jack L. Chalker |author2=Mark Owings | title=The Science-Fantasy Publishers: A Bibliographic History, 1923–1998 | location=Westminster, Maryland and Baltimore | publisher=Mirage Press, Ltd. | year=1998| page=322}}</ref>

The novella has more recently been published in the collections ''[[The Conan Chronicles, 1|The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle]]'' ([[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]], 2000), ''[[The Bloody Crown of Conan]]'' (Del Rey, 2005). It was selected by [[John Clute]] as part of the [[Penguin Modern Classics]] collection ''[[Heroes in the Wind]]'' ([[Penguin Books]], 2009).  All versions used pure-Howard texts with de Camp's alterations excised.<ref name=\"howardworks\" />

==Adaptation==
The story was adapted for comic books by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]] in ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' #5 (1975). The crucifixion scene was adapted for the first Conan film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982). The original script for the film, written by [[Oliver Stone]], was based on this novella and another Conan story, \"[[Black Colossus]]\", and re-set in a post-apocalyptic future.<ref name=\"vongunden\">{{cite book |last=Von Gunden |first=Kenneth |title=Flights of Fancy |url=https://archive.org/details/flightsoffancygr00vong |url-access=registration |pages = [https://archive.org/details/flightsoffancygr00vong/page/20 20–22] |publisher=McFarland |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7864-1214-3 }}</ref> When [[John Milius]] took over directing the film, he had the script changed but retained the crucifixion scene, described by Kenneth Von Gunden as \"Howard's quintessential Conan scene: the mighty Cimmerian, hanging on a cross, nails driven through his hands and feet, tearing out the throat of a vulture which comes to peck out his eyes.\"<ref name=\"vongunden\" />

The name \"[[Queen Taramis]]\" was also used in the second Conan movie, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984), played by actress [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]].  The mark of Salome also appears in this film, with the character Jehnna, but it is not used in the same way.

The Czech [[death metal]] band [[Animal Hate]] released the album ''...A Witch Shall Be Born'' in 2008 based on this story.

Another comics adaptation was done in 2015-2016 by [[Fred Van Lente]] and [[Brian Ching]] in ''Conan the Avenger'' #20-25.

'''Xingtai''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|邢|台}} |t=邢臺 ''or'' 邢台 |p=Xíngtái |w=Hsing<sup>2</sup>-tai<sup>2</sup>}}), formerly known as '''[[Xing Prefecture (Hebei)|Xingzhou]]''' and '''Shunde''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in southern [[Hebei]] province, People's Republic of China. It has a total area of {{convert|12486|km2}} and administers 2 [[district of China|districts]], 2 [[county-level cities]] and 15 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]. At the 2010 census, its population was 7,104,103 inhabitants whom 1,461,809 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of 2 urban districts and Xingtai and Nanhe Counties largely being conurbated now. It borders [[Shijiazhuang]] and [[Hengshui]] in the north, [[Handan]] in the south, and the provinces of [[Shandong]] and [[Shanxi]] in the east and west respectively.

==History==
Xingtai is the oldest city in North China.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The history of Xingtai can be traced back 3500 years ago. During the [[Shang Dynasty]], Xingtai functioned as a [[capitals of China|capital city]]. During the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the [[Xing (state)|State of Xing]]{{spaced ndash}}from which the present name derives{{spaced ndash}}was founded in the city. During the [[Warring States period]], the [[state of Zhao]] made Xingtai its provisional capital. The city was known as '''Xindu''' for most of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but after the 207 BC [[Battle of Julu]] (within present-day [[Pingxiang County]], not today's [[Julu County]]), it became known as '''Xiangguo'''. During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms Period]], when the [[Later Zhao]] was founded by [[Shi Le]] of the [[Jie people|Jie]], the capital was again at Xiangguo. During the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang dynasties]], the city was known as '''Xingzhou'''.

Sui, Tang and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] times saw the zenith of ceramics production in what was the most prolific ceramics center of northern China (rivaling the [[Yue ware]] from the South). The white ware and new technologies developed in the '''Xing Kiln''' mark the transition from proto-porcelain to proper '''[[porcelain]]'''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=Xiaoyan|title=The Most Ancient White Porcelain in China|url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/cs/201810/t20181011_800143922.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=China Today|date=October 11, 2018}}</ref> More than thirty kiln site have been excavated in different subdivisions of today's Xingtai City and a large high-tech museum have been established in Neiqiu County in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=Xiaoyan|title=Significant Results from the Excavation of Xing Kiln Site in 2012|url=http://chinesearchaeology.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2013/1026/43164.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=Chinese Archaeology|date=April 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Xingyao Museum|url=http://www.shijiazhuanggd.com/mlxt/yzxt/fjms/jdjs/201902/t20190212_462194.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=Shijiazhuang Municipality Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Xing Kiln Museum / YCA|url=https://www.archdaily.com/917716/xing-kiln-museum-yca|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=ArchDaily|date=May 29, 2019}}</ref>

During the [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing dynasties]], Xingtai was called '''Shunteh''' (''Shundefu'') and functioned as a prefecture in China.

==Geography and climate==
Xingtai has a continental, [[monsoon]]-influenced [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''),<ref>Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. (2007). [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png \"Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification\"]. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. 11: 1633-1644. {{ISSN|1027-5606}}.</ref> characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. The annual rainfall, more than half of which falls in July and August alone, is highly variable and not reliable. In the city itself, this amount has averaged to a meagre {{convert|493|mm|1}} per annum.

===Air pollution===

As air [[pollution in China]] is at an all-time high, several Hebei cities are among the most polluted cities and has one of the worst air quality in China. Reporting on China's '''[[airpocalypse]]''' has been accompanied by what seems like a monochromatic slideshow of the country's several cities smothered in thick smog. According to a survey made by \"Global voices China\" in February 2013, 7 cities in Hebei including Xingtai, [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Baoding]], [[Handan]], [[Langfang]], [[Hengshui]] and [[Tangshan]], are among China's 10 most polluted cities.

'''Xingtai''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|邢|台}} |t=邢臺 ''or'' 邢台 |p=Xíngtái |w=Hsing<sup>2</sup>-tai<sup>2</sup>}}), formerly known as '''[[Xing Prefecture (Hebei)|Xingzhou]]''' and '''Shunde''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in southern [[Hebei]] province, People's Republic of China. It has a total area of {{convert|12486|km2}} and administers 2 [[district of China|districts]], 2 [[county-level cities]] and 15 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]. At the 2010 census, its population was 7,104,103 inhabitants whom 1,461,809 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of 2 urban districts and Xingtai and Nanhe Counties largely being conurbated now.

==History==
Xingtai is the oldest city in North China.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The history of Xingtai can be traced back 3500 years ago. During the [[Shang Dynasty]], Xingtai functioned as a [[capitals of China|capital city]]. During the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the [[Xing (state)|State of Xing]]{{spaced ndash}}from which the present name derives{{spaced ndash}}was founded in the city. During the [[Warring States period]], the [[state of Zhao]] made Xingtai its provisional capital. The city was known as '''Xindu''' for most of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but after the 207 BC [[Battle of Julu]] (within present-day [[Pingxiang County]], not today's [[Julu County]]), it became known as '''Xiangguo'''. During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms Period]], when the [[Later Zhao]] was founded by [[Shi Le]] of the [[Jie people|Jie]], the capital was again at Xiangguo. During the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang dynasties]], the city was known as '''Xingzhou'''.

Sui, Tang and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] times saw the zenith of ceramics production in what was the most prolific ceramics center of northern China (rivaling the [[Yue ware]] from the South). The white ware and new technologies developed in the '''Xing Kiln''' mark the transition from proto-porcelain to proper '''[[porcelain]]'''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=Xiaoyan|title=The Most Ancient White Porcelain in China|url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/cs/201810/t20181011_800143922.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=China Today|date=October 11, 2018}}</ref> More than thirty kiln site have been excavated in different subdivisions of today's Xingtai City and a large high-tech museum have been established in Neiqiu County in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=Xiaoyan|title=Significant Results from the Excavation of Xing Kiln Site in 2012|url=http://chinesearchaeology.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2013/1026/43164.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=Chinese Archaeology|date=April 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Xingyao Museum|url=http://www.shijiazhuanggd.com/mlxt/yzxt/fjms/jdjs/201902/t20190212_462194.html|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=Shijiazhuang Municipality Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Xing Kiln Museum / YCA|url=https://www.archdaily.com/917716/xing-kiln-museum-yca|accessdate=3 March 2020|work=ArchDaily|date=May 29, 2019}}</ref>

During the [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing dynasties]], Xingtai was called '''Shunteh''' (''Shundefu'') and functioned as a prefecture in China.

==Geography and climate==
Xingtai has a continental, [[monsoon]]-influenced [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''),<ref>Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. (2007). [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png \"Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification\"]. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. 11: 1633-1644. {{ISSN|1027-5606}}.</ref> characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. The annual rainfall, more than half of which falls in July and August alone, is highly variable and not reliable. In the city itself, this amount has averaged to a meagre {{convert|493|mm|1}} per annum.

===Air pollution===

As air [[pollution in China]] is at an all-time high, several Hebei cities are among one of the most polluted cities and has one of the worst air quality in China. Reporting on China's '''[[airpocalypse]]''' has been accompanied by what seems like a monochromatic slideshow of the country's several cities smothered in thick smog. According to a survey made by \"Global voices China\" in February 2013, 7 cities in Hebei including Xingtai, [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Baoding]], [[Handan]], [[Langfang]], [[Hengshui]] and [[Tangshan]], are among China's 10 most polluted cities. Xingtai ranked 1st in the list and is referred to has the worst air quality in all Chinese cities.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bildner|first1=Eli|title=Interactive Maps of China’s Most–and Least–Polluted Places|url=http://newsmotion.org/feed-story/interactive-maps-china%E2%80%99s-most%E2%80%93and-least%E2%80%93polluted-places|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=Global Voices China|agency=http://newsmotion.org|date=February 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903071400/http://newsmotion.org/feed-story/interactive-maps-china%E2%80%99s-most%E2%80%93and-least%E2%80%93polluted-places|archive-date=3 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Xingtai earthquake===
A major earthquake, known as the [[1966 Xingtai earthquake|Xingtai earthquake]], with magnitude 6.8 on the [[Richter scale]] and epicenter in [[Longyao County]] occurred in the early morning of March 8, 1966. It was followed by 5 earthquakes above magnitude 6 on the Richter scale that lasted until March 29, 1966. The strongest of these quakes had a magnitude of 7.2 and took place in the southeastern part of [[Ningjin County, Hebei|Ningjin County]] on March 22. The earthquake damage included 8,064 dead, 38,000 injured and more than 5 million destroyed houses.<ref>[http://houston.china-consulate.org/eng/nv/t439315.htm \"Major earthquakes on Chinese mainland since 1966\" by the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Houston]</ref>

The '''PEF Survey of Palestine''' was a series of surveys carried out by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] (PEF) between 1872 and 1877 for the '''Survey of Western Palestine''' and in 1880 for the '''Survey of Eastern Palestine'''. The survey was carried out after the success of the [[Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem]] by the newly-founded PEF, with support from the War Office. Twenty-six sheets were produced for \"Western Palestine\" and one sheet for \"Eastern Palestine\". It was the first fully scientific [[Cartography of Palestine|mapping of Palestine]].

Besides being a geographic survey the group collected thousands of place names with the objective of identifying Biblical, Talmudic, early Christian and Crusading locations. The survey resulted in the publication of a map of Palestine consisting of 26 sheets, at a scale of 1:63,360, the most detailed and accurate map of Palestine published in the 19th century.<ref>Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Statement. January, 1878. pp.6,12.</ref> The PEF survey represented the peak of the cartographic work in Palestine in the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Masalha|2019|p=256a|ps=: \"The systematic mapping, surveying and place‐naming projects ... reached their peak with the British Ordnance Survey of Western Palestine between 1871 and 1877.\"}}

Although the [[Holiness of Palestine|holiness of Palestine]] was a significant motivator for many members of the PEF, the allocation of British Army Royal Engineers to carry out the survey was a result of British strategic interests, particularly the proximity of the [[Suez Canal]].{{sfn|Masalha|2019|p=256}}

The popularity of the publications led to a growth in [[Zionism]] amongst Jews.{{sfn|Masalha|2019|p=256b|ps=: “…the surveys and mapping of the British Royal Engineering Corp in the 1870s led subsequently to the growth of proto‐Jewish Zionism.”}}

==War Office involvement==
As a result of the French survey work in Galilee in 1870, [[Charles William Wilson|Charles Wilson]] joined the Topographical Department of the Intelligence Department of the War Office in London.{{sfn|Goren|2002|p=105}} In addition, the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] provided another strategic imperative for the British Government to ensure the completion of the survey work.{{sfn|Goren|2002|p=105}} Colonel Home of the British War Office wrote in May 1877: \"If Russia occupies Turkish Armenia she will have the two valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris at her disposal and she will completely dominate the [[Gulf of Alexandretta|Gulf of Seuderum]] if indeed she does not occupy it. Syria especially the Valley of the Jordan will become of great importance as offering the easiest road for an advance on the Suez Canal - under such circumstances it is of the utmost importance that we should have good maps of the country.\"{{sfn|Moscrop|2000|p=119}}

John James Moscrop illustrated the nature of the involvement of the War Office in the survey work, in a detailed monograph. The success of the survey resulted from the War Office providing support to the PEF, and the PEF providing cover to the War Office.{{sfn|Goren|2002|p=105}} Haim Goren's review summarized it as follows: 
<blockquote>Moscrop takes considerable pains to show how the different governmental bodies, particularly the War Office, were involved in all stages of the Survey of Western Palestine. He shows how Wilson was in practice serving as liaison between the government and the Palestine Exploration Fund's Executive Committee, of which he was a member... He also describes how general publication of the maps and memoirs was held back until the War Office had finished with them for its own purposes. Finally, Moscrop re-examines the payments made by the Fund to those involved in the survey. Revealingly, he finds that for most of the relevant period there is no mention of any payments for the salaries of the Royal Engineers. It has to be supposed that the money came from a quite different source-that from which the men's salaries had always come, namely the War Office in London. {{sfn|Goren|2002|p=105}}</blockquote>

The “Survey of Eastern Palestine” was abandoned partly due to a change of priority for the British Government, who became focused on the events building up to the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)]].{{sfn|Goren|2002|p=106}} Moscrop writes: “The abandonment of the Eastern Survey does demonstrate the close linkage between the War Office, the Intelligence Department, and the Fund and the fact that this survey like its predecessor, the Western Survey, was not an independent survey run by the fund.”{{sfn|Moscrop|2000|p=135}}

==The surveys==

The majority of the work of the survey was carried out by the [[Royal Engineers]].

===Jerusalem survey and excavations===
The PEF surveyors, led by Charles Warren, carried out survey and excavation work in Jerusalem between spring 1867 and April 1870, building on the 1864-65 [[Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem]].<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 3. Jerusalem, p.117-119</ref>

During his three periods of residence in the region (1865–72, 1873–74 and 1881–82), [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]] led a few discrete pieces of survey work that were carried out for and published by the PEF.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 3. Jerusalem, p.293</ref>

===Western Palestine survey===
The initial survey group arrived in Jaffa in early November 1871 led by Captain [[Richard Warren Stewart]]; [[Charles Francis Tyrwhitt-Drake]] joined the group on 17 December, around which time Captain Stewart fell ill and returned to Britain.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.23</ref> 23 year-old Lieutenant [[Claude Reignier Conder]] joined to lead the group on 17 July 1872, prior to which 560 sqm had been surveyed.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.23-24</ref>

An aggregate total of 1,250 sqm had been surveyed by the end of December 1872, 1,800 by 8 June 1873, 2,300 sqm by 22 January 1874, and 3,000 by 23 April 1874. Tyrwhitt-Drake died from fever (thought to be [[malaria]]) on 23 June 1874,<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.24-26</ref> and on 19 Nov 1874, 24 year-old Lieutenant [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener#Survey of Western Palestine|Herbert Kitchener]] joined to replace him.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.26-27</ref>

3,500 sqm had been surveyed by 8 December 1874, and 4,700 by 30 June 1875. The survey was suspended for 15 months following an incident in July 1875 when its members were attacked near [[Safad]] by a group of Algerians. Kitchener returned to the region, completing the remainder of the survey between 27 February 1877 and 27 September, with a total surveyed area of 6,040 sqm.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.27-29</ref>

===Eastern Palestine survey===
The survey was carried out between August and October 1881 by a team led by Captain Conder. They surveyed 510 sqm of barely populated land, covering an area which included [[Amman]], then an almost uninhabited set of Roman ruins, and the recently repopulated [[Madaba]].<ref>PEF Survey of Eastern Palestine, 1889, page v</ref>

==Leadership==
The survey was led at different times by four senior [[Royal Engineers]]:<ref>James, Frances W., \"[http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/?p=1021  A Milestone in Palestinian Archaeology]\" Expedition Magazine 7.4 (1965), Penn Museum: \"... the party at various times being commanded by Capt. C.W. Wilson (later Col. Sir Charles); Capt. C. Warren (later General Sir Charles); Lt. C.R. Conder (later Col.); and Lt. H.H. Kitchener (later General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum).\"</ref><ref name=\"Wharton2006\">{{cite book|last=Wharton|first=Annabel Jane|title=Selling Jerusalem: Relics, Replicas, Theme Parks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1_BBK-LsesC&pg=PA202|date=15 August 2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89422-5|pages=202|quote=Among the Royal Engineers working for the Fund in the mid-1860s were Charles Wilson, Charles Warren, and Horatio Herbert Kitchener, all of whom contributed so greatly to empire-building that they were later titled. Kitchener was distinguished for his military service in Egypt and South Africa and during World War I. Warren also served in South Africa and Egypt; he was police commissioner in London at the time of Jack the Ripper’s murderous spree. Wilson, in addition to his work in Palestine, surveyed the forty-ninth parallel as the border between the United States and Canada and laid the institutional foundations for British intelligence.}}</ref>

The '''PEF Survey of Palestine''' was a series of surveys carried out by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] (PEF) between 1872 and 1877 for the '''Survey of Western Palestine''' and in 1880 for the '''Survey of Eastern Palestine'''. The survey was carried out after the success of the [[Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem]] by the newly-founded PEF, with support from the War Office. Twenty-six sheets were produced for \"Western Palestine\" and one sheet for \"Eastern Palestine\". It was the first fully scientific [[Cartography of Palestine|mapping of Palestine]].

Besides being a geographic survey the group collected thousands of place names with the objective of identifying Biblical, Talmudic, early Christian and Crusading locations. The survey resulted in the publication of a map of Palestine consisting of 26 sheets, at a scale of 1:63,360, the most detailed and accurate map of Palestine published in the 19th century.<ref>Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Statement. January, 1878. pp.6,12.</ref> The PEF survey represented the peak of the cartographic work in Palestine in the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Masalha|2019|p=256a|ps=: \"The systematic mapping, surveying and place‐naming projects ... reached their peak with the British Ordnance Survey of Western Palestine between 1871 and 1877.\"}}

Although the [[Holiness of Palestine|holiness of Palestine]] was a significant motivator for many members of the PEF, the allocation of British Army Royal Engineers to carry out the survey was a result of British strategic interests, particularly the proximity of the [[Suez Canal]].{{sfn|Masalha|2019|p=256}}

The popularity of the publications led to a growth in [[Zionism]] amongst Jews.{{sfn|Masalha|2019|p=256b|ps=: “…the surveys and mapping of the British Royal Engineering Corp in the 1870s led subsequently to the growth of proto‐Jewish Zionism.”}}

==War Office involvement==
As a result of the French survey work in Galilee in 1870, [[Charles William Wilson|Charles Wilson]] joined the Topographical Department of the Intelligence Department of the War Office in London.{{sfn|Goren|2002|p=105}} In addition, the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] provided another strategic imperative for the British Government to ensure the completion of the survey work.{{sfn|Goren|2002|p=105}} Colonel Home of the British War Office wrote in May 1877: \"If Russia occupies Turkish Armenia she will have the two valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris at her disposal and she will completely dominate the [[Gulf of Alexandretta|Gulf of Seuderum]] if indeed she does not occupy it. Syria especially the Valley of the Jordan will become of great importance as offering the easiest road for an advance on the Suez Canal - under such circumstances it is of the utmost importance that we should have good maps of the country.\"{{sfn|Moscrop|2000|p=119}}

John James Moscrop illustrated the nature of the involvement of the War Office in the survey work, in a detailed monograph. The success of the survey resulted from the War Office providing support to the PEF, and the PEF providing cover to the War Office.{{sfn|Goren|2002|p=105}} Haim Goren's review summarized it as follows: 
<blockquote>Moscrop takes considerable pains to show how the different governmental bodies, particularly the War Office, were involved in all stages of the Survey of Western Palestine. He shows how Wilson was in practice serving as liaison between the government and the Palestine Exploration Fund's Executive Committee, of which he was a member... He also describes how general publication of the maps and memoirs was held back until the War Office had finished with them for its own purposes. Finally, Moscrop re-examines the payments made by the Fund to those involved in the survey. Revealingly, he finds that for most of the relevant period there is no mention of any payments for the salaries of the Royal Engineers. It has to be supposed that the money came from a quite different source-that from which the men's salaries had always come, namely the War Office in London. {{sfn|Goren|2002|p=105}}</blockquote>

The “Survey of Eastern Palestine” was abandoned partly due to a change of priority for the British Government, who became focused on the events building up to the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)]].{{sfn|Goren|2002|p=106}} Moscrop writes: “The abandonment of the Eastern Survey does demonstrate the close linkage between the War Office, the Intelligence Department, and the Fund and the fact that this survey like its predecessor, the Western Survey, was not an independent survey run by the fund.”{{sfn|Moscrop|2000|p=135}}

==The surveys==

The majority of the work of the survey was carried out by the [[Royal Engineers]].

===Jerusalem survey and excavations===
The PEF surveyors, led by Charles Warren, carried out survey and excavation work in Jerusalem between spring 1867 and April 1870, building on the 1864-65 [[Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem]].<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 3. Jerusalem, p.117-119</ref>

During his three periods of residence in the region (1865–72, 1873–74 and 1881–82), [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]] led a few discrete pieces of survey work that were carried out for and published by the PEF.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 3. Jerusalem, p.293</ref>

===Western Palestine survey===
The initial survey group arrived in Jaffa in early November 1871 led by Captain [[Richard Warren Stewart]]; [[Charles Francis Tyrwhitt-Drake]] joined the group on 17 December, around which time Captain Stewart fell ill and returned to Britain.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.23</ref> 23 year-old Lieutenant [[Claude Reignier Conder]] joined to lead the group on 17 July 1872, prior to which 560 sqm had been surveyed.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.23-24</ref>

An aggregate total of 1,250 sqm had been surveyed by the end of December 1872, 1,800 by 8 June 1873, 2,300 sqm by 22 January 1874, and 3,000 by 23 April 1874. Tyrwhitt-Drake died from fever (thought to be [[malaria]]) on 23 June 1874,<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.24-26</ref> and on 19 Nov 1874, 24 year-old Lieutenant [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener#Survey of Western Palestine|Herbert Kitchener]] joined to replace him.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.26-27</ref>

3,500 sqm had been surveyed by 8 December 1874, and 4,700 by 30 June 1875. The survey was suspended for 15 months following an incident in July 1875 when its members were attacked near [[Safad]] by a group of Algerians. Kitchener returned to the region, completing the remainder of the survey between 27 February 1877 and 27 September, with a total surveyed area of 6,040 sqm.<ref>PEF Survey of Palestine, 1.I. Galilee, p.27-29</ref>

===Eastern Palestine survey===
The survey was carried out between August and October 1881 by a team led by Captain Conder. They surveyed 510 sqm of barely populated land, covering an area which included [[Amman]], then an almost uninhabited set of Roman ruins, and the recently repopulated [[Madaba]].<ref>PEF Survey of Eastern Palestine, 1889, page v</ref>

==Leadership==
The survey was led at different times by four senior [[Royal Engineers]]:<ref>James, Frances W., \"[http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/?p=1021  A Milestone in Palestinian Archaeology]\" Expedition Magazine 7.4 (1965), Penn Museum: \"... the party at various times being commanded by Capt. C.W. Wilson (later Col. Sir Charles); Capt. C. Warren (later General Sir Charles); Lt. C.R. Conder (later Col.); and Lt. H.H. Kitchener (later General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum).\"</ref><ref name=\"Wharton2006\">{{cite book|last=Wharton|first=Annabel Jane|title=Selling Jerusalem: Relics, Replicas, Theme Parks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1_BBK-LsesC&pg=PA202|date=15 August 2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89422-5|pages=202|quote=Among the Royal Engineers working for the Fund in the mid-1860s were Charles Wilson, Charles Warren, and Horatio Herbert Kitchener, all of whom contributed so greatly to empire-building that they were later titled. Kitchener was distinguished for his military service in Egypt and South Africa and during World War I. Warren also served in South Africa and Egypt; he was police commissioner in London at the time of Jack the Ripper’s murderous spree. Wilson, in addition to his work in Palestine, surveyed the forty-ninth parallel as the border between the United States and Canada and laid the institutional foundations for British intelligence.}}</ref>

'''edX''' is a [[massive open online course]] (MOOC) provider. It hosts online university-level courses in a wide range of disciplines to a worldwide student body, including some courses at no charge. It also conducts research into learning based on how people use its platform. edX is a [[nonprofit organization]] and runs on the free [[Open edX]] [[open-source software]] platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/about-us|title=About Us|work=edX}}</ref>

The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Harvard University]] created edX in May 2012. More than 140 schools, nonprofit organizations, and corporations offer or plan to offer courses on the edX website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/schools-partners|title=Schools and Partners|work=edX}}</ref> As of 29 December 2018, edX has around 18 million students taking more than 2,200 courses online.<ref name=\"edxYear2018InReview\">{{cite web |title=EdX’s 2018: Year in Review |url=https://www.classcentral.com/report/edx-2018-review/ |work=edX |date=26 December 2018 |access-date=29 October 2019}}</ref>

==Functionality==

edX courses consist of weekly learning sequences. Each learning sequence is composed of short videos interspersed with interactive learning exercises, where students can immediately practice the concepts from the videos. The courses often include tutorial videos that are similar to small on-campus discussion groups, an online textbook, and an online discussion forum where students can post and review questions and comments to each other and teaching assistants. Where applicable, online laboratories are incorporated into the course. For example, in edX's first MOOC — a circuits and electronics course — students built virtual circuits in an online lab.<ref>Studying Learning in the Worldwide Classroom: Research Into edX's First MOOC, RPA Journal, June 14, 2013, By Lori Breslow, David E.

edX offers certificates of successful completion and some courses are credit-eligible. Whether or not a college or university offers credit for an online course is within the sole discretion of the school.<ref name=\"edXFAQ\" />  edX offers a variety of ways to take courses, including verified courses where students have the option to audit the course (no cost) or to work toward an edX Verified Certificate (fees vary by course). edX also offers XSeries Certificates for completion of a bundled set of two to seven verified courses in a single subject (cost varies depending on the courses).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/verified-certificate|title=Verified Certificate|work=edX}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/xseries|title=XSeries|work=edX}}</ref>

The drama depicts the story of Bano, a girl from a close knit [[Muslim]] family living in [[Ludhiana]] (located in undivided [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]) in the pre-1947 era. The story follows Bano and [[Hassan (Dastaan character)|Hassan]], as they face the trials and tribulations caused by the 1947 [[Partition of India|independence]].

''Dastaan'' is the first project of its kind taken up by the Pakistani [[Mass media|media]]. Director [[Haissam Hussain]] stated in an interview <ref>[http://vidpk.com/41855/Morning-With-Hum-Momina-Duraid--Haissam-Hussain--Mehreen-Raheel--Sanam-Baloch-P-2 Morning With Hum - Haissam Hussain and Momina Duraid discuss \"Dastaan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210060120/http://vidpk.com/41855/Morning-With-Hum-Momina-Duraid--Haissam-Hussain--Mehreen-Raheel--Sanam-Baloch-P-2/ |date=10 December 2010 }}/</ref> that [[Film production|production]] for the drama began months in advance, and that the filming itself only took a little over two months. The show was broadcast on [[Hum TV]]. The show is now airing in [[Middle East]] on channel [[Middle East Broadcasting Center#MBC Bollywood|MBC Bollywood]] under the title ''حب عبر حدود'' (Meaning ''Love Across Borders''). It is one of the [[Pakistani dramas|highest-rated Pakistani television series]] of all the time.

Dastaan was also aired in India on [[Zindagi (TV channel)|Zindagi]] under the title ''[[Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam (TV series)|Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam]]'' from 23 March 2015 onwards. Previously, it was decided to run the show under the title ''Lakeerein'', but the decision was later changed. Dastaan also aired on [[MBC Bollywood]] for the [[Arab world|Arab World]] under the title [[Dastaan (TV series)|''Hub Aber Hudud'']]. 

==Plot==
Built on the true events of partition of 1947, the series depicts the events of rioting and chaos in 1947. The series is based on the novel Bano.

Based on the novel, [[Bano (novel)|Bano]], ''Dastaan'' begins with the wedding of Suraiya ([[Saba Qamar]]) and Salim ([[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]]). Suraiya's nephew, Hassan ([[Fawad Khan]]) was the son of Bano's first cousin Rasheeda. When Hassan's father died, he and his mother were kicked out of his fathers house by his paternal family and they moved back to Rasheeda's maternal house. Bano, Suraiya, Faheem and Salim and Hassan were childhood friends (and cousins) and all grew up together. When Hassan went to study at University he left home and went to Islamia college in Peshawar. Hassan returns for Saleem and Suraiya's wedding where Hassan and Bano meet for the first time as adults after 3 years. (The last time they met was 3 years ago and they were kids). Hassan starts teasing and flirting with Bano and they slowly begin to develop feelings for each other, with Hassan visiting [[Ludhiana]] every now and then. Hassan is in his final year at the [[Islamia College (Lahore)|Islamia College]] as an engineering student. He is an active supporter of the [[All-India Muslim League]], and the leader of the Ludhiana Branch. He strongly believes in the establishment of Pakistan and is an avid follower of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Qaid-E-Azam]], the leader of the Muslim League and [[Pakistan Movement]]. Meanwhile, Saleem is an active supporter of the [[Indian National Congress]], with all his friends being [[Hindu]]. He strictly believes that the establishment of Pakistan will not help, but rather lessen the position of Muslims in India. The political debate between Saleem and Hassan begins as friendly competition, but intensifies as conditions worsen throughout India for Muslims. Saleem, hot-tempered and rash, begins to bring political debates into family life and eventually forbids Suraiya to visit Hassan, her nephew. But Hassan is not dissuaded. He continues to spread the message of Pakistan throughout Saleem's family, causing Saleem's anger to explode on many occasions. Other than Saleem, his entire family become strong supporters of the Muslim League, especially Bano, who makes posters and signs for the [[Pakistan Movement]].

Bibi, [[Samina Peerzada]] tells Suraiya that a marriage proposal has come for Bano from [[Patiala]]. Suraiya panicked and tells her sister Rashida that Bano and Hassan like each other and have become close, and that if they don't get married Bano would commit suicide and Hassan wouldn't marry anyone else either. Upon hearing this rasheeda takes her brother (Kareem bhai) and sister in law (sakina bhabhi) and asks for Banos hand in marriage for Hassan. Saleem overhears this and politely tells them that they can leave because a proposal has come for Bano. Bano's parents become angry and ask Saleem who he had in mind and Saleem tells them for his Hindu friend called Ram. Bano's parent angry at Saleem, panic and agree for Bano's proposal with Hassan.  Hassan and Bano eventually become engaged, and Saleem decides to leave behind his rivalry with Hassan for Bano's sake. Soon, Hassan gets a job in [[Rawalpindi]] and has to leave immediately. He leaves Ludhiana, with the promise that they will be back 4 months later for the wedding.  Meanwhile, Suraiya is 4 months pregnant.

During this time tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] escalate dramatically, and violence breaks out all across India. Hate crimes against Muslims become common, and fighting spreads to all states, getting threateningly closer to Ludhiana every day. As the fighting becomes more pronounced, Muslims retaliate, leaving nobody safe. Saleem seems to be under the impression that his [[Hindu]] friends and their families will be able to protect his family from rioters, after he asked them whether him and his entire family and relatives should migrate to Pakistan, but upon trying to get this reassurance from them, they say, \"What will we say to them? Why would they listen to us?\"  Saleem begins sensing a cold distance his [[Hindu]] friends have developed towards him and, while on his way home, encounters a sobbing Muslim man who lost his entire family and home. He begins to realize the importance of the creation of [[Pakistan]] and rushes home, telling his family to tightly lock up their doors and gates and to be ready for any kind of attack.

On a fateful night, a group of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]] attack the family's home.  All of the men (which includes many other Muslims who sought refuge in their house) stay on the bottom floor with their swords and knives intending to fight. All the women (including Bano, Suraiya, and Bano's mother, Bibi, Sakina Khala and her daughters) are huddled on the roof of the house.  Salim and all the men are brutally murdered in a terrible [[Mass murder|massacre]]. A pregnant Suraiya, upon seeing her husband stabbed, throws herself off the roof to be with her dying husband. She lays next to him, trying to move her bloodied hand to be with his, but a rioter brutally stabs her womb, killing Suraiya and her baby. Sakina Khala and her daughters also throw themselves from the roof while others are carried away to be raped and killed. Bano's other brother, Faheem, before being killed, shouts to his mother: \"Choke Bano!\" Bibi, with Bano's tearful consent, tries to choke her to death to protect her from losing her honor, virtue, and religion from the rapists, but two of Saleem's Hindu friends arrive claiming to save them.

Saleem's friend, Ram, tries to rape Bano, but his other friend saves her by killing Ram out of guilt. Bano, alone with Bibi, manages to escape [[Ludhiana]], where they seek shelter in a refugee camp for Muslims. The [[Muslim]] refugees are headed by a young brave Muslim man who lost his entire family. Thirsty and hungry, they try to walk to [[Pakistan]], encountering poisoned wells along the way. Eventually, [[Hindu]] rioters attack this caravan. Bano is separated from Bibi and both are gang raped. Bano crawls toward her mother's now lifeless body, seeing her [[Ta'wiz]] necklace next to it. Bano, grief-stricken and in shock, wears it and lays next to her body.

A Sikh man ([[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]) stumbles upon Bano and her dead mother, and he helps nurse her back to health. He then boards her on a train heading towards [[Lahore]] and leaves. It was common for trains to arrive in [[Lahore]] full of dead Muslims with only a few survivors and vice versa. Soon this train is attacked by rioters. Basant Singh ([[Babrik Shah (actor)|Babrik Shah]]), a rioter, chases after Bano on the train. She falls unconscious, and Basant Singh kidnaps her, bringing her to his home in [[Kapurthala]]. She awakens in his home where he and his mother live. At first, she refuses to tell them her name, and so Basant Singh calls her Sundar [[Kaur]], meaning \"beautiful princess\" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. He gives her the impression that he will take her to [[Pakistan]] himself once the dangers are gone. He also tells her she can write to Hassan and he'll deliver the letters. Bano believes his lies and cannot wait to go to [[Pakistan]].

Nearly a year later, Basant has not lived up to his promise, claiming that the roadways are still blocked and that traveling to Pakistan is too dangerous. Eventually, Bano learns of his plans to forcibly marry her and convert her, and she attempts to run away again. This time though, when Basant catches her, he doesn't treat her gently as the first time. He tries whatever method he can to break her; beating her, raping her, forcing her to become a [[Sikh]], marrying her, and in the end, having her give birth to his child.

After many years Basant Singh runs to the roof to go save his child, because he is about to fall off. Instead, he slips, falls, and dies. Bano immediately takes her son and leaves to go to Pakistan. Whilst this is happening, Hassan eventually falls in love with Rabia, his cousin, and they become engaged. Bano is taken in by a lady who sends a letter to Hassan to inform him that Bano has arrived.

Hassan receives the letter and takes Bano and the child home. Hassan decides to marry Bano, and wants to break off his engagement to Rabia. Rabia and her mother come to know of this and visit Hassan's house. Rabia's mother tells Rabia to take care of Bano to please Hassan. However, one day, he overhears a conversation between his parents about Rabia taking care of Bano so Hassan can see the goodness in her. He argues with Rabia, but Rabia insists that her love is truer than Bano's. Bano overhears this and interrupts them telling them that if they truly want to do something for her, they should get married. The next day, Hassan finds out that Bano has left the house. Hassan spends many days and weeks searching for Bano. He blames Rabia for this. Bano is living with a family where she does their household chores, she gets a job in a modern family where she realises that Pakistan is not how she thought it would be. She is fired from the job. One day Hassan sees her in the mosque and he runs after her to get her back home but Bano says her friend to go to Hassan and ask him to forget Bano. Hassan then goes home and agrees to marry Rabia as Bano had wished their marriage.
One day she goes to a birthday party where she meets a gentleman who has similar thoughts to those of Bano. He offers Bano to come and work in his office where they work for the welfare of people. Bano is very happy and offers his proposal.

'''''Dastaan''''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''داستان'''}}}})  (English: ''The Tale'') is a [[Pakistan]]i TV series dramatized by [[Samira Fazal]], and based on the novel ''[[Bano (novel)|Bano]]'', by [[Razia Butt]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/8103/dastaan-history-on-tv/|title=Dastaan: History on TV|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}</ref> It is based on the partition of the Indian Subcontinent and the resulting [[Partition of India|independence]]  of [[Pakistan]], and takes place between 1947 and 1956. The drama depicts the story of Bano, a girl from a close knit [[Muslim]] family living in [[Ludhiana]] (located in undivided [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]) in the pre-1947 era. The story follows Bano and [[Hassan (Dastaan character)|Hassan]], as they face the trials and tribulations caused by the 1947 [[Partition of India|independence]].

''Dastaan'' is the first project of its kind taken up by the Pakistani [[Mass media|media]]. Director [[Haissam Hussain]] stated in an interview <ref>[http://vidpk.com/41855/Morning-With-Hum-Momina-Duraid--Haissam-Hussain--Mehreen-Raheel--Sanam-Baloch-P-2 Morning With Hum - Haissam Hussain and Momina Duraid discuss \"Dastaan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210060120/http://vidpk.com/41855/Morning-With-Hum-Momina-Duraid--Haissam-Hussain--Mehreen-Raheel--Sanam-Baloch-P-2/ |date=10 December 2010 }}/</ref> that [[Film production|production]] for the drama began months in advance, and that the filming itself only took a little over two months. The show was broadcast on [[Hum TV]]. The show is now airing in [[Middle East]] on channel [[Middle East Broadcasting Center#MBC Bollywood|MBC Bollywood]] under the title ''حب عبر حدود'' (Meaning ''Love Across Borders''). It is one of the [[Pakistani dramas|highest-rated Pakistani television series]] of all the time.

Dastaan was also aired in India on [[Zindagi (TV channel)|Zindagi]] under the title ''[[Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam (TV series)|Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam]]'' from 23 March 2015 onwards. Previously, it was decided to run the show under the title ''Lakeerein'', but the decision was later changed.

==Plot==
Built on the true events of partition of 1947, the series depicts the events of rioting and chaos in 1947. The series is based on the novel Bano.

Based on the novel, [[Bano (novel)|Bano]], ''Dastaan'' begins with the wedding of Suraiya ([[Saba Qamar]]) and Salim ([[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]]). Suraiya's nephew, Hassan ([[Fawad Khan]]) was the son of Bano's first cousin Rasheeda. When Hassan's father died, he and his mother were kicked out of his fathers house by his paternal family and they moved back to Rasheeda's maternal house. Bano, Suraiya, Faheem and Salim and Hassan were childhood friends (and cousins) and all grew up together. When Hassan went to study at University he left home and went to Islamia college in Peshawar. Hassan returns for Saleem and Suraiya's wedding where Hassan and Bano meet for the first time as adults after 3 years. (The last time they met was 3 years ago and they were kids). Hassan starts teasing and flirting with Bano and they slowly begin to develop feelings for each other, with Hassan visiting [[Ludhiana]] every now and then. Hassan is in his final year at the [[Islamia College (Lahore)|Islamia College]] as an engineering student. He is an active supporter of the [[All-India Muslim League]], and the leader of the Ludhiana Branch. He strongly believes in the establishment of Pakistan and is an avid follower of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Qaid-E-Azam]], the leader of the Muslim League and [[Pakistan Movement]]. Meanwhile, Saleem is an active supporter of the [[Indian National Congress]], with all his friends being [[Hindu]]. He strictly believes that the establishment of Pakistan will not help, but rather lessen the position of Muslims in India. The political debate between Saleem and Hassan begins as friendly competition, but intensifies as conditions worsen throughout India for Muslims. Saleem, hot-tempered and rash, begins to bring political debates into family life and eventually forbids Suraiya to visit Hassan, her nephew. But Hassan is not dissuaded. He continues to spread the message of Pakistan throughout Saleem's family, causing Saleem's anger to explode on many occasions. Other than Saleem, his entire family become strong supporters of the Muslim League, especially Bano, who makes posters and signs for the [[Pakistan Movement]].

Bibi, [[Samina Peerzada]] tells Suraiya that a marriage proposal has come for Bano from [[Patiala]]. Suraiya panicked and tells her sister Rashida that Bano and Hassan like each other and have become close, and that if they don't get married Bano would commit suicide and Hassan wouldn't marry anyone else either. Upon hearing this rasheeda takes her brother (Kareem bhai) and sister in law (sakina bhabhi) and asks for Banos hand in marriage for Hassan. Saleem overhears this and politely tells them that they can leave because a proposal has come for Bano. Bano's parents become angry and ask Saleem who he had in mind and Saleem tells them for his Hindu friend called Ram. Bano's parent angry at Saleem, panic and agree for Bano's proposal with Hassan.  Hassan and Bano eventually become engaged, and Saleem decides to leave behind his rivalry with Hassan for Bano's sake. Soon, Hassan gets a job in [[Rawalpindi]] and has to leave immediately. He leaves Ludhiana, with the promise that they will be back 4 months later for the wedding.  Meanwhile, Suraiya is 4 months pregnant.

During this time tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] escalate dramatically, and violence breaks out all across India. Hate crimes against Muslims become common, and fighting spreads to all states, getting threateningly closer to Ludhiana every day. As the fighting becomes more pronounced, Muslims retaliate, leaving nobody safe. Saleem seems to be under the impression that his [[Hindu]] friends and their families will be able to protect his family from rioters, after he asked them whether him and his entire family and relatives should migrate to Pakistan, but upon trying to get this reassurance from them, they say, \"What will we say to them? Why would they listen to us?\"  Saleem begins sensing a cold distance his [[Hindu]] friends have developed towards him and, while on his way home, encounters a sobbing Muslim man who lost his entire family and home. He begins to realize the importance of the creation of [[Pakistan]] and rushes home, telling his family to tightly lock up their doors and gates and to be ready for any kind of attack.

On a fateful night, a group of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]] attack the family's home.  All of the men (which includes many other Muslims who sought refuge in their house) stay on the bottom floor with their swords and knives intending to fight. All the women (including Bano, Suraiya, and Bano's mother, Bibi, Sakina Khala and her daughters) are huddled on the roof of the house.  Salim and all the men are brutally murdered in a terrible [[Mass murder|massacre]]. A pregnant Suraiya, upon seeing her husband stabbed, throws herself off the roof to be with her dying husband. She lays next to him, trying to move her bloodied hand to be with his, but a rioter brutally stabs her womb, killing Suraiya and her baby. Sakina Khala and her daughters also throw themselves from the roof while others are carried away to be raped and killed. Bano's other brother, Faheem, before being killed, shouts to his mother: \"Choke Bano!\" Bibi, with Bano's tearful consent, tries to choke her to death to protect her from losing her honor, virtue, and religion from the rapists, but two of Saleem's Hindu friends arrive claiming to save them.

Saleem's friend, Ram, tries to rape Bano, but his other friend saves her by killing Ram out of guilt. Bano, alone with Bibi, manages to escape [[Ludhiana]], where they seek shelter in a refugee camp for Muslims. The [[Muslim]] refugees are headed by a young brave Muslim man who lost his entire family. Thirsty and hungry, they try to walk to [[Pakistan]], encountering poisoned wells along the way. Eventually, [[Hindu]] rioters attack this caravan. Bano is separated from Bibi and both are gang raped. Bano crawls toward her mother's now lifeless body, seeing her [[Ta'wiz]] necklace next to it. Bano, grief-stricken and in shock, wears it and lays next to her body.

A Sikh man ([[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]) stumbles upon Bano and her dead mother, and he helps nurse her back to health. He then boards her on a train heading towards [[Lahore]] and leaves. It was common for trains to arrive in [[Lahore]] full of dead Muslims with only a few survivors and vice versa. Soon this train is attacked by rioters. Basant Singh ([[Babrik Shah (actor)|Babrik Shah]]), a rioter, chases after Bano on the train. She falls unconscious, and Basant Singh kidnaps her, bringing her to his home in [[Kapurthala]]. She awakens in his home where he and his mother live. At first, she refuses to tell them her name, and so Basant Singh calls her Sundar [[Kaur]], meaning \"beautiful princess\" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. He gives her the impression that he will take her to [[Pakistan]] himself once the dangers are gone. He also tells her she can write to Hassan and he'll deliver the letters. Bano believes his lies and cannot wait to go to [[Pakistan]].

Nearly a year later, Basant has not lived up to his promise, claiming that the roadways are still blocked and that traveling to Pakistan is too dangerous. Eventually, Bano learns of his plans to forcibly marry her and convert her, and she attempts to run away again. This time though, when Basant catches her, he doesn't treat her gently as the first time. He tries whatever method he can to break her; beating her, raping her, forcing her to become a [[Sikh]], marrying her, and in the end, having her give birth to his child.

After many years Basant Singh runs to the roof to go save his child, because he is about to fall off. Instead, he slips, falls, and dies. Bano immediately takes her son and leaves to go to Pakistan. Whilst this is happening, Hassan eventually falls in love with Rabia, his cousin, and they become engaged. Bano is taken in by a lady who sends a letter to Hassan to inform him that Bano has arrived.

Hassan receives the letter and takes Bano and the child home. Hassan decides to marry Bano, and wants to break off his engagement to Rabia. Rabia and her mother come to know of this and visit Hassan's house. Rabia's mother tells Rabia to take care of Bano to please Hassan. However, one day, he overhears a conversation between his parents about Rabia taking care of Bano so Hassan can see the goodness in her. He argues with Rabia, but Rabia insists that her love is truer than Bano's. Bano overhears this and interrupts them telling them that if they truly want to do something for her, they should get married. The next day, Hassan finds out that Bano has left the house. Hassan spends many days and weeks searching for Bano. He blames Rabia for this. Bano is living with a family where she does their household chores, she gets a job in a modern family where she realises that Pakistan is not how she thought it would be. She is fired from the job. One day Hassan sees her in the mosque and he runs after her to get her back home but Bano says her friend to go to Hassan and ask him to forget Bano. Hassan then goes home and agrees to marry Rabia as Bano had wished their marriage.
One day she goes to a birthday party where she meets a gentleman who has similar thoughts to those of Bano. He offers Bano to come and work in his office where they work for the welfare of people. Bano is very happy and offers his proposal.
One day, Rabia comes to know about Bano's whereabouts and she begs to her to marry Hassan. Eventually, Bano agrees and she promises that she will come. She goes to her office where the same gentleman leads her to storage room and attempts to abuse her. She grabs hold of a scissor, and stabs hims to death. She is arrested by police. Bano is taken to a mental asylum for recovery. Later, Hassan and Rabia who are now husband and wife, visit Bano.

==Recording and release==
In January 2019, The Who confirmed that they were working on their first album of new material in 13 years (since their 2006 studio album ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]''), due to contain \"dark ballads, heavy rock stuff, experimental electronica, sampled stuff and Who-ish tunes that began with a guitar that goes yanga-dang\", as Townshend stated.<ref name=\"theguardian.com The Who new studio album\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/14/the-who-confirm-first-new-studio-album-in-13-years-tour |title=The Who confirm first new studio album in 13 years|date= 14 January 2019 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 13 September 2019}}</ref> As with previous Who albums, vocalist [[Roger Daltrey]] and guitarist [[Pete Townshend]] recorded their parts of ''Who'' separately.<ref name=\"rs\">{{Cite web |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=25 November 2019 |accessdate=25 November 2019 |last=Rodrick |first=Stephen |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/who-new-album-new-tour-townshend-daltrey-913902/ |title=The Who by Fire}}</ref>

\"[[Ball and Chain (The Who song)|Ball and Chain]]\", released as the first single on 13 September 2019, is a re-recording of a Pete Townshend solo song called \"Guantanamo\", which was released on his 2015 compilation ''[[Truancy: The Very Best of Pete Townshend]]''.

The album debuted at #2 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard 200]]'' album chart for the week ending 21 December 2019.

==Cover artwork==
The [[album cover]] was designed by pop artist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] whose work includes the band's ''[[Face Dances]]'' and [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album covers. It is a patchwork of 25 squares: 22 squares showing different coloured images placed around three squares forming the word \"WHO\" in the centre of the album cover. The 22 squares depict some of the band's influences and symbols of their career and culture: 
*The [[Union Jack]] flag.
*A red [[Routemaster bus]] (referring to both their 1968 single \"[[Magic Bus (song)|Magic Bus]]\" and its accompanying compilation album ''[[Magic Bus: The Who on Tour]]'').
*A [[Royal Air Force roundels|Royal Air Force roundel]].
*Baked beans (a reminiscence of the band's own 1967 ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' album cover).
*A [[pinball]] machine (a reminiscence of the band's own 1969 track \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\").
*The band's 1979 ''[[The Kids Are Alright (soundtrack)|The Kids Are Alright]]'' release advertisement poster featuring lead guitarist [[Pete Townshend]] on stage about to smash his Gibson Les Paul guitar, with the classic caption \"This guitar has seconds to live.\"<ref name=\"feelnumb.com The Who This guitar has seconds to live\">{{cite web |url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2012/03/12/pete-townshend-this-guitar-has-seconds-to-live-guitar/ |title=Pete Townshend \"This Guitar Has Seconds To Live\" The Who Ad |date= September 2019 |website=www.feelnumb.com |accessdate= 3 October 2019}}</ref> 
*A [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] (a nod to the [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] culture and therefore, a reminiscence of the band's own 1973 ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' album cover showing a mod scooter).
*The band's 1981 ''[[Face Dances]]'' cassette edition album cover.<ref name=\"discogs.com The Who Face Dances cassette edition\">{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Who-Face-Dances/release/5512303 |title= The Who – Face Dances (cassette edition) |date= September 2019 |website=discogs.com |accessdate= 3 October 2019}}</ref> 
*Comic book characters [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (the band covered [[Neal Hefti]]'s Batman theme on their first E.P. ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'' released in 1966).
*Cultural figures such as musician [[Chuck Berry]] and boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].
*A traffic sign reading \"Detour\", which is the fourth track on the album and a reference to the band's earlier name, The Detours.

==Reception==
''WHO'' has received generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike. According to ''Metacritic'' scores, fans gave the album a 7.5/10 star rating, while critics gave the album a 79/100 score.<ref>https://www.metacritic.com/music/who/the-who</ref> Praise for the band's performance also resonated with critics. In the ''Chicago Tribune,'' Pablo Gorondi complimented Daltrey for, \"sing(ing) with power, sensitivity, range and conviction, just as he has done for decades,\" and called Townshend's voice a \"highlight,\" while still \"rip(ping) power chords and perform(ing) slinky riffs.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref> Gorondi continued his praise by stating that the dominant reasons why the album was \"such a joy\" were due to \"Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing and Daltrey's superlative singing.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref>

Conceptually, the album tackles the struggles of being an elderly rock musician, as ''Guardian'' writer, Alexis Petridis noted. \"Townshend seems more troubled than ever,\" Petridis stated, and this feeling overlaps into songs such as \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise,\" which according to Petridis, \"...views a rock career as one of inevitable decline.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/28/the-who-who-review-back-and-still-causing-a-big-sensation</ref> Musically, the album sounds like a \"traditional\" Who record. ''Senior Rolling Stone'' writer, Kory Grow, called ''WHO'',\"classic rock comfort food\" and commented on the its nostalgic feel: \"...Townshend and Daltrey...can still summon their inner Who-ness in their mid 70s.\"<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-who-who-review-919564/</ref> Likewise, ''Ultimate Classic Rock'''s senior editor, Michael Gallucci, reflected on how the band's newest album sounds more like a \"conventional\" Who record, despite the album being thematically different from any of their previous works: \"It's a throwback record for the most part, with nods all over the place to their classic work. It's not a retread, but it sounds like a Who album, which is crucial for something like this, as well as an upgrade for the 21st century.\"<ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-who-album-review/</ref>

Despite the praises for its 1970s rock sound and Daltrey and Townshend's performances, ''WHO'' has received criticism. According to Matthew Taub of ''Consequence of Sound'', some tracks are \"not particularly well conceived,\" citing songs such as \"Detour\" and \"Hero Ground Zero,\" as \"just sit(ting) there\" or \"feeling more like an intermission.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Taub also commented that the track, \"Break the News,\" which was written by Townshend's younger brother, Simon, sounded like it was, \"plucked from some kind of factory for generic acoustic pop songs — somehow like 100 other songs you’ve heard, yet none you can actually name.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Another complaint was the generational tone of the album. Chris Willman from ''Variety'' stated,\"There are hints of mirth amid the crotchetiness. Right in the opening line, when Daltrey sings “I don’t care, I know you’re gonna hate this song,” followed later by “I don’t mind other guys ripping off my song.”\"<ref>https://variety.com/2019/music/news/the-who-album-review-1203426754/</ref> ''New Musical Express'' journalist, Mark Beaumont, similarly noted this theme with the track, \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise\": \"...(it) almost reads like a 75-year-old Daltrey talking to the drunk and tardy 20-year-old who sang 'My Generation.'\"<ref>https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/the-who-who-review-13-years-since-their-last-album-this-stands-up-alongside-their-classics-2580985</ref>

==Reception==
''WHO'' has received generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike. According to ''Metacritic'' scores, fans gave the album a 7.5/10 star rating, while critics gave the album a 79/100 score.<ref>https://www.metacritic.com/music/who/the-who</ref> Praise for the band's performance also resonated with critics. In the ''Chicago Tribune,'' Pablo Gorondi complimented Daltrey for, \"sing(ing) with power, sensitivity, range and conviction, just as he has done for decades,\" and called Townshend's voice a \"highlight,\" while still \"rip(ping) power chords and perform(ing) slinky riffs.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref> Gorondi continued his praise by stating that the dominant reasons why the album was \"such a joy\" were due to \"Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing and Daltrey's superlative singing.\"<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-the-who-who-album-review-20191206-dqqjqxn5wjgbvdrblffskbuuyq-story.html</ref>

Conceptually, the album tackles the struggles of being an elderly rock musician, as ''Guardian'' writer, Alexis Petridis noted. \"Townshend seems more troubled than ever,\" Petridis stated, and this feeling overlaps into songs such as \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise,\" which according to Petridis, \"...views a rock career as one of inevitable decline.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/28/the-who-who-review-back-and-still-causing-a-big-sensation</ref> Musically, the album sounds like a \"traditional\" Who record. ''Senior Rolling Stone'' writer, Kory Grow, called ''WHO'',\"classic rock comfort food\" and commented on the its nostalgic feel: \"...Townshend and Daltrey...can still summon their inner Who-ness in their mid 70s.\"<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-who-who-review-919564/</ref> Likewise, ''Ultimate Classic Rock'''s senior editor, Michael Gallucci, reflected on how the band's newest album sounds more like a \"conventional\" Who record, despite the album being thematically different from any of their previous works: \"It's a throwback record for the most part, with nods all over the place to their classic work. It's not a retread, but it sounds like a Who album, which is crucial for something like this, as well as an upgrade for the 21st century.\"<ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-who-album-review/</ref>

Despite the praises for its 1970s rock sound and Daltrey and Townshend's performances, ''WHO'' has received criticism. According to Matthew Taub of ''Consequence of Sound'', some tracks are \"not particularly well conceived,\" citing songs such as \"Detour\" and \"Hero Ground Zero,\" as \"just sit(ting) there\" or \"feeling more like an intermission.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Taub also commented that the track, \"Break the News,\" which was written by Townshend's younger brother, Simon, sounded like it was, \"plucked from some kind of factory for generic acoustic pop songs — somehow like 100 other songs you’ve heard, yet none you can actually name.\"<ref>https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/album-review-the-who-who/</ref> Another complaint was the generational tone of the album. Chris Willman from ''Variety'' stated,\"There are hints of mirth amid the crotchetiness. Right in the opening line, when Daltrey sings “I don’t care, I know you’re gonna hate this song,” followed later by “I don’t mind other guys ripping off my song.”\"<ref>https://variety.com/2019/music/news/the-who-album-review-1203426754/</ref> ''New Musical Express'' journalist, Mark Beaumont, similarly noted this theme with the track, \"I Don't Wanna Get Wise\": \"...(it) almost reads like a 75-year-old Daltrey talking to the drunk and tardy 20-year-old who sang 'My Generation.'\"<ref>https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/the-who-who-review-13-years-since-their-last-album-this-stands-up-alongside-their-classics-2580985</ref>

[[File:Karlův most.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Bridge]], 2006]]

There are '''30 statues''' mounted to the balustrade of '''[[Charles Bridge]]''' in [[Prague]]. They form two rows, one on each side. For the purpose of this article, they are listed in the order they are passed when crossing the bridge from the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, and are divided into two categories: those on the north side of the bridge and those on the south side. The [[Statue of Bruncvík, Charles Bridge|statue of Bruncvík]] is also included, although it is not considered one of the principal statues.

Damage caused to the statues over many years has resulted in many of the originals being replaced by copies.

==Statues on the south side of the bridge==
=== Statue of [[Ivo of Kermartin|St. Ivo]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Ivo of Kermartin, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Iva'' or ''Ivona'') The original was made by [[Matthias Braun]] in 1711, paid for by the Law faculty of [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]]. The statue portrays St. Ivo as the patron saint of lawyers, accompanied by an allegorical depiction of Justice.

=== Statues of saints [[Saint Barbara|Barbara]], [[Saint Margarita|Margaret]] and [[Elisabeth of Hungary|Elizabeth]] ===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Barbara, Margaret and Elizabeth, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Barbory, Markéty a Alžběty'') The statues were sculpted by [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1707. Although there is an inscription saying IOANN BROKOFF FECIT (''made by [[Jan Brokoff]]''), their style is evidence that his son Ferdinand is their true author.

=== Statue of the Lamentation of [[Christ]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Pietà, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Piety'') Designed by [[Emanuel Max]] in 1858, upon commission from the Old Town's public authorities, the statue depicts [[Mary Magdalene]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] mourning the dead Christ. At this position on the bridge, there was originally a wooden crucifix, which was destroyed by a flood in 1496. In 1695, a statue depicting the lamentation of Christ by [[Jan Brokoff]] was installed here; this was removed to the Monastery of Gracious Nurses under Petřín hill in Prague in 1859 and replaced by the current statue.

=== Statue of [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Joseph, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Josefa'') This statue was designed by [[Josef Max]] and sponsored by Josef Bergmann, a tradesman in Prague. It depicts St. Joseph leading a small Christ, and is situated on a pseudo-Gothic base. It replaced a statue with the same motif by Jan Brokoff, designed in 1706. This was damaged by cannon fire during the 1848 revolution and was replaced by the current statue in 1854.

=== Statue of [[Francis Xavier|St. Francis Xavier]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis Xavier, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Františka Xaverského'') This statue is a 1913 replica by [[Čeněk Vosmík]] of Ferdinand Brokoff's original 1711 sculpture. The original sculpture was commissioned of the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy of [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]], but fell into the river during the floods of 1890. The statue depicts an Indian and a Japanese prince being baptized by the saint, along with a Moor in chains and a Tatar.

=== Statue of [[Saint Christopher|St. Christopher]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Christopher, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Kryštofa'') This statue was designed by Emanuel Max in 1857 and sponsored by Václav Wanek, the portreeve of Prague. It depicts the saint holding Christ as a boy on his shoulder. The statue was originally conceived by Count [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Antonín Sporck]], who wanted to build a marble statue as tribute to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1720. A plan of this was created by Matthias Braun, which was not executed.

=== Statue of [[Francis Borgia|St. Francis Borgia]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis Borgia, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Františka Borgiáše'') This statue was commissioned from Ferdinand Brokoff by the imperial Burgrave František z Colletů in 1710. The sculpture portrays St. Borgia, a [[Jesuit]] priest, with two angels.

=== Statue of [[Saint Ludmila|St. Ludmila]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Ludmila, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Ludmily'') The exact date and sculptor responsible for this statue are not known, although it is believed that it was created by Matthias Braun around 1730. The sculpture was erected on the bridge in 1784 to replace the statue of St. Wenceslas damaged in the floods in that year. The statue depicts St. Ludmila teaching her grandson, St. Wenceslas and the base contains a relief sculpture showing the murder of St. Wenceslas.

=== Statue of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis of Assisi, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Františka Serafinského'') Sculpted by Emanuel Max in 1855, the statue was donated by count [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky|František Antonín Kolowrat Liebsteinský]]. It portrays St. Francis standing with two [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]] angels, on a pseudo-baroque base. The sculpture replaced a similar statue designed in 1708 by František Preis.

=== Statue of Saints [[Vincent Ferrer]] and [[Procopius of Sázava|Procopius]] + Bruncvík column ===
{{Main|Statue of Bruncvík, Charles Bridge|Statues of Saints Vincent Ferrer and Procopius, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Vincence Ferrarského a sv. Prokopa'') One of the most artistically important pieces on the bridge, this statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1712, paid for by Romedius Josef František, the count Thun and lord of Choltice. St. Vincent is on the left, with a coffin and a kneeling penitent sinner by his legs. Saint Procopius of Sázava stands on a devil to the right.

Beside the statue of Sts. Vincent and Procopius stands a column with a sculpture of Bruncvik, (a mythical Bohemian knight inspired by the Saxonian and Bavarian knight [[Henry the Lion]] from [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]), portrayed helping a lion fight a seven-headed dragon. This was sculpted by Ludvík Šimek in 1884, and sponsored by the City of Prague. The knight, Bruncvík, is holding a golden sword, with a lion lying by his legs. This replaced a [[Roland (statue)|statue of Roland]], erected in 1502, and was intended to remind passers-by of the Old Town's privileges to the bridge, in particular the right to charge tolls and duty. It was damaged by cannon fire when [[Battle of Prague (1648)|the city was attacked]] by [[Sweden|Swedish forces]] in 1648.

=== Statue of [[Nicholas of Tolentino|St. Nicholas of Tolentino]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Nicholas of Tolentino, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Mikuláše Tolentinského'') Sculpted by Jan Bedřich Kohl in 1708, this statue was paid for by the [[Augustinian order]] convent of St. Thomas in Prague. The saint is portrayed standing on a simple base, together with an angel holding a basket of bread.

=== Statue of [[Luthgard|St. Luthgard]] (Dream of St. Luthgard) ===
{{Main| Statue of Lutgardis, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Luitgardy'') Possibly the most valuable piece of art on the bridge, the statue of St. Luthgard was sculpted by Matthias Braun in 1710 as a commission from Evžen Tyttl, the abbot of the [[Cistercian]] monastery in Plasy.

=== Statue of [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Adalbert of Prague, Charles Bridge}}
(''socha sv. Vojtěcha'') Designed by [[Michael Brokoff|Michael]] and [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1709, this statue was sponsored by Markus Bernard Joanelli, the councilor of the Old Town of Prague. The saint is represented with a prelate stick developing into a sea paddle and is standing on a base decorated with angels and the emblem of the donor.

=== Statues of Saints [[John of Matha]], [[Felix of Valois]], and [[Saint Ivan|Ivan]] ===
{{Main|Statues of John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Saint Ivan, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Jana z Mathy, Felixe z Valois a Ivana'') The most spacious and expensive sculpture on the bridge, this was designed in 1714 by Ferdinand Brokoff and sponsored by František Josef Thun, the lord of Klášterec nad Ohří. The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks. St. Ivan, the saint patron of Slavs was added to the group for unknown reasons. The base depicts a cave in which three chained Christians are praying to the Lord for salvation.

=== Statue of [[Saint Wenceslas|St. Wenceslas]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Wenceslaus I, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Václava'') This statue was designed by Karel Böhm in 1858 and was based on the design by Josef Kamil Führing. The statue was paid for by the Institute of the Blind at Klárov, Prague. Until 1822, various little shops stood on this part of the bridge.

==Statues on the north side of the bridge==
===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] attending to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]]===
{{Main|Statues of Madonna and Saint Bernard, Charles Bridge}}

(Czech: ''sousoší Madony se sv. Bernardem'') This statue was sculpted by Matěj Václav Jäckl in 1709 and donated by the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Osek, Benedikt Littwerig.

===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], [[Saint Dominic|Ss. Dominic]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]===
{{Main|Statues of Madonna, Saint Dominic and Thomas Aquinas, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Madony se sv. Dominikem a Tomášem Akvinským'') This group was sculpted by Matěj Václav Jäckel in 1708, and sponsored by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] [[Convent]] of St. Giles in the Old Town of Prague. The statue portrays the Madonna giving the Rosary to St. Dominic on the left, with St. Thomas Aquinas standing to the right.

===The Crucifix and Calvary===
{{Main|Calvary, Charles Bridge}}

[[Image:St Calvary at Charles Bridge.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Statuary of the Holy Crucifix and Calvary]]
(''sousoší Kříže s Kalvárií'') This sculpture is one of the most historically interesting sculptures on the bridge, which gradually gained its present appearance throughout many centuries. The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the [[Hussites]] in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629 but was severely damaged by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] towards the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|lapidarium]] of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in [[Dresden]], this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and [[John the Evangelist]].

The golden [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text on the crucifix was added in 1696 and is a prime example of Medieval European [[anti-Semitism]]. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, one Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out \"Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts,\" the [[Kedusha]] from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the vision from the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews, forcing them to pay for a set of golden letters referring to God and hung around the neck of the statue of Christ (information from Steven Plaut, The \"Vav\" from the Charles Bridge).  A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000.  The tablet's placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text.  Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue.

===Statue of [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]]===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Anne, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Anny'') Designed by Matěj Václav Jäckel in 1707, at the expense of count Rudolf of Lisov, the hetman of the New Town of Prague, this statue represents St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, who is portrayed here as a young girl.

===Statue of [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]]===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Cyrila a Metoděje'') This statue was sculpted by Karel Dvořák between 1928 and 1939 and was erected by the Ministry of education. It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius ([[missionary|missionaries]] who introduced Christianity to the [[Slavic Peoples|Slavs]]). The original statue of St. Ignatius which stood here, designed by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1711, was displaced by the floods of 1890 and can now be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|Prague lapidarium]].

===Statue of St. [[John the Baptist]]===
{{Main|Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Jana Křtitele'') Sculpted by Josef Max in 1857, at the expenses of Jan Norbert Gemrich of Neuberk, this statue depicts a standing St. John. This replaces a statue by Jan Brokoff, portraying the Baptism of Jesus by St. John, which stood in this position between 1706 and 1848.

===Statue of Saints [[Norbert of Xanten]], [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] and [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]]===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Norbert, Wenceslaus and Sigismund}}

[[Image:Prague-charles bridge-hradcany.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund on Charles Bridge in Prague]]
(''sousoší sv. Norberta, Václava a Zikmunda'') This statue was designed by Josef Max in 1853, under the patronage of the abbot of Strahov Monastery, Dr. Jeroným Zeidler.

===Statue of [[John of Nepomuk|St. John of Nepomuk]]===
{{Main|Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge}}

[[Image:Prague 07-2016 Charles Bridge John of Nepomuk statue img2.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The [[Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge|statue of John of Nepomuk]]]]

(''socha sv. Jana Nepomuckého'') This statue is the oldest on the bridge. The original clay design was made by Austrian sculptor Matthias Rauchmüller, based upon a wood model by Jan Brokoff. The statue was then cast in bronze by Volfgang Jeroným Heroldt in [[Nuremberg]]. The saint is presented in a traditional way, as a bearded capitulary with a five-star glory, standing on a tripartite base. The base portrays scenes from the life of St. John of Nepomuk, including the confession of Queen Johanna and the saint's death. In 1393 St. John of Nepomuk was thrown from the bridge into the river where he drowned.

[[File:Karlův most.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Bridge]], 2006]]

There are '''30 statues''' mounted to the balustrade of '''[[Charles Bridge]]''' in [[Prague]]. They form two rows, one on each side. For the purpose of this article, they are listed in the order they are passed when crossing the bridge from the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, and are divided into two categories: those on the north side of the bridge and those on the south side. The [[Statue of Bruncvík, Charles Bridge|statue of Bruncvík]] is also included, although it is not considered one of the principal statues.

Damage caused to the statues over many years has resulted in many of the originals being replaced by copies.

==Statues on the south side of the bridge==
=== Statue of [[Ivo of Kermartin|St. Ivo]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Ivo of Kermartin, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Iva'' or ''Ivona'') The original was made by [[Matthias Braun]] in 1711, paid for by the Law faculty of [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]]. The statue portrays St. Ivo as the patron saint of lawyers, accompanied by an allegorical depiction of Justice.

{{Main|Statues of Saints Barbara, Margaret and Elizabeth, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Barbory, Markéty a Alžběty'') The statues were sculpted by [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1707. Although there is an inscription saying IOANN BROKOFF FECIT (''made by [[Jan Brokoff]]''), their style is evidence that his son Ferdinand is their true author.

=== Statue of the Lamentation of [[Christ]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Pietà, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Piety'') Designed by [[Emanuel Max]] in 1858, upon commission from the Old Town's public authorities, the statue depicts [[Mary Magdalene]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] mourning the dead Christ. At this position on the bridge, there was originally a wooden crucifix, which was destroyed by a flood in 1496. In 1695, a statue depicting the lamentation of Christ by [[Jan Brokoff]] was installed here; this was removed to the Monastery of Gracious Nurses under Petřín hill in Prague in 1859 and replaced by the current statue.

=== Statue of [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Joseph, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Josefa'') This statue was designed by [[Josef Max]] and sponsored by Josef Bergmann, a tradesman in Prague. It depicts St. Joseph leading a small Christ, and is situated on a pseudo-Gothic base. It replaced a statue with the same motif by Jan Brokoff, designed in 1706. This was damaged by cannon fire during the 1848 revolution and was replaced by the current statue in 1854.

=== Statue of [[Francis Xavier|St. Francis Xavier]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis Xavier, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Františka Xaverského'') This statue is a 1913 replica by [[Čeněk Vosmík]] of Ferdinand Brokoff's original 1711 sculpture. The original sculpture was commissioned of the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy of [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]], but fell into the river during the floods of 1890. The statue depicts an Indian and a Japanese prince being baptized by the saint, along with a Moor in chains and a Tatar.

=== Statue of [[Saint Christopher|St. Christopher]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Christopher, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Kryštofa'') This statue was designed by Emanuel Max in 1857 and sponsored by Václav Wanek, the portreeve of Prague. It depicts the saint holding Christ as a boy on his shoulder. The statue was originally conceived by Count [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Antonín Sporck]], who wanted to build a marble statue as tribute to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1720. A plan of this was created by Matthias Braun, which was not executed.

=== Statue of [[Francis Borgia|St. Francis Borgia]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis Borgia, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Františka Borgiáše'') This statue was commissioned from Ferdinand Brokoff by the imperial Burgrave František z Colletů in 1710. The sculpture portrays St. Borgia, a [[Jesuit]] priest, with two angels.

=== Statue of [[Saint Ludmila|St. Ludmila]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Ludmila, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Ludmily'') The exact date and sculptor responsible for this statue are not known, although it is believed that it was created by Matthias Braun around 1730. The sculpture was erected on the bridge in 1784 to replace the statue of St. Wenceslas damaged in the floods in that year. The statue depicts St. Ludmila teaching her grandson, St. Wenceslas and the base contains a relief sculpture showing the murder of St. Wenceslas.

=== Statue of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis of Assisi, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Františka Serafinského'') Sculpted by Emanuel Max in 1855, the statue was donated by count [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky|František Antonín Kolowrat Liebsteinský]]. It portrays St. Francis standing with two [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]] angels, on a pseudo-baroque base. The sculpture replaced a similar statue designed in 1708 by František Preis.

=== Statue of Saints [[Vincent Ferrer]] and [[Procopius of Sázava|Procopius]] + Bruncvík column ===
{{Main|Statue of Bruncvík, Charles Bridge|Statues of Saints Vincent Ferrer and Procopius, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Vincence Ferrarského a sv. Prokopa'') One of the most artistically important pieces on the bridge, this statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1712, paid for by Romedius Josef František, the count Thun and lord of Choltice. St. Vincent is on the left, with a coffin and a kneeling penitent sinner by his legs. Saint Procopius of Sázava stands on a devil to the right.

Beside the statue of Sts. Vincent and Procopius stands a column with a sculpture of Bruncvik, (a mythical Bohemian knight inspired by the Saxonian and Bavarian knight [[Henry the Lion]] from [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]), portrayed helping a lion fight a seven-headed dragon. This was sculpted by Ludvík Šimek in 1884, and sponsored by the City of Prague. The knight, Bruncvík, is holding a golden sword, with a lion lying by his legs. This replaced a [[Roland (statue)|statue of Roland]], erected in 1502, and was intended to remind passers-by of the Old Town's privileges to the bridge, in particular the right to charge tolls and duty. It was damaged by cannon fire when [[Battle of Prague (1648)|the city was attacked]] by [[Sweden|Swedish forces]] in 1648.

=== Statue of [[Nicholas of Tolentino|St. Nicholas of Tolentino]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Nicholas of Tolentino, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Mikuláše Tolentinského'') Sculpted by Jan Bedřich Kohl in 1708, this statue was paid for by the [[Augustinian order]] convent of St. Thomas in Prague. The saint is portrayed standing on a simple base, together with an angel holding a basket of bread.

{{Main| Statue of Lutgardis, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Luitgardy'') Possibly the most valuable piece of art on the bridge, the statue of St. Luthgard was sculpted by Matthias Braun in 1710 as a commission from Evžen Tyttl, the abbot of the [[Cistercian]] monastery in Plasy.

=== Statue of [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Adalbert of Prague, Charles Bridge}}
(''socha sv. Vojtěcha'') Designed by [[Michael Brokoff|Michael]] and [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1709, this statue was sponsored by Markus Bernard Joanelli, the councilor of the Old Town of Prague. The saint is represented with a prelate stick developing into a sea paddle and is standing on a base decorated with angels and the emblem of the donor.

=== Statues of Saints [[John of Matha]], [[Felix of Valois]], and [[Saint Ivan|Ivan]] ===
{{Main|Statues of John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Saint Ivan, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Jana z Mathy, Felixe z Valois a Ivana'') The most spacious and expensive sculpture on the bridge, this was designed in 1714 by Ferdinand Brokoff and sponsored by František Josef Thun, the lord of Klášterec nad Ohří. The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks. St. Ivan, the saint patron of Slavs was added to the group for unknown reasons. The base depicts a cave in which three chained Christians are praying to the Lord for salvation.

=== Statue of [[Saint Wenceslas|St. Wenceslas]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Wenceslaus I, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Václava'') This statue was designed by Karel Böhm in 1858 and was based on the design by Josef Kamil Führing. The statue was paid for by the Institute of the Blind at Klárov, Prague. Until 1822, various little shops stood on this part of the bridge.

==Statues on the north side of the bridge==
===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] attending to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]]===
{{Main|Statues of Madonna and Saint Bernard, Charles Bridge}}

(Czech: ''sousoší Madony se sv. Bernardem'') This statue was sculpted by Matěj Václav Jäckl in 1709 and donated by the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Osek, Benedikt Littwerig.

===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], [[Saint Dominic|Ss. Dominic]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]===
{{Main|Statues of Madonna, Saint Dominic and Thomas Aquinas, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Madony se sv. Dominikem a Tomášem Akvinským'') This group was sculpted by Matěj Václav Jäckel in 1708, and sponsored by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] [[Convent]] of St. Giles in the Old Town of Prague. The statue portrays the Madonna giving the Rosary to St. Dominic on the left, with St. Thomas Aquinas standing to the right.

===The Crucifix and Calvary===
{{Main|Calvary, Charles Bridge}}

[[Image:St Calvary at Charles Bridge.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Statuary of the Holy Crucifix and Calvary]]
(''sousoší Kříže s Kalvárií'') This sculpture is one of the most historically interesting sculptures on the bridge, which gradually gained its present appearance throughout many centuries. The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the [[Hussites]] in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629 but was severely damaged by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] towards the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|lapidarium]] of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in [[Dresden]], this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and [[John the Evangelist]]. 

The golden [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text on the crucifix was added in 1696 and is a prime example of Medieval European [[anti-Semitism]]. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, one Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out \"Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts,\" the [[Kedusha]] from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the vision from the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews, forcing them to pay for a set of golden letters referring to God and hung around the neck of the statue of Christ (information from Steven Plaut, The \"Vav\" from the Charles Bridge).  A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000.  The tablet's placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text.  Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue.

===Statue of [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]]===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Anne, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Anny'') Designed by Matěj Václav Jäckel in 1707, at the expense of count Rudolf of Lisov, the hetman of the New Town of Prague, this statue represents St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, who is portrayed here as a young girl.

===Statue of [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]]===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Cyrila a Metoděje'') This statue was sculpted by Karel Dvořák between 1928 and 1939 and was erected by the Ministry of education. It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius ([[missionary|missionaries]] who introduced Christianity to the [[Slavic Peoples|Slavs]]). The original statue of St. Ignatius which stood here, designed by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1711, was displaced by the floods of 1890 and can now be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|Prague lapidarium]].

===Statue of St. [[John the Baptist]]===
{{Main|Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Jana Křtitele'') Sculpted by Josef Max in 1857, at the expenses of Jan Norbert Gemrich of Neuberk, this statue depicts a standing St. John. This replaces a statue by Jan Brokoff, portraying the Baptism of Jesus by St. John, which stood in this position between 1706 and 1848.

===Statue of Saints [[Norbert of Xanten]], [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] and [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]]===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Norbert, Wenceslaus and Sigismund}}

[[Image:Prague-charles bridge-hradcany.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund on Charles Bridge in Prague]]
(''sousoší sv. Norberta, Václava a Zikmunda'') This statue was designed by Josef Max in 1853, under the patronage of the abbot of Strahov Monastery, Dr. Jeroným Zeidler.

===Statue of [[John of Nepomuk|St. John of Nepomuk]]===
{{Main|Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge}}

[[Image:Prague 07-2016 Charles Bridge John of Nepomuk statue img2.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The [[Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge|statue of John of Nepomuk]]]]

(''socha sv. Jana Nepomuckého'') This statue is the oldest on the bridge. The original clay design was made by Austrian sculptor Matthias Rauchmüller, based upon a wood model by Jan Brokoff. The statue was then cast in bronze by Volfgang Jeroným Heroldt in [[Nuremberg]]. The saint is presented in a traditional way, as a bearded capitulary with a five-star glory, standing on a tripartite base. The base portrays scenes from the life of St. John of Nepomuk, including the confession of Queen Johanna and the saint's death. In 1393 St. John of Nepomuk was thrown from the bridge into the river where he drowned. In modern times it has become traditional to [[statue rubbing|touch]] the bridge here; this is held to bring good fortune and to ensure that the visitor will return to the city of Prague.

===Statue of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony of Padua]]===
{{Main|Statue of Anthony of Padua, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Antonína Paduánského'') Designed by Jan Oldřich Mayer in 1707 and sponsored by Krištof Mořice Withauer, councilor of the [[Prague Castle]] [[Graf|burgraviate]], this statue represents St. Anthony standing between two vases, holding Jesus.

{{Main|Statue of Philip Benizi de Damiani, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Filipa Benicia'') Designed by Michal Bernard Mandel in 1714, this statue was made from [[Salzburg]] marble and donated by the [[Servite]]s convent in Prague.

{{Main|Statue of Vitus, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Víta'') Sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1714, this statue was donated by Matěj Vojtěch Macht of Löwenmacht, the dean of the [[Vysehrad|Vyšehrad]] canonry.

Duke [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] acquired a number of his relics to honor the founding of [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] at Prague Castle. These relics, together with others acquired by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1355, are embedded in the cathedral building.

The 2011 final was the last major sporting event to be broadcast in Japan prior to the country's [[digital television transition|digital switchover]] that took place on 24 July 2011.

==Background==
The match was between the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] (USA), which had been a major power in [[women's association football]] since winning the [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|inaugural World Cup championship]], and [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], which had never won a major world title, or indeed even reached the finals of a major world competition. This was also the first appearances of the United States in the final after 12 years. The United States was bidding to become the first team to win a third world championship, having won in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]] and [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]].<ref>[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/womens-world-cup/france-usa-369193.html Women's World Cup – USA see off France to reach final]</ref> Japan became the fourth team to win a world championship, joining the United States, [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]].

The match was the third between the two teams in World Cup play. The United States beat Japan 3–0 in pool play in 1991, and won 4–0 in a [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]] quarterfinal match. Going into the final, the USA had never lost to Japan, with 22 wins and 3 draws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6766720/women-world-cup-abby-wambach-become-ultimate-warrior-david-hirshey |title=Just call her Air Wambach |first=David |last=Hirshey |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110714140042/http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6766720/women-world-cup-abby-wambach-become-ultimate-warrior-david-hirshey| archivedate= 14 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Prior to the World Cup, the United States was the top-ranked team in the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]], while Japan was ranked fourth.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=f/fullranking.html FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking]</ref>

This marked the first time that a team won the World Cup having lost a match in pool play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ycn-8777149|title=Quarterfinal losses open door for World Cup history: A fan’s take}}</ref>

Japan became only the second [[Asian Football Confederation|Asian]] national team to reach the FIFA Women's World Cup Final, following [[China women's national football team|China]]'s final appearance against the United States in 1999. This was also only the second final not involving a [[UEFA|European]] team.

The 2011 final was the last major sporting event to be broadcast in Japan prior to the country's [[digital television transition|digital switchover]] that took place on 24 July 2011.

==Background==
The match was between the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] (USA), which had been a major power in [[women's association football]] since winning the [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|inaugural World Cup championship]], and [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], which had never won a major world title, or indeed even reached the finals of a major world competition. This was also the first appearances of the United States in the final after 12 years. The United States was bidding to become the first team to win a third world championship, having won in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]] and [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]].<ref>[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/womens-world-cup/france-usa-369193.html Women's World Cup – USA see off France to reach final]</ref> Japan became the fourth team to win a world championship, joining the United States, [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]].

The match was the third between the two teams in World Cup play. The United States beat Japan 3–0 in pool play in 1991, and won 4–0 in a [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]] quarterfinal match. Going into the final, the USA had never lost to Japan, with 22 wins and 3 draws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6766720/women-world-cup-abby-wambach-become-ultimate-warrior-david-hirshey |title=Just call her Air Wambach |first=David |last=Hirshey |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110714140042/http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6766720/women-world-cup-abby-wambach-become-ultimate-warrior-david-hirshey| archivedate= 14 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Prior to the World Cup, the United States was the top-ranked team in the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]], while Japan was ranked fourth.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=f/fullranking.html FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking]</ref>

This marked the first time that a team won the World Cup having lost a match in pool play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ycn-8777149|title=Quarterfinal losses open door for World Cup history: A fan’s take}}</ref>

Japan became only the second [[Asian Football Confederation|Asian]] national team to reach the FIFA Women's World Cup Final, following [[China women's national football team|China]]'s final appearance against the United States in 1999. This was also only the second final not involving a [[UEFA|European]] team.

An '''island''' or '''isle''' is any piece of [[continent|sub-continental]] land that is surrounded by [[water]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Webster's Dictionary-Island|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009102847/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|archivedate=October 9, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Very small islands such as emergent land features on [[atoll]]s can be called [[islet]]s, [[skerry|skerries]], [[cay]]s or keys. An [[river island|island in a river]] or a [[lake island]] may be called an [[ait|eyot or ait]], and a small island off the coast may be called a [[holm (island)|holm]]. Sedimentary islands in the [[Ganges delta]] are called [[List of islands of Bangladesh|chars]]. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands, such as the [[Philippines]], is referred to as an [[archipelago]].

An island may be described as such, despite the presence of an artificial land bridge; examples are [[Singapore]] and its [[Johor–Singapore Causeway|causeway]], and the various [[Netherlands|Dutch]] delta islands, such as [[IJsselmonde (island)|IJsselmonde]]. Some places may even retain \"island\" in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill, such as [[Coney Island]] and [[Coronado, California|Coronado Island]], though these are, strictly speaking, [[tied island]]s. Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the [[mainland]] by a man-made canal, for example the [[Peloponnese]] by the [[Corinth Canal]], more or less the entirety of [[Fennoscandia]] by the [[White Sea Canal]], or [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] in northern [[Manhattan]] during the time between the building of the [[United States Ship Canal]] and the filling-in of the [[Harlem River]] which surrounded the area, it is generally not considered an island.

There are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic. There are also [[artificial island]]s, which are man-made.

==Etymology==
The word ''island'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''iland'', from [[Old English]] ''igland'' (from ''ig'' or ''ieg'', similarly meaning 'island' when used independently, and [[-land]] carrying its contemporary meaning; cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''eiland'' (\"island\"), [[German language|German]] ''Eiland'' (\"small island\")). However, the spelling of the word was modified in the 15th century because of a [[false etymology]] caused by an incorrect association with the [[Etymology|etymologically]] unrelated Old French loanword ''isle'', which itself comes from the Latin word ''insula''.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Island |title=Island |accessdate=March 5, 2007 |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307143713/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/island |archivedate=March 7, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=76|year=1855|issue=6|pages=66}}</ref> Old English ''ieg'' is actually a [[cognate]] of Swedish ''ö'' and German ''Aue'', and related to Latin ''aqua'' (water).<ref>{{cite book

==Differentiation from continents==
[[Greenland]] is the world's largest island, with an area of over 2.1 million km<sup>2</sup>, while [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], the world's smallest continent, has an area of 7.6 million km<sup>2</sup>, but there is no standard of size that distinguishes islands from [[continent]]s,<ref name=\"google1\">Brown, Mike.

There is a difference between islands and [[continent]]s in terms of [[geology]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/story/is-australia-an-island Britannica: Is Austrailia an Island?]</ref>
Continents are the largest [[landmass]] of a particular [[continental plate]]; this holds true for [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], which sits on its own continental lithosphere and tectonic plate (the [[Australian plate]]).
By contrast, islands are either extensions of the [[oceanic crust]] (e.g. volcanic islands), or belong to a continental plate containing a larger landmass; the latter is the case of Greenland, which sits on the [[North American plate]].

==Types of islands==
===Continental islands===<!-- This section is linked from [[Great Barrier Reef]] -->
{{More|Continental shelf}}

Continental islands are bodies of land that lie on the [[continental shelf]] of a [[continent]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Island (geography)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295958/island#ref234009|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008102906/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295958/island#ref234009|archivedate=October 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Examples are [[Borneo]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Sakhalin]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Hainan]] off [[Asia]]; [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Kangaroo Island]] off [[Australia]]; [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], and [[Sicily]] off [[Europe]]; [[Greenland]], [[Newfoundland]], [[Long Island]], and [[Sable Island]] off [[North America]]; and [[Barbados]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[Trinidad]] off [[South America]].

A special type of continental island is the microcontinental island, which is created when a continent is [[rift|rifted]]. Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].

Another subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:

* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves
* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.

[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.

===Oceanic islands===
{{Main article|High island}}

Oceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.) (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oceanic%20island&f=false ''Foundations of Biogeography: Classic Papers with Commentaries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233729/https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |date=April 18, 2016 }}. University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.

One type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].

Another type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.

A third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.

An [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

International [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[Réunion]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].

==Artificial islands==
{{Main article|Artificial island}}

Almost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions. However, artificial (man-made) islands also exist, such as the island in [[Osaka Bay]] off the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Honshu]], on which [[Kansai International Airport]] is located. Artificial islands can be built using natural materials (e.g., earth, rock, or sand) or artificial ones (e.g., [[concrete]] slabs or recycled [[waste]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|title=Building Artificial Islands That Rise With the Sea|access-date=2016-06-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152821/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amti.csis.org/what-makes-an-island-land-reclamation-and-the-south-china-sea-arbitration/|title=What Makes an Island?

Artificial islands are sometimes built on pre-existing \"low-tide elevation,\" a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded by and above water at low [[tide]] but submerged at high tide.  Legally these are not islands and have no territorial sea of their own.<ref>{{cite book|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 13|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm|accessdate=25 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902091223/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm|archivedate=September 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''island'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''iland'', from [[Old English]] ''igland'' (from ''ig'' or ''ieg'', similarly meaning 'island' when used independently, and [[-land]] carrying its contemporary meaning; cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''eiland'' (\"island\"), [[German language|German]] ''Eiland'' (\"small island\")).

There is a difference between islands and [[continent]]s in terms of [[geology]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/story/is-australia-an-island Britannica: Is Austrailia an Island?]</ref>
Continents are the largest [[landmass]] of a particular [[continental plate]]; this holds true for [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], which sits on its own continental lithosphere and tectonic plate (the [[Australian plate]]).
By contrast, islands are either extensions of the [[oceanic crust]] (e.g. volcanic islands), or belong to a continental plate containing a larger landmass; the latter is the case of [[Greenland]], which sits on the [[North American plate]].

==Types of islands==
===Continental islands===<!-- This section is linked from [[Great Barrier Reef]] -->
{{More|Continental shelf}}

Continental islands are bodies of land that lie on the [[continental shelf]] of a [[continent]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Island (geography)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295958/island#ref234009|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008102906/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295958/island#ref234009|archivedate=October 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Examples are [[Borneo]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Sakhalin]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Hainan]] off [[Asia]]; [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Kangaroo Island]] off [[Australia]]; [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], and [[Sicily]] off [[Europe]]; [[Greenland]], [[Newfoundland]], [[Long Island]], and [[Sable Island]] off [[North America]]; and [[Barbados]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[Trinidad]] off [[South America]].

A special type of continental island is the microcontinental island, which is created when a continent is [[rift|rifted]]. Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].

Another subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:

* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves
* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.

[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.

===Oceanic islands===
{{Main article|High island}}

Oceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.) (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oceanic%20island&f=false ''Foundations of Biogeography: Classic Papers with Commentaries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233729/https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |date=April 18, 2016 }}. University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.

One type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].

Another type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.

A third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.

An [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

International [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[Réunion]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].

==Artificial islands==
{{Main article|Artificial island}}

Almost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions. However, artificial (man-made) islands also exist, such as the island in [[Osaka Bay]] off the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Honshu]], on which [[Kansai International Airport]] is located. Artificial islands can be built using natural materials (e.g., earth, rock, or sand) or artificial ones (e.g., [[concrete]] slabs or recycled [[waste]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|title=Building Artificial Islands That Rise With the Sea|access-date=2016-06-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152821/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amti.csis.org/what-makes-an-island-land-reclamation-and-the-south-china-sea-arbitration/|title=What Makes an Island?

Artificial islands are sometimes built on pre-existing \"low-tide elevation,\" a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded by and above water at low [[tide]] but submerged at high tide.  Legally these are not islands and have no territorial sea of their own.<ref>{{cite book|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 13|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm|accessdate=25 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902091223/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm|archivedate=September 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Continental islands are bodies of land that lie on the [[continental shelf]] of a [[continent]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Island (geography)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295958/island#ref234009|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008102906/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295958/island#ref234009|archivedate=October 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Examples are [[Borneo]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Sakhalin]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Hainan]] off [[Asia]]; [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Kangaroo Island]] off [[Australia]]; [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], and [[Sicily]] off [[Europe]]; [[Greenland]], [[Newfoundland]], [[Long Island]], and [[Sable Island]] off [[North America]]; and [[Barbados]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[Trinidad]] off [[South America]].

A special type of continental island is the microcontinental island, which is created when a continent is [[rift|rifted]]. Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].

Another subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:

* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves
* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.

[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.

===Oceanic islands===
{{Main article|High island}}

Oceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.) (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oceanic%20island&f=false ''Foundations of Biogeography: Classic Papers with Commentaries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233729/https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |date=April 18, 2016 }}. University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.

One type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].

Another type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.

A third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.

An [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

==Artificial islands==
{{Main article|Artificial island}}

Almost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions. However, artificial (man-made) islands also exist, such as the island in [[Osaka Bay]] off the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Honshu]], on which [[Kansai International Airport]] is located. Artificial islands can be built using natural materials (e.g., earth, rock, or sand) or artificial ones (e.g., [[concrete]] slabs or recycled [[waste]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|title=Building Artificial Islands That Rise With the Sea|access-date=2016-06-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152821/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amti.csis.org/what-makes-an-island-land-reclamation-and-the-south-china-sea-arbitration/|title=What Makes an Island?

Artificial islands are sometimes built on pre-existing \"low-tide elevation,\" a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded by and above water at low [[tide]] but submerged at high tide.

An '''island''' or '''isle''' is any piece of [[continent|sub-continental]] land that is surrounded by [[water]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Webster's Dictionary-Island|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009102847/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|archivedate=October 9, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Very small islands such as emergent land features on [[atoll]]s can be called [[islet]]s, [[skerry|skerries]], [[cay]]s or keys. An [[river island|island in a river]] or a [[lake island]] may be called an [[ait|eyot or ait]], and a small island off the coast may be called a [[holm (island)|holm]]. Sedimentary islands in the [[Ganges delta]] are called [[List of islands of Bangladesh|chars]]. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands, such as the [[Philippines]], is referred to as an [[archipelago]].

An island may be described as such, despite the presence of an artificial land bridge; examples are [[Singapore]] and its [[Johor–Singapore Causeway|causeway]], and the various [[Netherlands|Dutch]] delta islands, such as [[IJsselmonde (island)|IJsselmonde]]. Some places may even retain \"island\" in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill, such as [[Coney Island]] and [[Coronado, California|Coronado Island]], though these are, strictly speaking, [[tied island]]s. Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the [[mainland]] by a man-made canal, for example the [[Peloponnese]] by the [[Corinth Canal]], more or less the entirety of [[Fennoscandia]] by the [[White Sea Canal]], or [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] in northern [[Manhattan]] during the time between the building of the [[United States Ship Canal]] and the filling-in of the [[Harlem River]] which surrounded the area, it is generally not considered an island.

There are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic. There are also [[artificial island]]s, which are man-made.

==Etymology==
The word ''island'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''iland'', from [[Old English]] ''igland'' (from ''ig'' or ''ieg'', similarly meaning 'island' when used independently, and [[-land]] carrying its contemporary meaning; cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''eiland'' (\"island\"), [[German language|German]] ''Eiland'' (\"small island\")). However, the spelling of the word was modified in the 15th century because of a [[false etymology]] caused by an incorrect association with the [[Etymology|etymologically]] unrelated Old French loanword ''isle'', which itself comes from the Latin word ''insula''.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Island |title=Island |accessdate=March 5, 2007 |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307143713/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/island |archivedate=March 7, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=76|year=1855|issue=6|pages=66}}</ref> Old English ''ieg'' is actually a [[cognate]] of Swedish ''ö'' and German ''Aue'', and related to Latin ''aqua'' (water).<ref>{{cite book

There is a difference between islands and [[continent]]s in terms of [[geology]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/story/is-australia-an-island Britannica: Is Austrailia an Island?]</ref>
Continents are the largest [[landmass]] of a particular [[continental plate]]; this holds true for [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], which sits on its own continental lithosphere and tectonic plate (the [[Australian plate]]).
By contrast, islands are either extensions of the [[oceanic crust]] (e.g. volcanic islands), or belong to a continental plate containing a larger landmass; the latter is the case of [[Greenland]], which sits on the [[North American plate]].

The '''Wadiyar''' (alternatively spelt '''Wodeyer''' or '''Odeyer''') dynasty was a [[Hindu]] [[Yaduvanshi]] dynasty in [[Indian people|Indian]] subcontinent that ruled the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] from 1399 to 1950, with a brief interruption in the late 1700s.  The kingdom was incorporated into the [[Dominion of India]] after its independence from British rule.

==Name==
The word \"Wadiyar\" ([[Kannada]]: ಒಡೆಯರ್) in Kannada means \"Lord\" or \"Lordship.\" Historical records use the term ″Wodeyar″ when referring to the dynasty's royal family members; the ″W″ is silent. In more modern Kannada transliteration, the variation ″Odeyar″ is also used.[[File:HH Sri Chamarajendra Wadiyar X.jpg|thumb|HH Sri [[Chamarajendra Wadiyar X]]|404x404px]]

==History==
Accordingly the Wodiyars trace their ancestry to lord [[Krishna]]'s [[Yadava]] (or [[Yadav]]) clan of [[Yaduvanshi]] and arrived from the [[Dvārakā]], and on seeing the natural beauty of the place made [[Mysore]] their abode.<ref name=\"My Life, My Profession\">{{cite ook | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lURcCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT10&dq=Wadiyar+yadava&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oQZHVZjMMYKxuQT_oYH4CQ&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Wadiyar%20yadava&f=false | title=My Life, My Profession | publisher=Lulu Press, Inc | author=H S Gururaja Rao | year=2014 | isbn=9781483410654}}</ref> However, historians Shyam Prasad, Nobuhiro Ota, David Leeming, Aya Ikegame instead suggest that the Wodiyars were local feudal lords who adopted [[puranas|puranic]] legend to claim themselves as direct descendants of legendary [[Chandravanshi|Lunar Dynasty]].<ref>Enigmas of Karnataka: Mystery meets History by S.

The dynasty was established in 1399 by [[Yaduraya Wodeyar]]. He ruled [[Mysore]] under the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] until 1423. After Yaduraya Wodeyar, the Mysore kingdom was succeeded by the Wadiyar rulers. The kingdom remained fairly small during this early period and was a part of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, the Kingdom of Mysore became independent and remained so until 1799.

During the reign of [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar III]] (1799–1868), the region came under the control of the [[British Empire]]. His successors changed the English spelling of their royal name to Wadiyar and took the title of ''Bahadur''. The last two monarchs of the dynasty, [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV]] and [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]], also accepted the British decoration [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Grand Cross of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]].<ref>Annals of The Mysore Royal Family Part-1: A publication by the Royal Family of Mysore: 1916</ref><ref name=\"kam\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/wodeyars/mummadi.htm |publisher=Kamat's Potpourri |title=Krishnaraja Wodeyar III |work=Wodeyars of Mysore |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

==Expansion==
The Vijayanagara Empire disintegrated in 1565. The power vacuum created soon after was exploited by Raja Wadiyar (ruled 1578–1617). He expanded the borders of the Mysore kingdom and in 1610 changed the capital city from Mysore to Srirangapatna; a rare island formed by the river [[Kaveri]], which provided natural protection against military attacks.

Later famous rulers of the dynasty included [[Kanthirava Narasaraja I]] (ruled 1638–1659), who expanded the frontiers of the Mysore kingdom to Trichy in Tamil Nadu. The dynasty reached its peak under [[Chikka Devaraja]] (ruled 1673–1704), who reformed the administration of the empire by dividing it into 18 departments (called Chavadis) and he also introduced a coherent system of taxation.

From 1760 to 1799, the rule of the dynasty was essentially nominal, with real power in the hands of the ''dalwai'', or commanders-in-chief, [[Hyder Ali]] and his son [[Tipu Sultan]], who expanded the kingdom aggressively, but clashed with the [[British East India Company]]. After Tipu Sultan was killed by the British in the [[Battle of Srirangapatna]] in 1799, the Wadiyars were restored to a reduced kingdom.

==British Rule==

After restoring the Wadiyars to the throne of Mysore, the British shifted the capital back to the city of Mysore from [[Srirangapatna]]. The four-year-old boy (Mummudi) Krishna Raja Wadiyar III, son of the last Wadiyar king, Khasa Chamaraja Wadiyar VIII, was anointed as the King of Mysore. Wadiyars were now subsidiaries of the British Raj and had to pay an annual subsidy to the British. However the British took over the administration of the kingdom on a specious plea of non-payment of the subsidy by Mummudi Krishna Raja Wadiyar in 1831, and British-appointed commissioners were then in charge of the kingdom.

British commissioners administered Mysore from 1831–1881. [[Mark Cubbon]] (1834–1861) and [[L. B. Bowring]] (1861–1870) are among the well-known commissioners of the period.

In 1868, the British Parliament heeded the king's plea and decided to restore the kingdom to his adopted son Chamaraja Wadiyar IX. In 1881, the transfer of power back to the Wadiyars heralded an important phase in the making of modern Mysore. For the first time in India, democratic experiments were introduced by the establishment of a representative assembly. The next king, Nalvadi Krishna Raja Wadiyar, earned great fame as a saintly King-Rajarishi, and his kingdom was hailed as Ramarajya by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] as an ideal kingdom comparable to the one ruled by the historical hero [[Lord Rama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Under British hegemony, the Wadiyars, freed from security concerns, shifted their attention to the patronage of the fine arts. They made Mysore a cultural center of Karnataka, fostering a number of famous musicians, writers and painters.

The last king of the Wadiyar dynasty was [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]], who ruled from 1940 until Indian independence from British rule. In the year 1947, after India attained independence, he ceded his kingdom to the Dominion of India, but continued as the Maharajah until India became a Republic in 1950. He became the Raja Pramukh—a constitutional position—as the head of Mysore State in the Republic of India from 1950–1956. After the reorganization of the Indian states on a linguistic basis, he was appointed Governor of the integrated Mysore State (present Karnataka State) in 1956 and held the post until 1964.

Then he was Governor of Madras state (now [[Tamil Nadu]]) for two years. The Indian Constitution continued to recognize him as the Maharajah of Mysore, until 1971, when [[Indira Gandhi|Mrs. Indira Gandhi]], then Prime Minister of India, abolished the titles and Privy Purse of over 560 Maharajahs. The Maharajah died in 1974. His only son, Srikantadatta Narasimha Raja Wadiyar (1953–2013), was a member of the Indian Parliament for many years.

== Curse on Wadiyars ==

A curse was believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death — \"Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali\" (May [[Talakadu]] become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children). 400 years since, the Wadiyar dynasty never had any children for alternate generations. Hence the adopted child becomes the king. Even till date, most parts of Talakadu (Talakad) lie under sand, and Malangi village in present Mysore district is slowly eroding due to whirlpools.<ref>{{cite web | title = Does Alamelamma's curse continue to haunt Wadiyars? | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/373910/does-alamelamma039s-curse-continue-haunt.html |work=Deccan Herald|date=10 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 400-year-old curse haunts Wodeyar royals of erstwhile princely state of Mysore|work=India Today | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/wadiyar-royals-mysore-vijayanagara-empire-tirumalaraja-alamelamma-talakadu/1/330702.html |date=12 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref>{{cleanup section|reason=Needs to be rewritten|date=July 2013}}

The Mysore kingdom, founded by Yaduraya in the year 1399, consisted of only the areas surrounding the present Mysore City. The original fort was supposed to have been at a place known as haDadana — now a small village on the southern side of [[Chamundi Hill]]. The Wadiyars, like others at that time, were under the [[suzerainty]] of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Viceroy of the Vijayanagar kingdom was headquartered at [[Srirangapatna]]. Under Yaduraya, the Wadiyars increased their influence and territory over the next 200 years. Raja Wadiyar, the ninth ruler of the dynasty, was known for his valour and patronage of art and culture. He ruled from 1578 to 1617. In 1610, he conquered the fort of Srirangapatna from Tirumala, then Viceroy of Vijayanagar. Tirumala is said to have retired to Talakad with his two wives. One of them, Alamelamma, was a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki, the consort of Sri Ranganatha, the presiding deity of the famous Adi-Ranga temple in the island fortress of [[Srirangapatna]].

Tirumala suffered from a terminal disease on his back known as the \"disease of the kings\". The condition of Tirumala deteriorated and he died. Alamelamma had a large amount of precious jewellery, including a fine nose ring studded with a large pearl. As a widow she was no longer permitted jewellery. She donated the jewels to the temple of Sri Ranganayaki. Every Friday and Tuesday Sri Ranaganayaki was decorated with a large pearl-studded nose ring and other precious jewellery, which was put into the safe custody of Alamelamma the rest of the week, since she was known to be a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki.

The temple authorities requested Raja Wadiyar to give them the custody of the jewels, as was the normal practice. The treasury officials informed the king of this fact. Raja Wadiyar thought these jewels were of no value to Alamelamma, as she was now a widow and didn't have children, she would no longer need them. Raja Wadiyar sent emissaries to Malangi, where Alamelamma was staying, with a request to return the jewels. Only the pearl-studded nose ring was returned by Alamelamma. Raja Wadiyar then sent his army to Talakad to ask her once again and, if she refused, to seize them by force. To escape the wrath of the Mysore army, Alamelamma uttered the legendary curse on Raja Wadiyar and jumped into a whirlpool in the river Kaveri at Talakadu with the rest of the jewels and escaped unscathed. The curse, as passed down in folklore over the last 400 years, is:

{{cquote|ತಲಕಾಡು ಮರಳಾಗಲಿ, ಮಾಲಂಗಿ ಮಡುವಾಗಲಿ, ಮೈಸೂರು ದೊರೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಹೋಗಲಿ}}
{{cquote|Talakadu maraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysuru Doregalige Makkallilade Hogali}}
{{cquote|May Talakad turn into (a barren expanse of) sand, may Malangi turn into a whirlpool, may the Rajas of Mysore not have children (for all time to come).}}

Hearing of this extreme step taken by Alamelamma, Raja Wadiyar was truly repentant. He wanted to return the jewellery to the temple and not confiscate it for his own use. In his grief he had an idol of Alamelamma made in gold, installed it in the palace, and worshiped it as a deity. A remnant of her hair was preserved in a box. To this day, Alamelamma’s idol can be found inside the Mysore Palace and is worshiped by the royal family. One can see the same huge pearl nose-stud adorning the Goddess Ranganayaki and Alamelamma today.

The Dasara festivities inside the palace end on the evening of Navarathri with a formal pooja to Alamelamma, and the kankana worn by the royal couple is removed thereafter paving the way for the Vijaya Dashami – Sami pooja the next day. For these nine days the royal couple are required to stay inside the precincts of the palace. Another interesting part of the story is that this Alamelamma temple is under the care of the legal heirs of Alamelamma: They live inside the Mysore Palace fort. Strangely, these priests/caretakers appear to be cursed, and they do not beget children and follow the same pattern afflicting the Wodeyars.

==The Curse from the Time of Raja Wadiyar==

After shifting to Srirangapatna, Raja Wadiyar is credited with holding the famous Dasara festivities for the first time in 1610. His only surviving son, Narasaraja Wadiyar, died (believed to be an effect of the curse in folklore) just a day before the commencement of Navaratri, but the king after consulting experts laid down the rule that the celebration of the ceremonies was not to be interrupted even by the death of members of the royal family. Raja Wadiyar was a devoted Vaishnavaite, and he donated the famous bejewelled crown to Lord Cheluvarayaswami of Melukote that is a feature of the Raja Mudi car festival even today. This is contrary to his own lineage as the Wadiyars regarded the temple of Karigiri Lakshmi Narasimha (Devarayana Durga, Tumkur) as their household deity. The mere fact that all the Wadiyars end their names by -\"Narasimharaja Wadiyar\" stands testimony to what was previously stated. This crown was confiscated from the royal Family by the Karnataka Government during an emergency. Legend has it that Raja Wadiyar, having entered the garbha–gruha (sanctum sanctorum) of Cheluvarayaswami Temple on 20 June 1617, became one with the deity (aikya). Even today one can find a Bhakthi Vigraha of the King inside the Temple. Another Bhakthi Vigraha of the King can be found inside the Lakshmi-Narayanaswami Temple inside the Mysore Palace Fort. Malangi and Talakad are two small towns near [[Tirumakudalu Narasipura]] on the banks of the Kaveri where the river takes a bend. Talakad's temples lie buried in a vast expanse of sand and are dug up and exposed every 12 years. At Malangi, on the other hand, the river is at its deepest. Whether these phenomena appeared only after Alamelamma's curse in 1610 is a matter of conjecture. What can be stated with certainty is that the curse on the royal family seems to have come true. Their chief courtier Ram Nath Molahalli was the army head.

From Raja Wadiyar’s death in 1617 to that of [[Chikka Devaraja|Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar]] in 1704 (there were four rulers in between) the kingdom was ruled by the surviving descendants of Yaduraya, but none could beget legal heirs. Incidentally, Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar is credited with the composition of Gita Gopala – an opera in Kannada. The sole exception to the curse was Chikka Devaraja's deaf and mute son Kantheerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II, also known as Mookarasu. He was succeeded by his son Dodda Krushna Raja Wodeyar, who ruled from 1714 to 1732. With him Yaduraya’s direct lineage came to an end. What followed was a succession of nominal rulers adopted by the surviving queens to continue the tradition. Traditional army commanders known as Dalvoys virtually ruled the kingdom and paved the way for the ascendancy of a foot soldier like Hyder Ali by 1762. There were five rulers from 1732 to 1796. In this period a definite pattern emerged under which no natural heir to the throne born to a king (adopted or otherwise) could beget children, whereas one who became king by virtue of adoption or other indirect inheritance was blessed with a legal heir. Hyder and Tipu continued the tradition of having a nominal Wodeyar King on the throne, and even the Dasara Celebrations continued as usual. After the famous [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the death of Tipu Sultan, a British army, in which the legendary [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (later Duke of Wellington, also known as the Iron Duke) was serving, conquered Srirangapatna in 1799.

According to legend the Wodiyars trace their ancestry to lord [[Krishna]]'s [[Yadava]] (or [[Yadav]]) clan of [[Yaduvanshi]] and arrived from the [[Dvārakā]], and on seeing the natural beauty of the place made [[Mysore]] their abode.<ref name=\"My Life, My Profession\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lURcCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT10&dq=Wadiyar+yadava&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oQZHVZjMMYKxuQT_oYH4CQ&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Wadiyar%20yadava&f=false | title=My Life, My Profession | publisher=Lulu Press, Inc | author=H S Gururaja Rao | year=2014 | isbn=9781483410654}}</ref> However, historians Shyam Prasad, Nobuhiro Ota, David Leeming, Aya Ikegame instead suggest that the Wodiyars were local feudal lords who adopted [[puranas|puranic]] legend to claim themselves as direct descendants of legendary [[Chandravanshi|Lunar Dynasty]].<ref>Enigmas of Karnataka: Mystery meets History by S.

The dynasty was established in 1399 by [[Yaduraya Wodeyar]]. He ruled [[Mysore]] under the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] until 1423. After Yaduraya Wodeyar, the Mysore kingdom was succeeded by the Wadiyar rulers. The kingdom remained fairly small during this early period and was a part of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, the Kingdom of Mysore became independent and remained so until 1799.

During the reign of [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar III]] (1799–1868), the region came under the control of the [[British Empire]]. His successors changed the English spelling of their royal name to Wadiyar and took the title of ''Bahadur''. The last two monarchs of the dynasty, [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV]] and [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]], also accepted the British decoration [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Grand Cross of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]].<ref>Annals of The Mysore Royal Family Part-1: A publication by the Royal Family of Mysore: 1916</ref><ref name=\"kam\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/wodeyars/mummadi.htm |publisher=Kamat's Potpourri |title=Krishnaraja Wodeyar III |work=Wodeyars of Mysore |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

==Expansion==
The Vijayanagara Empire disintegrated in 1565. The power vacuum created soon after was exploited by Raja Wadiyar (ruled 1578–1617). He expanded the borders of the Mysore kingdom and in 1610 changed the capital city from Mysore to Srirangapatna; a rare island formed by the river [[Kaveri]], which provided natural protection against military attacks.

Later famous rulers of the dynasty included [[Kanthirava Narasaraja I]] (ruled 1638–1659), who expanded the frontiers of the Mysore kingdom to Trichy in Tamil Nadu. The dynasty reached its peak under [[Chikka Devaraja]] (ruled 1673–1704), who reformed the administration of the empire by dividing it into 18 departments (called Chavadis) and he also introduced a coherent system of taxation.

From 1760 to 1799, the rule of the dynasty was essentially nominal, with real power in the hands of the ''dalwai'', or commanders-in-chief, [[Hyder Ali]] and his son [[Tipu Sultan]], who expanded the kingdom aggressively, but clashed with the [[British East India Company]]. After Tipu Sultan was killed by the British in the [[Battle of Srirangapatna]] in 1799, the Wadiyars were restored to a reduced kingdom.

==British Rule==

After restoring the Wadiyars to the throne of Mysore, the British shifted the capital back to the city of Mysore from [[Srirangapatna]]. The four-year-old boy (Mummudi) Krishna Raja Wadiyar III, son of the last Wadiyar king, Khasa Chamaraja Wadiyar VIII, was anointed as the King of Mysore. Wadiyars were now subsidiaries of the British Raj and had to pay an annual subsidy to the British. However the British took over the administration of the kingdom on a specious plea of non-payment of the subsidy by Mummudi Krishna Raja Wadiyar in 1831, and British-appointed commissioners were then in charge of the kingdom.

British commissioners administered Mysore from 1831–1881. [[Mark Cubbon]] (1834–1861) and [[L. B. Bowring]] (1861–1870) are among the well-known commissioners of the period.

In 1868, the British Parliament heeded the king's plea and decided to restore the kingdom to his adopted son Chamaraja Wadiyar IX. In 1881, the transfer of power back to the Wadiyars heralded an important phase in the making of modern Mysore. For the first time in India, democratic experiments were introduced by the establishment of a representative assembly. The next king, Nalvadi Krishna Raja Wadiyar, earned great fame as a saintly King-Rajarishi, and his kingdom was hailed as Ramarajya by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] as an ideal kingdom comparable to the one ruled by the historical hero [[Lord Rama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Under British hegemony, the Wadiyars, freed from security concerns, shifted their attention to the patronage of the fine arts. They made Mysore a cultural center of Karnataka, fostering a number of famous musicians, writers and painters.

The last king of the Wadiyar dynasty was [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]], who ruled from 1940 until Indian independence from British rule. In the year 1947, after India attained independence, he ceded his kingdom to the Dominion of India, but continued as the Maharajah until India became a Republic in 1950. He became the Raja Pramukh—a constitutional position—as the head of Mysore State in the Republic of India from 1950–1956. After the reorganization of the Indian states on a linguistic basis, he was appointed Governor of the integrated Mysore State (present Karnataka State) in 1956 and held the post until 1964.

Then he was Governor of Madras state (now [[Tamil Nadu]]) for two years. The Indian Constitution continued to recognize him as the Maharajah of Mysore, until 1971, when [[Indira Gandhi|Mrs. Indira Gandhi]], then Prime Minister of India, abolished the titles and Privy Purse of over 560 Maharajahs. The Maharajah died in 1974. His only son, Srikantadatta Narasimha Raja Wadiyar (1953–2013), was a member of the Indian Parliament for many years.

== Curse on Wadiyars ==

A curse was believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death — \"Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali\" (May [[Talakadu]] become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children). 400 years since, the Wadiyar dynasty never had any children for alternate generations. Hence the adopted child becomes the king. Even till date, most parts of Talakadu (Talakad) lie under sand, and Malangi village in present Mysore district is slowly eroding due to whirlpools.<ref>{{cite web | title = Does Alamelamma's curse continue to haunt Wadiyars? | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/373910/does-alamelamma039s-curse-continue-haunt.html |work=Deccan Herald|date=10 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 400-year-old curse haunts Wodeyar royals of erstwhile princely state of Mysore|work=India Today | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/wadiyar-royals-mysore-vijayanagara-empire-tirumalaraja-alamelamma-talakadu/1/330702.html |date=12 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref>{{cleanup section|reason=Needs to be rewritten|date=July 2013}}

The Mysore kingdom, founded by Yaduraya in the year 1399, consisted of only the areas surrounding the present Mysore City. The original fort was supposed to have been at a place known as haDadana — now a small village on the southern side of [[Chamundi Hill]]. The Wadiyars, like others at that time, were under the [[suzerainty]] of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Viceroy of the Vijayanagar kingdom was headquartered at [[Srirangapatna]]. Under Yaduraya, the Wadiyars increased their influence and territory over the next 200 years. Raja Wadiyar, the ninth ruler of the dynasty, was known for his valour and patronage of art and culture. He ruled from 1578 to 1617. In 1610, he conquered the fort of Srirangapatna from Tirumala, then Viceroy of Vijayanagar. Tirumala is said to have retired to Talakad with his two wives. One of them, Alamelamma, was a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki, the consort of Sri Ranganatha, the presiding deity of the famous Adi-Ranga temple in the island fortress of [[Srirangapatna]].

Tirumala suffered from a terminal disease on his back known as the \"disease of the kings\". The condition of Tirumala deteriorated and he died. Alamelamma had a large amount of precious jewellery, including a fine nose ring studded with a large pearl. As a widow she was no longer permitted jewellery. She donated the jewels to the temple of Sri Ranganayaki. Every Friday and Tuesday Sri Ranaganayaki was decorated with a large pearl-studded nose ring and other precious jewellery, which was put into the safe custody of Alamelamma the rest of the week, since she was known to be a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki.

The temple authorities requested Raja Wadiyar to give them the custody of the jewels, as was the normal practice. The treasury officials informed the king of this fact. Raja Wadiyar thought these jewels were of no value to Alamelamma, as she was now a widow and didn't have children, she would no longer need them. Raja Wadiyar sent emissaries to Malangi, where Alamelamma was staying, with a request to return the jewels. Only the pearl-studded nose ring was returned by Alamelamma. Raja Wadiyar then sent his army to Talakad to ask her once again and, if she refused, to seize them by force. To escape the wrath of the Mysore army, Alamelamma uttered the legendary curse on Raja Wadiyar and jumped into a whirlpool in the river Kaveri at Talakadu with the rest of the jewels and escaped unscathed. The curse, as passed down in folklore over the last 400 years, is:

{{cquote|ತಲಕಾಡು ಮರಳಾಗಲಿ, ಮಾಲಂಗಿ ಮಡುವಾಗಲಿ, ಮೈಸೂರು ದೊರೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಹೋಗಲಿ}}
{{cquote|Talakadu maraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysuru Doregalige Makkallilade Hogali}}
{{cquote|May Talakad turn into (a barren expanse of) sand, may Malangi turn into a whirlpool, may the Rajas of Mysore not have children (for all time to come).}}

Hearing of this extreme step taken by Alamelamma, Raja Wadiyar was truly repentant. He wanted to return the jewellery to the temple and not confiscate it for his own use. In his grief he had an idol of Alamelamma made in gold, installed it in the palace, and worshiped it as a deity. A remnant of her hair was preserved in a box. To this day, Alamelamma’s idol can be found inside the Mysore Palace and is worshiped by the royal family. One can see the same huge pearl nose-stud adorning the Goddess Ranganayaki and Alamelamma today.

The Dasara festivities inside the palace end on the evening of Navarathri with a formal pooja to Alamelamma, and the kankana worn by the royal couple is removed thereafter paving the way for the Vijaya Dashami – Sami pooja the next day. For these nine days the royal couple are required to stay inside the precincts of the palace. Another interesting part of the story is that this Alamelamma temple is under the care of the legal heirs of Alamelamma: They live inside the Mysore Palace fort. Strangely, these priests/caretakers appear to be cursed, and they do not beget children and follow the same pattern afflicting the Wodeyars.

==The Curse from the Time of Raja Wadiyar==

After shifting to Srirangapatna, Raja Wadiyar is credited with holding the famous Dasara festivities for the first time in 1610. His only surviving son, Narasaraja Wadiyar, died (believed to be an effect of the curse in folklore) just a day before the commencement of Navaratri, but the king after consulting experts laid down the rule that the celebration of the ceremonies was not to be interrupted even by the death of members of the royal family. Raja Wadiyar was a devoted Vaishnavaite, and he donated the famous bejewelled crown to Lord Cheluvarayaswami of Melukote that is a feature of the Raja Mudi car festival even today. This is contrary to his own lineage as the Wadiyars regarded the temple of Karigiri Lakshmi Narasimha (Devarayana Durga, Tumkur) as their household deity. The mere fact that all the Wadiyars end their names by -\"Narasimharaja Wadiyar\" stands testimony to what was previously stated. This crown was confiscated from the royal Family by the Karnataka Government during an emergency. Legend has it that Raja Wadiyar, having entered the garbha–gruha (sanctum sanctorum) of Cheluvarayaswami Temple on 20 June 1617, became one with the deity (aikya). Even today one can find a Bhakthi Vigraha of the King inside the Temple. Another Bhakthi Vigraha of the King can be found inside the Lakshmi-Narayanaswami Temple inside the Mysore Palace Fort. Malangi and Talakad are two small towns near [[Tirumakudalu Narasipura]] on the banks of the Kaveri where the river takes a bend. Talakad's temples lie buried in a vast expanse of sand and are dug up and exposed every 12 years. At Malangi, on the other hand, the river is at its deepest. Whether these phenomena appeared only after Alamelamma's curse in 1610 is a matter of conjecture. What can be stated with certainty is that the curse on the royal family seems to have come true. Their chief courtier Ram Nath Molahalli was the army head.

From Raja Wadiyar’s death in 1617 to that of [[Chikka Devaraja|Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar]] in 1704 (there were four rulers in between) the kingdom was ruled by the surviving descendants of Yaduraya, but none could beget legal heirs. Incidentally, Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar is credited with the composition of Gita Gopala – an opera in Kannada. The sole exception to the curse was Chikka Devaraja's deaf and mute son Kantheerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II, also known as Mookarasu. He was succeeded by his son Dodda Krushna Raja Wodeyar, who ruled from 1714 to 1732. With him Yaduraya’s direct lineage came to an end. What followed was a succession of nominal rulers adopted by the surviving queens to continue the tradition. Traditional army commanders known as Dalvoys virtually ruled the kingdom and paved the way for the ascendancy of a foot soldier like Hyder Ali by 1762. There were five rulers from 1732 to 1796. In this period a definite pattern emerged under which no natural heir to the throne born to a king (adopted or otherwise) could beget children, whereas one who became king by virtue of adoption or other indirect inheritance was blessed with a legal heir. Hyder and Tipu continued the tradition of having a nominal Wodeyar King on the throne, and even the Dasara Celebrations continued as usual. After the famous [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the death of Tipu Sultan, a British army, in which the legendary [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (later Duke of Wellington, also known as the Iron Duke) was serving, conquered Srirangapatna in 1799.

In the run up to the [[next United Kingdom general election]], various organisations are expected to carry out [[opinion polling]] to gauge voting intention. Results of such polls are displayed in this article. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the [[British Polling Council]] (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules.

The date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|previous general election]], held on 12 December 2019, to the present day. Under current [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|fixed-term legislation]], the next general election is scheduled to be held in May 2024,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tufft|first1=Ben|title=When will the next UK General Election be held?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/when-will-the-next-uk-general-election-be-held-10236102.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=29 December 2019|quote=The act specifies that future elections will be held on the first Thursday of May, every five years.|date=8 May 2015}}</ref> though the government has pledged to repeal this law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/12/full-transcript-the-queens-speech/|title=Full transcript: The Queen’s Speech|date=19 December 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|work=The Spectator}}</ref>

Most opinion polls do not cover [[Northern Ireland]], since its major political parties are different to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.

In the run up to the [[next United Kingdom general election]], various organisations are expected to carry out [[opinion polling]] to gauge voting intention. Results of such polls are displayed in this article. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the [[British Polling Council]] (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules.

The date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|previous general election]], held on 12 December 2019, to the present day. Under current [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|fixed-term legislation]], the next general election is scheduled to be held in May 2024,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tufft|first1=Ben|title=When will the next UK General Election be held?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/when-will-the-next-uk-general-election-be-held-10236102.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=29 December 2019|quote=The act specifies that future elections will be held on the first Thursday of May, every five years.|date=8 May 2015}}</ref> though the government has pledged to repeal this law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/12/full-transcript-the-queens-speech/|title=Full transcript: The Queen’s Speech|date=19 December 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|work=The Spectator}}</ref>

Most opinion polls do not cover [[Northern Ireland]], since its major political parties are different to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.

== Graphical summary ==
{{Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election}}

== National poll results==
Poll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party's colour. The 'party lead' column shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. In the instance of a tie, no figure is shaded but both are displayed in bold.

The parties with the largest numbers of votes in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] are listed here. Other parties are listed in the \"Other\" column.

The '''Campanhã Railway Station''' ({{lang-pt|Estação Ferroviária de Campanhã}}) is a 19th-century railway station in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Campanhã]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Porto]], district of [[Porto (district)|Porto]]. Opened in 1877,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cp.pt/cp/detailCulture.do?itemId=396461&lang=en |title=In and around the station: Estação de Campanhã |publisher=CP |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref> it is connected to the [[Porto Metro]], with local intercity and commuter service (operated by [[Comboios de Portugal]], the Portuguese national railway operator). The railway station provides Lisbon to north access, a through-station, and not a terminus station, serving the Lisbon-to-north allowing through running of trains from Lisbon to the north of Portugal.

==History==
[[File:Aviso CFMD Campanha - Diario Illustrado 1696 1877.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The tender notice issued in 1877 for the exploration of the rail service concession at the ''Railway Station of Pinehro'']]

[[File:Campanha comboio porto medina.jpg|thumb|235px|left|A view of the platform and passengers waiting at the updated Campanhã station (1899)]]
The first plan for a station was presented in 1860, to be built in Esteiro de Campanhã and that connected the Douro line to Minho, through an extension that follows the Campanhã valley to the branches along the Rio Tinto.<ref name=\"SIPA\">{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=23030 |title=Estação Ferroviária de Campanhã (IPA.00023030/PT011312030368) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Ana |last=Filipe |year=2009 |accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref>  Initially designated, the ''Estação de caminho de ferro do Pinheiro'' (''Pinheiro Railway Station''), the station at Campanhã was designated for lands occupied by the estates of ''Quinta do Pinheiro'' and ''Quintas do Valado''.<ref name=SIPA/>

In 1872, the current layout was definitively set by Manuel Afonso Espregueira, Pedro Inácio Lopes and Alexandre Eiffel.<ref name=SIPA/> Manuel Afonso de Espregueira, from Viana do Castelo, had a licentiate degree in mathematics from the University of Coimbra, and completed courses in infantry and general staff at the ''Escola do Exército'' (''Military School'').<ref name=SIPA/> Later he attended the [[École des ponts ParisTech|École Imperiale des Ponts et Chaussées]], in Paris, where he was one of the better students and colleague of other important people, such as [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (later President of the French Republic.<ref name=SIPA/> In 1880, he abandoned the army and entered the public service (specifically the Ministry of Public Works) where he held various positions and was part of several projects (such as artificial port of Leixões, improvements to the Barra do Porto and Figueira da Foz, among others). He was a director of the first ''Divisão Hidráulica do Reino'' (''Hydraulic Division of the Kingdom'') that was responsible for ports and inlets along the area north of the [[Mondego River|Mondego]], except Aveiro.<ref name=SIPA/>

Between 1872 and 1885, Manuel Afonso de Espregueira, was director general for the ''Companhia Real dos Caminhos-de-ferro'' (''Royal Railway Company''), but in 1874, he was responsible for the elaboration of the general plan, that included all the lines that crossed the Douro and [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte region]].<ref name=SIPA/>

By 1875, the first trains began to run along the northern Douro, between Pinheiro-Campanhã and Braga. On 28 April, they began work on the [[Maria Pia Bridge|\"Eiffel Bridge\"]], projected by Seyrig from the Eiffel School of Paris.<ref name=SIPA/>

An accord was established between the government and the Royal on 15 September 1875, to begin the construction of the railway station.<ref name=SIPA/> On 4 November 1877, following diverse vicissitudes during the construction, the inauguration, along with that of the Bridge D. Maria Pia was celebrated, with the presence of King D. [[Louis of Portugal|Luís]] and Queen D. [[Maria Pia of Savoy|Maria Pia]].<ref name=SIPA/> The first train arrived the railway station from São Bento in 1896.<ref name=SIPA/>

In 1923, Cottinelli Telmo in partnership with Luís da Cunha, authored the first project plan to construct a dormitory for railway personnel, but was never executed.<ref name=SIPA/> A second version, which was submitted in 1925, was approved. Between 1943 and 1945, Cottinelli Telmo expanded the construction by building a warehouse for foodstuffs.<ref name=SIPA/>

By decree 104/97, the management of the railways was entrusted to a new company, the ''Rede Ferroviária Nacional'' (''National Railway'') in 1997.<ref name=SIPA/>

Commemorations celebrating the Portuguese railway system's 150 years were celebrated at Campanhã in 2006.<ref name=SIPA/>

[[File:Campanhã-Estação Ferroviária de Campanhã (2).jpg|thumb|235px|A view of the rail platform and rear facade]]
The station is situated in an isolated space, implanted on level terrain, on the western end of the city of Porto, along the right margin of the Douro River.<ref name=SIPA/> The principal facade is exposed to the ''Largo da Estação'' towards the urban centre of Campanhã, and its rear towards the railway lines and departure platforms. In actuality it is a central station to the city.<ref name=SIPA/>

The station includes, not only the passenger terminal, but also some support buildings, with sanitary installations, covered wharfs and carriage house. The main building has a rectangular plan, that comprises five bodies, that occupy a linear tract.<ref name=SIPA/> The rectangular, two-story, central corp is slightly extended from the main body, and flanked by the lateral, single-story wings, that extend to another two lateral sections.<ref name=SIPA/> The facades are plastered and painted in white, along with the frames and bunting, while the pilasters, decorative friezes and cornices are in granite.<ref name=SIPA/>

All first-story facades are broken by rounded windows or doorways, interspersed by pilasters and ionic capitals, while similar motifs are included in the upper floor of the central block.<ref name=SIPA/> This facade (oriented to the west) is divided into five sections, with the central partially section decorated in granite, with split silhouettes, while the floors are separated by friezes and cornices, this topped by elaborate friezes along the second floor, punctuated by three central inscriptions PORTO - CAMPANHÃ - PORTO and a minor inscription under the cornice: REFER.<ref name=SIPA/> The frontispiece integrates a circular clock, flanked by fins, and finished in semicircular pediment with wide phytomorphic key.<ref name=SIPA/> On the ground floor there are three perfect, molded back porticos, with flagstone integrated with two windows on each side.<ref name=SIPA/> On the upper floors there are six balcony windows, surrounded by rectangular frame and topped by cornice, protected by stone balusters (on the central section) and iron railings on the sides.<ref name=SIPA/> The intermediate sections are torn by six spans identical to those on the ground floor of the central facade.<ref name=SIPA/>

The facades of the lateral bodies, are broken by two windows and central door (at ground floor) and three balcony windows (on the upper floor). The lateral facades with identical layout, has a visible mezzanine between the two floors, while underneath the frieze is a blue-and-white azulejo panel, with the inscription ''PORTO CAMPANHÃ''.<ref name=SIPA/>

The rear facade is symmetrically-broken by numerous spans of identical composition, with a full-length porch, resting on the cornice and iron pillars resting on granite plinths, supported by the boarding platform.<ref name=SIPA/>

{{main|Porto Metro|Douro railway line}}
Campanhã station is one of two railway stations in Porto, with the other being the [[São Bento railway station|São Bento]] (the city centre terminus station for local trains and passenger service to the north, including the [[Douro railway line|Douro line]]). All ''Comboios de Portugal'' (CP) services operate through Campanhã, including other services such as the [[Alfa Pendular]] high speed trains and [[InterCity|Inter Cidades]] (''inter-city'') suburban trains, which continue on to São Bento. Suburban trains coming from General Torres reverse here and continue to São Bento.

The '''Campanhã Railway Station''' ({{lang-pt|Estação Ferroviária de Campanhã}}) is a 19th-century railway station in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Campanhã]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Porto]], district of [[Porto (district)|Porto]]. Opened in 1877,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cp.pt/cp/detailCulture.do?itemId=396461&lang=en |title=In and around the station: Estação de Campanhã |publisher=CP |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref> it is connected to the [[Porto Metro]], with local intercity and commuter service (operated by [[Comboios de Portugal]], the Portuguese national railway operator). The railway station provides Lisbon to north access, a through-station, and not a terminus station, serving the Lisbon-to-north allowing through running of trains from Lisbon to the north of Portugal.

==History==
[[File:Aviso CFMD Campanha - Diario Illustrado 1696 1877.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The tender notice issued in 1877 for the exploration of the rail service concession at the ''Railway Station of Pinehro'']]

[[File:Campanha comboio porto medina.jpg|thumb|235px|left|A view of the platform and passengers waiting at the updated Campanhã station (1899)]]
The first plan for a station was presented in 1860, to be built in Esteiro de Campanhã and that connected the Douro line to Minho, through an extension that follows the Campanhã valley to the branches along the Rio Tinto.<ref name=\"SIPA\">{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=23030 |title=Estação Ferroviária de Campanhã (IPA.00023030/PT011312030368) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Ana |last=Filipe |year=2009 |accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref>  Initially designated, the ''Estação de caminho de ferro do Pinheiro'' (''Pinheiro Railway Station''), the station at Campanhã was designated for lands occupied by the estates of ''Quinta do Pinheiro'' and ''Quintas do Valado''.<ref name=SIPA/>

In 1872, the current layout was definitively set by Manuel Afonso Espregueira, Pedro Inácio Lopes and Alexandre Eiffel.<ref name=SIPA/> Manuel Afonso de Espregueira, from Viana do Castelo, had a licentiate degree in mathematics from the University of Coimbra, and completed courses in infantry and general staff at the ''Escola do Exército'' (''Military School'').<ref name=SIPA/> Later he attended the [[École des ponts ParisTech|École Imperiale des Ponts et Chaussées]], in Paris, where he was one of the better students and colleague of other important people, such as [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (later President of the French Republic.<ref name=SIPA/> In 1880, he abandoned the army and entered the public service (specifically the Ministry of Public Works) where he held various positions and was part of several projects (such as artificial port of Leixões, improvements to the Barra do Porto and Figueira da Foz, among others). He was a director of the first ''Divisão Hidráulica do Reino'' (''Hydraulic Division of the Kingdom'') that was responsible for ports and inlets along the area north of the [[Mondego River|Mondego]], except Aveiro.<ref name=SIPA/>

Between 1872 and 1885, Manuel Afonso de Espregueira, was director general for the ''Companhia Real dos Caminhos-de-ferro'' (''Royal Railway Company''), but in 1874, he was responsible for the elaboration of the general plan, that included all the lines that crossed the Douro and [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte region]].<ref name=SIPA/>

By 1875, the first trains began to run along the northern Douro, between Pinheiro-Campanhã and Braga. On 28 April, they began work on the [[Maria Pia Bridge|\"Eiffel Bridge\"]], projected by Seyrig from the Eiffel School of Paris.<ref name=SIPA/>

An accord was established between the government and the Royal on 15 September 1875, to begin the construction of the railway station.<ref name=SIPA/> On 4 November 1877, following diverse vicissitudes during the construction, the inauguration, along with that of the Bridge D. Maria Pia was celebrated, with the presence of King D. [[Louis of Portugal|Luís]] and Queen D. [[Maria Pia of Savoy|Maria Pia]].<ref name=SIPA/> The first train arrived the railway station from São Bento in 1896.<ref name=SIPA/>

In 1923, Cottinelli Telmo in partnership with Luís da Cunha, authored the first project plan to construct a dormitory for railway personnel, but was never executed.<ref name=SIPA/> A second version, which was submitted in 1925, was approved. Between 1943 and 1945, Cottinelli Telmo expanded the construction by building a warehouse for foodstuffs.<ref name=SIPA/>

By decree 104/97, the management of the railways was entrusted to a new company, the ''Rede Ferroviária Nacional'' (''National Railway'') in 1997.<ref name=SIPA/>

Commemorations celebrating the Portuguese railway system's 150 years were celebrated at Campanhã in 2006.<ref name=SIPA/>

[[File:Campanhã-Estação Ferroviária de Campanhã (2).jpg|thumb|235px|A view of the rail platform and rear facade]]
The station is situated in an isolated space, implanted on level terrain, on the western end of the city of Porto, along the right margin of the Douro River.<ref name=SIPA/> The principal facade is exposed to the ''Largo da Estação'' towards the urban centre of Campanhã, and its rear towards the railway lines and departure platforms. In actuality it is a central station to the city.<ref name=SIPA/>

The station includes, not only the passenger terminal, but also some support buildings, with sanitary installations, covered wharfs and carriage house. The main building has a rectangular plan, that comprises five bodies, that occupy a linear tract.<ref name=SIPA/> The rectangular, two-story, central corp is slightly extended from the main body, and flanked by the lateral, single-story wings, that extend to another two lateral sections.<ref name=SIPA/> The facades are plastered and painted in white, along with the frames and bunting, while the pilasters, decorative friezes and cornices are in granite.<ref name=SIPA/>

All first-story facades are broken by rounded windows or doorways, interspersed by pilasters and ionic capitals, while similar motifs are included in the upper floor of the central block.<ref name=SIPA/> This facade (oriented to the west) is divided into five sections, with the central partially section decorated in granite, with split silhouettes, while the floors are separated by friezes and cornices, this topped by elaborate friezes along the second floor, punctuated by three central inscriptions PORTO - CAMPANHÃ - PORTO and a minor inscription under the cornice: REFER.<ref name=SIPA/> The frontispiece integrates a circular clock, flanked by fins, and finished in semicircular pediment with wide phytomorphic key.<ref name=SIPA/> On the ground floor there are three perfect, molded back porticos, with flagstone integrated with two windows on each side.<ref name=SIPA/> On the upper floors there are six balcony windows, surrounded by rectangular frame and topped by cornice, protected by stone balusters (on the central section) and iron railings on the sides.<ref name=SIPA/> The intermediate sections are torn by six spans identical to those on the ground floor of the central facade.<ref name=SIPA/>

The facades of the lateral bodies, are broken by two windows and central door (at ground floor) and three balcony windows (on the upper floor). The lateral facades with identical layout, has a visible mezzanine between the two floors, while underneath the frieze is a blue-and-white azulejo panel, with the inscription ''PORTO CAMPANHÃ''.<ref name=SIPA/>

The rear facade is symmetrically-broken by numerous spans of identical composition, with a full-length porch, resting on the cornice and iron pillars resting on granite plinths, supported by the boarding platform.<ref name=SIPA/>

==Service==
{{main|Porto Metro|Douro railway line}}
Campanhã station is one of two railway stations in Porto, with the other being the [[São Bento railway station|São Bento]] (the city centre terminus station for local trains and passenger service to the north, including the [[Douro railway line|Douro line]]). All ''Comboios de Portugal'' (CP) services operate through Campanhã, including other services such as the [[Alfa Pendular]] high speed trains and [[InterCity|Inter Cidades]] (''inter-city'') suburban trains, which continue on to São Bento. Suburban trains coming from General Torres reverse here and continue to São Bento.

{{nihongo|'''''Mr. Osomatsu'''''|おそ松さん|Osomatsu-san|lead=yes}} is a 2015 comedy [[anime]] television series by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]], based on [[Fujio Akatsuka]]'s 1962 [[manga]] series, ''[[Osomatsu-kun]]''. Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. The brothers are completely H O M O S E X U A L. If the show was made by a more brave company they would probably be openly H O M O.

==Premise==
The original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.

{{nihongo|'''''Mr. Osomatsu'''''|おそ松さん|Osomatsu-san|lead=yes}} is a 2015 comedy [[anime]] television series by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]], based on [[Fujio Akatsuka]]'s 1962 [[manga]] series, ''[[Osomatsu-kun]]''. Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. 

==Premise==
The original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.

An '''island''' or '''isle''' is any piece of [[continent|sub-continental]] land that is surrounded by [[water]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Webster's Dictionary-Island|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009102847/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|archivedate=October 9, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Very small islands such as emergent land features on [[atoll]]s can be called [[islet]]s, [[skerry|skerries]], [[cay]]s or keys. An [[river island|island in a river]] or a [[lake island]] may be called an [[ait|eyot or ait]], and a small island off the coast may be called a [[holm (island)|holm]]. Sedimentary islands in the [[Ganges delta]] are called [[List of islands of Bangladesh|chars]]. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands, such as the [[Philippines]], is referred to as an [[archipelago]].

An island may be described as such, despite the presence of an artificial land bridge; examples are [[Singapore]] and its [[Johor–Singapore Causeway|causeway]], and the various [[Netherlands|Dutch]] delta islands, such as [[IJsselmonde (island)|IJsselmonde]]. Some places may even retain \"island\" in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill, such as [[Coney Island]] and [[Coronado, California|Coronado Island]], though these are, strictly speaking, [[tied island]]s. Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the [[mainland]] by a man-made canal, for example the [[Peloponnese]] by the [[Corinth Canal]], more or less the entirety of [[Fennoscandia]] by the [[White Sea Canal]], or [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] in northern [[Manhattan]] during the time between the building of the [[United States Ship Canal]] and the filling-in of the [[Harlem River]] which surrounded the area, it is generally not considered an island.

There are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic. There are also [[artificial island]]s, which are man-made.

==Etymology==
The word ''island'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''iland'', from [[Old English]] ''igland'' (from ''ig'' or ''ieg'', similarly meaning 'island' when used independently, and [[-land]] carrying its contemporary meaning; cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''eiland'' (\"island\"), [[German language|German]] ''Eiland'' (\"small island\")). However, the spelling of the word was modified in the 15th century because of a [[false etymology]] caused by an incorrect association with the [[Etymology|etymologically]] unrelated Old French loanword ''isle'', which itself comes from the Latin word ''insula''.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Island |title=Island |accessdate=March 5, 2007 |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307143713/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/island |archivedate=March 7, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=76|year=1855|issue=6|pages=66}}</ref> Old English ''ieg'' is actually a [[cognate]] of Swedish ''ö'' and German ''Aue'', and related to Latin ''aqua'' (water).<ref>{{cite book

There is a difference between islands and [[continent]]s in terms of [[geology]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/story/is-australia-an-island Britannica: Is Austrailia an Island?]</ref>
Continents are the largest [[landmass]] of a particular [[continental plate]]; this holds true for [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], which sits on its own continental lithosphere and tectonic plate (the [[Australian plate]]).
By contrast, islands are either extensions of the [[oceanic crust]] (e.g. volcanic islands), or belong to a continental plate containing a larger landmass; the latter is the case of [[Greenland]], which sits on the [[North American plate]].

Continental islands are bodies of land that lie on the [[continental shelf]] of a [[continent]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Island (geography)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295958/island#ref234009|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008102906/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295958/island#ref234009|archivedate=October 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Examples are [[Borneo]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Sakhalin]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Hainan]] off [[Asia]]; [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Kangaroo Island]] off [[Australia]]; [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], and [[Sicily]] off [[Europe]]; [[Greenland]], [[Newfoundland]], [[Long Island]], and [[Sable Island]] off [[North America]]; and [[Barbados]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[Trinidad]] off [[South America]].

A special type of continental island is the microcontinental island, which is created when a continent is [[rift|rifted]]. Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].

Another subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:

* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves
* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.

[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.

===Oceanic islands===
{{Main article|High island}}

Oceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.) (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oceanic%20island&f=false ''Foundations of Biogeography: Classic Papers with Commentaries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233729/https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |date=April 18, 2016 }}. University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.

One type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].

Another type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.

A third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.

An [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

==Artificial islands==
{{Main article|Artificial island}}

Almost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions. However, artificial (man-made) islands also exist, such as the island in [[Osaka Bay]] off the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Honshu]], on which [[Kansai International Airport]] is located. Artificial islands can be built using natural materials (e.g., earth, rock, or sand) or artificial ones (e.g., [[concrete]] slabs or recycled [[waste]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|title=Building Artificial Islands That Rise With the Sea|access-date=2016-06-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152821/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amti.csis.org/what-makes-an-island-land-reclamation-and-the-south-china-sea-arbitration/|title=What Makes an Island?

Artificial islands are sometimes built on pre-existing \"low-tide elevation,\" a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded by and above water at low [[tide]] but submerged at high tide.  Legally these are not islands and have no territorial sea of their own.<ref>{{cite book|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 13|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm|accessdate=25 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902091223/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm|archivedate=September 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

An '''island''' or '''isle''' is any piece of [[continent|sub-continental]] land that is surrounded by [[water]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Webster's Dictionary-Island|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009102847/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island|archivedate=October 9, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Very small islands such as emergent land features on [[atoll]]s can be called [[islet]]s, [[skerry|skerries]], [[cay]]s or keys. An [[river island|island in a river]] or a [[lake island]] may be called an [[ait|eyot or ait]], and a small island off the coast may be called a [[holm (island)|holm]]. Sedimentary islands in the [[Ganges delta]] are called [[List of islands of Bangladesh|chars]]. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands, such as the [[Philippines]], is referred to as an [[archipelago]].

An island may be described as such, despite the presence of an artificial land bridge; examples are [[Singapore]] and its [[Johor–Singapore Causeway|causeway]], and the various [[Netherlands|Dutch]] delta islands, such as [[IJsselmonde (island)|IJsselmonde]]. Some places may even retain \"island\" in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill, such as [[Coney Island]] and [[Coronado, California|Coronado Island]], though these are, strictly speaking, [[tied island]]s. Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the [[mainland]] by a man-made canal, for example the [[Peloponnese]] by the [[Corinth Canal]], more or less the entirety of [[Fennoscandia]] by the [[White Sea Canal]], or [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] in northern [[Manhattan]] during the time between the building of the [[United States Ship Canal]] and the filling-in of the [[Harlem River]] which surrounded the area, it is generally not considered an island.

There are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic. There are also [[artificial island]]s, which are man-made.

==Etymology==
The word ''island'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''iland'', from [[Old English]] ''igland'' (from ''ig'' or ''ieg'', similarly meaning 'island' when used independently, and [[-land]] carrying its contemporary meaning; cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''eiland'' (\"island\"), [[German language|German]] ''Eiland'' (\"small island\")). However, the spelling of the word was modified in the 15th century because of a [[false etymology]] caused by an incorrect association with the [[Etymology|etymologically]] unrelated Old French loanword ''isle'', which itself comes from the Latin word ''insula''.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Island |title=Island |accessdate=March 5, 2007 |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307143713/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/island |archivedate=March 7, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=76|year=1855|issue=6|pages=66}}</ref> Old English ''ieg'' is actually a [[cognate]] of Swedish ''ö'' and German ''Aue'', and related to Latin ''aqua'' (water).<ref>{{cite book

There is a difference between islands and [[continent]]s in terms of [[geology]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/story/is-australia-an-island Britannica: Is Austrailia an Island?]</ref>
Continents are the largest [[landmass]] of a particular [[continental plate]]; this holds true for [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], which sits on its own continental lithosphere and tectonic plate (the [[Australian plate]]).
By contrast, islands are either extensions of the [[oceanic crust]] (e.g. volcanic islands), or belong to a continental plate containing a larger landmass; the latter is the case of [[Greenland]], which sits on the [[North American plate]].

{{nihongo|'''''Mr. Osomatsu'''''|おそ松さん|Osomatsu-san|lead=yes}} is a 2015 comedy [[anime]] television series by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]], based on [[Fujio Akatsuka]]'s 1962 [[manga]] series, ''[[Osomatsu-kun]]''. Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. 

==Premise==
The original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.

{{nihongo|'''''Mr. Osomatsu'''''|おそ松さん|Osomatsu-san|lead=yes}} is a 2015 comedy [[anime]] television series by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]], based on [[Fujio Akatsuka]]'s 1962 [[manga]] series, ''[[Osomatsu-kun]]''. Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. 

==Premise==
The original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.

{{nihongo|'''''Mr. Osomatsu'''''|おそ松さん|Osomatsu-san|lead=yes}} is a 2015 comedy [[anime]] television series by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]], based on [[Fujio Akatsuka]]'s 1962 [[manga]] series, ''[[Osomatsu-kun]]''. Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. Both seasons have been licensed in [[Americas]] by [[Viz Media]]. A [[manga]] adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[You (manga magazine)|You]]'' magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. 

==Premise==
The original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.

{{nihongo|Osomatsu Matsuno|松野 おそ松|Matsuno Osomatsu}} is the eldest of the sextuplets and self-proclaimed leader of the group. An avid gambler, he spends his time playing [[pachinko]] and betting on horses. He often dresses in red.

====Karamatsu Matsuno====
{{animevoices|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]]<ref name=\"cast\" />|[[Ray Chase (voice actor)|Ray Chase]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}

{{nihongo|Karamatsu Matsuno|松野 カラ松|Matsuno Karamatsu}} is the second born of the sextuplets. Believes himself to be cooler and more popular than he really is and calls his fan girls \"Karamatsu Girls.\" He occasionally adds English words into his sentences. His distinguishing feature is his thick eyebrows and he often dresses in blue, though he occasionally sports a leather jacket and sunglasses.

====Choromatsu Matsuno====
{{animevoices|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]]<ref name=\"cast\" />|[[Chris Niosi]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}

{{nihongo|Choromatsu Matsuno|松野 チョロ松|Matsuno Choromatsu}} is the third born and most responsible of the sextuplets. Often acts as [[straight man]] to his siblings. His distinguishing features are his angular mouth, smaller pupils, and his lack of a cowlick. He often dresses in green.

====Ichimatsu Matsuno====
{{animevoices|[[Jun Fukuyama]]<ref name=\"cast\" />|[[Kyle McCarley]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}

{{nihongo|Ichimatsu Matsuno|松野 一松|Matsuno Ichimatsu}} is the fourth born of the sextuplets and the sharp-tongued loner of the group. His distinguishing features are his tired eyes, scruffy hair, hunched back, and he often dresses in purple.

====Jyushimatsu Matsuno====
{{animevoices|[[Daisuke Ono]]<ref name=\"cast\" />|[[Michael Sinterniklaas]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}

{{nihongo|Jyushimatsu Matsuno|松野 十四松|Matsuno Jūshimatsu}} is the fifth born of the sextuplets. He is very energetic but also quite the airhead, often having no reaction to the wild goings-on. He has a wide open mouth, and a single cowlick compared to the other siblings' two. He often dresses in yellow. And the showrunners need to bring homura back.

====Todomatsu Matsuno====
{{animevoices|[[Miyu Irino]]<ref name=\"cast\" />|[[Max Mittelman]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}

{{nihongo|Todomatsu Matsuno|松野 トド松|Matsuno Todomatsu}} is the most outgoing of the sextuplets. Often uses his cuteness as a brother to manipulate others. He has a smaller mouth, and bigger pupils. He often dresses in pink.

The original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.

'''Samaria''' ({{lang-he-n|שומרון}}, ''Shomron''; {{lang-grc|Σαμάρεια}}, ''Samareia''; {{lang-ar|السامرة}}, ''as-Samira'') was an ancient city in the [[Land of Israel]]. It was the capital of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. The ruins of the city are located in the [[Samaria]] mountains of the [[West Bank]], almost 10 km to the northwest of [[Nablus]].

==History==
Israelite Shomron (lit. \"watch-tower\"; also written \"Shomeron\") was located in the heart of the mountains of [[Samaria]], a few miles northwest of [[Shechem]]. The ruins of the Israelite town, as well the ruins of towns built at this same location later in history, are all adjacent or within the modern [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]]. 
 
The \"hill of Shomron\" is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. According to biblical tradition, [[Omri]], the king of the northern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] (reigned c. 870s BC), purchased this hill from [[Shemer (biblical figure)|Shemer]] its owner for two [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of \"Shomron\", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:24|KJV}}). As such it possessed many advantages. Omri resided here during the last six years of his reign.<!--these paragraphs read like plagiarism-->

Omri is thought to have granted the Arameans the right to \"make streets in Samaria\" as a sign of submission ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:34|KJV}}). This probably meant permission was granted to the [[Aramean]] merchants to carry on their trade in the city. This would imply the existence of a considerable Aramean population.

<blockquote>It was the only great city of Israel created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, \"Beth-Khumri\" (\"the house or palace of Omri\"). (Stanley) <!--who is Stanley--></blockquote>

According to Biblical tradition, Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of [[Ahab]], Benhadad II came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:1–21|KJV}}). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:28–34|KJV}}), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than \"two little flocks of kids.\"

Biblical tradition also holds that in the days of [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke off the siege, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famished inhabitants of the city were soon relieved from the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that \"a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of [[barley]] for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria\" ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:1–20|KJV}}).

According to [[Josephus]], the ancient name of the site ''Shomron'' (Samaria) was changed to ''[[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]]'' by King [[Herod the Great]], in honor of [[Augustus Caesar]].<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D15%3Asection%3D292 15.8.5.]</ref> .

===Assyrian invasion===
[[File:SamariaHellenisticTower.JPG|right|thumb|[[Hellenistic]] tower from the inside.]]
During the reign of the last king of the northern kingdom, [[Hoshea]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|10|KJV}}), the [[Assyria]]ns invaded in 722/721 BC. (initially under [[Shalmaneser V]] and finally under [[Sargon II]]) when they established complete control over the capital city and the remainder of the northern kingdom. The fragment of a stela with an Assyrian inscription attributed to Sargon II was found on the eastern slope of the acropolis testifying to their presence. In addition, according to inscriptions from Sargon's palace at [[Khorsabad]], the inhabitants of Samaria were deported to Assyria.

{{quote|[the Samar]ians [who had agreed with a hostile king]. ... I fought with them and decisively defeated them] ... carried off as spoil. 50 chariots for my royal force ... [the rest of them I settled in the midst of Assyria]. ... The Tamudi, Ibadidi, Marsimani and Hayappa, who live in distant Arabia, in the desert, who knew neither overseer nor commander, who never brought tribute to any king—with the help of Ashshur my lord, I defeated them. I deported the rest of them. I settled them in Samaria/Samerina. (Sargon II Inscriptions, COS 2.118A, p. 293)}}

Also,

{{quote|The inhabitants of Samaria/Samerina, who agreed [and plotted] with a king [hostile to] me, not to do service and not to bring tribute [to Ashshur] and who did battle, I fought against them with the power of the great gods, my lords. I counted as spoil 27,280 people, together with their chariots, and gods, in which they trusted. I formed a unit with 200 of [their] chariots for my royal force. I settled the rest of them in the midst of Assyria. I repopulated Samaria/Samerina more than before. I brought into it people from countries conquered by my hands. I appointed my eunuch as governor over them. And I counted them as Assyrians. (Nimrud Prisms, COS 2.118D, pp. 295–296)}}

The remains of a wall relief in Room 5 of Sargon's palace is thought to depict Samaria and its defeated defenders. New inhabitants were brought in (from [[Kutha]] and the Syro-Mesopotamian area, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|17:24|KJV}}) and they formed a new [[Samaritan]] population, also known as [[Cuthim]]. The city together with the neighboring highland area became known as Samerina and was ruled by an Assyrian governor. There are only meager remains from the succeeding [[Babylonia]]n period and it was only in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period, in the mid 5th century, that the city reemerged in importance. The tensions between the ruling family of [[Sanballat the Horonite|Sanballat]] and [[Jerusalem]] under the governorship of [[Nehemiah]] are documented in the Bible ({{bibleverse||Ezra|4:10|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Neh|4:7–8|KJV}}). Samaria became a [[Hellenistic]] town in 332 BC and thousands of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] soldiers were settled there following a revolt by the Samaritans. Three 13 m diameter round towers dating to that period have been excavated (the first two by Harvard who attributed them to the Israelite period) and a later, massive, fortification wall with square towers. These fortifications were breached during the destruction of the city by [[John Hyrcanus]] in 108. Traces of the destruction wrought by Hyrcanus were found by the excavators, but the city was apparently resettled under [[Alexander Yannai]]. In 63 BC Samaria was annexed to the Roman province of Syria.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Sebaste===
[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 052.jpg|right|thumb|Base of [[Augusteum]] temple at summit of the hilltop, originally 25 metres high.]]
In 30 BC the emperor [[Augustus]] awarded the city to [[Herod the Great]] who renamed it '''Sebaste''' ({{Lang-he-n|'''סבסטי'''}}), in honor of Augustus (\"Sebaste\" is the feminine form of Gr. [[Sebastos]] = Augustus). The outstanding remains from this period are; the [[Augusteum]], consisting of a temple and a large forecourt built over the Omride palace at the summit of the acropolis; a city gate and an east-west colonnaded street; a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theater]] on the north-east slope of the acropolis; a Temple to [[Persephone|Kore]] on a terrace north of the acropolis, and a stadium to the north-east in the valley below. East of the acropolis, and in an area that today links the ancient city with the modern village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]], lies the forum flanked on the west by a partially excavated basilica. Water for Roman Sebaste was provided by an underground aqueduct that led into the area of the forum from springs in the east. The city was encompassed by a city wall 2½ miles (4&nbsp;km) long, with imposing towers that linked the gateways in the west and north. A number of mausoleums with ornate sarcophagi were excavated in the area of the modern village and adjoining fields.

===New Testament===
In {{bibleverse||Acts|8:4–13|NKJV}} it is recorded that [[Philip the Evangelist]] went down to the city of Samaria and preached the Christian gospel and healed the sick there. [[Simon Magus|Simon the Magician]], a noted sorcerer, was among those converted.

===Roman reconstruction and later===
[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 085.jpg|thumb|right|[[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine church]] entrance.]]
[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 099.jpg|thumb|right|Byzantine church]]
The city was rebuilt without any major changes in the 2nd century&nbsp;AD by [[Septimius Severus]] when the city was established as a colony. 

Samaria has been associated with [[John the Baptist]], whose body was believed to be buried there. 
In about August 362 AD, in continuation of his policy against Christianity, Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], more commonly known as Julian the [[Apostasy#Christianity|Apostate]] and who was based in [[Antioch]], in the course of the [[Julian's Persian expedition|Persian expedition]], ordered the destruction of the tomb of John the Baptist and the cremation of his body; the event was recorded by historian and theologian [[Tyrannius Rufinus]]. A small basilica church, first founded in the 5th century, was excavated on the southern slope of the acropolis. The church was believed to be the burial place of the head of John the Baptist. A monastery was added to it at a later date. 

In the 12th century AD, a Latin (i.e. [[Catholic Church|Western or Catholic]]) cathedral also dedicated to John the Baptist was built east of the Roman forum and combined elements of the Roman period city wall. It later became the Sebaste village mosque, the [[Nabi Yahya Mosque]] (\"mosque of the Prophet John\"), preserving the old Christian tradition.

===Modern era===
In 1867, visitors found the village to have a population of 400, 'almost all Moslems'.<ref>Ellen Clare Miller, 'Eastern Sketches – notes of scenery, schools and tent life in Syria and Palestine'. Edinburgh: William Oliphant and Company. 1871. p. 179: 'stigmatized in guide-books as remarkable for rudeness and fanaticism' although this was not Ms Miller's experience.</ref>

In late 1976, the Israeli settlers movement, [[Gush Emunim]], attempted to establish a settlement at the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] train station. The Israeli government did not approve and the group that was removed from the site would later found the settlement of [[Elon Moreh]] adjacent to [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]].

==Archaeology==
The site was first excavated by the Harvard Expedition, initially directed by [[Gottlieb Schumacher]] in 1908 and then by [[George Andrew Reisner]] in 1909 and 1910; with the assistance of architect C.S. Fisher and D.G. Lyon.<ref>Reisner, G. A.; C.S. Fisher, and D.G. Lyon (1924). ''Harvard Excavations at Samaria, 1908–1910''.

The second expedition was known as the Joint Expedition, a consortium of 5 institutions directed by [[John Winter Crowfoot]] between 1931 and 1935; with the assistance of [[Kathleen Kenyon|Kathleen Mary Kenyon]], [[Eliezer Sukenik]] and G.M.

===Israelite city, Building Period I (Omri)===
Only the acropolis of Samaria has been extensively excavated down to the bedrock. The palace was excavated solely by the Harvard Expedition and recognized by them as the Palace of Omri (designated Building Period I). The Omride palace was located on an elevated 4 meter high rock-cut platform that isolated it from its immediate surroundings. While immediately below the palace, cut into the face of the bedrock platform, there are two rock-cut tomb chambers that have only recently been recognized and attributed to Omri and Ahab. West of the palace there are meager remains of other Building Period I buildings but much of the rock surface has been severely damaged by later buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Israelite city, Building Period II===
[[File:Palace in the Kingdom of Israel · HHWII77.svg|left|200px|thumb|An artist's depiction of a royal palace in the Kingdom of Israel.]]
The Omride palace continued in use during the next building phase (designated Building Period II), but it was no longer isolated on an elevated platform. The acropolis area was extended in all direction by the addition of a massive perimeter wall built in the casemate style; the new enlarged rectangular acropolis measured c. 290&nbsp;ft. (90 m.) from north to south and at least c. 585&nbsp;ft. (180 m.) from west to east (that is a capacity of approximately 7,500 persons by current fire standards), and the surface was now raised to a uniform elevation by the addition of a massive fill. This phase (Building Period II) was traditionally attributed to Ahab due to the misallocation of Wall 161 that run parallel to the northern casemates and the identification of a large rock-cut pool near the northern casemate wall as the Biblical \"Pool of Samaria\"; the wall (Wall 161) is now recognized to belong to Building Period II and the \"pool\" is a rock-cut grape-treading area that originated in Building Period 0 and continued in a reduced form in Building Period I. Consequently, the onset of Building Period II can only be relatively fixed. There is neither a biblical anchor nor securely dated pottery to establish the chronological affiliation of Building Period II.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The Omride Palace was still in use and the royal tombs were still accessible (now via subterranean rooms) and there was an administrative building the [[Ostraca House]] (due to the 63 ostraca retrieved from the floor's make-up) built west of the palace on the newly extended acropolis. The ostraca provide a wealth of data concerning oil and wine supplies, and can possibly be attributed to the period of [[Jeroboam II]] c. 785–749, thus providing a probable date for Building Period II. North of the palace a rich cache of Phoenician ivories were retrieved, these were mixed with later debris but it was presumed by the excavators that it was in this area that the \"Ivory House\" that [[Ahab]] built for [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] 1 Kings 22:39 stood. North-east and below the acropolis a number of Iron Age tombs were found and their location probably delimits the area of the city in that direction. In essence only the acropolis was excavated down to the Iron Age but it is presumed by the excavators that the city extended down over the northern and southern slopes of the hill.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Samaria''' ({{lang-he-n|שומרון}}, ''Shomron''; {{lang-grc|Σαμάρεια}}, ''Samareia''; {{lang-ar|السامرة}}, ''as-Samira'') was an ancient city in the [[Land of Israel]]. It was the capital of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. The ruins of the city are located in the [[Samaria]] mountains of the [[West Bank]], almost 10 km to the northwest of [[Nablus]].

==History==
Israelite Shomron (lit. \"watch-tower\"; also written \"Shomeron\") was located in the heart of the mountains of [[Samaria]], a few miles northwest of [[Shechem]]. The ruins of the Israelite town, as well the ruins of towns built at this same location later in history, are all adjacent or within the modern [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]]. 
 
The \"hill of Shomron\" is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. According to biblical tradition, [[Omri]], the king of the northern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] (reigned c. 870s BC), purchased this hill from [[Shemer (biblical figure)|Shemer]] its owner for two [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of \"Shomron\", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:24|KJV}}). As such it possessed many advantages. Omri resided here during the last six years of his reign.<!--these paragraphs read like plagiarism-->

Omri is thought to have granted the Arameans the right to \"make streets in Samaria\" as a sign of submission ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:34|KJV}}). This probably meant permission was granted to the [[Aramean]] merchants to carry on their trade in the city. This would imply the existence of a considerable Aramean population.

<blockquote>It was the only great city of Israel created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, \"Beth-Khumri\" (\"the house or palace of Omri\"). (Stanley) <!--who is Stanley--></blockquote>

According to Biblical tradition, Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of [[Ahab]], Benhadad II came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:1–21|KJV}}). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:28–34|KJV}}), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than \"two little flocks of kids.\"

Biblical tradition also holds that in the days of [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke off the siege, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famished inhabitants of the city were soon relieved from the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that \"a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of [[barley]] for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria\" ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:1–20|KJV}}).

According to [[Josephus]], the ancient name of the site ''Shomron'' (Samaria) was changed to ''[[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]]'' by King [[Herod the Great]], in honor of [[Augustus Caesar]].<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D15%3Asection%3D292 15.8.5.]</ref> .

===Assyrian invasion===
[[File:SamariaHellenisticTower.JPG|right|thumb|[[Hellenistic]] tower from the inside.]]
During the reign of the last king of the northern kingdom, [[Hoshea]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|10|KJV}}), the [[Assyria]]ns invaded in 722/721 BC. (initially under [[Shalmaneser V]] and finally under [[Sargon II]]) when they established complete control over the capital city and the remainder of the northern kingdom. The fragment of a stela with an Assyrian inscription attributed to Sargon II was found on the eastern slope of the acropolis testifying to their presence. In addition, according to inscriptions from Sargon's palace at [[Khorsabad]], the inhabitants of Samaria were deported to Assyria.

{{quote|[the Samar]ians [who had agreed with a hostile king]. ... I fought with them and decisively defeated them] ... carried off as spoil. 50 chariots for my royal force ... [the rest of them I settled in the midst of Assyria]. ... The Tamudi, Ibadidi, Marsimani and Hayappa, who live in distant Arabia, in the desert, who knew neither overseer nor commander, who never brought tribute to any king—with the help of Ashshur my lord, I defeated them. I deported the rest of them. I settled them in Samaria/Samerina. (Sargon II Inscriptions, COS 2.118A, p. 293)}}

Also,

{{quote|The inhabitants of Samaria/Samerina, who agreed [and plotted] with a king [hostile to] me, not to do service and not to bring tribute [to Ashshur] and who did battle, I fought against them with the power of the great gods, my lords. I counted as spoil 27,280 people, together with their chariots, and gods, in which they trusted. I formed a unit with 200 of [their] chariots for my royal force. I settled the rest of them in the midst of Assyria. I repopulated Samaria/Samerina more than before. I brought into it people from countries conquered by my hands. I appointed my eunuch as governor over them. And I counted them as Assyrians. (Nimrud Prisms, COS 2.118D, pp. 295–296)}}

The remains of a wall relief in Room 5 of Sargon's palace is thought to depict Samaria and its defeated defenders. New inhabitants were brought in (from [[Kutha]] and the Syro-Mesopotamian area, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|17:24|KJV}}) and they formed a new [[Samaritan]] population, also known as [[Cuthim]]. The city together with the neighboring highland area became known as Samerina and was ruled by an Assyrian governor. There are only meager remains from the succeeding [[Babylonia]]n period and it was only in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period, in the mid 5th century, that the city reemerged in importance. The tensions between the ruling family of [[Sanballat the Horonite|Sanballat]] and [[Jerusalem]] under the governorship of [[Nehemiah]] are documented in the Bible ({{bibleverse||Ezra|4:10|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Neh|4:7–8|KJV}}). Samaria became a [[Hellenistic]] town in 332 BC and thousands of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] soldiers were settled there following a revolt by the Samaritans. Three 13 m diameter round towers dating to that period have been excavated (the first two by Harvard who attributed them to the Israelite period) and a later, massive, fortification wall with square towers. These fortifications were breached during the destruction of the city by [[John Hyrcanus]] in 108. Traces of the destruction wrought by Hyrcanus were found by the excavators, but the city was apparently resettled under [[Alexander Yannai]]. In 63 BC Samaria was annexed to the Roman province of Syria.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Sebaste===
[[File:2016 WLM - OVEDC - Shomron capital of the Kingdom of Israel 052.jpg|right|thumb|Base of [[Augusteum]] temple at summit of the hilltop, originally 25 metres high.]]
In 30 BC the emperor [[Augustus]] awarded the city to [[Herod the Great]] who renamed it '''Sebaste''' ({{Lang-he-n|'''סבסטי'''}}), in honor of Augustus (\"Sebaste\" is the feminine form of Gr. [[Sebastos]] = Augustus). The outstanding remains from this period are; the [[Augusteum]], consisting of a temple and a large forecourt built over the Omride palace at the summit of the acropolis; a city gate and an east-west colonnaded street; a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theater]] on the north-east slope of the acropolis; a Temple to [[Persephone|Kore]] on a terrace north of the acropolis, and a stadium to the north-east in the valley below. East of the acropolis, and in an area that today links the ancient city with the modern village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]], lies the forum flanked on the west by a partially excavated basilica. Water for Roman Sebaste was provided by an underground aqueduct that led into the area of the forum from springs in the east. The city was encompassed by a city wall 2½ miles (4&nbsp;km) long, with imposing towers that linked the gateways in the west and north. A number of mausoleums with ornate sarcophagi were excavated in the area of the modern village and adjoining fields.

===New Testament===
In {{bibleverse||Acts|8:4–13|NKJV}} it is recorded that [[Philip the Evangelist]] went down to the city of Samaria and preached the Christian gospel and healed the sick there. [[Simon Magus|Simon the Magician]], a noted sorcerer, was among those converted.

===Roman reconstruction and later===

== Reaction to the authoritarian downturn in Hungary ==
Sixteen member nations of the European Union issued a statement warning that certain emergency measures issued by countries during the coronavirus pandemic could undermine the principles of rule of law and democracy on 1 April.

'''Thomas Posey''' (July 9, 1750{{spaced ndash}}March 19, 1818) was an officer in the [[American Revolution]], a general during peacetime, the [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|third Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Kentucky]], Governor of the [[Indiana Territory]], and a [[Louisiana]] Senator.

==Early life==

===Family and background===
Thomas Posey was born on the banks of the [[Potomac River]] on a farm adjacent to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mt Vernon]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] on July 9, 1750.<ref>Sparks, p. 364</ref> According to his own account, he was \"born of respectable parentage.\"<ref name = g33>Gugin, p. 33</ref> Throughout his life Posey was dogged by rumors that he was the illegitimate son of [[George Washington]]. The rumor persisted even after his death and was the subject of several newspaper articles.

Most historians are unsure of who his parents truly were as there is little recorded of them. Posey grew up on land adjacent to Washington's [[Mt. Vernon]] home, in the home of John Posey. John was a close friend of George Washington, and Thomas benefited from Washington's patronage early in his life. The rumors were dismissed by Posey's biographer, John Thornton Posey.<ref name=\"g33\" />

Posey received a plain English education from the neighborhood school and at 19 he moved to the Virginia frontier near [[Staunton, Virginia]] where he intended to engage in a trade or farm.<ref name = g33/> He opened a business producing saddles and married Martha Mathews, daughter of [[Sampson Mathews]] of the [[Mathews family]].<ref name=Oren>Oren, Frederick Morton (1920). A History of Rockbridge County, Virginia. McClure Company, pg 232. Retrieved online April 24, 2014 from https://books.google.com/books?id=rtF4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA232&dq=%22thomas+posey%22++%22mathews+family%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nVVZU6PwKZHgsAT17oLQAg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20posey%22%20%20%22mathews%20family%22&f=false</ref><ref name=Clem>Clem, Gladys B. (1965)\"It Happened Around Staunton in Virginia\"(Staunton, Virginia: Second Edition) p. 21-23</ref> The couple had three sons, although only one survived to adulthood. Martha died in 1778 while giving birth to the third son. Life on the frontier was tumultuous, and the Indians' continual raiding led to a reprisal by the Virginia's Royal Governor, Lord Dunmore. In 1774 Posey was in the quartermaster's department of an armed expedition against the Indians who were threatening the frontier settlements.<ref>Sparks, p. 365</ref> He was present at the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]], and the expedition succeeded in suppressing the Indians for the short term.<ref name = g34>Gugin, p. 34</ref>

===Revolutionary War===
Posey was elected a member of the [[Virginia]] [[committee of correspondence]] in 1775.<ref>Sparks, p. 372</ref> He served in the army during the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]], first as a captain in the [[Continental Army]], mostly with the [[7th Virginia Regiment]], then later rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1782. Some claimed his quick rise was due to the patronage of [[George Washington]]. During the war Posey led campaigns against Lord Dunmore who was fortified on Gwyn's Island and drove him and his naval support out of the area. Lord Dunmore had been the officer he served under during the Indian war. In the winter of 1775 the 7th Virginia Regiment marched to join with General [[George Washington]] in [[New Jersey]]. It was at this time that Washington promoted Posey to the rank of Captain.<ref>Sparks, p. 376</ref> During the winter of 1776, Posey commanded the pickets guarding the [[Valley Forge]] encampment and led skirmishes almost daily. The following campaigning season, his corps was involved in the battle to drive Gen. Howe back to [[New York City]], and played a critical role in the [[Battle of Monmouth]]. In 1778 Capt. Posey replaced [[Daniel Morgan]] as commander of the [[Provisional Rifle Corps]] when it was reduced to two companies. His small unit was sent to upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] to help secure that frontier flank of the Continental Army's Highland Department.<ref name = g34/><ref>Sparks, p. 378</ref> He was promoted to major and given command of the [[7th Virginia Regiment]] on December 20, 1778.

In July 1779 Posey was assigned to command a battalion of light infantry in Corps of Light Infantry commanded by Brig-Gen. [[Anthony Wayne]]. As part of the provisional 1st Regiment under Col. [[Christian Febiger]], he led his battalion in a bayonet night assault to [[Battle of Stony Point|storm Stony Point]], a key British position on the [[Hudson River]] near West Point. Posey was one of the first to enter the British works and seized the colors of the [[17th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name = g34/><ref>Sparks, p. 380</ref>

In his absence, the 7th Virginia regiment was ordered on December 8, 1779, to join the rest of the Virginia Line to march to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], to join the Southern Army. When the Corps of Light Infantry disbanded in December, Posey was sent to join his regiment, but the army surrendered on May 12, 1780, before he could rejoin it. As one of the few uncaptured Virginia officers, Posey had few duties until exchange of captured soldiers occurred in early 1781, at which time Col. Febiger recruited him to help reconstitute the Virginia Line in a new \"18-month\" battalion. He became de facto commander of the battalion and served in the [[siege of Yorktown]]. During 1781–1782 he served with General Wayne again, this time in Georgia against the forces in Savannah. He was promoted to Lt. Col. in 1782.<ref>Sparks, p. 381</ref><ref name = g35>Gugin, p. 35</ref>

When the war ended, Posey returned to Virginia having resigned from the army on March 10, 1783.  In the same year he became an original member of the Virginia [[Society of the Cincinnati]].

He took guardianship of his surviving son who had been living with friends since the death of his mother. Posey married Mary Alexander Thornton, the wealthy widow of George Thornton, in 1784. Posey had nine children by her. He remained married to her until his death. The family lived on her [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] plantation, where Posey farmed for nearly eighteen years. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for the United States House of Representatives in 1797, and held several appointed position in the Virginia state government.<ref name = g35/>

Posey briefly returned to the military following several setbacks to the army which was campaigning against the [[Wabash Confederacy]] in the [[Old Northwest]]. He reentered the army as a [[brigadier general]] in 1793 and served with \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] campaigning against the Indians beyond the frontier in the [[Northwest Indian War]].<ref>Sparks, p. 392</ref> Posey was disturbed by the actions of second in command, General [[James Wilkinson]]. Wilkinson had been secretly undermining Wayne's authority in reports to Washington, and Posey discovered that Wilkinson had been involved in similar plots against other ranking officers, including the former frontier commander [[George Rogers Clark]]. Years after Wilkinson's death, it was discovered that he had been accepting bribery money from [[Spain]] to stir up trouble on the frontier. Because of the ill feelings caused by Wilkinson, Posey resigned from the army again on February 20, 1794, only a few months before the war was ended following American victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].<ref name = g36>Gugin, p. 36</ref>

==Public office==

===Kentucky and Louisiana===

In 1802, Posey received {{convert|7000|acre|ha}} in reward for his military service, and he was given several options of land tracts in the western United States. He chose land near [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and moved his family to the new estate. His prestige made him immediately popular in the area and he was elected to the [[Kentucky State Senate]], beginning a term on November 10, 1804 and became the body's speaker. In 1805 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, serving a brief term. He was a candidate for governor in 1808, but withdrew to support [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]].<ref name = g36/><ref name=s395>Sparks, p. 395</ref>

In preparation for possible hostilities with the French and British, in 1809 Congress authorized an army of 100,000 men to be mobilized. Kentucky was assigned the task of providing five thousand men. Posey returned to the army as a Major General in command of the Kentucky militia. He oversaw an organization of the militia to ready them for the war before he resigned from in 1810.<ref name= s395/> He then moved to the Attakapas region of [[Louisiana]], and was appointed by the governor to serve as a U.S. Senator from that state in 1812–1813 to fill the vacant seat of [[Jean Noel Destréhan]] after his resignation. In [[Washington D.C.]] he also assisted the Acting Secretary of War in preparing war plans.<ref name = g36/><ref>Sparks, p. 399</ref>

===Indiana Territory===

After he was defeated for re-election to his senate seat, he was appointed by President [[James Madison]] to be Governor of [[Indiana Territory]] in February 1813 where he succeeded [[William Henry Harrison]] who had accepted a new position to lead the army against Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>Cockrum, p. 377</ref> When he arrived he relieved [[John Gibson (Indiana)|John Gibson]] of his duties as acting-governor. The Territorial General Assembly, who had been strongly opposed to the previous governor, took the absence of a strong governor to enact several pieces of legislation it had been trying to force Harrison to pass for several years, including the move of the capital. The assembly was unhappy with Posey's appointment, hoping to have instead received a northern governor who was opposed to slavery and more agreeable to the prevailing mood of the territory. He arrived in the new capital of [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] in December 1813 where he delivered a conciliatory speech to the assembly.<ref name = g37>Gugin, p. 37</ref>

Posey was considered to be a charitable and personally likable man in the territory. He was an active member of the [[Presbyterian Church]] and became president of a Bible Society, who distributed free Bibles to the poor.<ref>Woollen, p. 28</ref> Posey disliked the small capitol, and because of his poor health he wanted to be closer to a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. During the middle of the first General Assembly session, Posey moved to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] where he remained for the duration of his tenure, and from there conducted the office of governor. He communicated with the legislature in Corydon by courier.<ref>Cockrum, p. 383</ref> The legislature was offended by his absence, which they portrayed as a continuation of the previous governor's alleged aristocratic tendencies and issued a resolution that rebuked him for leaving.<ref name = g37/>

Posey's most important act as governor was to reorganize the territorial courts. In 1815 Posey called a special session of the assembly to meet in Corydon to create a new territorial judiciary. The existing judiciary's authority was in question because the courts had been created at a time when no authority had been granted by Congress to create their offices. Posey presided over the assembly which ultimately divided the territory into three judicial districts and appointed several judges.<ref>Cockrum, p. 398</ref> The legislature was pleased to find that Posey's appointments to public office were not overly partisan, and were happy with his approval of road construction and the framework he created for basic educational facilities. He also approved the charter for the [[Bank of Vincennes]], the first in the territory leading to considerable economic advancement.<ref name = g37/>

Despite his attempts to please the territory's population, he was widely disliked by the legislature for his \"inaccessibility\", and his pro-slavery sentiments were at odds with that of the anti-slavery dominated territory. He was the frequent victim of speaker [[Dennis Pennington]]'s huaranging speeches. Although statehood was approved during his term, he is considered to have had little impact on it, and instead attempted to delay it. In a speech he delivered, he claimed the territory's population was too sparse to bear the taxation that would be necessary to effectually grow the state, and instead recommended remaining a territory for a longer period to continue receiving federal financial assistance. The legislature pressed for statehood, and the territory's congressman [[Jonathan Jennings]] proposed federal legislation to approve statehood. When Indiana became a state in 1816, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor and was defeated by Jennings, 5,211 to 3,934 votes.<ref name = g37/> A key election issue causing the dislike of Posey was that he was in favor of slavery in Indiana, which much of the legislature, Dennis Pennington, and Jonathan Jennings opposed.<ref name = g37/><ref>Baird, Lewis. ''Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana'', (1909) pg.60</ref><ref>Cockrum, p. 392</ref>

===Later life===
In the last two years of his life, he served as an [[Indian agent]] in [[Illinois]], negotiating treaties with the [[Wea]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Pottawatomie]].  He was appointed Indian Agent of Helios's in 1816.<ref>Sparks, p. 402</ref>  He was a candidate for Congress again in 1817, hoping to be elected to Jennings' now vacant seat in Congress, but was overwhelming defeated by [[William Hendricks]].  He died of [[Typhus]] fever on March 19, 1818 in [[Shawneetown, Illinois]], aged 67, and was buried in the Westwood Cemetery.<ref>Gugin, p. 38</ref>  [[Posey County, Indiana]], and [[Posey Township, Franklin County, Indiana]]<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVE0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of Franklin County, Indiana | publisher=Windmill Publications | author=Reifel, August Jacob | year=1915 | pages=122}}</ref>. were named in honor of Thomas Posey.

'''Thomas Posey''' (July 9, 1750{{spaced ndash}}March 19, 1818) was an officer in the [[American Revolution]], a general during peacetime, the [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|third Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Kentucky]], Governor of the [[Indiana Territory]], and a [[Louisiana]] Senator.

==Early life==

===Family and background===
Thomas Posey was born on the banks of the [[Potomac River]] on a farm adjacent to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mt Vernon]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] on July 9, 1750.<ref>Sparks, p. 364</ref> According to his own account, he was \"born of respectable parentage.\"<ref name = g33>Gugin, p. 33</ref> Throughout his life Posey was dogged by rumors that he was the illegitimate son of [[George Washington]]. The rumor persisted even after his death and was the subject of several newspaper articles.

Most historians are unsure of who his parents truly were as there is little recorded of them. Posey grew up on land adjacent to Washington's [[Mt. Vernon]] home, in the home of John Posey. John was a close friend of George Washington, and Thomas benefited from Washington's patronage early in his life. The rumors were dismissed by Posey's biographer, John Thornton Posey.<ref name=\"g33\" />

Posey received a plain English education from the neighborhood school and at 19 he moved to the Virginia frontier near [[Staunton, Virginia]] where he intended to engage in a trade or farm.<ref name = g33/> He opened a business producing saddles and married Martha Mathews, daughter of [[Sampson Mathews]] of the [[Mathews family (Virginia)|Mathews family]].<ref name=Oren>Oren, Frederick Morton (1920). A History of Rockbridge County, Virginia. McClure Company, pg 232. Retrieved online April 24, 2014 from https://books.google.com/books?id=rtF4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA232&dq=%22thomas+posey%22++%22mathews+family%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nVVZU6PwKZHgsAT17oLQAg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20posey%22%20%20%22mathews%20family%22&f=false</ref><ref name=Clem>Clem, Gladys B. (1965)\"It Happened Around Staunton in Virginia\"(Staunton, Virginia: Second Edition) p. 21-23</ref> The couple had three sons, although only one survived to adulthood. Martha died in 1778 while giving birth to the third son. Life on the frontier was tumultuous, and the Indians' continual raiding led to a reprisal by the Virginia's Royal Governor, Lord Dunmore. In 1774 Posey was in the quartermaster's department of an armed expedition against the Indians who were threatening the frontier settlements.<ref>Sparks, p. 365</ref> He was present at the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]], and the expedition succeeded in suppressing the Indians for the short term.<ref name = g34>Gugin, p. 34</ref>

===Revolutionary War===
Posey was elected a member of the [[Virginia]] [[committee of correspondence]] in 1775.<ref>Sparks, p. 372</ref> He served in the army during the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]], first as a captain in the [[Continental Army]], mostly with the [[7th Virginia Regiment]], then later rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1782. Some claimed his quick rise was due to the patronage of [[George Washington]]. During the war Posey led campaigns against Lord Dunmore who was fortified on Gwyn's Island and drove him and his naval support out of the area. Lord Dunmore had been the officer he served under during the Indian war. In the winter of 1775 the 7th Virginia Regiment marched to join with General [[George Washington]] in [[New Jersey]]. It was at this time that Washington promoted Posey to the rank of Captain.<ref>Sparks, p. 376</ref> During the winter of 1776, Posey commanded the pickets guarding the [[Valley Forge]] encampment and led skirmishes almost daily. The following campaigning season, his corps was involved in the battle to drive Gen. Howe back to [[New York City]], and played a critical role in the [[Battle of Monmouth]]. In 1778 Capt. Posey replaced [[Daniel Morgan]] as commander of the [[Provisional Rifle Corps]] when it was reduced to two companies. His small unit was sent to upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] to help secure that frontier flank of the Continental Army's Highland Department.<ref name = g34/><ref>Sparks, p. 378</ref> He was promoted to major and given command of the [[7th Virginia Regiment]] on December 20, 1778.

In July 1779 Posey was assigned to command a battalion of light infantry in Corps of Light Infantry commanded by Brig-Gen. [[Anthony Wayne]]. As part of the provisional 1st Regiment under Col. [[Christian Febiger]], he led his battalion in a bayonet night assault to [[Battle of Stony Point|storm Stony Point]], a key British position on the [[Hudson River]] near West Point. Posey was one of the first to enter the British works and seized the colors of the [[17th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name = g34/><ref>Sparks, p. 380</ref>

In his absence, the 7th Virginia regiment was ordered on December 8, 1779, to join the rest of the Virginia Line to march to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], to join the Southern Army. When the Corps of Light Infantry disbanded in December, Posey was sent to join his regiment, but the army surrendered on May 12, 1780, before he could rejoin it. As one of the few uncaptured Virginia officers, Posey had few duties until exchange of captured soldiers occurred in early 1781, at which time Col. Febiger recruited him to help reconstitute the Virginia Line in a new \"18-month\" battalion. He became de facto commander of the battalion and served in the [[siege of Yorktown]]. During 1781–1782 he served with General Wayne again, this time in Georgia against the forces in Savannah. He was promoted to Lt. Col. in 1782.<ref>Sparks, p. 381</ref><ref name = g35>Gugin, p. 35</ref>

When the war ended, Posey returned to Virginia having resigned from the army on March 10, 1783.  In the same year he became an original member of the Virginia [[Society of the Cincinnati]].

He took guardianship of his surviving son who had been living with friends since the death of his mother. Posey married Mary Alexander Thornton, the wealthy widow of George Thornton, in 1784. Posey had nine children by her. He remained married to her until his death. The family lived on her [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] plantation, where Posey farmed for nearly eighteen years. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for the United States House of Representatives in 1797, and held several appointed position in the Virginia state government.<ref name = g35/>

Posey briefly returned to the military following several setbacks to the army which was campaigning against the [[Wabash Confederacy]] in the [[Old Northwest]]. He reentered the army as a [[brigadier general]] in 1793 and served with \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] campaigning against the Indians beyond the frontier in the [[Northwest Indian War]].<ref>Sparks, p. 392</ref> Posey was disturbed by the actions of second in command, General [[James Wilkinson]]. Wilkinson had been secretly undermining Wayne's authority in reports to Washington, and Posey discovered that Wilkinson had been involved in similar plots against other ranking officers, including the former frontier commander [[George Rogers Clark]]. Years after Wilkinson's death, it was discovered that he had been accepting bribery money from [[Spain]] to stir up trouble on the frontier. Because of the ill feelings caused by Wilkinson, Posey resigned from the army again on February 20, 1794, only a few months before the war was ended following American victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].<ref name = g36>Gugin, p. 36</ref>

==Public office==

===Kentucky and Louisiana===

In 1802, Posey received {{convert|7000|acre|ha}} in reward for his military service, and he was given several options of land tracts in the western United States. He chose land near [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and moved his family to the new estate. His prestige made him immediately popular in the area and he was elected to the [[Kentucky State Senate]], beginning a term on November 10, 1804 and became the body's speaker. In 1805 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, serving a brief term. He was a candidate for governor in 1808, but withdrew to support [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]].<ref name = g36/><ref name=s395>Sparks, p. 395</ref>

In preparation for possible hostilities with the French and British, in 1809 Congress authorized an army of 100,000 men to be mobilized. Kentucky was assigned the task of providing five thousand men. Posey returned to the army as a Major General in command of the Kentucky militia. He oversaw an organization of the militia to ready them for the war before he resigned from in 1810.<ref name= s395/> He then moved to the Attakapas region of [[Louisiana]], and was appointed by the governor to serve as a U.S. Senator from that state in 1812–1813 to fill the vacant seat of [[Jean Noel Destréhan]] after his resignation. In [[Washington D.C.]] he also assisted the Acting Secretary of War in preparing war plans.<ref name = g36/><ref>Sparks, p. 399</ref>

===Indiana Territory===

After he was defeated for re-election to his senate seat, he was appointed by President [[James Madison]] to be Governor of [[Indiana Territory]] in February 1813 where he succeeded [[William Henry Harrison]] who had accepted a new position to lead the army against Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>Cockrum, p. 377</ref> When he arrived he relieved [[John Gibson (Indiana)|John Gibson]] of his duties as acting-governor. The Territorial General Assembly, who had been strongly opposed to the previous governor, took the absence of a strong governor to enact several pieces of legislation it had been trying to force Harrison to pass for several years, including the move of the capital. The assembly was unhappy with Posey's appointment, hoping to have instead received a northern governor who was opposed to slavery and more agreeable to the prevailing mood of the territory. He arrived in the new capital of [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] in December 1813 where he delivered a conciliatory speech to the assembly.<ref name = g37>Gugin, p. 37</ref>

Posey was considered to be a charitable and personally likable man in the territory. He was an active member of the [[Presbyterian Church]] and became president of a Bible Society, who distributed free Bibles to the poor.<ref>Woollen, p. 28</ref> Posey disliked the small capitol, and because of his poor health he wanted to be closer to a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. During the middle of the first General Assembly session, Posey moved to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] where he remained for the duration of his tenure, and from there conducted the office of governor. He communicated with the legislature in Corydon by courier.<ref>Cockrum, p. 383</ref> The legislature was offended by his absence, which they portrayed as a continuation of the previous governor's alleged aristocratic tendencies and issued a resolution that rebuked him for leaving.<ref name = g37/>

Posey's most important act as governor was to reorganize the territorial courts. In 1815 Posey called a special session of the assembly to meet in Corydon to create a new territorial judiciary. The existing judiciary's authority was in question because the courts had been created at a time when no authority had been granted by Congress to create their offices. Posey presided over the assembly which ultimately divided the territory into three judicial districts and appointed several judges.<ref>Cockrum, p. 398</ref> The legislature was pleased to find that Posey's appointments to public office were not overly partisan, and were happy with his approval of road construction and the framework he created for basic educational facilities. He also approved the charter for the [[Bank of Vincennes]], the first in the territory leading to considerable economic advancement.<ref name = g37/>

Despite his attempts to please the territory's population, he was widely disliked by the legislature for his \"inaccessibility\", and his pro-slavery sentiments were at odds with that of the anti-slavery dominated territory. He was the frequent victim of speaker [[Dennis Pennington]]'s huaranging speeches. Although statehood was approved during his term, he is considered to have had little impact on it, and instead attempted to delay it. In a speech he delivered, he claimed the territory's population was too sparse to bear the taxation that would be necessary to effectually grow the state, and instead recommended remaining a territory for a longer period to continue receiving federal financial assistance. The legislature pressed for statehood, and the territory's congressman [[Jonathan Jennings]] proposed federal legislation to approve statehood. When Indiana became a state in 1816, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor and was defeated by Jennings, 5,211 to 3,934 votes.<ref name = g37/> A key election issue causing the dislike of Posey was that he was in favor of slavery in Indiana, which much of the legislature, Dennis Pennington, and Jonathan Jennings opposed.<ref name = g37/><ref>Baird, Lewis. ''Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana'', (1909) pg.60</ref><ref>Cockrum, p. 392</ref>

===Later life===
In the last two years of his life, he served as an [[Indian agent]] in [[Illinois]], negotiating treaties with the [[Wea]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Pottawatomie]].  He was appointed Indian Agent of Helios's in 1816.<ref>Sparks, p. 402</ref>  He was a candidate for Congress again in 1817, hoping to be elected to Jennings' now vacant seat in Congress, but was overwhelming defeated by [[William Hendricks]].  He died of [[Typhus]] fever on March 19, 1818 in [[Shawneetown, Illinois]], aged 67, and was buried in the Westwood Cemetery.<ref>Gugin, p. 38</ref>  [[Posey County, Indiana]], and [[Posey Township, Franklin County, Indiana]]<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVE0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of Franklin County, Indiana | publisher=Windmill Publications | author=Reifel, August Jacob | year=1915 | pages=122}}</ref>. were named in honor of Thomas Posey.

Robert de Auberville maintained connections with Robertsbridge Abbey, married the heiress of another of its patron families, and became settled at the western edge of [[Romney Marsh]].

'''Zakynthos International Airport \"[[Dionysios Solomos]]\"''' {{airport codes|ZTH|LGZA}} is an airport in [[Zakynthos]], Greece.

== History ==
In December 2015 the privatisation of Zakynthos International Airport and 13 other regional airports of Greece was finalised with the signing of the agreement between the [[Fraport#|Fraport AG]]/Copelouzos Group joint venture and the state privatisation fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tornosnews.gr/en/tourism-businesses/new-investments/13859-greece-signs-privatization-of-14-regional-airports-with-germany-s-fraport-for-e1-2-bln.html|title=Greece signs privatization of 14 regional airports with Germany's Fraport - TornosNews.gr|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> \"We signed the deal today,\" the head of Greece's privatisation agency [[HRADF]], Stergios Pitsiorlas, told Reuters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-privatisation-idUKL8N1431P720151214|title=REFILE-UPDATE 1-Greece signs major privatisation deal with Germany's Fraport|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> According to the agreement, the joint venture will operate the 14 airports (including Zakynthos International Airport) for 40 years from 11 April 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fraport-greece.com/eng/media-center/news/fraport-greece-begins-40year-concession-at-14-greek-regional-airports|title=Fraport Greece Begins 40-Year Concession at 14 Greek Regional Airports - Fraport Greece|website=www.fraport-greece.com|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>

The airport is close to the town and beach of [[Kalamaki, Zakynthos|Kalamaki]]. Kalamaki beach is part of the [[National Marine Park of Zakynthos]]. The endangered loggerhead sea turtles (''[[Caretta caretta]]'') lay their eggs at the beaches of the marine park at night during the summer months. This has resulted in aircraft movement restrictions. Flights are not permitted to take off or land between 10:00PM to 5:00AM. It is at the jurisdiction of the Greek authorities to allow aircraft movements at night under extenuating circumstances. The airport opened in 1972.<ref>http://www.alxd.gr/AirportGuide/zakinthos/zakinthosE.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> An expansion of the airport's apron area to 35,100 m² was completed in 2003, and a new 22,150 m² terminal building was completed in 2008. The airport is 4.3&nbsp;km from [[Zakynthos]] town and other seaside tourist destinations such as [[Laganas]], [[Tsilivi]] and [[Kalamaki, Zakynthos|Kalamaki]]. The main approach into the airport is Runway 34. Aircraft usually have to fly over [[Laganas]] bay and make a 180-degree turn, before their final approach over sunbathing tourists on the busy [[Kalamaki, Zakynthos|Kalamaki]] beach.
