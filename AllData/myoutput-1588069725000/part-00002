/>\n}}\n\n'''''Plants vs. Zombies''''' is a [[tower defense]] and [[strategy]] [[video game]] developed and originally published by [[PopCap Games]] for [[Windows]] and [[OS X]] in May 2009, and ported to consoles, handhelds, and mobile devices, and in remastered versions for personal computers.\n\nIn ''Plants vs. Zombies'', the player takes the role of a homeowner in the midst of a [[zombie apocalypse]]. To defend their home from zombies, some of which have unique abilities, the player uses plants that can fire projectiles at, or have other detrimental effects on, the horde of advancing zombies. The player collects \"sun\" with which defending plants can be bought. Zombies approach along several parallel lanes on the lawn, and the player must plan defenses in these lanes. If a zombie makes it to the house on any lane, the game is over. \n\nDirector George Fan was inspired to make the game after playing other tower defense titles and desiring to eliminate the typical strategies of sending advancing enemies through mazes of defenses, instead adapting the lane approach to remove this strategy.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim and was nominated for multiple [[Interactive Achievement Award]]s, alongside receiving praise for its musical score. It was followed by one direct sequel and another made for mobile devices, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time]],'' released in 2013 for iOS and Android, and Plants vs. Zombies 3 respectively; two third-person shooters, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare]]'' and [[Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2|its sequel]], and a digital collectible card game, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies Heroes]]''. On October 18, 2019, hyyy9000987huoy''[[Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville]]'' was also released. On February 25, 2020, Plants vs. Zombies 3 was soft-launched.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Plants vs Zombies Gameplay.png|thumb|200px|left|Game in progress]]\n\nIn ''Plants vs. Zombies'', players place different types of plants and fungi, each with their own unique offensive or defensive capabilities, around their house, in order to stop a horde of [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]] from reaching it. The playing field is divided into 5 to 6 horizontal lanes, each with lawnmowers, and with rare exceptions, a zombie will move towards the player's house along one lane only (the main exception is if it has bitten garlic, causing it to move to another lane). Planting costs \"sun\", which can be gathered for free (albeit slowly) during daytime levels and by planting certain plants or fungi. Most plants can attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in only. In later levels, players can purchase upgrades with different offensive and defensive abilities.\n\nThe game uses several different level types and layouts, each with their own gimmick. The game starts out in a front yard (the standard) and progresses to nighttime levels (sun won't be able to be gathered for free), where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added (in general more to cost). Later levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (where a slanted roof renders most offensive plants useless). On the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a zombie who takes the form of a mad scientist known as [[#Dr. Zomboss|Dr. Zomboss]]. At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by their neighbor, [[#Crazy Dave|Crazy Dave]], to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come upon a conveyor belt, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.\n\nThe player starts with a limited number of seed pack types and seed pack slots that they can use during most levels. The number of slots can be increased through purchases with in-game money. At the start of a level, the player is shown the various types of zombies to expect and given the opportunity to select which seed packs to take into the level. Several plants are nocturnal, such as mushrooms, have a lower sunlight cost, and are ideal for nighttime levels. Certain plants are highly effective against specific types of zombies, such as the Magnet-shroom, which can remove metallic items from a zombie, such as helmets, buckets, ladders, and pogo sticks. Plants may be placed on any available square of lawn, on lily pads floating in a pool, or in flowerpots on a rooftop; these last two items may be chosen as a seed pack for their respective level types and deployed to increase the usable planting space.\n\nThe zombies also come in a number of types that have different attributes, in particular, speed, damage tolerance, and abilities. Zombies include those wearing makeshift armor, those who can jump or fly over plants, and a dancing zombie able to summon other zombies from the ground. At various points, the player will be inundated with a huge wave of zombies.\n\nIf a zombie reaches the end of a lane, a lawnmower will shoot forward and destroy all the zombies in that lane. However, if a zombie reaches the end of that same lane for a second time, it will reach the player's house. When this happens, the music changes and the other plants and zombies stop moving while that zombie enters the house. Crunching sounds will be heard, accompanied by a scream and a message saying \"The zombies ate your brains!\". The game will then end and display the [[Game over|Game Over]] dialog box along with an option to retry the level or return to the main menu at the upper-right side of the screen.\n\n===Game modes===\nThe primary game mode is Adventure Mode in which the player can earn money to spend at an in-game store to buy new seed packets and other bonuses. There are also mini-games and puzzles. In the [[Xbox Live Arcade]], [[PlayStation Network]], and [[Nintendo DS]] versions, there is also a co-op mode, as well as 2 player mini-games and a Versus mode (only Versus mode in the Nintendo DS version & Xbox Live Arcade).\n\n==== Adventure mode ====\nThe adventure mode consists of 5 different areas and 50 different area levels (each area contains 10 levels). They are shown with the area number first, followed by the level number (i.e. 1-10) in the game. Each level in this model has a certain amount of flags and one final wave. The adventure mode is the first game mode and is also the main mode. Mini-games are unlocked from here. Every 5th level will be a mini-game, while the 10th level will be a conveyor level.\n\nWhen and if the player plays through it a second time, Crazy Dave will pick 3 random seeds that the player must use based on the zombies and area they are in every level, this is, of course, optional but it can assist the player in getting more of the in-game currency.\n\n==== Mini games ====\n\nMini-games are unlocked during the adventure mode and are mostly for fun. Some of the minigames are inspired by earlier [[PopCap Games|PopCap]] games.\n\n==== Puzzles ====\n\nPuzzles consist of 18 levels from 2 different \"modes\", Vasebreaker, where you break vases that either contains a plant seed or a zombie, and I, Zombie, where you create zombies to destroy cardboard cutouts of plants. On iOS and Android versions, there's also a third mode called Last Stand that similar to the level with the same name from the Mini-Game Mode but with different zombies in each wave.\n\n==== Survival ====\n\nSurvival is the second-largest game mode in ''Plants vs Zombies''. It involves two difficulties as hard and normal and also has different areas. Each normal round has 5 flags and each hard round has 10 flags. It also has an endless streak level as the final level. Survival is the last game mode in the game itself.\n\nThere is also a page of canceled mini-games called the Limbo Page which can be accessed using the Cheat Engine.\n\n==== Zen Garden ====\nThe game also features a [[Japanese rock garden|Zen Garden]], where players can care for plants they previously purchased from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies or occasionally dropped by zombies. Players can also buy other Zen Garden areas for different plants. Fertilizer, water, and bug spray are necessary for a plant to grow. Plants will grow only when the game has been running for enough time.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n''Plants vs. Zombies'' director George Fan intended on balancing the game between a \"gritty\" game and a \"sickeningly cute\" game. Strong strategic elements were included to appeal to more experienced gamers, while keeping it simple to appeal to casual gamers, without needing too many tutorials. He was inspired to make it a [[tower defense]] game after both thinking of a more defense-oriented version of a previous title of his, ''[[Insaniquarium]]'', and playing some ''[[Warcraft III]]'' tower defense [[mod (video gaming)|mods]].<ref name=\"ars dev\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/george-fan-how-insaniquarium-2-became-plants-vs-zombies.ars |title=Aliens in the garden: the secret origin of Plants vs. Zombies |first=Michael |last=Thompson |date=March 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 20, 2010 |publisher=Ars Technica |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322191116/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/george-fan-how-insaniquarium-2-became-plants-vs-zombies.ars |archivedate=March 22, 2010 }}</ref> While he was looking at the towers in ''Warcraft III'', he felt that plants would make good towers.

Showing her how to customize their card decks inspired him to design Plants vs Zombies with seed packets rather than his original idea of using a conveyor belt that produced randomly selected plants, due to the greater complexity of the seed packet method. While the conveyor belt idea was dropped from the more common game mode, it remained as a special element in select levels.<ref name=\"gamasutra fan 10th\"/> Another influence on ''Plants vs. Zombies'' besides ''Warcraft III'' and ''Insaniquarium'' was ''[[Tapper (arcade game)|Tapper]]'', crediting the use of five lanes to this game.<ref name=\"gamezebo\"/><ref name=\"edge\">{{cite web|title=Flower Defence |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/flower-defence |publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821190932/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/flower-defence |archivedate=August 21, 2010 }}</ref> Various members of [[PopCap Games]] contributed to the development of ''Plants vs. Zombies'' through an internal forum where they gave feedback.\n\nSome of the characteristics that defined ''Insaniquarium'' influenced the development of ''Plants vs. Zombies''. Players advance in a similar pace by receiving new plants. Also, the way plants are chosen at the beginning of each level was derived from the way pets are chosen in ''Insaniquarium''.<ref name=\"gamezebo\" /> Other inspiration for the game's mechanics came from the film ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'', especially where the family defends against pirates. This was the inspiration for the Potato Mine; Fan stated that it was satisfying to watch a zombie step on the mine, being defeated and covered in mashed potatoes.<ref name=hobbit>{{cite web|title=Game Industry Insider: George Fan |url=http://hobbithollow.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-industry-insider-george-fan.html |website=hobbithollow.blogspot.com |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090732/http://hobbithollow.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-industry-insider-george-fan.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nThe team wanted to bring back the aliens from ''Insaniquarium'', but in the end they were changed to zombies, which players could react to more easily because of how slowly they moved. George's favorite zombie was the Pole Vaulting Zombie, due to the hilarity involved when a player encounters it for the first time, using a specific example where a player tries to block it with the Wall-Nut, only to have the zombie jump over it.<ref name=\"gamezebo\"/><ref name=\"edge\"/><ref name=gamearena/>\n\nDuring development, it was discovered that newcomers to the genre of real-time strategy may have a hard time learning the concept behind sun collection. So, the price of the income generating sunflowers was dropped from 100 to 50 to encourage players to buy them over the attacking peashooter. As a result, the balance between plants and zombies had to be restructured\u2014a move that Fan said was definitely worth the effort.<ref name=gamezebo/> Programmers focused on Adventure mode for much of the first year of development. Upon finishing some items ahead of schedule, one of the programmers, Tod Semple, began working on ideas that would later be used for the [[minigame]] section. Some ideas for the puzzle mode section would later be tweaked and moved into adventure mode; \"Vasebreaker\" and \"I, Zombie\", for example, came from single-level minigame concepts. During testing, Fan found that minigame and puzzle modes seemed to detract from the focus on Adventure mode, so some of the additional modes and minigames were locked requiring advancement within adventure mode to become unlocked.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\nFan stated that every game he worked on had only him designing the prototype, adding that he used to draw a lot before he made games, where he made pixel art. The final designs of the zombies and the first plants are similar to how they were initially. After searching for an artist, they discovered Rich Werner, who Fan thought clicked with what he intended for the design. He attributed the intrigue of the design to its animation scheme; Tod Semple suggested that they animate it in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and export it into the game. Fan worried that this would look like it was cut out from paper, and would resemble ''[[South Park]]'' too much, but was satisfied in the end, attributing this to Semple and Werner's talents.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\nFan was most proud of the Tall-nut, Torchwood, and Cob Cannon plants. He explained that the Tall-nut has character, citing its \"determined gaze\" and how it sheds a single tear when hurt. Laura Shigihara could not stand to see this and protected it with a protective plant called a Pumpkin, which can protect plants inside it. He felt that the Torchwood \u2013 which gives Peashooters flaming ammunition \u2013 required players to think of how plants interacted with each other.<ref name=\"gamezebo\" /><ref name=\"edge\"/> Another favorite plant of Fan's was the Squash, due to how its name suggested its purpose; to squash things.<ref name=\"gamearena\">{{cite web|title=GameArena Interviews George Fan, Plants vs Zombies Man |url=http://www.gamearena.com.au/news/read.php/4948392?latest=1 |website=www.gamearena.com.au |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=June 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001123643/http://www.gamearena.com.au/news/read.php/4948392?latest=1 |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> A plant was proposed that is similar to the defensive item Umbrella Leaf, which would be planted above other plants to protect them from bungee zombies and catapult zombies. However, it was difficult to visualize their positions.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\n===Cultural references===\n''Plants vs. Zombies'' uses many cultural references in its names of stages and others. The gravestones' inscriptions (\"Expired\", \"Ceased to Exist\", \"Just Resting\", etc.) were taken from [[Monty Python]]'s \"[[Dead Parrot sketch]]\". Three of the mini-games\u2014\"Zombiquarium\", \"Beghouled\" and \"Beghouled Twist\"\u2014take their names from two other PopCap games: ''[[Insaniquarium]]'', ''[[Bejeweled]]'' and ''[[Bejeweled Twist]]'' respectively.<ref name=\"edge\"/><ref name=\"1up\"/> Two levels in \"vasebreaker\" puzzles, \"Scary Potter\" and \"Ace of Vase\", take their names from ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and [[Ace of Base]]. Similarly, the \"I, Zombie\" (a reference to Isaac Asimov's \"[[I, Robot]]\") puzzles have levels called \"Dead Zeppelin\" (resembling [[Led Zeppelin]]) and \"All your brainz r belong to us\" (a play on the gaming meme \"[[All your base are belong to us]]\"). The name of the Torchwood plant is a reference to ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its spin-off show ''[[Torchwood]].''

He is later abducted by a Bungee Zombie on level 5\u201310 right before he can tell the player Dr. Zomboss' weaknesses, and reappears during Sunflower's rendition of \"Zombies on your Lawn\" after Dr. Zomboss's defeat at the end of the game. He has a shop known as \"Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies\" that he runs from the back of his car once he finds his car keys after Level 3\u20134. He sells several plant upgrades, extra defenses, and Zen Garden items. Crazy Dave's notable features include a rugged beard and a pot always worn on his head, as well as his signature babbling speech.\n\n===Dr. Zomboss===\n'''Dr. Edgar George Zomboss''' is the main antagonist and the leader of the zombies in ''Plants vs. Zombies'', and reappears in the sequel, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time]]''. He is battled on the Night Roof during Level 5\u201310 as the final boss in ''Plants vs. Zombies''. The name \"Zomboss\" is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Boss\", meaning \"Zombie Boss\", while the Zombot, the machine used by Dr. Zomboss in the game, is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Robot\", meaning \"Zombie Robot\". His middle name, George, is after the name of the game's creator, [[George Fan]].\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Edgar Zomboss.png|thumb|235px|left|Dr. Zomboss' ''Suburban Almanac'' Entry]] -->\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack for ''Plants vs. Zombies'' was composed by [[Laura Shigihara]]. It borrows elements from the pop music genre, as well as console [[chiptune]]s. Before the inception of ''Plants vs. Zombies'', Director George Fan asked Laura if she would like to compose the music for his next title after following her for some years. She accepted, owing to his creativity. Shigihara described the music as \"macabre, yet goofy\". Using the night stage as an example, she used a combination of \"Big Band\" and swing beats with \"several haunting and serious melodies\". The songs  \"Loonboon\" and \"Brainiac Maniac\" were written towards the end of production. The song \"Ultimate Battle\" also appears in the game Melolune. She stated that these were reactionary songs that she wrote to fit the feel of the game after having played through it twice. She tried to make the game have a [[Danny Elfman]] feel to it, while mixing in melodic tunes and funky beats. She describes a song early in the game, which uses marching band percussion and swing beats. She described another one which used techno beats with organic sounds.<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web|title=Interview: The Terrifying True Story of The Plants vs. Zombies Soundtrack |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/news/originals/?story=23666 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 19, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110102040/http://www.gamasutra.com/news/originals/?story=23666 |archivedate=November 10, 2009 }}</ref>\nShigihara also composed and performed the music video shown during the credits of the game, titled \"Zombies on Your Lawn\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Laura Shigihara \u2013 Lyrics |url=http://shigi.wordpress.com/lyrics/#Zombies%20on%20your%20Lawn |publisher=Laura Shigihara |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901114852/http://shigi.wordpress.com/lyrics/ |archivedate=September 1, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Plants vs Zombies Music Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ |publisher=PlantsVsZombies channel ([[PopCap Games]]) |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707075923/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ |archivedate=July 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = PC: 88%<ref name=\"GRPC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/pc/959255-plants-vs-zombies/index.html |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PC |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309124318/http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/959255-plants-vs-zombies/index.html |archivedate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>\n| MC = PC: 87/100<ref name=\"MCPC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226133832/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies |archivedate=December 26, 2017}}</ref><br />iOS: 92/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />(iPad) iOS: 93/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/plants-vs-zombies-hd |title=Plants vs. Zombies HD for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />X360: 89/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for Xbox 360 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />DS: 81/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />PS3: 85/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PlayStation 3 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />(DSiWare) DS: 73/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/plants-vs-zombies-dsiware |title=Plants vs. Zombies (DSiWare) for DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />PSVita: 77/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PlayStation Vita Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n| 1UP = A\u2212<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3174094&p=1 |title=Plants vs Zombies Review for the PC from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref>\n| Destruct =  10/10\n| Edge = 9/10\n| EuroG = 9/10\n| GamePro = {{Rating|4.5|5}}\n| GSpot = 8.5/10\n| IGN = 9.0/10<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web|last=Hatfield |first=Daemon |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/979/979621p1.html |title=Plants vs. Zombies Review \u2013 PC Review at IGN |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date=May 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611154544/http://pc.ign.com/articles/979/979621p1.html |archivedate=June 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n| PCGUK = 90%\n| rev1 = ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''\n| rev1Score = 9/10\n| rev2 = ''[[Gamezebo]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}\n| rev3 = ''[[TouchArcade]]''\n| rev3Score = iOS: {{rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://toucharcade.com/2010/02/14/plants-vs-zombies-the-zombies-are-coming/ |title='Plants vs. Zombies' \u2013 The Zombies...

/>\n}}\n\n'''''Plants vs. Zombies''''' is a [[tower defense]] and [[strategy]] [[video game]] developed and originally published by [[PopCap Games]] for [[Windows]] and [[OS X]] in May 2009, and ported to consoles, handhelds, and mobile devices, and in remastered versions for personal computers.\n\nIn ''Plants vs. Zombies'', the player takes the role of a homeowner in the midst of a [[zombie apocalypse]]. To defend their home from zombies, some of which have unique abilities, the player uses plants that can fire projectiles at, or have other detrimental effects on, the horde of advancing zombies. The player collects \"sun\" with which defending plants can be bought. Zombies approach along several parallel lanes on the lawn, and the player must plan defenses in these lanes. If a zombie makes it to the house on any lane, the game is over. \n\nDirector George Fan was inspired to make the game after playing other tower defense titles and desiring to eliminate the typical strategies of sending advancing enemies through mazes of defenses, instead adapting the lane approach to remove this strategy.\n\nThe game received critical acclaim and was nominated for multiple [[Interactive Achievement Award]]s, alongside receiving praise for its musical score. It was followed by one direct sequel and another made for mobile devices, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time]],'' released in 2013 for iOS and Android, and Plants vs. Zombies 3 respectively; two third-person shooters, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare]]'' and [[Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2|its sequel]], and a digital collectible card game, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies Heroes]]''. On October 18, 2019, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville]]'' was also released. On February 25, 2020, Plants vs. Zombies 3 was soft-launched.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Plants vs Zombies Gameplay.png|thumb|200px|left|Game in progress]]\n\nIn ''Plants vs. Zombies'', players place different types of plants and fungi, each with their own unique offensive or defensive capabilities, around their house, in order to stop a horde of [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]] from reaching it. The playing field is divided into 5 to 6 horizontal lanes, each with lawnmowers, and with rare exceptions, a zombie will move towards the player's house along one lane only (the main exception is if it has bitten garlic, causing it to move to another lane). Planting costs \"sun\", which can be gathered for free (albeit slowly) during daytime levels and by planting certain plants or fungi. Most plants can attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in only. In later levels, players can purchase upgrades with different offensive and defensive abilities.\n\nThe game uses several different level types and layouts, each with their own gimmick. The game starts out in a front yard (the standard) and progresses to nighttime levels (sun won't be able to be gathered for free), where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added (in general more to cost). Later levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (where a slanted roof renders most offensive plants useless). On the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a zombie who takes the form of a mad scientist known as [[#Dr. Zomboss|Dr. Zomboss]]. At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by their neighbor, [[#Crazy Dave|Crazy Dave]], to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come upon a conveyor belt, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.\n\nThe player starts with a limited number of seed pack types and seed pack slots that they can use during most levels. The number of slots can be increased through purchases with in-game money. At the start of a level, the player is shown the various types of zombies to expect and given the opportunity to select which seed packs to take into the level. Several plants are nocturnal, such as mushrooms, have a lower sunlight cost, and are ideal for nighttime levels. Certain plants are highly effective against specific types of zombies, such as the Magnet-shroom, which can remove metallic items from a zombie, such as helmets, buckets, ladders, and pogo sticks. Plants may be placed on any available square of lawn, on lily pads floating in a pool, or in flowerpots on a rooftop; these last two items may be chosen as a seed pack for their respective level types and deployed to increase the usable planting space.\n\nThe zombies also come in a number of types that have different attributes, in particular, speed, damage tolerance, and abilities. Zombies include those wearing makeshift armor, those who can jump or fly over plants, and a dancing zombie able to summon other zombies from the ground. At various points, the player will be inundated with a huge wave of zombies.\n\nIf a zombie reaches the end of a lane, a lawnmower will shoot forward and destroy all the zombies in that lane. However, if a zombie reaches the end of that same lane for a second time, it will reach the player's house. When this happens, the music changes and the other plants and zombies stop moving while that zombie enters the house. Crunching sounds will be heard, accompanied by a scream and a message saying \"The zombies ate your brains!\". The game will then end and display the [[Game over|Game Over]] dialog box along with an option to retry the level or return to the main menu at the upper-right side of the screen.\n\n===Game modes===\nThe primary game mode is Adventure Mode in which the player can earn money to spend at an in-game store to buy new seed packets and other bonuses. There are also mini-games and puzzles. In the [[Xbox Live Arcade]], [[PlayStation Network]], and [[Nintendo DS]] versions, there is also a co-op mode, as well as 2 player mini-games and a Versus mode (only Versus mode in the Nintendo DS version & Xbox Live Arcade).\n\n==== Adventure mode ====\nThe adventure mode consists of 5 different areas and 50 different area levels (each area contains 10 levels). They are shown with the area number first, followed by the level number (i.e. 1-10) in the game. Each level in this model has a certain amount of flags and one final wave. The adventure mode is the first game mode and is also the main mode. Mini-games are unlocked from here. Every 5th level will be a mini-game, while the 10th level will be a conveyor level.\n\nWhen and if the player plays through it a second time, Crazy Dave will pick 3 random seeds that the player must use based on the zombies and area they are in every level, this is, of course, optional but it can assist the player in getting more of the in-game currency.\n\n==== Mini games ====\n\nMini-games are unlocked during the adventure mode and are mostly for fun. Some of the minigames are inspired by earlier [[PopCap Games|PopCap]] games.\n\n==== Puzzles ====\n\nPuzzles consist of 18 levels from 2 different \"modes\", Vasebreaker, where you break vases that either contains a plant seed or a zombie, and I, Zombie, where you create zombies to destroy cardboard cutouts of plants. On iOS and Android versions, there's also a third mode called Last Stand that similar to the level with the same name from the Mini-Game Mode but with different zombies in each wave.\n\n==== Survival ====\n\nSurvival is the second-largest game mode in ''Plants vs Zombies''. It involves two difficulties as hard and normal and also has different areas. Each normal round has 5 flags and each hard round has 10 flags. It also has an endless streak level as the final level. Survival is the last game mode in the game itself.\n\nThere is also a page of canceled mini-games called the Limbo Page which can be accessed using the Cheat Engine.\n\n==== Zen Garden ====\nThe game also features a [[Japanese rock garden|Zen Garden]], where players can care for plants they previously purchased from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies or occasionally dropped by zombies. Players can also buy other Zen Garden areas for different plants. Fertilizer, water, and bug spray are necessary for a plant to grow. Plants will grow only when the game has been running for enough time.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n''Plants vs. Zombies'' director George Fan intended on balancing the game between a \"gritty\" game and a \"sickeningly cute\" game. Strong strategic elements were included to appeal to more experienced gamers, while keeping it simple to appeal to casual gamers, without needing too many tutorials. He was inspired to make it a [[tower defense]] game after both thinking of a more defense-oriented version of a previous title of his, ''[[Insaniquarium]]'', and playing some ''[[Warcraft III]]'' tower defense [[mod (video gaming)|mods]].<ref name=\"ars dev\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/george-fan-how-insaniquarium-2-became-plants-vs-zombies.ars |title=Aliens in the garden: the secret origin of Plants vs. Zombies |first=Michael |last=Thompson |date=March 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 20, 2010 |publisher=Ars Technica |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322191116/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/george-fan-how-insaniquarium-2-became-plants-vs-zombies.ars |archivedate=March 22, 2010 }}</ref> While he was looking at the towers in ''Warcraft III'', he felt that plants would make good towers.

Showing her how to customize their card decks inspired him to design Plants vs Zombies with seed packets rather than his original idea of using a conveyor belt that produced randomly selected plants, due to the greater complexity of the seed packet method. While the conveyor belt idea was dropped from the more common game mode, it remained as a special element in select levels.<ref name=\"gamasutra fan 10th\"/> Another influence on ''Plants vs. Zombies'' besides ''Warcraft III'' and ''Insaniquarium'' was ''[[Tapper (arcade game)|Tapper]]'', crediting the use of five lanes to this game.<ref name=\"gamezebo\"/><ref name=\"edge\">{{cite web|title=Flower Defence |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/flower-defence |publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821190932/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/flower-defence |archivedate=August 21, 2010 }}</ref> Various members of [[PopCap Games]] contributed to the development of ''Plants vs. Zombies'' through an internal forum where they gave feedback.\n\nSome of the characteristics that defined ''Insaniquarium'' influenced the development of ''Plants vs. Zombies''. Players advance in a similar pace by receiving new plants. Also, the way plants are chosen at the beginning of each level was derived from the way pets are chosen in ''Insaniquarium''.<ref name=\"gamezebo\" /> Other inspiration for the game's mechanics came from the film ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'', especially where the family defends against pirates. This was the inspiration for the Potato Mine; Fan stated that it was satisfying to watch a zombie step on the mine, being defeated and covered in mashed potatoes.<ref name=hobbit>{{cite web|title=Game Industry Insider: George Fan |url=http://hobbithollow.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-industry-insider-george-fan.html |website=hobbithollow.blogspot.com |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090732/http://hobbithollow.blogspot.com/2009/05/game-industry-insider-george-fan.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nThe team wanted to bring back the aliens from ''Insaniquarium'', but in the end they were changed to zombies, which players could react to more easily because of how slowly they moved. George's favorite zombie was the Pole Vaulting Zombie, due to the hilarity involved when a player encounters it for the first time, using a specific example where a player tries to block it with the Wall-Nut, only to have the zombie jump over it.<ref name=\"gamezebo\"/><ref name=\"edge\"/><ref name=gamearena/>\n\nDuring development, it was discovered that newcomers to the genre of real-time strategy may have a hard time learning the concept behind sun collection. So, the price of the income generating sunflowers was dropped from 100 to 50 to encourage players to buy them over the attacking peashooter. As a result, the balance between plants and zombies had to be restructured\u2014a move that Fan said was definitely worth the effort.<ref name=gamezebo/> Programmers focused on Adventure mode for much of the first year of development. Upon finishing some items ahead of schedule, one of the programmers, Tod Semple, began working on ideas that would later be used for the [[minigame]] section. Some ideas for the puzzle mode section would later be tweaked and moved into adventure mode; \"Vasebreaker\" and \"I, Zombie\", for example, came from single-level minigame concepts. During testing, Fan found that minigame and puzzle modes seemed to detract from the focus on Adventure mode, so some of the additional modes and minigames were locked requiring advancement within adventure mode to become unlocked.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\nFan stated that every game he worked on had only him designing the prototype, adding that he used to draw a lot before he made games, where he made pixel art. The final designs of the zombies and the first plants are similar to how they were initially. After searching for an artist, they discovered Rich Werner, who Fan thought clicked with what he intended for the design. He attributed the intrigue of the design to its animation scheme; Tod Semple suggested that they animate it in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and export it into the game. Fan worried that this would look like it was cut out from paper, and would resemble ''[[South Park]]'' too much, but was satisfied in the end, attributing this to Semple and Werner's talents.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\nFan was most proud of the Tall-nut, Torchwood, and Cob Cannon plants. He explained that the Tall-nut has character, citing its \"determined gaze\" and how it sheds a single tear when hurt. Laura Shigihara could not stand to see this and protected it with a protective plant called a Pumpkin, which can protect plants inside it. He felt that the Torchwood \u2013 which gives Peashooters flaming ammunition \u2013 required players to think of how plants interacted with each other.<ref name=\"gamezebo\" /><ref name=\"edge\"/> Another favorite plant of Fan's was the Squash, due to how its name suggested its purpose; to squash things.<ref name=\"gamearena\">{{cite web|title=GameArena Interviews George Fan, Plants vs Zombies Man |url=http://www.gamearena.com.au/news/read.php/4948392?latest=1 |website=www.gamearena.com.au |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=June 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001123643/http://www.gamearena.com.au/news/read.php/4948392?latest=1 |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> A plant was proposed that is similar to the defensive item Umbrella Leaf, which would be planted above other plants to protect them from bungee zombies and catapult zombies. However, it was difficult to visualize their positions.<ref name=\"edge\"/>\n\n===Cultural references===\n''Plants vs. Zombies'' uses many cultural references in its names of stages and others. The gravestones' inscriptions (\"Expired\", \"Ceased to Exist\", \"Just Resting\", etc.) were taken from [[Monty Python]]'s \"[[Dead Parrot sketch]]\". Three of the mini-games\u2014\"Zombiquarium\", \"Beghouled\" and \"Beghouled Twist\"\u2014take their names from two other PopCap games: ''[[Insaniquarium]]'', ''[[Bejeweled]]'' and ''[[Bejeweled Twist]]'' respectively.<ref name=\"edge\"/><ref name=\"1up\"/> Two levels in \"vasebreaker\" puzzles, \"Scary Potter\" and \"Ace of Vase\", take their names from ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and [[Ace of Base]]. Similarly, the \"I, Zombie\" (a reference to Isaac Asimov's \"[[I, Robot]]\") puzzles have levels called \"Dead Zeppelin\" (resembling [[Led Zeppelin]]) and \"All your brainz r belong to us\" (a play on the gaming meme \"[[All your base are belong to us]]\"). The name of the Torchwood plant is a reference to ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its spin-off show ''[[Torchwood]].'' Originally, the dancing zombie resembled [[Michael Jackson]] from the short film \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Masterful Plants vs. Zombies Proves Less Is More |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/05/plants-vs-zombies/ |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905150515/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/05/plants-vs-zombies |archivedate=September 5, 2009 }}</ref> Though the Jackson-inspired zombie was present in the game before Jackson's death, the estate of Michael Jackson objected to its inclusion more than a year after his death; PopCap agreed to remove the Jackson-inspired zombie and replaced it with a more generic [[disco]]-dancing one for all future patches and releases of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2010/07/27/michael-jackson-estate-forces-plants-vs-zombies-update/ |title=Michael Jackson Estate Forces 'Plants vs. Zombies' Update |first=Russ |last=Frustick |date=July 27, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |work=[[MTV]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728105628/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2010/07/27/michael-jackson-estate-forces-plants-vs-zombies-update/ |archivedate=July 28, 2010 }}</ref>  A \"disclaimer\" in the game's almanac states \"Any resemblance between Dancing Zombie and any persons living or dead is purely coincidental.\" Some ''Plants vs. Zombies'' advertisements parody controversial ''[[Evony]]'' ads, showing a drooling zombie instead of a voluptuous woman.<ref name=\"escapist\">[http://www.offworld.com/2009/07/evony-agony-popcaps-plants-vs.html \"Plants vs. Zombies Pokes Fun At Cleavage-Filled Evony Ads\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801095310/http://www.offworld.com/2009/07/evony-agony-popcaps-plants-vs.html |date=August 1, 2009 }}, [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]], July 30, 2009</ref>\n\nA planned name was ''Lawn of the Dead'', a pun on the title of the [[George A.

He is later abducted by a Bungee Zombie on level 5\u201310 right before he can tell the player Dr. Zomboss' weaknesses, and reappears during Sunflower's rendition of \"Zombies on your Lawn\" after Dr. Zomboss's defeat at the end of the game. He has a shop known as \"Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies\" that he runs from the back of his car once he finds his car keys after Level 3\u20134. He sells several plant upgrades, extra defenses, and Zen Garden items. Crazy Dave's notable features include a rugged beard and a pot always worn on his head, as well as his signature babbling speech.\n\n===Dr. Zomboss===\n'''Dr. Edgar George Zomboss''' is the main antagonist and the leader of the zombies in ''Plants vs. Zombies'', and reappears in the sequel, ''[[Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time]]''. He is battled on the Night Roof during Level 5\u201310 as the final boss in ''Plants vs. Zombies''. The name \"Zomboss\" is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Boss\", meaning \"Zombie Boss\", while the Zombot, the machine used by Dr. Zomboss in the game, is a portmanteau of the words \"Zombie\" and \"Robot\", meaning \"Zombie Robot\". His middle name, George, is after the name of the game's creator, [[George Fan]].\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Edgar Zomboss.png|thumb|235px|left|Dr. Zomboss' ''Suburban Almanac'' Entry]] -->\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack for ''Plants vs. Zombies'' was composed by [[Laura Shigihara]]. It borrows elements from the pop music genre, as well as console [[chiptune]]s. Before the inception of ''Plants vs. Zombies'', Director George Fan asked Laura if she would like to compose the music for his next title after following her for some years. She accepted, owing to his creativity. Shigihara described the music as \"macabre, yet goofy\". Using the night stage as an example, she used a combination of \"Big Band\" and swing beats with \"several haunting and serious melodies\". The songs  \"Loonboon\" and \"Brainiac Maniac\" were written towards the end of production. The song \"Ultimate Battle\" also appears in the game Melolune. She stated that these were reactionary songs that she wrote to fit the feel of the game after having played through it twice. She tried to make the game have a [[Danny Elfman]] feel to it, while mixing in melodic tunes and funky beats. She describes a song early in the game, which uses marching band percussion and swing beats. She described another one which used techno beats with organic sounds.<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web|title=Interview: The Terrifying True Story of The Plants vs. Zombies Soundtrack |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/news/originals/?story=23666 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |date=May 19, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110102040/http://www.gamasutra.com/news/originals/?story=23666 |archivedate=November 10, 2009 }}</ref>\nShigihara also composed and performed the music video shown during the credits of the game, titled \"Zombies on Your Lawn\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Laura Shigihara \u2013 Lyrics |url=http://shigi.wordpress.com/lyrics/#Zombies%20on%20your%20Lawn |publisher=Laura Shigihara |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901114852/http://shigi.wordpress.com/lyrics/ |archivedate=September 1, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Plants vs Zombies Music Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ |publisher=PlantsVsZombies channel ([[PopCap Games]]) |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707075923/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ |archivedate=July 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = PC: 88%<ref name=\"GRPC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/pc/959255-plants-vs-zombies/index.html |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PC |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309124318/http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/959255-plants-vs-zombies/index.html |archivedate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>\n| MC = PC: 87/100<ref name=\"MCPC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226133832/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies |archivedate=December 26, 2017}}</ref><br />iOS: 92/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />(iPad) iOS: 93/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/plants-vs-zombies-hd |title=Plants vs. Zombies HD for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />X360: 89/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for Xbox 360 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />DS: 81/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />PS3: 85/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PlayStation 3 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />(DSiWare) DS: 73/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/plants-vs-zombies-dsiware |title=Plants vs. Zombies (DSiWare) for DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><br />PSVita: 77/100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/plants-vs-zombies |title=Plants vs. Zombies for PlayStation Vita Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n| 1UP = A\u2212<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3174094&p=1 |title=Plants vs Zombies Review for the PC from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref>\n| Destruct =  10/10\n| Edge = 9/10\n| EuroG = 9/10\n| GamePro = {{Rating|4.5|5}}\n| GSpot = 8.5/10\n| IGN = 9.0/10<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web|last=Hatfield |first=Daemon |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/979/979621p1.html |title=Plants vs. Zombies Review \u2013 PC Review at IGN |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date=May 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611154544/http://pc.ign.com/articles/979/979621p1.html |archivedate=June 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n| PCGUK = 90%\n| rev1 = ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''\n| rev1Score = 9/10\n| rev2 = ''[[Gamezebo]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}\n| rev3 = ''[[TouchArcade]]''\n| rev3Score = iOS: {{rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://toucharcade.com/2010/02/14/plants-vs-zombies-the-zombies-are-coming/ |title='Plants vs. Zombies' \u2013 The Zombies...
