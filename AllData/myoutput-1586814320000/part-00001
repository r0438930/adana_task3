Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.\n\nOne way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].\n\nThough using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.\n\n==Goals==\n\nThe scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:\n\n* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)\n* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)\n* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.\n\nThe accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.\n\n==Types of surrogate models==\n\nPopular surrogate modeling approaches are: polynomial [[response surface]]s; [[kriging]]; [[gradient-enhanced kriging]] (GEK); [[radial basis function]]; [[support vector machine]]s; [[space mapping]] <ref name=\"space mapping\">J.W.
