Later in 1218, a German army led by [[Oliver of Paderborn]], and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] under [[Kaykaus I]] and attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.\n\nAfter occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. On the way, they laid siege to [[Aswan]] from the north side, but were turned back after they were trapped and their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat. Sultan [[al-Kamil]] ordered the destruction of the dam blocking the Nile River which lead to the flooding of the Crusader camp. They retreated to a nearby hilltop where they resisted to the point of starvation. The siege resulted in a great number of Crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army. Al-Kamil forced Europe to retreat from Damietta - and Egypt altogether - and to an eight-year peace agreement.\n\n==Preparations==\n[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'', calling all of Christendom to join a new [[crusade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Thomas W.|date=2019|title=How to craft a crusade call: Pope Innocent III and Quia maior (1213)|journal=Historical Research|language=en|volume=92|issue=255|pages=2\u201323|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12258|issn=1468-2281}}</ref> This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.<ref name=\"cf\">{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman| authorlink = Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02387-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer }}</ref>\n\n===France===\nThe message of the crusade was preached in France by [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.\n\nIn 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.\n\n===Hungary and Germany===\n[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew was estimated to have the largest royal army in the history of the crusades. (Stated strengths of 20,000 knights, 12,000 castle-garrisons and 200,000 foot soldiers were likely an exaggeration).<ref>Wolff, Robert L. and Hazard, H. W., ''A History of the Crusades: Volume Two, The Later Crusades 1187-1311'', The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, 1977, pg. 389</ref>\n\n===Portugal===\nAccording to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts [[William I of Holland]] and [[George of Weid]] they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217-1218\", ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History'' 15 (2019)</ref>\nAt their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the [[Almohad]] controlled city of [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]]. The [[Frisians]] according to ''[[De itinere frisonum]],'' however, refused on account of [[Innocent III]]'s disqualification of the venture at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref> The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]] with the help of the [[Military order (religious society)|military orders]] on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of [[Seville]], [[Badajoz]], and [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]] to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nPope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]] in 1222.  After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>\n\nDecades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|left|180px|King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]\n\n===Holy Land===\nThe first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|\u00c9rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147\u2013148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. They landed on 9 October on [[Cyprus]] from where they sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and joined [[John of Brienne]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Hugh I of Cyprus]], and Prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]] to fight against the [[Ayyubids]] in [[Syria]]. Until his return to Hungary, King Andrew remained the leader of Christian forces in the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Thomas Keightley, Dionysius Lardner: ''Outlines of history: from the earliest period to the present time'' (page 210)</ref> In October 1217, the leaders of the crusaders - Masters of Hospitallers, Templars and Teutonic knights with the leaders and dignitaries of the crusade - held a war council in Acre, over which King Andrew II presided.<ref>Kenneth M.

Hazard: ''A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East'' (page 358)</ref>\n\nKing Andrew's well-mounted army defeated sultan [[Al-Adil I]] at [[Bethsaida]] on the [[Jordan River]] on 10 November 1217. Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics. At the beginning of 1218 Andrew, who was very sick, decided to return to Hungary.<ref>(Jean Richard: ''The Crusades'', c 1071-c. 1291) page 298.</ref><ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title= The Crusades: A History of One of the Most Epic Military Campaigns of All Time |author= Jonathan Howard |year= 2011 |publisher= BookCaps Study Guides [for Kindle; Golgotha Press for paperback] |page= |isbn= 9781610428040 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWEUg5pMqJYC&pg=PT22 |access-date=12 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAndrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, and Bohemund and Hugh also returned home.<ref name=Howard/>\n\n===Alliance with the Sultanate of Rum===\nLater in 1218 Oliver of Cologne arrived with a new German army and the count of Holland [[William I, Count of Holland|William I]] arrived with a mixed army consisting of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers. With Leopold and John they discussed attacking [[Damietta]] in Egypt. To accomplish this, they allied with [[Kaykaus I]], Seljuq Sultan of R\u00fbm in [[Anatolia]], who attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RAbaJ3EbWjUC&pg=PR11&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title=The 14th and Final Crusade to the Middle East: Crusades from the 11th Century to the 21st Century |last1=Conte |first1=Joseph J. |website=[[Google Books]] |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn=9781452055466 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bWQFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT203&dq=kaykaus+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=kaykaus%20fifth%20crusade&f=false |title= A Clash of Thrones: The Power-crazed Medieval Kings, Popes and Emperors of Europe |last1=Rawson|first1=Andrew |website=[[Google Books]] |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9780750966788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UCblDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT301&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title= Afghanistan's Experiences: The History of the Most Horrifying Events Involving Politics, Religion, and Terrorism |last1=Hadi |first1=Hamdi |website=[[Google Books]] |date=31 March 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9781524600068 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tKSjW-j2G1YC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=sultanate+of+rum+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=sultanate%20of%20rum%20fifth%20crusade&f=false\n |title= Franks and Saracens: Reality and Fantasy in the Crusades and Terrorism |last1=Avner |first1=Falk|website=[[Google Books]] |date=2010 |accessdate=31 August 2016|isbn= 9781855757332 }}</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nIn July 1218 the crusaders began their [[Siege of Damietta (1218\u201319)|siege of Damietta]], and despite resistance from the unprepared sultan [[Al-Adil]], the tower outside the city was taken on August 25. They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.\n\nImmediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. \n\nThen in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.\n\nBy now al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Kaykaus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.\n\nThe failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.\n\n==Impact on literature==\nThe ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] under [[Kaykaus I]] and attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.\n\nAfter occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. On the way, they laid siege to [[Aswan]] from the north side, but were turned back after they were trapped and their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat. Sultan [[al-Kamil]] ordered the destruction of the dam blocking the Nile River which lead to the flooding of the Crusader camp. They retreated to a nearby hilltop where they resisted to the point of starvation. The siege resulted in a great number of Crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army. Al-Kamil forced Europe to retreat from Damietta - and Egypt altogether - and to an eight-year peace agreement.\n\n==Preparations==\n[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'', calling all of Christendom to join a new [[crusade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Thomas W.|date=2019|title=How to craft a crusade call: Pope Innocent III and Quia maior (1213)|journal=Historical Research|language=en|volume=92|issue=255|pages=2\u201323|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12258|issn=1468-2281}}</ref> This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.<ref name=\"cf\">{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman| authorlink = Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02387-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer }}</ref>\n\n===France===\nThe message of the crusade was preached in France by [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.\n\nIn 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.\n\n===Hungary and Germany===\n[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew was estimated to have the largest royal army in the history of the crusades. (Stated strengths of 20,000 knights, 12,000 castle-garrisons and 200,000 foot soldiers were likely an exaggeration).<ref>Wolff, Robert L. and Hazard, H. W., ''A History of the Crusades: Volume Two, The Later Crusades 1187-1311'', The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, 1977, pg. 389</ref>\n\n===Portugal===\nAccording to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts [[William I of Holland]] and [[George of Weid]] they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217-1218\", ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History'' 15 (2019)</ref>\nAt their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the [[Almohad]] controlled city of [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]]. The [[Frisians]] according to ''[[De itinere frisonum]],'' however, refused on account of [[Innocent III]]'s disqualification of the venture at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref> The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]] with the help of the [[Military order (religious society)|military orders]] on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of [[Seville]], [[Badajoz]], and [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]] to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nPope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]] in 1222.  After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>\n\nDecades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|left|180px|King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]\n\n===Holy Land===\nThe first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|\u00c9rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147\u2013148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. They landed on 9 October on [[Cyprus]] from where they sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and joined [[John of Brienne]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Hugh I of Cyprus]], and Prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]] to fight against the [[Ayyubids]] in [[Syria]]. Until his return to Hungary, King Andrew remained the leader of Christian forces in the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Thomas Keightley, Dionysius Lardner: ''Outlines of history: from the earliest period to the present time'' (page 210)</ref> In October 1217, the leaders of the crusaders - Masters of Hospitallers, Templars and Teutonic knights with the leaders and dignitaries of the crusade - held a war council in Acre, over which King Andrew II presided.<ref>Kenneth M. Setton, Norman P. Zacour, Harry W. Hazard: ''A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East'' (page 358)</ref>\n\nKing Andrew's well-mounted army defeated sultan [[Al-Adil I]] at [[Bethsaida]] on the [[Jordan River]] on 10 November 1217. Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics. At the beginning of 1218 Andrew, who was very sick, decided to return to Hungary.<ref>(Jean Richard: ''The Crusades'', c 1071-c. 1291) page 298.</ref><ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title= The Crusades: A History of One of the Most Epic Military Campaigns of All Time |author= Jonathan Howard |year= 2011 |publisher= BookCaps Study Guides [for Kindle; Golgotha Press for paperback] |page= |isbn= 9781610428040 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWEUg5pMqJYC&pg=PT22 |access-date=12 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAndrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, and Bohemund and Hugh also returned home.<ref name=Howard/>\n\n===Alliance with the Sultanate of Rum===\nLater in 1218 Oliver of Cologne arrived with a new German army and the count of Holland [[William I, Count of Holland|William I]] arrived with a mixed army consisting of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers. With Leopold and John they discussed attacking [[Damietta]] in Egypt. To accomplish this, they allied with [[Keykavus I]], Seljuq Sultan of Rum in [[Anatolia]], who attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RAbaJ3EbWjUC&pg=PR11&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title=The 14th and Final Crusade to the Middle East: Crusades from the 11th Century to the 21st Century |last1=Conte |first1=Joseph J. |website=[[Google Books]] |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn=9781452055466 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bWQFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT203&dq=kaykaus+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=kaykaus%20fifth%20crusade&f=false |title= A Clash of Thrones: The Power-crazed Medieval Kings, Popes and Emperors of Europe |last1=Rawson|first1=Andrew |website=[[Google Books]] |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9780750966788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UCblDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT301&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title= Afghanistan's Experiences: The History of the Most Horrifying Events Involving Politics, Religion, and Terrorism |last1=Hadi |first1=Hamdi |website=[[Google Books]] |date=31 March 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9781524600068 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tKSjW-j2G1YC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=sultanate+of+rum+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=sultanate%20of%20rum%20fifth%20crusade&f=false\n |title= Franks and Saracens: Reality and Fantasy in the Crusades and Terrorism |last1=Avner |first1=Falk|website=[[Google Books]] |date=2010 |accessdate=31 August 2016|isbn= 9781855757332 }}</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nIn July 1218 the crusaders began their [[Siege of Damietta (1218\u201319)|siege of Damietta]], and despite resistance from the unprepared sultan [[Al-Adil]], the tower outside the city was taken on August 25. They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to Al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.\n\nImmediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. \n\nThen in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of Al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.\n\nBy now Al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Keykavus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to Al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.\n\nThe failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.\n\n==Impact on literature==\nThe ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.
