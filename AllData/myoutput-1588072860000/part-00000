His mother died from childbirth complications ten days after his birth, on 19 November 1602.\n\n==Life==\nSince his early years, Frederick William's education was entrusted to the Silesian humanist [[Baltzar Exner]]. In 1611 Duke Adam Wenceslaus decided to convert to the [[Catholicism]], and all the Protestant members of his court were dismissed, among them also Exner. Frederick William was then sent to the [[Jesuit]]s in [[Munich]].\n\nOn 13 July 1617 Duke Adam Wenceslaus died and was succeeded by Frederick William. Despite this, the young Duke remained in Munich until 1624. On his behalf, the authority over the Duchy was exercised by a Regency council, which included [[Charles of Habsburg, Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw|Archduke Charles of Habsburg]], [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Karl of Liechtenstein]], Duke of [[Opava]] and [[Krnov]] and [[George of Oppersdorf]], Starost of [[Opole]]-[[Racib\u00f3rz]]. However, the real power in Cieszyn was held by the Duke's sister, [[Elizabeth Lucretia, Duchess of Cieszyn|Elizabeth Lucretia]].\n\nDuring the 1620s a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] infected Cieszyn and many citizens died. The Duchy was also affected by the [[Thirty Years' War]] and plundered by various forces. In 1620 [[Skocz\u00f3w]] was destroyed by the [[Lisowczycy]] troops, who recognized Protestant inhabitants of this city as their enemies. In 1621, Cieszyn was severely destroyed by the Imperial troops stationed here under the command of Colonel Charles Spinelli. Finally, in 1622 Cieszyn was the battlefield in the fight between the Protestants troops of [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg]], and the Catholics forces led by [[Charles Hannibal of Dohna]].\n\nIn religious sphere he was tolerant and avoided restrictions towards both [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]].<ref>Panic 2002, 33.</ref>\n\nThe beginning of Frederick William's independent rule in 1624 didn't bring any relief to the Duchy; moreover, soon afterwards (in early 1625), he left Cieszyn and went to serve the Emperor in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], where he obtained the post of military Commander of the district. During this journey, the Duke became suddenly ill and died on 19 August 1625 in [[Cologne]]. Frederick Wilhelm was buried in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church in [[Cieszyn]].\n\nFrederick William never married, and only left an illegitimate daughter, ''Maria Magdalena'' (b. {{circa|1624}} - d. {{circa|1661}}), who was legitimized by [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand III]] and created ''Baroness of Hohenstein'' by Imperial order at [[Vienna]] on 8 May 1640.
