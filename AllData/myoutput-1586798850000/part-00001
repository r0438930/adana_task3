She has written over 20 books, including ''Sex and Destiny'' (1984), ''The Change'' (1991), ''The Whole Woman'' (1999), and ''Shakespeare's Wife'' (2007). Her 2013 book, ''[[White Beech: The Rainforest Years]]'', describes her efforts to restore an area of [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia|rainforest]] in the [[Numinbah Valley]] in Australia. In addition to her academic work and activism, she has been a prolific columnist for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'', and ''[[The Oldie]]'', among others.<ref name=Buchanan7Jan2018/>\n\nGreer is a [[Women's liberation movement|liberation]] (or [[Radical feminism|radical]]) rather than [[Equality feminism|equality feminist]].{{efn|Germaine Greer, \"All About Women\" (2015): \"I've always been a liberation feminist. I'm not an equality feminist. I think that's a profoundly conservative aim, and it wouldn't change anything. It would just mean that women were implicated.\"<ref>\"How to be a feminist\", All About Women festival, Sydney Opera House, 8 March 2015, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzcs4ti_bdI&t=1h6m4s 01:06:04].</ref>}} Her goal is not equality with men, which she sees as assimilation and \"agreeing to live the lives of unfree men\". \"Women's liberation\", she wrote in ''The Whole Woman'' (1999), \"did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual.\" She argues instead that liberation is about asserting difference and \"insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination\". It is a struggle for the freedom of women to \"define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate\".{{efn|Germaine Greer (''The Whole Woman'', 1999): \"In 1970 the movement was called 'Women's Liberation' or, contemptuously, 'Women's Lib'. When the name 'Libbers' was dropped for 'Feminists' we were all relieved. What none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. We were settling for equality. Liberation struggles are not about assimilation but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination. The aim of women's liberation is to do as much for female people as has been done for colonized nations. Women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. Seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. Liberationists sought the world over for clues as to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate.

She argued that the Western promotion of birth control in the Third World was in large part driven not by concern for human welfare but by the traditional fear and envy of the rich towards the fertility of the poor.

Her 2013 book, ''[[White Beech: The Rainforest Years]]'', describes her efforts to restore an area of [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia|rainforest]] in the [[Numinbah Valley]] in Australia.

It would just mean that women were implicated.\"<ref>\"How to be a feminist\", All About Women festival, Sydney Opera House, 8 March 2015, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzcs4ti_bdI&t=1h6m4s 01:06:04].</ref>}} Her goal is not equality with men, which she sees as assimilation and \"agreeing to live the lives of unfree men\". \"Women's liberation\", she wrote in ''The Whole Woman'' (1999), \"did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual.\" She argues instead that liberation is about asserting difference and \"insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination\". It is a struggle for the freedom of women to \"define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate\".{{efn|Germaine Greer (''The Whole Woman'', 1999): \"In 1970 the movement was called 'Women's Liberation' or, contemptuously, 'Women's Lib'. When the name 'Libbers' was dropped for 'Feminists' we were all relieved. What none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. We were settling for equality. Liberation struggles are not about assimilation but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination. The aim of women's liberation is to do as much for female people as has been done for colonized nations. Women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. Seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. Liberationists sought the world over for clues as to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate.

Suggesting that whites were mistaken in understanding this literally, she argued that Aborigines were offering whites terms on which they could be accepted into the Aboriginal kinship system. The essay argues that it may not be too late for Australia as a nation to root itself in Aboriginal history and culture. She wrote:\n\n{{quote|Though I can claim no drop of Aboriginal blood, twenty years ago [[Kulin people|Kulin]] women from [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]] adopted me. There are whitefellas who insist that blackfellas don't practise adoption; all I can say is that when I asked about the possibility of assuming Aboriginality, the Kulin women said at once 'We'll adopt you.' 'How do you do that?' I asked, hoping I wouldn't be required to camp in some bleak spot for a month or two, and be painted or smoked and cut about. 'That's it,' they said. 'It's done. We've adopted you.' Since then I have sat on the ground with black women and been assigned a skin and been taught how to hunt and how to cook shellfish and [[witchetty grub]]s, with no worse punishment for getting it wrong than being laughed at.{{sfn|Greer|2004|p=23}}}}\n\nGreer's essay ''On Rage'' (2008) dealt with the widespread rage of indigenous men.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greer |first1=Germaine |title=On Rage |date=2008 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |location=Melbourne}}; {{cite news| last=Wilson |first=Laura |url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24183660-16947,00.html| title = Bob Carr pierced by Germaine Greer's 'ferocious logic'| date = 15 August 2008| work = The Australian}}</ref> Aboriginal academic [[Marcia Langton]] argued that she was making excuses for bad behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/greer-maintains-rage-of-racists/story-e6frg6zo-1111117231379|title=Greer maintains rage of racists|last=Langton|first=Marcia|authorlink=Marcia Langton|date=15 August 2008|work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref> Greer returned that year to Newnham College, Cambridge, as a special supervisor.{{sfn|Standish|2014}}\n\n===''White Beech'' (2013)===\n{{further|White Beech: The Rainforest Years|Gondwana Rainforests of Australia}}\n[[File:Natural Bridge, Springbrook National Park, Queensland - Cave Creek.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Cave Creek, near [[Natural Bridge, Queensland]]]]\nIn 2001 Greer bought {{convert|60|ha}} of land in Australia for $500,000 at Cave Creek in the [[Numinbah Valley]], near the [[Natural Bridge, Queensland|Natural Bridge]] section of [[Springbrook National Park]] in [[South East Queensland]].
