According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} making it the most populous city in Nueva Ecija and the fifth-most populous in Central Luzon.\n\nThe city is popular for being home to more than 30,000 [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|tricycles]], thus priding itself as the \"Tricycle Capital of the Philippines\"<ref>[https://archive.today/20140118134718/http://philippinetimesofsouthernnevada.com/news/the-philippines/ph-provinces/cabanatuan-city-remains-the-undisputed-tricycle-capital-of-the-philippines/]</ref> and its strategic location along the Cagayan Valley Road has made the city a major economic, educational, medical, entertainment shopping and transportation center in Nueva Ecija and nearby provinces in the region such as Aurora and Bulacan. It has also earned the moniker \"Gateway to the North\".\n\nCabanatuan remained as Nueva Ecija's capital until 1965, when the government created nearby [[Palayan City]] as the new provincial capital. Nueva Ecija's old capitol and other government offices are still used and maintained by the provincial administration.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gen Luna Death Site.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px| Marker of Gen. Antonio Luna's Death Place]]\nCabanatuan was founded as a Barrio of Gapan in 1750 and became a Municipality and capital of La Provincia de Nueva Ecija in 1780. Cabanatuan is the site of the historical \"Plaza Lucero\" and the Cabanatuan Cathedral, where General [[Antonio Luna]] was assassinated by Captain Pedro Janolino and members of the kawit battalion. Cabanatuan lost the title of provincial capital in 1850 when the capital of Nueva Ecija was moved to San Isidro, another historic town. It was only in 1917, when the Administrative code was enacted, that Cabanatuan was restored as capital of the Province. However, in 1965, Congress created Palayan City, which has been the capital ever since.\n\n[[File:Cabanatuan_Operations_-_Routes_to_and_from_the_Objectives,_January_1945.jpg|thumbnail|left|Map of the routes taken by the US Rangers in their Raid at Cabanatuan]]\nDuring World War II, the occupying Japanese built Cabanatuan Prison Camp, where many American soldiers were imprisoned, some of whom had been forced to endure the infamous [[Bataan Death March]]. In January 1945, elements of the U.S. Army [[6th Ranger Battalion]] and two teams of [[Alamo Scouts]] marched {{convert|30|mi}} behind enemy lines to rescue the prisoners in what became known as the [[Raid at Cabanatuan]]. As a result of the raid on January 30, 1945, victorious Filipino guerrillas, American troops of the U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion and [[Alamo Scouts]] celebrated having obtained the freedom of 500 American [[Prisoner of war|POWs]]. Soon thereafter, Philippine and American forces re-established the presence of military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary 2nd Constabulary Regiment, and the United States Army in Cabanatuan from February 1, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during the Allied Liberation. Before long, the combined Philippine Commonwealth and American armed forces, in cooperation with local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} had liberated Central Luzon from Japanese Imperial forces, a campaign that lasted from January until August 1945.\n\nIn 1957, the barrios of Mataas na Kahoy, Balangkare Norte, Balangkare Sur, Sapang Kawayan, Magasawang Sampaloc, Talabutab Norte, Talabutab Sur, Platero, Belen, Pecaleon, Pi\u00f1ahan, Kabulihan, Pasong-Hari, Balaring, Pulong Singkamas, Panaksak, Bravo, Sapang Bato, Burol, Miller, Tila Patio, Pula, Carinay, and Acacia were separated from Cabanatuan and constituted into a separate and independent municipality known as [[General Mamerto Natividad, Nueva Ecija|General Mamerto Natividad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1863.html|title=An Act to Create the Municipality of General Mamerto Natividad in the Province of Nueva Ecija|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nCabanatuan was the epicenter of a [[1990 Luzon earthquake|very strong earthquake]], 7.8 on the [[surface wave magnitude]] scale, at roughly 3 pm on July 16, 1990. It leveled some buildings, including the Christian College of the Philippines (Liwag Colleges) in the midst of class time, and killed 1,653 people.\n\n===Conversion from town, component city to highly urbanized city===\nCabanatuan became a city by virtue of [[Republic Act]] No. 526, approved on June 16, 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra526-cabanatuan-city-charter.html|title=An act creating the City of Cabanatuan|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}</ref> In 1998, Cabanatuan was declared by then-president [[Fidel V.

New commercial buildings are springing up in the [[central business district|CBD]] and along Maharlika Highway on the average of seventy-five per year.\n\nCabanatuan nowadays is gradually becoming a major investment hub and is considered as one of the most competitive cities for doing business in the country. Investors in banking, real estate, retail and other business and industrial enterprises are similarly drawn to the city because of its adequate infrastructure and investor support services. Its continuing urbanization is also luring investors into its suburban municipalities as well.\n\nTo further explore its economic potentials, Cabanatuan is seeking to have a share of the [[business process outsourcing|IT-BPO]] boom. The first [[call center]] in Nueva Ecija was successfully established in the city in 2008. The city government is providing prospective investors fast business applications processing, low business taxes, and other incentives to attract big-ticket projects.<ref name=\"businessmirror.com.ph\"/>\n\nIn 2015, the city's total assets amounted to PHP 3.719 billion and the total income reached PHP 1.696 billion,.<ref name=\"coa.gov.ph\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units/2015/category/5879-cities?download=26278:region-iii |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817112554/http://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units/2015/category/5879-cities?download=26278:region-iii |archive-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Real estate===\nMany Novo Ecijanos choose to resettle in Cabanatuan for proximity to their jobs and other necessities. With the influx of people, residential developments followed; now more than a hundred subdivisions for A to D markets decimate the city.\n\nLarge-scale residential developments are present, such as Lakewood City and Avida Santa Arcadia Estates. Santa Lucia Realty's Lakewood City is a medium to high-end project encompassing more than 170 hectares. Its centerpiece is a 64-hectare championship golf course, one of the largest in Central Luzon.\n\n[[Ayala Land]]'s 87-hectare Avida Santa Arcadia Estates is master planned to become a mixed-use development that will include the Avida Santa Arcadia Residences, Avida Settings, and Avida Town Center.\n\nAlso included in the roster of large residential districts are the Kapitan Pepe Subdivision, Grand Victoria Estates, and Acropolis North by Santa Lucia Realty.\n\nAyala Land currently has five residential subdivisions while Vista Land has three and Santa Lucia Realty, three.\n\nRecently, there is active development of residential subdivisions in Santa Arcadia, Bangad and the stretch of NE-Aurora Road.\n\nPrime lands in Cabanatuan are becoming pricier as demand for residential land increases, with the entry of more Manila- and Cebu-based land developers.\n\nEstablished players are being challenged by newcomers like [[JG Summit Holdings|Robinsons Land]], [[SM Investments Corporation#Subsidiaries|SMDC]], [[Filinvest Land, Inc.|Filinvest]] and AboitizLand.

Cabanatuan City has many bus companies operating provincial and regional routes, with the Cabanatuan Central Transport Terminal serving as the terminus. Jeepney operators serve routes within the province with some reaching as far to Dingalan, Baler and Dilasag in Aurora, Olongapo City, San Fernando and Dau in Pampanga, Mariveles and Balanga in Bataan, Baguio City in Benguet, Dagupan City and Tarlac City. Much of the city's population rely on public transportation such as tricycles and jeeps to get around the city.\n\n[[Maharlika Highway]] (or Pan-Philippine Highway) is the main highway traversing the city where most vehicles going to Cagayan Valley pass through. Nueva Ecija - Aurora Road links Cabanatuan to [[Baler, Aurora]], passing through rural towns in eastern Nueva Ecija. Burgos Avenue and Del Pilar Street serve as the city's main thoroughfare inside the downtown area. Other major roads include the General Tinio and Rizal Streets which run through the city proper in an east-west direction; Mabini Street, where two of the city's three universities are situated and the Circumferential Road that connects the downtown area to the Kapitan Pepe residential district. Two bypass roads were constructed during the early 2000s to decongest the Maharlika Highway and to spur new developments outside the downtown area. The 10.3-kilometer Felipe Vergara Highway provides a direct route to Cagayan Valley, while Emilio Vergara Highway links [[Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija|Santa Rosa]] to Nueva Ecija - Aurora Road, avoiding traffic bottleneck along [[Maharlika Highway]].\n\nCabanatuan was served by the Manila Railroad Company in 1905 through the Balagtas - Cabanatuan line, which was abandoned after the war because scavengers looted pieces of the rail tracks. Rail service was resumed in 1969 after the rehabilitation of the rail tracks as mandated by a government order. The service was again abandoned in the 1980s. The old Cabanatuan Railway Station is located at Barangay General Luna and is converted to a day care center with the original structure remaining.\n\nInfrastructure improvements by the administration are ongoing. A Unified Command Center for the traffic lights to be installed at 25 major intersections is currently under construction. Separate tricycle lanes are also present within the perimeter of the Public Market. Road widening of the Emilio Vergara Highway from two to six lanes is already proceeding, while the widening of all city and arterial roads from one- to two-lane highway to three-lane highway is also being considered.\n\nTwo proposed expressways will pass through Cabanatuan City if built. These are the [[North Luzon East Expressway]] ([[Quezon City]] to Cabanatuan) and the [[Central Luzon Link Expressway]] ([[SCTEx]]-[[TPLEx]] to San Jose City).\n\nIntercity and interprovincial buses from Manila serve the city, and are usually operated by [[Baliwag Transit, Inc.]], [[Five Star Bus Company|Five Star]], [[Victory Liner]], [[Genesis Transport Service Inc.]], [[GV Florida Transport]], and Pangasinan Solid North.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:106jfFreedom_Park_Burgos_Avenue_Cabanatuan_Cityfvf_25.jpg|thumb|right| Freedom Park]]\n[[File:9905jfAntonio Luna Monument Freedom Park Cabanatuanfvf 23.JPG|thumb|right| Gen.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} making it the most populous city in Nueva Ecija and the fifth-most populous in Central Luzon.\n\nThe city is popular for being home to more than 30,000 [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|tricycles]], thus priding itself as the \"Tricycle Capital of the Philippines\"<ref>[https://archive.today/20140118134718/http://philippinetimesofsouthernnevada.com/news/the-philippines/ph-provinces/cabanatuan-city-remains-the-undisputed-tricycle-capital-of-the-philippines/]</ref> and its strategic location along the Cagayan Valley Road has made the city a major economic, educational, medical, entertainment shopping and transportation center in Nueva Ecija and nearby provinces in the region such as Aurora and Bulacan. It has also earned the moniker \"Gateway to the North\".\n\nCabanatuan remained as Nueva Ecija's capital until 1965, when the government created nearby [[Palayan City]] as the new provincial capital. Nueva Ecija's old capitol and other government offices are still used and maintained by the provincial administration.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gen Luna Death Site.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px| Marker of Gen. Antonio Luna's Death Place]]\nCabanatuan was founded as a Barrio of Gapan in 1750 and became a Municipality and capital of La Provincia de Nueva Ecija in 1780. Cabanatuan is the site of the historical \"Plaza Lucero\" and the Cabanatuan Cathedral, where General [[Antonio Luna]] was assassinated by Captain Pedro Janolino and members of the kawit battalion. Cabanatuan lost the title of provincial capital in 1850 when the capital of Nueva Ecija was moved to San Isidro, another historic town. It was only in 1917, when the Administrative code was enacted, that Cabanatuan was restored as capital of the Province. However, in 1965, Congress created Palayan City, which has been the capital ever since.\n\n[[File:Cabanatuan_Operations_-_Routes_to_and_from_the_Objectives,_January_1945.jpg|thumbnail|left|Map of the routes taken by the US Rangers in their Raid at Cabanatuan]]\nDuring World War II, the occupying Japanese built Cabanatuan Prison Camp, where many American soldiers were imprisoned, some of whom had been forced to endure the infamous [[Bataan Death March]]. In January 1945, elements of the U.S. Army [[6th Ranger Battalion]] and two teams of [[Alamo Scouts]] marched {{convert|30|mi}} behind enemy lines to rescue the prisoners in what became known as the [[Raid at Cabanatuan]]. As a result of the raid on January 30, 1945, victorious Filipino guerrillas, American troops of the U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion and [[Alamo Scouts]] celebrated having obtained the freedom of 500 American [[Prisoner of war|POWs]]. Soon thereafter, Philippine and American forces re-established the presence of military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary 2nd Constabulary Regiment, and the United States Army in Cabanatuan from February 1, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during the Allied Liberation. Before long, the combined Philippine Commonwealth and American armed forces, in cooperation with local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} had liberated Central Luzon from Japanese Imperial forces, a campaign that lasted from January until August 1945.\n\nIn 1957, the barrios of Mataas na Kahoy, Balangkare Norte, Balangkare Sur, Sapang Kawayan, Magasawang Sampaloc, Talabutab Norte, Talabutab Sur, Platero, Belen, Pecaleon, Pi\u00f1ahan, Kabulihan, Pasong-Hari, Balaring, Pulong Singkamas, Panaksak, Bravo, Sapang Bato, Burol, Miller, Tila Patio, Pula, Carinay, and Acacia were separated from Cabanatuan and constituted into a separate and independent municipality known as [[General Mamerto Natividad, Nueva Ecija|General Mamerto Natividad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1863.html|title=An Act to Create the Municipality of General Mamerto Natividad in the Province of Nueva Ecija|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nCabanatuan was the epicenter of a [[1990 Luzon earthquake|very strong earthquake]], 7.8 on the [[surface wave magnitude]] scale, at roughly 3 pm on July 16, 1990. It leveled some buildings, including the Christian College of the Philippines (Liwag Colleges) in the midst of class time, and killed 1,653 people.\n\n===Conversion from town, component city to highly urbanized city===\nCabanatuan became a city by virtue of [[Republic Act]] No. 526, approved on June 16, 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra526-cabanatuan-city-charter.html|title=An act creating the City of Cabanatuan|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}</ref> In 1998, Cabanatuan was declared by then-president [[Fidel V.

New commercial buildings are springing up in the [[central business district|CBD]] and along Maharlika Highway on the average of seventy-five per year.\n\nCabanatuan nowadays is gradually becoming a major investment hub and is considered as one of the most competitive cities for doing business in the country. Investors in banking, real estate, retail and other business and industrial enterprises are similarly drawn to the city because of its adequate infrastructure and investor support services. Its continuing urbanization is also luring investors into its suburban municipalities as well.\n\nTo further explore its economic potentials, Cabanatuan is seeking to have a share of the [[business process outsourcing|IT-BPO]] boom. The first [[call center]] in Nueva Ecija was successfully established in the city in 2008. The city government is providing prospective investors fast business applications processing, low business taxes, and other incentives to attract big-ticket projects.<ref name=\"businessmirror.com.ph\"/>\n\nIn 2015, the city's total assets amounted to PHP 3.719 billion and the total income reached PHP 1.696 billion,.<ref name=\"coa.gov.ph\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units/2015/category/5879-cities?download=26278:region-iii |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817112554/http://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units/2015/category/5879-cities?download=26278:region-iii |archive-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Real estate===\nMany Novo Ecijanos choose to resettle in Cabanatuan for proximity to their jobs and other necessities. With the influx of people, residential developments followed; now more than a hundred subdivisions for A to D markets decimate the city.\n\nLarge-scale residential developments are present, such as Lakewood City and Avida Santa Arcadia Estates. Santa Lucia Realty's Lakewood City is a medium to high-end project encompassing more than 170 hectares. Its centerpiece is a 64-hectare championship golf course, one of the largest in Central Luzon.\n\n[[Ayala Land]]'s 87-hectare Avida Santa Arcadia Estates is master planned to become a mixed-use development that will include the Avida Santa Arcadia Residences, Avida Settings, and Avida Town Center.\n\nAlso included in the roster of large residential districts are the Kapitan Pepe Subdivision, Grand Victoria Estates, and Acropolis North by Santa Lucia Realty.\n\nAyala Land currently has five residential subdivisions while Vista Land has three and Santa Lucia Realty, three.\n\nRecently, there is active development of residential subdivisions in Santa Arcadia, Bangad and the stretch of NE-Aurora Road.\n\nPrime lands in Cabanatuan are becoming pricier as demand for residential land increases, with the entry of more Manila- and Cebu-based land developers.\n\nEstablished players are being challenged by newcomers like [[JG Summit Holdings|Robinsons Land]], [[SM Investments Corporation#Subsidiaries|SMDC]], [[Filinvest Land, Inc.|Filinvest]] and AboitizLand.

Cabanatuan City has many bus companies operating provincial and regional routes, with the Cabanatuan Central Transport Terminal serving as the terminus. Jeepney operators serve routes within the province with some reaching as far to Dingalan, Baler and Dilasag in Aurora, Olongapo City, San Fernando and Dau in Pampanga, Mariveles and Balanga in Bataan, Baguio City in Benguet, Dagupan City and Tarlac City. Much of the city's population rely on public transportation such as tricycles and jeeps to get around the city.\n\n[[Maharlika Highway]] (or Pan-Philippine Highway) is the main highway traversing the city where most vehicles going to Cagayan Valley pass through. Nueva Ecija - Aurora Road links Cabanatuan to [[Baler, Aurora]], passing through rural towns in eastern Nueva Ecija. Burgos Avenue and Del Pilar Street serve as the city's main thoroughfare inside the downtown area. Other major roads include the General Tinio and Rizal Streets which run through the city proper in an east-west direction; Mabini Street, where two of the city's three universities are situated and the Circumferential Road that connects the downtown area to the Kapitan Pepe residential district. Two bypass roads were constructed during the early 2000s to decongest the Maharlika Highway and to spur new developments outside the downtown area. The 10.3-kilometer Felipe Vergara Highway provides a direct route to Cagayan Valley, while Emilio Vergara Highway links [[Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija|Santa Rosa]] to Nueva Ecija - Aurora Road, avoiding traffic bottleneck along [[Maharlika Highway]].\n\nCabanatuan was served by the Manila Railroad Company in 1905 through the Balagtas - Cabanatuan line, which was abandoned after the war because scavengers looted pieces of the rail tracks. Rail service was resumed in 1969 after the rehabilitation of the rail tracks as mandated by a government order. The service was again abandoned in the 1980s. The old Cabanatuan Railway Station is located at Barangay General Luna and is converted to a day care center with the original structure remaining.\n\nInfrastructure improvements by the administration are ongoing. A Unified Command Center for the traffic lights to be installed at 25 major intersections is currently under construction. Separate tricycle lanes are also present within the perimeter of the Public Market. Road widening of the Emilio Vergara Highway from two to six lanes is already proceeding, while the widening of all city and arterial roads from one- to two-lane highway to three-lane highway is also being considered.\n\nTwo proposed expressways will pass through Cabanatuan City if built. These are the [[North Luzon East Expressway]] ([[Quezon City]] to Cabanatuan) and the [[Central Luzon Link Expressway]] ([[SCTEx]]-[[TPLEx]] to San Jose City).\n\nIntercity and interprovincial buses from Manila serve the city, and are usually operated by [[Baliwag Transit, Inc.]], [[Five Star Bus Company|Five Star]], [[Victory Liner]], [[Genesis Transport Service Inc.]], [[GV Florida Transport]], and Pangasinan Solid North.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:106jfFreedom_Park_Burgos_Avenue_Cabanatuan_Cityfvf_25.jpg|thumb|right| Freedom Park]]\n[[File:9905jfAntonio Luna Monument Freedom Park Cabanatuanfvf 23.JPG|thumb|right| Gen.
