It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven.\n}}\nWriting when [[Palm Inc.]] introduced its first web-capable [[personal digital assistant]] (supporting Web access with [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]), DiNucci saw the Web \"fragmenting\" into a future that extended beyond the browser/PC combination it was identified with. She focused on how the basic information structure and hyper-linking mechanism introduced by [[HTTP]] would be used by a variety of devices and platforms. As such, her \"2.0\" designation refers to the next version of the Web that does not directly relate to the term's current use.\n\nThe term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2002.<ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003.

The year of Web services. CIO, December 15.</ref> Kinsley and Eric focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, \"the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform\".<ref name=\"Knorr, Eric 2003\"/> In 2004, the term began to popularize when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the \"Web as Platform\", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that \"customers are building your business for you\".<ref name=\"O'Reilly, Tim 2004\">O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In San Francisco, California, October 5.</ref> They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be \"harnessed\" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called \"Web 1.0\". They associated this term with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]. For example,\n{{quote|Netscape framed \"the web as platform\" in terms of the old software [[paradigm]]: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the \"horseless carriage\" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a \"webtop\" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.<ref>O\u2019Reilly, T., 2005.</ref>}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company that did not, at the time, focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data, such as the links that Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web searches based on reputation through its \"[[PageRank]]\" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called \"the [[perpetual beta]]\". A similar difference can be seen between the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] and [[Wikipedia]] \u2013 while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and release them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the [[Open-source software|open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|\"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\"]]. This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any \"[[Bug (computing)|bugs]]\" or other problems. The Wikipedia volunteer editor community produces, edits, and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting [[entrepreneur]]s, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.\n\nThe popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').<ref>Grossman, Lev. 2006.

By increasing emphasis on these already-extant capabilities, they encourage users to rely more on their browser for [[user interface]], [[application software]] (\"apps\") and [[file storage]] facilities. This has been called \"network as platform\" computing.<ref name=\"oreilly\" /> Major features of Web 2.0 include [[social networking]] websites, self-publishing platforms (e.g., [[WordPress]]' easy-to-use blog and website creation tools), [[Tag (metadata)|\"tagging\"]] (which enables users to label websites, videos or photos in some fashion), [[Like button|\"like\" buttons]] (which enable a user to indicate that they are pleased by online content), and [[social bookmarking]].  \n\nUsers can provide the data and exercise some control over what they share on a Web 2.0 site.<ref name=\"oreilly\" /><ref name=\"hinchcliffe\">{{cite web\n|url=http://web2.wsj2.com/the_state_of_web_20.htm\n|title=The State of Web 2.0\n|publisher=Web Services\n|first = Dion | last = Hinchcliffe\n|date=2006-04-02\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515032339/http://web2.wsj2.com/the_state_of_web_20.htm\n|archivedate=2007-05-15\n|accessdate=2006-08-06\n}}</ref> These sites may have an \"architecture of participation\" that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it.<ref name=\"graham\" /><ref name=\"oreilly\" /> Users can add value in many ways, such as by commenting on news stories on a news website, by uploading a relevant photo on a travel website, or by adding a link to a video or [[TED talk]] which is pertinent to the subject being discussed on a website.

To allow users to continue interacting with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page ([[Asynchronous communication|asynchronously]]). \n\nOtherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases the overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used [[structured data]] formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. \n\nWhen this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.\n\nAs a widely available plug-in independent of [[W3C]] standards (the World Wide Web Consortium is the governing body of Web standards and protocols), [[Adobe Flash]] is capable of doing many things that were not possible pre-[[HTML5]]. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used is its ability to integrate streaming multimedia into HTML pages. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2010 and the growing concerns with Flash's security, the role of Flash is decreasing. \n\nIn addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks use the same technology as JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. However, frameworks smooth over inconsistencies between Web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[Software widget|widgets]]' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. \n\nOn the [[Server side|server-side]], Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], as well as [[J2EE|Enterprise Java (J2EE)]] and [[.NET Framework|Microsoft.NET Framework]], are used by developers to output data dynamically using information from files and databases. This allows websites and web services to share [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] formats such as [[XML]] ([[Atom (standard)|Atom]], [[RSS]], etc.) and [[JSON]]. When data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|integrate a portion of that site's functionality]].\n\n==Concepts==\n[[File:Qualitydimensions.png|thumb|alt=Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, encyclopedias and Wikipedia|Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] and [[Wikipedia]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=W\u0142odzimierz |last2=W\u0119cel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2019 |title=Multilingual Ranking of Wikipedia Articles with Quality and Popularity Assessment in Different Topics |journal=Computers |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=60 |doi=10.3390/computers8030060 |doi-access=free }}</ref>]]\nWeb 2.0 can be described in three parts:\n* [[Rich Internet application]] (RIA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines the experience brought from desktop to browser, whether it is \"rich\" from a graphical point of view or a usability/interactivity or features point of view.\n* [[Web-oriented architecture]] (WOA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 applications expose their functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications. Examples are [[Web feed|feeds]], [[RSS feed]]s, [[web services]], [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].\n* [[Social Web]]&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 websites tend to interact much more with the end user and make the end user an integral part of the website, either by adding his or her profile, adding comments on content, uploading new content, or adding [[user-generated content]] (e.g., personal [[digital photo]]s).\n\nAs such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[Client (computing)|client]]- and [[Server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented Web browsers may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and software extensions to handle the content and user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with [[Computer data storage|information storage]], creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment known as \"Web 1.0\".\n\nWeb 2.0 sites include the following features and techniques, referred to as the acronym [[SLATES]] by Andrew McAfee:<ref>McAfee, A.

For example, in the Talis white paper \"Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation\", [[Paul Miller (journalist)|Paul Miller]] argues\n\n<blockquote>Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.<ref>Miller 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nHere, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a \"Library 2.0\". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods. The meaning of Web 2.0 is role dependent. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to \"end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |title=i-Technology Viewpoint: It's Time to Take the Quotation Marks Off \"Web 2.0\" &#124; Web 2.0 Journal |publisher=Web2.sys-con.com |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216062850/http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |archive-date=2011-02-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nThere is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education.

A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, [[customer service]] enhancement, product or service improvement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis\u2014Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content&nbsp;\u2014 to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. \n\nAnother marketing Web 2.0 lure is to make sure consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing.<ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | title=The Secrets of Marketing in a Web 2.0 World | last=Parise | first=Salvatore | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=2008-12-16 | access-date=2017-08-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710043624/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | archive-date=2017-07-10 | url-status=live }}\n</ref> Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing.

The brand of tourist destinations can be built through marketing campaigns on social media and by engaging with customers. For example, the \u201cSnow at First Sight\u201d campaign launched by the [[Colorado|State of Colorado]] aimed to bring brand awareness to Colorado as a winter destination. The campaign used social media platforms, for example, Facebook and Twitter, to promote this competition, and requested the participants to share experiences, pictures and videos on social media platforms. As a result, Colorado enhanced their image as a winter destination and created a campaign worth about $2.9 million.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe tourism organisation can earn brand royalty from interactive marketing campaigns on social media with engaging passive communication tactics. For example, \u201cMoms\u201d advisors of the [[Walt Disney World]] are responsible for offering suggestions and replying to questions about the family trips at Walt Disney World.

They mimic the user experience of desktop operating systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these so-called \"operating systems\" do not directly control the hardware on the client's computer. Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers.\n\n==Distribution of media==\n\n===XML and RSS===\nMany regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another Web site, a [[browser plugin]], or a separate desktop application). Protocols permitting syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as Web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of which are [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[Web feed]]s. Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites and permit end-users to interact without centralized Web sites.\n\n===Web APIs===\n{{Main|Web API}}\nWeb 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[Application programming interface]]s (API), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self-describing once an entry [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP Application programming interface and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of Web service specifications]].\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics of the term claim that \"Web 2.0\" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called \"Web 1.0\" technologies and concepts.<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\" /> First, techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], but add a layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 were already featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term \"Web 2.0\" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Amazon Web Services API\n|work=O'Reilly Network\n|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly\n|date=2002-06-18\n|accessdate=2006-05-27\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613235806/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|archivedate=2006-06-13\n}}</ref> Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena that preceded Web 2.0. [[Tim Berners-Lee]], who developed the initial technologies of the Web, has been an outspoken critic of the term, while supporting many of the elements associated with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|title=Tim Berners-Lee on Web 2.0: \"nobody even knows what it means\"|quote=He's big on blogs and wikis, and has nothing but good things to say about AJAX, but Berners-Lee faults the term \"Web 2.0\" for lacking any coherent meaning.|date=September 2006|access-date=2017-06-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708091023/https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|archive-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref> In [[CERN|the environment where the Web originated]], each workstation had a [[dedicated IP address]] and always-on connection to the Internet.

For many people who work in software, version numbers like 2.0 and 3.0 are for [[software versioning]] or hardware versioning only, and to assign 2.0 arbitrarily to many technologies with a variety of real version numbers has no meaning.  The web does not have a version number.  For example, in a 2006 interview with [[IBM]] [[developerWorks]] podcast editor Scott Laningham, Tim Berners-Lee described the term \"Web 2.0\" as a jargon:<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821185101/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |archive-date=2012-08-21 |url-status=live }}\n</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Nobody really knows what it means... If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along... Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [to the] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people is really what the Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact.\"</blockquote> Other critics labeled Web 2.0 \"a second bubble\" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of [[business model]]s.

Keen's 2007 book, ''[[Cult of the Amateur]]'', argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as \"creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels...

For instance, Twitter offers online tools for users to create their own tweet, in a way the users are doing all the work when it comes to producing media content. At the heart of Web 2.0's participatory culture is an inherent disregard for privacy, although it was not much of an issue for giant platforms like Facebook and Google, as users are discovering and exploring the internet because they want users to participate and create more content. More importantly, because user participation creates fresh content and profile data that are useful for third parties such as advertising corporates and national security. Therefore, suppression of privacy is built into the business model of Web 2.0 and one should not be too tied up to the optimistic notion of Web 2.0 being the next evolutionary step for digital media.\n\n==Trademark==\nIn November 2004, [[CMP Media]] applied to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] for a [[service mark]] on the use of the term \"WEB 2.0\" for live events.<ref name=\"uspto\">{{cite web |url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |title=USPTO serial number 78322306 |publisher=Tarr.uspto.gov |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113155427/http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |archive-date=2011-01-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the basis of this application, CMP Media sent a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] demand to the Irish non-profit organisation IT@Cork on May 24, 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=O'Reilly and CMP Exercise Trademark on 'Web 2.0' |work=Slashdot |url=http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/26/1238245 |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2006-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511040244/http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F05%2F26%2F1238245 |archive-date=2009-05-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> but retracted it two days later.<ref>{{cite web | title=O'Reilly's coverage of Web 2.0 as a service mark | work=O'Reilly Radar | url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html | first = Nathan | last = Torkington | date=2006-05-26 | accessdate=2006-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115224430/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html|archivedate=15 January 2008}}</ref> The \"WEB 2.0\" service mark registration passed final PTO Examining Attorney review on May 10, 2006, and was registered on June 27, 2006.<ref name=\"uspto\"/> The [[European Union]] application (which would confer unambiguous status in Ireland)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212#|title=Application number 004972212|year=2007|access-date=2010-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512034116/http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212|archive-date=2013-05-12|url-status=live}}</ref> was declined on May 23, 2007.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cloud computing]]\n* [[Collective intelligence]]\n* [[Connectivity (media)|Connectivity]] of social media\n* [[Crowd computing]]\n* [[Enterprise social software]]\n* [[Mass collaboration]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Office suite]]\n* [[Open source governance]]\n* [[Privacy issues of social networking sites]]\n* [[Social commerce]]\n* [[Social shopping]]\n* [[Web 2.0 for development]] (web2fordev)\n* [[Semantic Web#Web 3.0|Web 3.0]]\n* [[You (Time Person of the Year)]]\n* [[Libraries in Second Life]]\n* [[List of free software for Web 2.0 Services]]\n* [[Cute cat theory of digital activism]]\n\n; Application domains\n* [[Sci-Mate]]\n* [[Business 2.0]]\n* [[Learning 2.0|E-learning 2.0]]\n* [[e-Government]] (Government 2.0)\n* [[Health 2.0]]\n* [[Science 2.0]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Wikiversity-inline}}\n{{Scholia}}\n* {{cite book | title=Web 2.0 / Social Media / Social Networks|year=2017| publisher=MultiMedia| location=Charleston, South Carolina, SUA| isbn=978-1-544-63831-7}}\n\n{{Semantic Web}}\n\n[[Category:Web 2.0| ]]\n[[Category:2000s in computer science]]\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Cloud applications]]\n[[Category:Internet ages]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:New media]]\n[[Category:Social information processing]]\n[[Category:Technology neologisms]]\n[[Category:Web 2.0 neologisms| ]]\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 2000s]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|World Wide Web sites that use technology beyond the static pages of earlier Web sites}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n\n[[File:Web 2.0 Map.svg|thumb|300px|A [[tag cloud]] (a typical Web 2.0 phenomenon in itself) presenting Web 2.0 themes]]\n\n'''Web 2.0''' (also known as '''Participative (or Participatory)'''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blank|first=Grant|last2=Reisdorf|first2=Bianca|date=2012-05-01|title=The Participatory Web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263266131|journal=Information|volume=15|issue=4|pages=537\u2013554|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2012.665935}}</ref> and '''Social Web''')<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27960/web-10|title=What is Web 1.0?

She focused on how the basic information structure and hyper-linking mechanism introduced by [[HTTP]] would be used by a variety of devices and platforms. As such, her \"2.0\" designation refers to the next version of the Web that does not directly relate to the term's current use.\n\nThe term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2002.<ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003.

The year of Web services. CIO, December 15.</ref> Kinsley and Eric focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, \"the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform\".<ref name=\"Knorr, Eric 2003\"/> In 2004, the term began to popularize when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the \"Web as Platform\", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that \"customers are building your business for you\".<ref name=\"O'Reilly, Tim 2004\">O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In San Francisco, California, October 5.</ref> They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be \"harnessed\" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called \"Web 1.0\". They associated this term with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]. For example,\n{{quote|Netscape framed \"the web as platform\" in terms of the old software [[paradigm]]: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the \"horseless carriage\" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a \"webtop\" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.<ref>O\u2019Reilly, T., 2005.</ref>}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company that did not, at the time, focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data, such as the links that Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web searches based on reputation through its \"[[PageRank]]\" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called \"the [[perpetual beta]]\". A similar difference can be seen between the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] and [[Wikipedia]] \u2013 while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and release them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the [[Open-source software|open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|\"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\"]]. This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any \"[[Bug (computing)|bugs]]\" or other problems. The Wikipedia volunteer editor community produces, edits, and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting [[entrepreneur]]s, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.\n\nThe popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').<ref>Grossman, Lev. 2006.

What is Web 2.0. Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software, p. 30</ref> by way of user participation, can also be viewed as essential attributes of Web 2.0. Some websites require users to contribute user-generated content to have access to the website, to discourage \"free riding\".[[File:Mass Effect Wiki Collaboration.png|thumb|A list of ways that people can volunteer to improve Mass Effect Wiki, an example of content generated by users working collaboratively.]]The key features of Web 2.0 include:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n# [[Folksonomy]] \u2013 free classification of information; allows users to collectively classify and find information (e.g. [[Tag (metadata)|\"tagging\"]] of websites, images, videos or links)\n# Rich [[user experience]] \u2013 dynamic content that is responsive to user input (e.g., a user can \"click\" on an image to enlarge it or find out more information)\n# [[Crowdsourcing|User participation]] \u2013 information flows two ways between the site owner and site users by means of evaluation, review, and online commenting. Site users also typically create [[user-generated content]] for others to see (e.g., [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia that anyone can write articles for or edit)\n# [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) \u2013 Web 2.0 sites developed [[API]]s to allow automated usage, such as by a [[Web app|Web \"app\"]] ([[software application]]) or a [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]\n# [[Eternal September|Mass participation]] \u2013 near-universal web access leads to differentiation of concerns, from the traditional Internet user base (who tended to be [[hacker]]s and computer hobbyists) to a wider variety of users\n\n==Technologies==\nThe [[client-side]] ([[Web browser]]) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[JavaScript library|JavaScript frameworks]]. Ajax programming uses [[JavaScript]] and the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) to update selected regions of the page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue interacting with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page ([[Asynchronous communication|asynchronously]]). \n\nOtherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases the overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used [[structured data]] formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. \n\nWhen this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.\n\nAs a widely available plug-in independent of [[W3C]] standards (the World Wide Web Consortium is the governing body of Web standards and protocols), [[Adobe Flash]] is capable of doing many things that were not possible pre-[[HTML5]]. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used is its ability to integrate streaming multimedia into HTML pages. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2010 and the growing concerns with Flash's security, the role of Flash is decreasing. \n\nIn addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks use the same technology as JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. However, frameworks smooth over inconsistencies between Web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[Software widget|widgets]]' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. \n\nOn the [[Server side|server-side]], Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], as well as [[J2EE|Enterprise Java (J2EE)]] and [[.NET Framework|Microsoft.NET Framework]], are used by developers to output data dynamically using information from files and databases. This allows websites and web services to share [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] formats such as [[XML]] ([[Atom (standard)|Atom]], [[RSS]], etc.) and [[JSON]]. When data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|integrate a portion of that site's functionality]].\n\n==Concepts==\n[[File:Qualitydimensions.png|thumb|alt=Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, encyclopedias and Wikipedia|Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] and [[Wikipedia]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=W\u0142odzimierz |last2=W\u0119cel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2019 |title=Multilingual Ranking of Wikipedia Articles with Quality and Popularity Assessment in Different Topics |journal=Computers |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=60 |doi=10.3390/computers8030060 |doi-access=free }}</ref>]]\nWeb 2.0 can be described in three parts:\n* [[Rich Internet application]] (RIA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines the experience brought from desktop to browser, whether it is \"rich\" from a graphical point of view or a usability/interactivity or features point of view.\n* [[Web-oriented architecture]] (WOA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 applications expose their functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications. Examples are [[Web feed|feeds]], [[RSS feed]]s, [[web services]], [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].\n* [[Social Web]]&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 websites tend to interact much more with the end user and make the end user an integral part of the website, either by adding his or her profile, adding comments on content, uploading new content, or adding [[user-generated content]] (e.g., personal [[digital photo]]s).\n\nAs such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[Client (computing)|client]]- and [[Server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented Web browsers may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and software extensions to handle the content and user interactions.

[[Wiki]] users may extend, undo, redo and edit each other's work. Comment systems allow readers to contribute their viewpoints.\n; '''T'''ags\n: Categorization of content by users adding \"tags\"&nbsp;\u2014 short, usually one-word or two-word descriptions&nbsp;\u2014 to facilitate searching. For example, a user can tag a metal song as \"[[death metal]]\". Collections of tags created by many users within a single system may be referred to as \"folksonomies\" (i.e., [[Folk taxonomy|folk]] [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]]).\n; '''E'''xtensions\n: Software that makes the Web an [[application platform]] as well as a document server. Examples include [[Adobe Reader]], [[Adobe Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight]], [[ActiveX]], [[Java programming language|Oracle Java]], [[QuickTime]], and [[Windows Media]].\n; Signals\n: The use of syndication technology, such as [[RSS]] feeds to notify users of content changes.\n\nWhile SLATES forms the basic framework of Enterprise 2.0, it does not contradict all of the higher level Web 2.0 design patterns and business models. It includes discussions of self-service IT, the long tail of enterprise IT demand, and many other consequences of the Web 2.0 era in enterprise uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=71 |title=Web 2.0 definition updated and Enterprise 2.0 emerges |last=Hinchcliffe |first=Dion |date=November 5, 2006 |website=ZDNet blogs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129225858/http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=71 |archivedate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nDocuments of Web 2.0 can be assessed by [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] related to such [[data quality|quality]] dimension as [[Web accessibility|accessibility]], [[Completeness (knowledge bases)|completeness]], [[credibility]], involvement, [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], [[readability]], [[relevance]], [[reputation]], [[Writing style|style]], timeliness, uniqueness and usefulness<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=W\u0142odzimierz |date=2019-01-03 |title=Measures for Quality Assessment of Articles and Infoboxes in Multilingual Wikipedia |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330087836 |journal=Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing |volume=339 |issue= |pages=619\u2013633 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-04849-5_53|isbn=978-3-030-04848-8 }}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nA third important part of Web 2.0 is the [[social web]]. The social Web consists of a number of online tools and platforms where people share their perspectives, opinions, thoughts and experiences.

For example, in the Talis white paper \"Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation\", [[Paul Miller (journalist)|Paul Miller]] argues\n\n<blockquote>Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.<ref>Miller 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nHere, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a \"Library 2.0\". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods. The meaning of Web 2.0 is role dependent. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to \"end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |title=i-Technology Viewpoint: It's Time to Take the Quotation Marks Off \"Web 2.0\" &#124; Web 2.0 Journal |publisher=Web2.sys-con.com |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216062850/http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |archive-date=2011-02-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nThere is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education.

A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, [[customer service]] enhancement, product or service improvement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis\u2014Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content&nbsp;\u2014 to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. \n\nAnother marketing Web 2.0 lure is to make sure consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing.<ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | title=The Secrets of Marketing in a Web 2.0 World | last=Parise | first=Salvatore | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=2008-12-16 | access-date=2017-08-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710043624/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | archive-date=2017-07-10 | url-status=live }}\n</ref> Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing.

The brand of tourist destinations can be built through marketing campaigns on social media and by engaging with customers. For example, the \u201cSnow at First Sight\u201d campaign launched by the [[Colorado|State of Colorado]] aimed to bring brand awareness to Colorado as a winter destination. The campaign used social media platforms, for example, Facebook and Twitter, to promote this competition, and requested the participants to share experiences, pictures and videos on social media platforms. As a result, Colorado enhanced their image as a winter destination and created a campaign worth about $2.9 million.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe tourism organisation can earn brand royalty from interactive marketing campaigns on social media with engaging passive communication tactics. For example, \u201cMoms\u201d advisors of the [[Walt Disney World]] are responsible for offering suggestions and replying to questions about the family trips at Walt Disney World. Due to its characteristic of expertise in Disney, \u201cMoms\u201d was chosen to represent the campaign.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Simon|last2=Thal|first2=Karen|date=2013-01-01|title=The Impact of Social Media on the Consumer Decision Process: Implications for Tourism Marketing|journal=Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing|volume=30|issue=1\u20132|pages=156\u2013160|doi=10.1080/10548408.2013.751276|issn=1054-8408}}</ref> Social networking sites, such as Facebook, can be used as a platform for providing detailed information about the marketing campaign, as well as real-time online communication with customers.

[[WYSIWYG]] [[wiki]] and [[blog]]ging sites replicate many features of PC authoring applications. Several browser-based services have emerged, including [[EyeOS]]<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/\n|title=Can eyeOS Succeed Where Desktop.com Failed?\n|work=www.techcrunch.com\n|accessdate=2007-12-12\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212023338/http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/\n|archive-date=2007-12-12\n|url-status=live\n}}\n</ref> and [[YouOS]].(No longer active.)<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html\n|title=Tech Beat Hey YouOS!&nbsp;\u2013 BusinessWeek\n|publisher=www.businessweek.com\n|accessdate=2007-12-12\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217040221/http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html\n|archive-date=2007-12-17\n|url-status=live\n}}\n</ref> Although named [[operating systems]], many of these services are application platforms. They mimic the user experience of desktop operating systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these so-called \"operating systems\" do not directly control the hardware on the client's computer. Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers.\n\n==Distribution of media==\n\n===XML and RSS===\nMany regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another Web site, a [[browser plugin]], or a separate desktop application). Protocols permitting syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as Web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of which are [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[Web feed]]s. Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites and permit end-users to interact without centralized Web sites.\n\n===Web APIs===\n{{Main|Web API}}\nWeb 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[Application programming interface]]s (API), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self-describing once an entry [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP Application programming interface and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of Web service specifications]].\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics of the term claim that \"Web 2.0\" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called \"Web 1.0\" technologies and concepts.<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\" /> First, techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], but add a layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 were already featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term \"Web 2.0\" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Amazon Web Services API\n|work=O'Reilly Network\n|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly\n|date=2002-06-18\n|accessdate=2006-05-27\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613235806/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|archivedate=2006-06-13\n}}</ref> Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena that preceded Web 2.0.

For many people who work in software, version numbers like 2.0 and 3.0 are for [[software versioning]] or hardware versioning only, and to assign 2.0 arbitrarily to many technologies with a variety of real version numbers has no meaning.  The web does not have a version number.  For example, in a 2006 interview with [[IBM]] [[developerWorks]] podcast editor Scott Laningham, Tim Berners-Lee described the term \"Web 2.0\" as a jargon:<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821185101/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |archive-date=2012-08-21 |url-status=live }}\n</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Nobody really knows what it means... If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along... Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [to the] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people is really what the Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact.\"</blockquote> Other critics labeled Web 2.0 \"a second bubble\" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of [[business model]]s.

Keen's 2007 book, ''[[Cult of the Amateur]]'', argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as \"creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels...

For instance, Twitter offers online tools for users to create their own tweet, in a way the users are doing all the work when it comes to producing media content. At the heart of Web 2.0's participatory culture is an inherent disregard for privacy, although it was not much of an issue for giant platforms like Facebook and Google, as users are discovering and exploring the internet because they want users to participate and create more content. More importantly, because user participation creates fresh content and profile data that are useful for third parties such as advertising corporates and national security. Therefore, suppression of privacy is built into the business model of Web 2.0 and one should not be too tied up to the optimistic notion of Web 2.0 being the next evolutionary step for digital media.\n\n==Trademark==\nIn November 2004, [[CMP Media]] applied to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] for a [[service mark]] on the use of the term \"WEB 2.0\" for live events.<ref name=\"uspto\">{{cite web |url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |title=USPTO serial number 78322306 |publisher=Tarr.uspto.gov |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113155427/http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |archive-date=2011-01-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the basis of this application, CMP Media sent a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] demand to the Irish non-profit organisation IT@Cork on May 24, 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=O'Reilly and CMP Exercise Trademark on 'Web 2.0' |work=Slashdot |url=http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/26/1238245 |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2006-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511040244/http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F05%2F26%2F1238245 |archive-date=2009-05-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> but retracted it two days later.<ref>{{cite web | title=O'Reilly's coverage of Web 2.0 as a service mark | work=O'Reilly Radar | url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html | first = Nathan | last = Torkington | date=2006-05-26 | accessdate=2006-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115224430/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html|archivedate=15 January 2008}}</ref> The \"WEB 2.0\" service mark registration passed final PTO Examining Attorney review on May 10, 2006, and was registered on June 27, 2006.<ref name=\"uspto\"/> The [[European Union]] application (which would confer unambiguous status in Ireland)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212#|title=Application number 004972212|year=2007|access-date=2010-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512034116/http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212|archive-date=2013-05-12|url-status=live}}</ref> was declined on May 23, 2007.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cloud computing]]\n* [[Collective intelligence]]\n* [[Connectivity (media)|Connectivity]] of social media\n* [[Crowd computing]]\n* [[Enterprise social software]]\n* [[Mass collaboration]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Office suite]]\n* [[Open source governance]]\n* [[Privacy issues of social networking sites]]\n* [[Social commerce]]\n* [[Social shopping]]\n* [[Web 2.0 for development]] (web2fordev)\n* [[Semantic Web#Web 3.0|Web 3.0]]\n* [[You (Time Person of the Year)]]\n* [[Libraries in Second Life]]\n* [[List of free software for Web 2.0 Services]]\n* [[Cute cat theory of digital activism]]\n\n; Application domains\n* [[Sci-Mate]]\n* [[Business 2.0]]\n* [[Learning 2.0|E-learning 2.0]]\n* [[e-Government]] (Government 2.0)\n* [[Health 2.0]]\n* [[Science 2.0]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Wikiversity-inline}}\n{{Scholia}}\n* {{cite book | title=Web 2.0 / Social Media / Social Networks|year=2017| publisher=MultiMedia| location=Charleston, South Carolina, SUA| isbn=978-1-544-63831-7}}\n\n{{Semantic Web}}\n\n[[Category:Web 2.0| ]]\n[[Category:2000s in computer science]]\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Cloud applications]]\n[[Category:Internet ages]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:New media]]\n[[Category:Social information processing]]\n[[Category:Technology neologisms]]\n[[Category:Web 2.0 neologisms| ]]\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 2000s]]\n", "name_user": "Subhamvermaa", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0"}
