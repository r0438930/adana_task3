The team is controlled by the governing body for [[football in Bhutan]], the [[Bhutan Football Federation]], which is currently a member of the [[Asian Football Federation]] and the regional body the [[South Asian Football Federation]]. Bhutan play their home games at the national stadium, [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang]]. It is one of the younger national teams in the world having played its first match in 2010. Bhutan took part in the 2014 SAFF Women's Championship in Islamabad, Pakistan at the end of 2014, losing all three games, including a 4-1 loss to host Pakistan in which Tshering Yangdon scored just the second official goal in the team's history.\n\n==History==\nBhutanese football in general came to the international stage comparatively late in the day with the [[Bhutan national football

2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because of the very under-developed state of women's football in Bhutan at this time, club teams did not exist and so the tournament consisted of teams representing individual [[Dzongkhag]]s.<ref name=\"Sarpang\" /> This competition was used not only to increase the popularity of football amongst women in the country, but also to act as means of identifying and coaching players who would form the first ever Bhutan women's national football squad.<ref name=\"Sarpang\" />\n\nTheir first ever competitive game was a friendly match against [[Bangladesh women's national football team|Bangladesh]] in [[Dhaka]] on 6 December 2010 as a warm up for their appearance at the inaugural [[2010 SAFF Women's Championship|SAFF Women's Championships]] a week later.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Unfortunately, their debut was one to forget as, having travelled to [[Cox's Bazar]] where all of the group matches were scheduled to take place, they succumbed 7\u20130 to their hosts.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Their competition proper got off to an even worse start as they lost 18\u20130 to [[India women's national football team|India]], one of the strongest teams in the region.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Bangladesh then repeated their performance in the pre-competition friendly running out 9\u20130 victors and eliminating Bhutan from the competition.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> The team were able to salvage some pride in their final game, drawing 1\u20131 with [[Sri Lanka women's national football team|Sri Lanka]], which marks their only positive result of any kind as well as their first competitive goal (one of two times they have scored a goal in a competitive match).<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Their performance at the SAFF Championships saw them gain 889 ranking points.<ref name=\"FIFARanking\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=18 March

of five competitive matches against officially ranked teams, their performance saw them achieve a higher points total than four other provisionally ranked teams: the [[United States Virgin Islands women's national soccer team|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Liberia women's national football team|Liberia]], [[Qatar women's national football team|Qatar]] and [[Afghanistan women's national football

team|Botswana]].<ref name=\"FIFARanking\" />\n\nThe women's team then withdrew from international football for the next two years, re-emerging to play in the [[2012 SAFF Women's Championship]]. Prior to the tournament in Sri Lanka, the team of twenty five, including two referees and physiotherapists, but with the playing squad consisting entirely of students, flew to [[Bangkok]] for two weeks training to get accustomed to warmer weather.<ref name=\"Bangkok\">{{cite web|url=http://raonline.ch/pages/bt/sport/bt_sportfootball0102.html|title=Women's national football team in Bangkok|last=Phuntsho|first=Tashi|date=September 2012|website=raonline.ch|publisher=[[Kuensel]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> They entered the tournament provisionally ranked 34th out of 35 in the [[Asian Football Confederation]], with only [[Afghanistan women's national football team|Afghanistan]] ranked below them, and unranked on the global listing because they had been inactive for more than eighteen months.<ref name=\"FIFARanking2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=17 August 2012|website=fifa.com|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> At this point, with their points total of 889, they had a higher technical rating than twelve teams who were either unranked due to inactivity or provisionally ranked in last place due to insufficient competition and had more ranking points than five officially ranked teams: [[Iraq women's national football team|Iraq]], [[Mozambique women's national football team|Mozambique]], [[Malawi women's national football team|Malawi]], Antigua and Barbuda and Bostswana.<ref name=\"FIFARanking2\" /> The team travelled to [[Sri Lanka]] to play their fixtures at the [[CR & FC Grounds|Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club Grounds]] and were drawn in a group with the same teams as the previous edition of the tournament. Sri Lanka took advantage of their status as hosts in the first match, beating Bhutan 4\u20130, taking the lead after just four minutes through Nilushika Kumari, with Praveena Perera wrapping up the scoring at the end of the game following two goals either side of half time from Erandi Kumudumala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goalnepal.com/matchinfo.php?id=878|title=Sri Lanka vs Bhutan - 2014 SAFF Women's Championship|date=7 September 2012|website=goalnepal.com|publisher=GoalNepal.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> Bhutan performed better in their next game, a narrow 1\u20130 loss to Bangladesh, but this eliminated them from the tournament.<ref name=\"BhutanTeam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goalnepal.com/matchinfo.php?id=888|title=Bangladesh vs Bhutan - 2014 SAFF Women's Championship|date=9 September 2012|website=goalnepal.com|publisher=GoalNepal.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> Their final match against India was very one-sided, though not as great a defeat as last time, India still ran out victors 11\u20130 sending Bhutan home without a point or a goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goalnepal.com/matchinfo.php?id=891|title=Bhutan vs India - 2014 SAFF Women's Championship|date=9 September 2012|website=goalnepal.com|publisher=GoalNepal.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nHaving now played the required five games against already ranked teams, Bhutan received their first official ranking position: 128th, ahead of Antigua and Barbuda and Botswana.<ref name=\"FIFARanking3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=7 December 2012|website=fifa.com|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> Bhutan have not played a competitive match since the 2014 SAFF Championships, but due to movements around them, did climb to a high ranking of 115th in December 2013<ref name=\"FIFARanking4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=13 December 2013|website=fifa.com|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> The team took part in the [[2014 SAFF Women's Championship]] held in November 2014 in [[Pakistan]].\n\n==Players==\nThe following 20 players were called up for the [[2019 SAFF Women's Championship]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bhutanese 20-woman Squad for 2019 SAFF Women's Championship |url= https://saffederation.org/saff-womens-championship-2019-bhutan-team/ |website=https://saffederation.org/ |publisher=SAFF |accessdate=1 April  2019}}</ref>\n{{nat fs g start}}\n{{nat fs g player |no= 1|pos=GK |name= [[Nima Lhden]]|other=| age={{Birth date and age |1992|11|20 |df=y}}|caps=0|goals=0 |club=TBD|clubnat=BHU}}\n{{nat fs g player |no= 21|pos=GK |name= [[Ngawang Chozom]]| age=|caps=0|goals=0 |club=|clubnat=BHU }}\n{{nat fs g player |no= 23|pos=GK |name= [[Sangita Monger ]]| age=|caps=0|goals=0 |club=|clubnat=BHU }}\n|-\n!

The team is controlled by the governing body for [[football in Bhutan]], the [[Bhutan Football Federation]], which is currently a member of the [[Asian Football Federation]] and the regional body the [[South Asian Football Federation]]. Bhutan play their home games at the national stadium, [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang]]. It is one of the younger national teams in the world having played its first match in 2010. Bhutan took part in the 2014 SAFF Women's Championship in Islamabad, Pakistan at the end of 2014, losing all three games, including a 4-1 loss to host Pakistan in which Tshering Yangdon scored just the second official goal in the team's history.\n\n==History==\nBhutanese football in general came to the international stage comparatively late in the day with the [[Bhutan national football

individual [[Dzongkhag]]s.<ref name=\"Sarpang\" /> This competition was used not only to increase the popularity of football amongst women in the country, but also to act as means of identifying and coaching players who would form the first ever Bhutan women's national football squad.<ref name=\"Sarpang\" />\n\nTheir first ever competitive game was a friendly match against [[Bangladesh women's national football team|Bangladesh]] in [[Dhaka]] on 6 December 2010 as a warm up for their appearance at the inaugural [[2010 SAFF Women's Championship|SAFF Women's Championships]] a week later.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Unfortunately, their debut was one to forget as, having travelled to [[Cox's Bazar]] where all of the group matches were scheduled to take place, they succumbed 7-0 to their hosts.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Their competition proper got off to an even worse start as they lost 18-0 to [[India women's national football team|India]], one of the strongest teams in the region.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Bangladesh then repeated their performance in the pre-competition friendly running out 9-0 victors and eliminating Bhutan from the competition.<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> The team were able to salvage some pride in their final game, drawing 1-1 with [[Sri Lanka women's national football team|Sri Lanka]], which marks their only positive result of any kind as well as their first competitive goal (one of two times they have scored a goal in a competitive match).<ref name=\"FIFAResults\" /> Their performance at the SAFF Championships saw them gain 889 ranking points.<ref name=\"FIFARanking\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=18 March

of five competitive matches against officially ranked teams, their performance saw them achieve a higher points total than four other provisionally ranked teams: the [[United States Virgin Islands women's national soccer team|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Liberia women's national football team|Liberia]], [[Qatar women's national football team|Qatar]] and [[Afghanistan women's national football

team|Botswana]].<ref name=\"FIFARanking\" />\n\nThe women's team then withdrew from international football for the next two years, re-emerging to play in the [[2012 SAFF Women's Championship]].

Sri Lanka took advantage of their status as hosts in the first match, beating Bhutan 4-0, taking the lead after just four minutes through Nilushika Kumari, with Praveena Perera wrapping up the scoring at the end of the game following two goals either side of half time from Erandi Kumudumala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goalnepal.com/matchinfo.php?id=878|title=Sri Lanka vs Bhutan - 2014 SAFF Women's Championship|date=7 September 2012|website=goalnepal.com|publisher=GoalNepal.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> Bhutan performed better in their next game, a narrow 1-0 loss to Bangladesh, but this eliminated them from the tournament.<ref name=\"BhutanTeam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goalnepal.com/matchinfo.php?id=888|title=Bangladesh vs Bhutan - 2014 SAFF Women's Championship|date=9 September 2012|website=goalnepal.com|publisher=GoalNepal.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> Their final match against India was very one-sided, though not as great a defeat as last time, India still ran out victors 11-0 sending Bhutan home without a point or a goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goalnepal.com/matchinfo.php?id=891|title=Bhutan vs India - 2014 SAFF Women's Championship|date=9 September 2012|website=goalnepal.com|publisher=GoalNepal.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nHaving now played the required five games against already ranked teams, Bhutan received their first official ranking position: 128th, ahead of Antigua and Barbuda and Botswana.<ref name=\"FIFARanking3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=7 December 2012|website=fifa.com|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> Bhutan have not played a competitive match since the 2014 SAFF Championships, but due to movements around them, did climb to a high ranking of 115th in December 2013<ref name=\"FIFARanking4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/women/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking |date=13 December 2013|website=fifa.com|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> The team took part in the [[2014 SAFF Women's Championship]] held in November 2014 in [[Pakistan]].\n\n==Players==\nThe following 20 players were called up for the [[2019 SAFF Women's Championship]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bhutanese 20-woman Squad for 2019 SAFF Women's Championship |url= https://saffederation.org/saff-womens-championship-2019-bhutan-team/ |website=https://saffederation.org/ |publisher=SAFF |accessdate=1 April  2019}}</ref>\n{{nat fs g start}}\n{{nat fs g player |no= 1|pos=GK |name= [[Nima Lhden]]|other=| age={{Birth date and age |1992|11|20 |df=y}}|caps=0|goals=0 |club=TBD|clubnat=BHU}}\n{{nat fs g player |no= 21|pos=GK |name= [[Ngawang Chozom]]| age=|caps=0|goals=0 |club=|clubnat=BHU }}\n{{nat fs g player |no= 23|pos=GK |name= [[Sangita Monger ]]| age=|caps=0|goals=0 |club=|clubnat=BHU }}\n|-\n!
