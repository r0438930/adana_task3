{"title_page": "F\u00e9don's rebellion", "text_new": "'''F\u00e9don's rebellion''' (also known as the '''Brigands' War''',{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{refn|Predominently by the British at the time.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}|group=note}} March 2, 1795 \u2013 June 19, 1796) was an uprising against [[Great Britain|British]] rule of [[Grenada]], predominantly led by free mixed-race [[French language|French-speakers]].  Although a significant number of slaves were involved, they fought on both sides.  The stated purpose of the rebellion was to create a black republic as had already occurred in neighbouring [[Haiti]] rather than to free slaves, so it is not properly called a [[slave rebellion]], although freedom of the slaves would have been a probable consequence of its success.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Julien F\u00e9don]],{{refn|Also given without the [[Acute accent]], and occasionally spelt Foedon or Feydon.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=xiv}}|group=note}} owner of a plantation in the mountainous interior of the island, and encouraged by [[French Revolution]]ary leaders on [[Guadeloupe]], the rebels seized control of most of the island ([[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital, was never taken), but were eventually crushed by a military expedition led by General [[Ralph Abercromby]].\n\n==Background==\nGrenada was formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=31}} The French [[French capture of Grenada 1779|re-captured the island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after [[Comte d'Estaing]] won the bloody land and naval [[Battle of Grenada]] in July 1779.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=44}} However, the island was restored to Britain with the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in 1783.{{sfn|Newman|Brown|1997|p=533}} The context of the country's political tribulations, argues Martin, was \"an oppressive slave plantation complex\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\nNews of the French revolution was, says the historian [[Kit Candlin]], \"particularly prescient\" in Grenada, especially as two-thirds of the 5,000 free population were French.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} The political upheavals in neighbouring Haiti provided the motivation for a similar rebellion in Grenada, and also provided a sufficient diversion to allow it to happen.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}} It was not, however, strictly a [[slave rebellion]]. In the aftermath, it was noted that perhaps only half the island's slave population had joined the rebels, the other half, comments Candlin, were \"found cowering in their\nplantations or discovered aimlessly wandering the island\u2019s roads, unsure of what to do\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nAt the time of the rebellion, Grenada had a population of approximately 1,125 free coloured\nresidents\u2014including 940 French free coloureds\u2014and 185 British citizens.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}} The situation was worse for the [[Free people of color|black French]], argues Martin, as\u2014even though they were [[Freedman|free]]\u2014they were generally treated as third-class citizens by both white French and the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}}\n\n==Causes of the revolution==\nInternal grievances, rather than external influence, were the fundamental cause of F\u00e9don's rebellion, argues the scholar John Angus Martin, being an \"anti-discriminatory rebellion for social, political and religious rights by the French who orchestrated and led the rebellion against the British colonial\ngovernment\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There were some external influences: the biggest was the [[French Revolution]] and its ideology, [[Tom Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', the revolt in Haiti and the general discontent that pervaded the Caribbean during the period.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The had been a smouldering discontent with the British administration for some time before the rebellion.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=1\u20132}} The rebellion, led as it was by slave owners and planters rather than the salves themselves indicates that the French revolution that inspired it was seen as a method of enabling social mobility for the French rather than to free slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nBritish governance of the island was becoming \"increasingly harsh\", suggests Martin,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} especially against the French\u2014and Catholic{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}}\u2014inhabitants whose previous political and social influence and power was now increasingly restricted by the new management.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} Although the intention to allow a form of [[Representative government]] had been declared in a [[royal proclamation]],{{sfn|Muller|2017|p=139}} this was continually deferred due to British suspicions that any democratic assembly would be dominated by the French.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}{{refn|Britain's harsh treatment of the Grenadans, suggest Candlin, can be compared to that of the Spanish who \"showed a particularly lenient attitude to people of mixed race\" and encouraged emigration to their [[Trinidad]] lands.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}|group=note}} The large number of French coloureds worried the British, who, says Candlin \"regarded them first with deep suspicion then actively\ntried to oppress them through legislation, each law underscoring further the inherent dif\ufb01culty members of the white community had at distinguishing friend from foe\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}{{refn|Legislation included restrictions on the holding of unregulated ceremonies, coloureds being forbidden to walk at night without a lantern to light them, a [[curfew]] and weapons restrictions.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}|group=note}} On one occasion, F\u00e9don's wife had been arrested for breaching a restriction and had been imprisoned for some weeks before he could secure her release.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}} For their part, the British\u2014who knew what had happened in other islands\u2014expected \"anarchy, confusion and killings...Increasingly the governor\u2019s correspondence was \ufb01lled with worries for security and his fear of the island's French inhabitants, especially the free coloureds\". {{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}}\n\n===Planning===\nIt is possible that the planning of the rebellion took up to 18 months. The conspiracy was composed of a [[kernal]] of around 50 individuals and of diverse social composition, including white [[bourgeoise]] and free-French blacks. No slaves, however, appear to have been involved in the planning stages of the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nSupplies were initially received by French revolutionaries in [[Guadeloupe]]\u2014including [[materiel]] and financing\u2014under [[Victor Hugues]].{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The conspiracy had been successfully hidden from the authorities, notes Martin, and \"it wasn't until the day leading up to the rebellion that some British residents began to notice unusual activities among the rebels, but by then it was too late to act\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nThe conspirators' headquarters was F\u00e9don's remote [[plantation]] in Belvidere Estate.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} This was situated up a mountain in the middle of a cocoa and coffee plantation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} In February, F\u00e9don despatched Nogues and Lavalee to Guadeloupe, seeking the assistance of the new French republican government under [[Victor Huges]]. Only absent a few days, when they returned it was bearing the rank of captain in the French revolutionary army and a large supply of arms, tricolour [[cockade]]s and [[Phrygian cap|liberty caps]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}}\n\n===Participants===\nCandlin has estimated that around 12,500 slaves took an active role in the rebellion, or half the island's slave population.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}{{refn|Many others, she notes, \"hedged their bets or took opportunities as they came\", for instance, to escape the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}|group=note}} Although the slaves who revolted were doing so for with the aim of their own emancipation as their primary goal, they appear to have had a longer-term intention of abolishing the system itself.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There was, however, a \"stark diversity of ideas and personalities\" among them.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Many had been business associates of F\u00e9don and his brothers-in-law, or legal witnesses to deeds and charters.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}}\n\nLeaders included F\u00e9don's brother-in-law [[Charles Nogues]]{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[Jean Pierre Lavallee]],{{refn|Ocassionally Lavelette.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=14\u201315}}|group=note}} who were close friends with Victor Hughes; Hughes looked protected Nogues' son while the rebellion was ongoing.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} Nogues wasa prominent [[tailor]] on the island,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} and was also Philip's brother-in-law.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} Prominent whites included [[Clozier d'Arcuiel]], [[Jean Baptiste Olliviere]] and the [[Chevalier du Suze]] who were important strategists in the military campaign as well as its administration.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} As well as Nogue, leading freed men included [[Stanislaus Besson]], [[Etienne Ventour]]\u2014a \"hothead\", suggests Candlin{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}\u2014and [[Joachim Phillip]],{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} a coloured free [[Coloniser|planter]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} F\u00e9don appears to have come under internal criticism for a having a dictatorial approach.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\n====Leadership====\nF\u00e9don was both [[General]] of the army and head of the revolutionary council, known as the \"Commission of the 24\", which, despite concerns as to his dictatorial attitude, F\u00e9don does seem to have regularly requested advice from.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} The leadership element was particularly concentrated in residents of the parishes of [[Saint John Parish, Grenada|St John]] and [[Gouyave]]. F\u00e9don, for example, was from the latter, as were a number of \"prominent whites\" he associated with.{{sfn|Martin|2017|pp=13\u201314}} Much of F\u00e9don's immediate support came from his relatives, either by blood or by marriage.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} Another leading figure, [[Joachim Philip]], was, according to Candlin, a \"most interesting man\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}} From a large and extremely prosperous family of Grenadian planters, with much standing in the community,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} he felt that he had been repeatedly ignored for office or patronage by the British administration.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}{{refn|His family was also already known to the governor, Home. In 1793 his father Michael had submitted a request to the administration for small arms to defend [[Petite Martinique]]; \"unable to countenance such an idea, in the margin of the request Ninian Home scribbled 'not complied with'\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}|group=note}} The rebellion's leadership, suggests Candlin, was composed of \"tightly knit series of free coloured families who all intermarried\". F\u00e9don's deputy in the rebellion, Besson, was a local [[silversmith]]; Philip was a carpenter. Personally, F\u00e9don was heavily [[mortgage]]d.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}}\n\n==Outbreak and the first week of operations==\nBy 1 March 1795, Governor home, Candlin argues, was \"increasingly desperate and\naware that something might be afoot\". The [[militia]] was raised, but\u2014in a continuance of the heavy-handed treatment of the island's coloured population\u2014the coloured members of the militia were excluded from the general call to arms. This created further ill-feeling, and may, suggest Candlin, encouraged those members to join, rather than resist, the rebels. Home's actions may have forced F\u00e9don's hand in the timing of the rebellion: \"On an island where distrust and disloyalty were salient features, keeping covert plans secret was impossible\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}} F\u00e9don\u2014now holding the rank of General\u2014directed the opening assaults on the night of 2\u20133 March 1795,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} simultaneously attacking the towns of Gouyave and [[Grenville, Grenada|Grenville]], in the parishes of St John and St Andrew respectively.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} \n\n===Massacre at Grenville=== \nIn the east, at the small village of Grenville, the insurgents attacked and overran the town.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{refn|F\u00e9don later blamed this massacre on a non-existent French Revolutionary army he claimed had invaded.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}|group=note}} about seven miles from Belvidere.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=15, 16}} At midnight F\u00e9don and Besson, leading a group of about 100 freedmen{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}}\u2014some of whom guarded the entrances to the village to prevent anyone escaping\u2014attacked. They forced 20 white residents from their houses and into the market place, where they were all shot and the bodies then cut up with cutlasses. This, says Candlin, was done to \"the cheers of their free coloured neighbours\". Two whites escaped, and the town was looted.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}} F\u00e9don and his force withdrew with hostages to their headquarters in Belvidere.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} ''En route'', some of these\u2014including an old priest and a [[Piloting (navigation)|pilot]]\u2014were shot dead.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} They also returned to Belvidere, capturing more hostages and gathering more support as they did.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}\n\n===Assault on Gouyave===\nGouyave was on the west coast of the island and was attacked at the same time as Grenville, although with far less violence. This force was led by Philip and Ventour, and included both white French and coloured men. Although there were no deaths in Gouyave, the town was also looted, with houses being ransacked and torched.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} The leader of the local militia, says Candlin, Dr Hay \"and his family could expect no quarter\", although in the event they were spared. Candlin speculates that this may have been because he and Ventour were neighbours, or perhaps more likely, because of the value a medical doctor was recognised as having to the rebel army.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} The only injury was suffered by Ventour, who shot himself in the wrist while confiscating Hay's pistols. The white men were taken hostage and marched off to Belvidere, while, says Candlin, French coloured women \"enjoyed the scene below from their balconies\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}{{refn|Candlin argues that the relative lack of violence done in Gouyave may have been due to Philip, who, she suggests, had \"more to lose\" than his comrades.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}|group=note}} \n\n===Marching on St George's===\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Without entering into any detail of our rights, we summon you, and all the inhabitants, of every denomination in this colony, to surrender, within the space of two hours, to the republican forces under our command...And we give you notice, that in case of your not submitting, as you are enjoined, you shall be liable to all the scourges of a disastrous war ...\nDone at our camp, the fourth of March in the third year of the French Republic, one and indivisible.\nJulien F\u00e9don, Of\ufb01cer of the Republic, appointed at Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Julien F\u00e9don, 4 March 1796|align=right|width=25em}}\n\nBy the morning of 4 March, the rebel army approached St George's. Drumming themselves on, they were heard at a distance; one commentator later wrote how the local [[militia]] declared they would defend their lives, families and properties or die in the attempt. It was, said the observer, \"a chaotic and most melancholy scene\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} A delegation comprising Nogues and Philip demanded access to the gubernatorial council; this was granted and they proceeded to make two proclamations. The first\u2014\"chillingly uncompromising\"\u2014was from F\u00e9don, demanding the British surrender. The next speech had been prepared by Victor Huges, emphasising the extent of his victory over the British at Guadaloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Time and the defeat of the English forces at Guadeloupe had weakened the remembrance of the heinous crimes by which the vile satellites of GEORGE had sullied the Windward Islands...that from and after the date of this our of\ufb01cial declaration, the assassination of each and every individual republican (of whatever colour he is; and in whatever island it may happen) shall be expiated by the death of two English of\ufb01cers, our prisoners.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Victor Huges to the British council in St George's, 4 March 1796|align=left|width=25em}}\n\nNogues and Philip were fed and watered by the British\u2014which \"they calmly enjoyed\"\u2014while the latter went into consultation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}} Outside, meanwhile, the rest of the gang that had accompanied them was becoming increasingly fractious and was being continually augmented by supporters in St George's. The British procrastinated, suggests Candlin, probably because the deputy governor, one McKenzie, was unused to taking command.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nThe rebels, who identified strongly with the French Revolution, wore [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour sashes]] and declaimed ''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|Libert\u00e9, equalit\u00e9 ou la mort]]'' (\"liberty, equality or death\") as their slogan,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} which was engraved on their brass helmets.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\nBy the end of the week, the rebel ranks had swollen to over 7,000 people, comprising coloured and black freemen, whites and self-emancipated.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Only a few hours into the rebellion\u2014\"with a combination of planning and good fortune\", comments Martin\u2014they captured [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Grenada|the island's governor]], [[Ninian Home]]. This was not only a propaganda coup for the rebels but physically inhibited the British response to the rising by his enforced absence from leadership.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} Home, and many other hostages, were kept tied to a [[Buccan|boucan frame]] for drying coffee.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} The rebels announced that any Frenchman who failed to join the insurrection would be deemed an enemy to the enterprise, outlawed and they goods confiscated.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}\n\n===British response===\nThe British, besieged in the south in the capital, [[St. George's, Grenada|St George's]], were taken by surprise, and this frustrated their efforts at a concerted response.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although in disarray, when the rebels called upon the administration to dissolve itself, the British were unwilling to do so.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although Nogues' and Philip's negotiations with McKenzie lasted three hours, they left with nothing tangible to show for it, and it is likely that the deputy governor expected reinforcements shortly. This belief enabled McKenzie to dismiss the rebels' demands, saying, \"with some stoicism...that any British governor, indeed any British subject, imprisoned or otherwise would rather die with honour than face the ignominy of surrendering an island to slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} McKenzie wrote to London demanding reinforcements, emphasising the precarious nature of British rule following the rebellion:\n\n{{blockquote|text=Every moment of inactivity must increase the evil within, as the Negroes are daily joining the Insurgents and desolating the Estates; all of which have been plundered, and a number in the neighbourhood of St George's...have been burnt\".{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=143}}}}\n\n==Course of the rebellion==\nThe rebels received further assistance from Hughes, in the form of armed squadrons, which had sufficient success to establish an administrative ''[[Department (country subdivision)|d\u00e9partment]]'' under the rebels' direct control.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}\n\nThe rebellion, argues Martin, \"raged for 15 months, and saw extreme brutality and destruction\" take place.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Many of the white french rebels surrendered to the British as the rebellion increased in ferocity; they may have felt more endangered from the rebels than from the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nAlthough the rebels massively outnumbered the British, F\u00e9don's side lacked the experienced tacticians and strategists possessed by the British, and their assaults\u2014while large-scale and brutal\u2014were disorganised.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although controlled most of the countryside, F\u00e9don's army was unable to displace the British from St George's, while the latter also had the advantage of [[Royal Navy|superior sea power]]. This was used to great effect, eventually cutting Grenada off from its supply lines to St Lucia and Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\nSickness, mostly from [[Yellow fever]], pervaded the British Army.{{refn|In [[British America|Colonial times]] and during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area. The mortality rate in British garrisons in [[Jamaica]] was seven times that of garrisons in Canada, mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases.{{sfn|McNeill|2002|pp=10\u201316}}|group=note}} In April, a British [[Brigadier-General]], [[Colin Lindsay]], was so distraught with the fever that he left his camp, went out into the rain, and shot himself.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\nLittle activity from either side is known of between the initial rebel attacks and May 1795; the rebels may have spent their time consolidating the defences at Belvidere; Philip's brother was a trained [[Stone mason|mason]], notes Candlin, and this would have been a particularly useful skill in this regard.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=17\u201318}} The rebels were still disorganised, so intensive training was probably undertaken, while the presence of a large number of women and children made it necessary for them to be looked after.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} The British limited their actions to circulating bills around the anglophone community urging them to remember their duty as subjects of [[George III]], while calling on the French-speaking populace to return to the fold.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}}\n\n===Attack on Belvidere===\nIn May 1795, the British launched a surprise night-attack on F\u00e9don's Belvidere base with a force comprising reinforcements from [[Barbados]] and the sailors and marines from a passing British [[frigate]]; also present were a number of Spanish soldiers sent by the governor of [[Trinidad]] in sympathy. The army's commander, Lindsay, had killed himself, so the command fell to his inexperienced subordinate, Colonel Schaw. The British troops, in particular, were weakened by sickness, and this lost them the element of surprise they had relied on for victory.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}{{refn|They were not always weak with sickness; before the assault on Belvidere was finally launched, the attack had already been cancelled twice through the troops getting plastered on good [[rum]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}|group=note}}\n\nAs the Belvidere Estate was situated on elevated ground, the British were at a severe tactical disadvantage.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} Further, the rebels had spent the preceding weeks fortifying it with a number of levels of defence.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}{{refn|The defences were good enough that, later on, British officers assumed that they had to have been a long time in the preparation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}|group=note}} The outer layer of defence\u2014known as ''Fraternit\u00e9''\u2014held the majority of the rebel army, including artillery, behind a complex of [[earthworks (military)|earthworks]]. Above that was ''Libert\u00e9'', which contained the estate buildings itself and the rebel headquarters. The third and last camp\u2014''Morte''\u2014was by way of being a redoubt at the last line of defence.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}\n\nThe British attacked from several directions simultaneously, supported by both cannon and cavalry.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} The fighting was bitter, and Dr Hay was responsible for the rebels' medical station in ''Libert\u00e9''.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=7, 17}} F\u00e9don's brother, Jean, was killed in the intense fighting.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} and F\u00e9don later suggested that no [[No quarter|quarter]] was given the rebels. The attack, however, had dissipated by morning. The failure was the result, says Candlin, of \"poor coordination, coupled with bad weather and mere bad luck\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n====Murder of the hostages====\nIn retaliation for the attack on Belvidere, F\u00e9don had the 44 of his 47 hostages killed: \"one by one\", comments Candlin, \"the prisoners were dragged from the coffee store into the estate courtyard and shot,\ntheir blood mingling with the muddy, rain-soaked ground and running in great streams off the hillside\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=8, 18}}{{refn|Joachim Philip's brother Nicholas had been responsible for guarding the prisoners, and he was also in charge of their execution, including the provision of a [[coup de grace]] when necessary.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} This number included the island's governor, Ninian Home. Among those whom Fr\u00e9don allowed to live was a \"much-loved\" [[Anglican]] vicar\u2014who, Candlin suggests may have been known to F\u00e9don\u2014a Dr Hay, and a fellow named Kerr. Dr Hay was spared because, as a medical doctor, his skills would come in handy to the rebels; why who Kerr was, o why he was spared, is unknown, but in his memoirs, Dr Hay asserted that Kerr was probably a rebel spy among the hostages.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n===Haitus===\nThe assault on Belvidere and the killings of the hostages was followed, comments Candlin, by a \"bizarre year-long standoff\". On F\u00e9don's part, this was because he had neither the troops nor the resources to maintain an army in the field for any length of time,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} although he was joined by a number of English-speaking slaves from British estates.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} Neither, for that matter, did the British; but they were waiting for the men and supplies that were gradually reached them by sea.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}\n\nThe failure of the attack on St George's meant that the British remained in control of the most important strategic site on the island, and to where they could be regularly revictualled. F\u00e9don, meanwhile, remained in command of most of the island. His army needed feeding, but he had no effective strategy for this and mainly relied on hand-to-mouth pillaging of by now-deserted estates. Although originally a rich vein of succour, these estates\u2014by now producing nothing due to the war\u2014were gradually becoming less and less profitable for the rebels. This was reflected generally: says Candlin, \"the island\u2019s produce was destroyed,\nthere were no crops and the economy completely collapsed\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}\n\n==Support==\n===External===\nCommunication was maintained with fellow revolutionaries in Haiti, Guadaloupe{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[St Lucia]], although this was a somewhat \"uneasy relationship\", suggests Martin, as F\u00e9don, on the one hand, wanted as much assistance as he could receive, but on the other was wary of allowing external forces too much influence within his movement.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} As a result, he increasingly ignored the exhortations of his comrades on St Lucia to unity and enforced his own strategy and discipline.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} F\u00e9don and Philip both had siblings who had emigrated to Trinidad prior to the rebellion and it is probable that they also provided external support for the rebels.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} \n\nIt seems likely, says Martin, that while French revolutionaries elsewhere in the Caribbean wanted more direct involvement in F\u00e9don's rebellion, he went to lengths to limit their active participation because \"he did not want checks on his own authority\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} He suggests, furthermore, that this backing was \"vital to the success of the rebellion, and it proved detrimental when British forces\nsucceeded in cutting it off\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}{{refn|Which they managed to do, says Candlin, despite having no small ships available to patrol the sea. However, there were sufficient [[ships of the line]] in the area to ensure an effective blockade of Grenada,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} as the Royal Navy had maintained a presence in the Caribbean since the [[Seven Years' War]].{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=143}}|group=note}}\n\n===Internal dissention===\nFrom almost the point the rebellion had been declared, rifts appeared in the ranks. In the first week, a mutinous rebel shot Lavalee, and was then himself [[Execution by firing squad|ordered executed]] by F\u00e9don. Martin suggests that internal relations went downhill rapidly on account of the rebels' failure to swiftly overcome the British forces.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Nogues, too, seems to have fallen out with the leadership relatively quickly; although an original member of the Commission of 24, he left it soon after the rebellion broke out.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin notes that the causes of Nogues' falling out with F\u00e9don is now unknown, but in a letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand urged him to strive for unity:{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We are pained to see how divided you are; the enemy will hear of it, and will take advantage of it to fall upon you and defeat you. Let ambition give way to love of the Republic. It is impossible for you all to be in charge; obey those who command you and do not force us to use harsh measures against you. Listen to our appeals, they are for your own good.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}}}\n\n[[Gaspar Goyrand]], in St Lucia, wrote that he had heard that \"several individuals have desired to act a part in this revolution, who, from a spirit of jealousy, of ambition, or the insanity of pride, have endeavoured to revive prejudices condemned to profound oblivion\".{{sfn|Hay|1823|p=44}} He reminded F\u00e9don that, for as long as his \"ambition [is] to wear epaulettes\" rather than unite his army, he was hurting the rebellion's chances.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n===Summoned by Goyrand===\nIn October 1795, Goyrand finally took action against F\u00e9don's increasing distancing. Goyrand ordered the dissolution of the Commission of 24 and summoned F\u00e9don to Guadeloupe. Nogues had brought charges against F\u00e9don, and Goyrand was investigating, but F\u00e9don failed to appear. As a result, he was stripped of his command of the French revolutionary troops in Grenada he had been sent, although he maintained his control of the freedmen and slaves.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n==Collapse of the rebellion==\nIn the meantime, Britain had been organising an [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] under [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]] to take back the island. Although \"long overdue\",{{refn|Abercromby had been appointed in June 1795.{{sfn|Divall|2019|pp=72\u201373}}|group=note}} suggests Candlin, it arrived in June 1796.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} Abercromby was a highly experienced editor{{refn|A strong supporter of the [[American Revolution]], he had buggered about in Ireland in order to avoid being sent to fight there for Britain. When war with France broke out in 1793, however, he was appointed command of a brigade under the [[Prince Frederick, 1st Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for service in the [[Netherlands]], where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis|Le Cateau]]. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]] and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}|group=note}} and Candlin estimates that it took only a fortnight to [[rout]] F\u00e9don's rebel army and regain the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}\n\nThe British had regained control of most of the island, and now, comments Martin, \"the might of the [[British Empire|Brotish Empire]] descended\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} The effectiveness of the British assault led to large losses among the slaves,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and by this point, F\u00e9don and his colleagues would have been focussing their energies in escaping Grenada, suggest Candlin.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} He had a number of near misses from being captured. A British official later recorded that, on one such occasion, F\u00e9don launched himself \"down a place where [no man] dare venture after him. His object and that of the few remaining in the woods was to get off in a canoe. We have...destroyed several that were preparing for that purpose\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}}\n\n==Consequences==\nFollowing the collapse of the rebellion, a [[Bill of attainder]] was promulgated which condemned 400 people.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} 200 rebels were enslaved{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and 50 executed.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Overall, approximately 25% of the island's slave population\u2014around 7,000 people\u2014died during the revolt. Another 500\u2014charged with being in possession of arms\u2014were sold off the island.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} F\u00e9don's fate is unknown, comments Candlin, \"only a compass in an upturned rowboat tantalizing\" scholars as to his end. The fact that the boat was pointing towards Trinidad when it was found suggested to contemporaries that he had drowned attempting to join his sister there.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}}{{refn|On the other hand, a report as late as 1815, from [[Ralph James Woodford|Sir Ralph Woodford]], Governor of Trinidad, that F\u00e9don had been recently sighted in [[Cuba]]. However, the Spanish government disallowed an investigation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}}|group=note}} Candlin inclines to the theory that\u2014\"Given the interconnectedness of relatives in Trinidad and Grenada\"\u2014it is most likely that he survived and went into hiding in the former.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Philip, on the other hand, stayed in Grenada, successfully hiding from the authorities for eight years\u2014possibly as a \"maroon\" in the forest, suggested an official report\u2014when he was discovered on Petite Martinique. He was tried and hanged St George's in 1803.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=19}} Candlin notes that, while those directly involved could not expect to receive mercy\u2014and did not\u2014those who managed to \"managed to keep a low pro\ufb01le away from the violence and at relative peace with their neighbours fared better\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=19}} Coloured freedmen who survived \"now found themselves open to abuse on the streets, their homes invaded and their property taken\", argues Candlin.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=36}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nDue to the ultimate failure of the rebellion, it impossible for scholars to know what would have happened consequently. Martin suggests that the most likely immediate result would have been\u2014mirroring Haiti\u2014the abolishing of slavery.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\nGoyrand, in St Lucia, put the failing of the rebellion down to the rebels' lack of unity. In a later letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand told him that{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We had predicted, citizen, you are divided, you were overcome, thus re-join that love of the Republic to replace your ambitious desires. We want to send you forces to repair the loss that disunion has just made you.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}}}\n\nAs a result of his falling out with F\u00e9don, Nogues left Grenada and joined Goyrand's staff in St Lucia.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin argues that the ideological and strategic divisions within the rebel leadership fundamentally weakened it, and made it incapable of meeting the increasingly effective sorties of the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\nThe rebellion has been estimated to have caused around {{Inflation|UK|250000|1795|fmt=c}} worth of damage to Grenada, and severely, limited the island's future sugar production.{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=144}} Every plantation had been at least partially destroyed, and in many cases, totally. This compares to Grenada's pre-rebellion position as producing the British Caribbean's send-largest annual income of {{Inflation|UK|450000|1795|fmt=c}}, which the rebellion wiped out.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=35}} Candlin summarises the after-effects of the rebellion thus:\n\n{{blockquote|text=The Royal Navy now patrolled the coastline in force. There was now no argument or protest from the French community, no truculent local councilmen or companies badgering to turn a pro\ufb01t, just grateful British planters and merchants at least thankful that order had been restored. The con\ufb02ict had cleared the way for a widespread [[Anglicanization]] of the island and a dramatic increase in colonial power.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=35\u201336}}}}\n\nThe rebellion probably influenced the [[Second Carib War|revolt in St Vincent]] in 1796, in which rebels held the country for six months before being crushed by Abercromby.{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=144}} \n\n==Historiography==\n===Sourcing===\nThe main sources for scholars of F\u00e9don's Rebellion are original documents, mostly held at the [[National Archives (UK)|the National Archives]] in [[Kew]], and a number of contemporary books. These are [[eye-witness]] descriptions of the rebellion, but are all from the perspective of the British, and, suggests Candlin, \"show a predictable bias to the eventual victors in the con\ufb02ict\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=5}} The most important near-contemporary source is a monograph by [[D. G. Garraway]] of 1877, in which he [[synthesizes]] the contemporary recollections. The rebellion remains, says Candlin however, \"of all the\nmajor slave revolts and insurrections in the Atlantic world...the least studied and the least mentioned\" in the literature.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\n===Analysis===\nMartin argues that, while \"almost all analyses of [the rebellion] define it as a slave revolt or a revolt against the slave system\", the number of white French involved necessitates a far more nuanced view.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} Candlin has argued that \"in unleashing the power of the slaves, including their own, they [the rebel leaders] had betrayed everyone who remained loyal to the old system\". {{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nMartin has compared F\u00e9don's Rebellion with the 1979 [[Grenadian Revolution]] as being equally \"defining moments\" in the history of the country, both \"for what they set out to achieve and the impact they have had on Grenadian society ever since\",{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=1}} and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]]'s main base before the uprising was named camp F\u00e9don.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} Often considered second only to the Haitian Revolution in its regional significance, and many Grenadians, he suggests, see F\u00e9don as a [[Folk hero|national hero]]. Indeed, he suggests that those who led the revolution 200 years later saw themselves as part of a historical tradition that sprang from the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}}\n\nAlthough those slaves who joined F\u00e9don's army enjoyed a greater degree of freedom than they had, the vast majority of the island's slaves watched from the sidelines. Martin suggests that choosing the wrong side would mean harsh retaliation, and they chose to avoid this.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n===Reasons for failure===\nCandlin emphasises that too little planning was to blame for the eventual failure of the rebellion, particularly regarding supplies and materiel. F\u00e9don had not planned for an eventuality in which he began running out of either, and was, therefore, surprised when this occurred. Further, too much of the island's productive machinery had been destroyed n the early weeks of the uprising without a long-term plan to replace it. F\u00e9don relied on reinforcements that never materialised.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\n==Memorials and cultural impact==\nThe 19th-century Trinidadian novelist [[Edward Lanzer Joseph]]'s ''[[Warner Arundell: The Adventures of a Creole|Warner Arundell]]'', published in 1838, is a historical register of the period in which F\u00e9don is a primary protagonist.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} A contemporary reviewer for ''[[The Literary Gazette]]'' noted that, although \"by the pen of its author, it is evidently founded on a basis of fact\".{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} In Joseph's story, F\u00e9don has survived the rebellion, and while roaming as a criminal in exile, he is haunted by a sense of failure.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brizan|first=G.

Although a significant number of slaves were involved, they fought on both sides.  The stated purpose of the rebellion was to create a black republic as had already occurred in neighbouring [[Haiti]] rather than to free slaves, so it is not properly called a [[slave rebellion]], although freedom of the slaves would have been a probable consequence of its success.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Julien F\u00e9don]],{{refn|Also given without the [[Acute accent]], and occasionally spelt Foedon or Feydon.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=xiv}}|group=note}} owner of a plantation in the mountainous interior of the island, and encouraged by [[French Revolution]]ary leaders on [[Guadeloupe]], the rebels seized control of most of the island ([[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital, was never taken), but were eventually crushed by a military expedition led by General [[Ralph Abercromby]].\n\n==Background==\nGrenada was formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=31}} The French [[French capture of Grenada 1779|re-captured the island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after [[Comte d'Estaing]] won the bloody land and naval [[Battle of Grenada]] in July 1779.{{sfn|Brizan|1984|p=44}} However, the island was restored to Britain with the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in 1783.{{sfn|Newman|Brown|1997|p=533}} The context of the country's political tribulations, argues Martin, was \"an oppressive slave plantation complex\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\nNews of the French revolution was, says the historian [[Kit Candlin]], \"particularly prescient\" in Grenada, especially as two-thirds of the 5,000 free population were French.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} The political upheavals in neighbouring Haiti provided the motivation for a similar rebellion in Grenada, and also provided a sufficient diversion to allow it to happen.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}} It was not, however, strictly a [[slave rebellion]]. In the aftermath, it was noted that perhaps only half the island's slave population had joined the rebels, the other half, comments Candlin, were \"found cowering in their\nplantations or discovered aimlessly wandering the island\u2019s roads, unsure of what to do\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nAt the time of the rebellion, Grenada had a population of approximately 1,125 free coloured\nresidents\u2014including 940 French free coloureds\u2014and 185 British citizens.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}} The situation was worse for the [[Free people of color|black French]], argues Martin, as\u2014even though they were [[Freedman|free]]\u2014they were generally treated as third-class citizens by both white French and the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=8}}\n\n==Causes of the revolution==\nInternal grievances, rather than external influence, were the fundamental cause of F\u00e9don's rebellion, argues the scholar John Angus Martin, being an \"anti-discriminatory rebellion for social, political and religious rights by the French who orchestrated and led the rebellion against the British colonial\ngovernment\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There were some external influences: the biggest was the [[French Revolution]] and its ideology, [[Tom Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'', the revolt in Haiti and the general discontent that pervaded the Caribbean during the period.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The had been a smouldering discontent with the British administration for some time before the rebellion.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=1\u20132}} The rebellion, led as it was by slave owners and planters rather than the salves themselves indicates that the French revolution that inspired it was seen as a method of enabling social mobility for the French rather than to free slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\nBritish governance of the island was becoming \"increasingly harsh\", suggests Martin,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} especially against the French\u2014and Catholic{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}}\u2014inhabitants whose previous political and social influence and power was now increasingly restricted by the new management.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} Although the intention to allow a form of [[Representative government]] had been declared in a [[royal proclamation]],{{sfn|Muller|2017|p=139}} this was continually deferred due to British suspicions that any democratic assembly would be dominated by the French.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}{{refn|Britain's harsh treatment of the Grenadans, suggest Candlin, can be compared to that of the Spanish who \"showed a particularly lenient attitude to people of mixed race\" and encouraged emigration to their [[Trinidad]] lands.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}|group=note}} The large number of French coloureds worried the British, who, says Candlin \"regarded them first with deep suspicion then actively\ntried to oppress them through legislation, each law underscoring further the inherent dif\ufb01culty members of the white community had at distinguishing friend from foe\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}{{refn|Legislation included restrictions on the holding of unregulated ceremonies, coloureds being forbidden to walk at night without a lantern to light them, a [[curfew]] and weapons restrictions.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}|group=note}} On one occasion, F\u00e9don's wife had been arrested for breaching a restriction and had been imprisoned for some weeks before he could secure her release.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}} For their part, the British\u2014who knew what had happened in other islands\u2014expected \"anarchy, confusion and killings...Increasingly the governor\u2019s correspondence was \ufb01lled with worries for security and his fear of the island's French inhabitants, especially the free coloureds\". {{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}}\n\n===Planning===\nIt is possible that the planning of the rebellion took up to 18 months. The conspiracy was composed of a [[kernal]] of around 50 individuals and of diverse social composition, including white [[bourgeoise]] and free-French blacks. No slaves, however, appear to have been involved in the planning stages of the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nSupplies were initially received by French revolutionaries in [[Guadeloupe]]\u2014including [[materiel]] and financing\u2014under [[Victor Hugues]].{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} The conspiracy had been successfully hidden from the authorities, notes Martin, and \"it wasn't until the day leading up to the rebellion that some British residents began to notice unusual activities among the rebels, but by then it was too late to act\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nThe conspirators' headquarters was F\u00e9don's remote [[plantation]] in Belvidere Estate.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} This was situated up a mountain in the middle of a cocoa and coffee plantation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} In February, F\u00e9don despatched Nogues and Lavalee to Guadeloupe, seeking the assistance of the new French republican government under [[Victor Huges]]. Only absent a few days, when they returned it was bearing the rank of captain in the French revolutionary army and a large supply of arms, tricolour [[cockade]]s and [[liberty cap]]s.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}}\n\n===Participants===\nCandlin has estimated that around 12,500 slaves took an active role in the rebellion, or half the island's slave population.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}{{refn|Many others, she notes, \"hedged their bets or took opportunities as they came\", for instance, to escape the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}|group=note}} Although the slaves who revolted were doing so for with the aim of their own emancipation as their primary goal, they appear to have had a longer-term intention of abolishing the system itself.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} There was, however, a \"stark diversity of ideas and personalities\" among them.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Many had been business associates of F\u00e9don and his brothers-in-law, or legal witnesses to deeds and charters.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}}\n\nLeaders included F\u00e9don's brother-in-law [[Charles Nogues]]{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[Jean Pierre Lavallee]],{{refn|Ocassionally Lavelette.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=14\u201315}}|group=note}} who were close friends with Victor Hughes; Hughes looked protected Nogues' son while the rebellion was ongoing.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} Nogues wasa prominent [[tailor]] on the island,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} and was also Philip's brother-in-law.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} Prominent whites included [[Clozier d'Arcuiel]], [[Jean Baptiste Olliviere]] and the [[Chevalier du Suze]] who were important strategists in the military campaign as well as its administration.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} As well as Nogue, leading freed men included [[Stanislaus Besson]], [[Etienne Ventour]]\u2014a \"hothead\", suggests Candlin{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}\u2014and [[Joachim Phillip]],{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} a coloured free [[Coloniser|planter]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}} F\u00e9don appears to have come under internal criticism for a having a dictatorial approach.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\n====Leadership====\nF\u00e9don was both [[General]] of the army and head of the revolutionary council, known as the \"Commission of the 24\", which, despite concerns as to his dictatorial attitude, F\u00e9don does seem to have regularly requested advice from.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} The leadership element was particularly concentrated in residents of the parishes of [[Saint John Parish, Grenada|St John]] and [[Gouyave]]. F\u00e9don, for example, was from the latter, as were a number of \"prominent whites\" he associated with.{{sfn|Martin|2017|pp=13\u201314}} Much of F\u00e9don's immediate support came from his relatives, either by blood or by marriage.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} Another leading figure, [[Joachim Philip]], was, according to Candlin, a \"most interesting man\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}} From a large and extremely prosperous family of Grenadian planters, with much standing in the community,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=13}} he felt that he had been repeatedly ignored for office or patronage by the British administration.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}{{refn|His family was also already known to the governor, Home. In 1793 his father Michael had submitted a request to the administration for small arms to defend [[Petite Martinique]]; \"unable to countenance such an idea, in the margin of the request Ninian Home scribbled 'not complied with'\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=12}}|group=note}} The rebellion's leadership, suggests Candlin, was composed of \"tightly knit series of free coloured families who all intermarried\". F\u00e9don's deputy in the rebellion, Besson, was a local [[silversmith]]; Philip was a carpenter. Personally, F\u00e9don was heavily [[mortgage]]d.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=14}}\n\n==Outbreak and the first week of operations==\nBy 1 March 1795, Governor home, Candlin argues, was \"increasingly desperate and\naware that something might be afoot\". The [[militia]] was raised, but\u2014in a continuance of the heavy-handed treatment of the island's coloured population\u2014the coloured members of the militia were excluded from the general call to arms. This created further ill-feeling, and may, suggest Candlin, encouraged those members to join, rather than resist, the rebels. Home's actions may have forced F\u00e9don's hand in the timing of the rebellion: \"On an island where distrust and disloyalty were salient features, keeping covert plans secret was impossible\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}} F\u00e9don\u2014now holding the rank of General\u2014directed the opening assaults on the night of 2\u20133 March 1795,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} simultaneously attacking the towns of Gouyave and [[Grenville, Grenada|Grenville]], in the parishes of St John and St Andrew respectively.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} \n\n===Massacre at Grenville=== \nIn the east, at the small village of Grenville, the insurgents attacked and overran the town.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{refn|F\u00e9don later blamed this massacre on a non-existent French Revolutionary army he claimed had invaded.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}|group=note}} about seven miles from Belvidere.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=15, 16}} At midnight F\u00e9don and Besson, leading a group of about 100 freedmen{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}}\u2014some of whom guarded the entrances to the village to prevent anyone escaping\u2014attacked. They forced 20 white residents from their houses and into the market place, where they were all shot and the bodies then cut up with cutlasses. This, says Candlin, was done to \"the cheers of their free coloured neighbours\". Two whites escaped, and the town was looted.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=15}} F\u00e9don and his force withdrew with hostages to their headquarters in Belvidere.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} ''En route'', some of these\u2014including an old priest and a [[Piloting (navigation)|pilot]]\u2014were shot dead.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} They also returned to Belvidere, capturing more hostages and gathering more support as they did.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}}\n\n===Assault on Gouyave===\nGouyave was on the west coast of the island and was attacked at the same time as Grenville, although with far less violence. This force was led by Philip and Ventour, and included both white French and coloured men. Although there were no deaths in Gouyave, the town was also looted, with houses being ransacked and torched.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} The leader of the local militia, says Candlin, Dr Hay \"and his family could expect no quarter\", although in the event they were spared. Candlin speculates that this may have been because he and Ventour were neighbours, or perhaps more likely, because of the value a medical doctor was recognised as having to the rebel army.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}} The only injury was suffered by Ventour, who shot himself in the wrist while confiscating Hay's pistols. The white men were taken hostage and marched off to Belvidere, while, says Candlin, French coloured women \"enjoyed the scene below from their balconies\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}{{refn|Candlin argues that the relative lack of violence done in Gouyave may have been due to Philip, who, she suggests, had \"more to lose\" than his comrades.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=16}}|group=note}} \n\n===Marching on St George's===\n{{Quotebox|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Without entering into any detail of our rights, we summon you, and all the inhabitants, of every denomination in this colony, to surrender, within the space of two hours, to the republican forces under our command...And we give you notice, that in case of your not submitting, as you are enjoined, you shall be liable to all the scourges of a disastrous war ...\nDone at our camp, the fourth of March in the third year of the French Republic, one and indivisible.\nJulien F\u00e9don, Of\ufb01cer of the Republic, appointed at Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}|source=Proclamation of Julien F\u00e9don, 4 March 1796|align=right|width=25em}}\n\nBy the morning of 4 March, the rebel army approached St George's.

It was, said the observer, \"a chaotic and most melancholy scene\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} A delegation comprising Nogues and Philip demanded access to the gubernatorial council; this was granted and they proceeded to make two proclamations. The first\u2014\"chillingly uncompromising\"\u2014was from F\u00e9don, demanding the British surrender.

The British procrastinated, suggests Candlin, probably because the deputy governor, one McKenzie, was unused to taking command.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nThe rebels, who identified strongly with the French Revolution, wore [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour sashes]] and declaimed ''[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|Libert\u00e9, equalit\u00e9 ou la mort]]'' (\"liberty, equality or death\") as their slogan,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} which was engraved on their brass helmets.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=2}}\n\nBy the end of the week, the rebel ranks had swollen to over 7,000 people, comprising coloured and black freemen, whites and self-emancipated.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Only a few hours into the rebellion\u2014\"with a combination of planning and good fortune\", comments Martin\u2014they captured [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Grenada|the island's governor]], [[Ninian Home]]. This was not only a propaganda coup for the rebels but physically inhibited the British response to the rising by his enforced absence from leadership.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=3}} Home, and many other hostages, were kept tied to a [[Buccan|boucan frame]] for drying coffee.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} The rebels announced that any Frenchman who failed to join the insurrection would be deemed an enemy to the enterprise, outlawed and they goods confiscated.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}}\n\n===British response===\nThe British, besieged in the south in the capital, [[St. George's, Grenada|St George's]], were taken by surprise, and this frustrated their efforts at a concerted response.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although in disarray, when the rebels called upon the administration to dissolve itself, the British were unwilling to do so.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although Nogues' and Philip's negotiations with McKenzie lasted three hours, they left with nothing tangible to show for it, and it is likely that the deputy governor expected reinforcements shortly. This belief enabled McKenzie to dismiss the rebels' demands, saying, \"with some stoicism...that any British governor, indeed any British subject, imprisoned or otherwise would rather die with honour than face the ignominy of surrendering an island to slaves.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} McKenzie wrote to London demanding reinforcements, emphasising the precarious nature of British rule following the rebellion:\n\n{{blockquote|text=Every moment of inactivity must increase the evil within, as the Negroes are daily joining the Insurgents and desolating the Estates; all of which have been plundered, and a number in the neighbourhood of St George's...have been burnt\".{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=143}}}}\n\n==Course of the rebellion==\nThe rebels received further assistance from Hughes, in the form of armed squadrons, which had sufficient success to establish an administrative ''[[Department (country subdivision)|d\u00e9partment]]'' under the rebels' direct control.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}\n\nThe rebellion, argues Martin, \"raged for 15 months, and saw extreme brutality and destruction\" take place.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Many of the white french rebels surrendered to the British as the rebellion increased in ferocity; they may have felt more endangered from the rebels than from the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}}\n\nAlthough the rebels massively outnumbered the British, F\u00e9don's side lacked the experienced tacticians and strategists possessed by the British, and their assaults\u2014while large-scale and brutal\u2014were disorganised.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} Although controlled most of the countryside, F\u00e9don's army was unable to displace the British from St George's, while the latter also had the advantage of [[Royal Navy|superior sea power]]. This was used to great effect, eventually cutting Grenada off from its supply lines to St Lucia and Guadeloupe.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\nSickness, mostly from [[Yellow fever]], pervaded the British Army.{{refn|In [[British America|Colonial times]] and during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area. The mortality rate in British garrisons in [[Jamaica]] was seven times that of garrisons in Canada, mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases.{{sfn|McNeill|2002|pp=10\u201316}}|group=note}} In April, a British [[Brigadier-General]], [[Colin Lindsay]], was so distraught with the fever that he left his camp, went out into the rain, and shot himself.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\nLittle activity from either side is known of between the initial rebel attacks and May 1795; the rebels may have spent their time consolidating the defences at Belvidere; Philip's brother was a trained [[mason]], notes Candlin, and this would have been a particularly useful skill in this regard.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=17\u201318}} The rebels were still disorganised, so intensive training was probably undertaken, while the presence of a large number of women and children made it necessary for them to be looked after.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} The British limited their actions to circulating bills around the anglophone community urging them to remember their duty as subjects of [[George III]], while calling on the French-speaking populace to return to the fold.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}}\n\n===Attack on Belvidere===\nIn May 1795, the British launched a surprise night-attack on F\u00e9don's Belvidere base with a force comprising reinforcements from [[Barbados]] and the sailors and marines from a passing British [[frigate]]; also present were a number of Spanish soldiers sent by the governor of [[Trinidad]] in sympathy. The army's commander, Lindsay, had killed himself, so the command fell to his inexperienced subordinate, Colonel Schaw. The British troops, in particular, were weakened by sickness, and this lost them the element of surprise they had relied on for victory.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}{{refn|They were not always weak with sickness; before the assault on Belvidere was finally launched, the attack had already been cancelled twice through the troops getting plastered on good [[rum]].{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}|group=note}}\n\nAs the Belvidere Estate was situated on elevated ground, the British were at a severe tactical disadvantage.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}} Further, the rebels had spent the preceding weeks fortifying it with a number of levels of defence.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}{{refn|The defences were good enough that, later on, British officers assumed that they had to have been a long time in the preparation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}|group=note}} The outer layer of defence\u2014known as ''Fraternit\u00e9''\u2014held the majority of the rebel army, including artillery, behind a complex of [[earthworks]]. Above that was ''Libert\u00e9'', which contained the estate buildings itself and the rebel headquarters. The third and last camp\u2014''Morte''\u2014was by way of being a redoubt at the last line of defence.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}}\n\nThe British attacked from several directions simultaneously, supported by both cannon and cavalry.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} The fighting was bitter, and Dr Hay was responsible for the rebels' medical station in ''Libert\u00e9''.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=7, 17}} F\u00e9don's brother, Jean, was killed in the intense fighting.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=17}} and F\u00e9don later suggested that no [[No quarter|quarter]] was given the rebels. The attack, however, had dissipated by morning. The failure was the result, says Candlin, of \"poor coordination, coupled with bad weather and mere bad luck\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n====Murder of the hostages====\nIn retaliation for the attack on Belvidere, F\u00e9don had the 44 of his 47 hostages killed: \"one by one\", comments Candlin, \"the prisoners were dragged from the coffee store into the estate courtyard and shot,\ntheir blood mingling with the muddy, rain-soaked ground and running in great streams off the hillside\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=8, 18}}{{refn|Joachim Philip's brother Nicholas had been responsible for guarding the prisoners, and he was also in charge of their execution, including the provision of a [[coup de grace]] when necessary.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} This number included the island's governor, Ninian Home. Among those whom Fr\u00e9don allowed to live was a \"much-loved\" [[Anglican]] vicar\u2014who, Candlin suggests may have been known to F\u00e9don\u2014a Dr Hay, and a fellow named Kerr. Dr Hay was spared because, as a medical doctor, his skills would come in handy to the rebels; why who Kerr was, o why he was spared, is unknown, but in his memoirs, Dr Hay asserted that Kerr was probably a rebel spy among the hostages.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=7}}\n\n===Haitus===\nThe assault on Belvidere and the killings of the hostages was followed, comments Candlin, by a \"bizarre year-long standoff\". On F\u00e9don's part, this was because he had neither the troops nor the resources to maintain an army in the field for any length of time,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} although he was joined by a number of English-speaking slaves from British estates.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} Neither, for that matter, did the British; but they were waiting for the men and supplies that were gradually reached them by sea.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}\n\nThe failure of the attack on St George's meant that the British remained in control of the most important strategic site on the island, and to where they could be regularly revictualled. F\u00e9don, meanwhile, remained in command of most of the island. His army needed feeding, but he had no effective strategy for this and mainly relied on hand-to-mouth pillaging of by now-deserted estates. Although originally a rich vein of succour, these estates\u2014by now producing nothing due to the war\u2014were gradually becoming less and less profitable for the rebels. This was reflected generally: says Candlin, \"the island\u2019s produce was destroyed,\nthere were no crops and the economy completely collapsed\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}\n\n==Support==\n===External===\nCommunication was maintained with fellow revolutionaries in Haiti, Guadaloupe{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and [[St Lucia]], although this was a somewhat \"uneasy relationship\", suggests Martin, as F\u00e9don, on the one hand, wanted as much assistance as he could receive, but on the other was wary of allowing external forces too much influence within his movement.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} As a result, he increasingly ignored the exhortations of his comrades on St Lucia to unity and enforced his own strategy and discipline.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} F\u00e9don and Philip both had siblings who had emigrated to Trinidad prior to the rebellion and it is probable that they also provided external support for the rebels.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} \n\nIt seems likely, says Martin, that while French revolutionaries elsewhere in the Caribbean wanted more direct involvement in F\u00e9don's rebellion, he went to lengths to limit their active participation because \"he did not want checks on his own authority\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}} He suggests, furthermore, that this backing was \"vital to the success of the rebellion, and it proved detrimental when British forces\nsucceeded in cutting it off\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=10}}{{refn|Which they managed to do, says Candlin, despite having no small ships available to patrol the sea. However, there were sufficient [[ships of the line]] in the area to ensure an effective blockade of Grenada,{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} as the Royal Navy had maintained a presence in the Caribbean since the [[Seven Years' War]].{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=143}}|group=note}}\n\n===Internal dissention===\nFrom almost the point the rebellion had been declared, rifts appeared in the ranks. In the first week, a mutinous rebel shot Lavalee, and was then himself [[Execution by firing squad|ordered executed]] by F\u00e9don. Martin suggests that internal relations went downhill rapidly on account of the rebels' failure to swiftly overcome the British forces.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=13}} Nogues, too, seems to have fallen out with the leadership relatively quickly; although an original member of the Commission of 24, he left it soon after the rebellion broke out.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin notes that the causes of Nogues' falling out with F\u00e9don is now unknown, but in a letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand urged him to strive for unity:{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We are pained to see how divided you are; the enemy will hear of it, and will take advantage of it to fall upon you and defeat you. Let ambition give way to love of the Republic. It is impossible for you all to be in charge; obey those who command you and do not force us to use harsh measures against you. Listen to our appeals, they are for your own good.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}}}\n\n[[Gaspar Goyrand]], in St Lucia, wrote that he had heard that \"several individuals have desired to act a part in this revolution, who, from a spirit of jealousy, of ambition, or the insanity of pride, have endeavoured to revive prejudices condemned to profound oblivion\".{{sfn|Hay|1823|p=44}} He reminded F\u00e9don that, for as long as his \"ambition [is] to wear epaulettes\" rather than unite his army, he was hurting the rebellion's chances.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n===Summoned by Goyrand===\nIn October 1795, Goyrand finally took action against F\u00e9don's increasing distancing. Goyrand ordered the dissolution of the Commission of 24 and summoned F\u00e9don to Guadeloupe. Nogues had brought charges against F\u00e9don, and Goyrand was investigating, but F\u00e9don failed to appear. As a result, he was stripped of his command of the French revolutionary troops in Grenada he had been sent, although he maintained his control of the freedmen and slaves.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n==Collapse of the rebellion==\nIn the meantime, Britain had been organising an [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] under [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]] to take back the island. Although \"long overdue\",{{refn|Abercromby had been appointed in June 1795.{{sfn|Divall|2019|pp=72\u201373}}|group=note}} suggests Candlin, it arrived in June 1796.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}} Abercromby was a highly experienced editor{{refn|A strong supporter of the [[American Revolution]], he had buggered about in Ireland in order to avoid being sent to fight there for Britain. When war with France broke out in 1793, however, he was appointed command of a brigade under the [[Prince Frederick, 1st Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for service in the [[Netherlands]], where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis|Le Cateau]]. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]] and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}|group=note}} and Candlin estimates that it took only a fortnight to [[rout]] F\u00e9don's rebel army and regain the island.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=8}}\n\nThe British had regained control of most of the island, and now, comments Martin, \"the might of the [[British Empire|Brotish Empire]] descended\".{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} The effectiveness of the British assault led to large losses among the slaves,{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and by this point, F\u00e9don and his colleagues would have been focussing their energies in escaping Grenada, suggest Candlin.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} He had a number of near misses from being captured. A British official later recorded that, on one such occasion, F\u00e9don launched himself \"down a place where [no man] dare venture after him. His object and that of the few remaining in the woods was to get off in a canoe. We have...destroyed several that were preparing for that purpose\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}}\n\n==Consequences==\nFollowing the collapse of the rebellion, a [[Bill of attainder]] was promulgated which condemned 400 people.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} 200 rebels were enslaved{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} and 50 executed.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Overall, approximately 25% of the island's slave population\u2014around 7,000 people\u2014died during the revolt. Another 500\u2014charged with being in possession of arms\u2014were sold off the island.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}} F\u00e9don's fate is unknown, comments Candlin, \"only a compass in an upturned rowboat tantalizing\" scholars as to his end. The fact that the boat was pointing towards Trinidad when it was found suggested to contemporaries that he had drowned attempting to join his sister there.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}}{{refn|On the other hand, a report as late as 1815, from [[Ralph James Woodford|Sir Ralph Woodford]], Governor of Trinidad, that F\u00e9don had been recently sighted in [[Cuba]]. However, the Spanish government disallowed an investigation.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}}|group=note}} Candlin inclines to the theory that\u2014\"Given the interconnectedness of relatives in Trinidad and Grenada\"\u2014it is most likely that he survived and went into hiding in the former.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=18}} Philip, on the other hand, stayed in Grenada, successfully hiding from the authorities for eight years\u2014possibly as a \"maroon\" in the forest, suggested an official report\u2014when he was discovered on Petite Martinique. He was tried and hanged St George's in 1803.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=19}} Candlin notes that, while those directly involved could not expect to receive mercy\u2014and did not\u2014those who managed to \"managed to keep a low pro\ufb01le away from the violence and at relative peace with their neighbours fared better\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=19}} Coloured freedmen who survived \"now found themselves open to abuse on the streets, their homes invaded and their property taken\", argues Candlin.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=36}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nDue to the ultimate failure of the rebellion, it impossible for scholars to know what would have happened consequently. Martin suggests that the most likely immediate result would have been\u2014mirroring Haiti\u2014the abolishing of slavery.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}\n\nGoyrand, in St Lucia, put the failing of the rebellion down to the rebels' lack of unity. In a later letter to F\u00e9don, Goyrand told him that{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}}\n\n{{blockquote|text=We had predicted, citizen, you are divided, you were overcome, thus re-join that love of the Republic to replace your ambitious desires. We want to send you forces to repair the loss that disunion has just made you.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}}}}\n\nAs a result of his falling out with F\u00e9don, Nogues left Grenada and joined Goyrand's staff in St Lucia.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=14}} Martin argues that the ideological and strategic divisions within the rebel leadership fundamentally weakened it, and made it incapable of meeting the increasingly effective sorties of the British.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\nThe rebellion has been estimated to have caused around {{Inflation|UK|250000|1795|fmt=c}} worth of damage to Grenada, and severely, limited the island's future sugar production.{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=144}} Every plantation had been at least partially destroyed, and in many cases, totally. This compares to Grenada's pre-rebellion position as producing the British Caribbean's send-largest annual income of {{Inflation|UK|450000|1795|fmt=c}}, which the rebellion wiped out.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=35}} Candlin summarises the after-effects of the rebellion thus:\n\n{{blockquote|text=The Royal Navy now patrolled the coastline in force. There was now no argument or protest from the French community, no truculent local councilmen or companies badgering to turn a pro\ufb01t, just grateful British planters and merchants at least thankful that order had been restored. The con\ufb02ict had cleared the way for a widespread [[Anglicanization]] of the island and a dramatic increase in colonial power.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|pp=35\u201336}}}}\n\nThe rebellion probably influenced the [[Second Carib War|revolt in St Vincent]] in 1796, in which rebels held the country for six months before being crushed by Abercromby.{{sfn|Morgan|2007|p=144}} \n\n==Historiography==\n===Sourcing===\nThe main sources for scholars of F\u00e9don's Rebellion are original documents, mostly held at the [[National Archives (UK)|the National Archives]] in [[Kew]], and a number of contemporary books. These are [[eye-witness]] descriptions of the rebellion, but are all from the perspective of the British, and, suggests Candlin, \"show a predictable bias to the eventual victors in the con\ufb02ict\".{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=5}} The most important near-contemporary source is a monograph by [[D. G. Garraway]] of 1877, in which he [[synthesizes]] the contemporary recollections. The rebellion remains, says Candlin however, \"of all the\nmajor slave revolts and insurrections in the Atlantic world...the least studied and the least mentioned\" in the literature.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=6}}\n\n===Analysis===\nMartin argues that, while \"almost all analyses of [the rebellion] define it as a slave revolt or a revolt against the slave system\", the number of white French involved necessitates a far more nuanced view.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=7}} Candlin has argued that \"in unleashing the power of the slaves, including their own, they [the rebel leaders] had betrayed everyone who remained loyal to the old system\". {{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\nMartin has compared F\u00e9don's Rebellion with the 1979 [[Grenadian Revolution]] as being equally \"defining moments\" in the history of the country, both \"for what they set out to achieve and the impact they have had on Grenadian society ever since\",{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=1}} and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]]'s main base before the uprising was named camp F\u00e9don.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}} Often considered second only to the Haitian Revolution in its regional significance, and many Grenadians, he suggests, see F\u00e9don as a [[Folk hero|national hero]]. Indeed, he suggests that those who led the revolution 200 years later saw themselves as part of a historical tradition that sprang from the rebellion.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=2}}\n\nAlthough those slaves who joined F\u00e9don's army enjoyed a greater degree of freedom than they had, the vast majority of the island's slaves watched from the sidelines. Martin suggests that choosing the wrong side would mean harsh retaliation, and they chose to avoid this.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=4}}\n\n===Reasons for failure===\nCandlin emphasises that too little planning was to blame for the eventual failure of the rebellion, particularly regarding supplies and materiel. F\u00e9don had not planned for an eventuality in which he began running out of either, and was, therefore, surprised when this occurred. Further, too much of the island's productive machinery had been destroyed n the early weeks of the uprising without a long-term plan to replace it. F\u00e9don relied on reinforcements that never materialised.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=4}}\n\n==Memorials and cultural impact==\nThe 19th-century Trinidadian novelist [[Edward Lanzer Joseph]]'s ''[[Warner Arundell: The Adventures of a Creole|Warner Arundell]]'', published in 1838, is a historical register of the period in which F\u00e9don is a primary protagonist.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} A contemporary reviewer for ''[[The Literary Gazette]]'' noted that, although \"by the pen of its author, it is evidently founded on a basis of fact\".{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}} In Joseph's story, F\u00e9don has survived the rebellion, and while roaming as a criminal in exile, he is haunted by a sense of failure.{{sfn|Ward|2017|p=206}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Brizan|first=G.
