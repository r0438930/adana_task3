It is one of the [[Pakistani dramas|highest-rated Pakistani television series]] of all the time.\n\nDastaan was also aired in India on [[Zindagi (TV channel)|Zindagi]] under the title ''[[Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam (TV series)|Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam]]'' from 23 March 2015 onwards. Previously, it was decided to run the show under the title ''Lakeerein'', but the decision was later changed. Dastaan also aired on [[MBC Bollywood]] for the [[Arab world|Arab World]] under the title [[Dastaan (TV series)|''Hub Aber Hudud'']]. \n\n==Plot==\nBuilt on the true events of partition of 1947, the series depicts the events of rioting and chaos in 1947. The series is based on the novel Bano.\n\nBased on the novel, [[Bano (novel)|Bano]], ''Dastaan'' begins with the wedding of Suraiya ([[Saba Qamar]]) and Salim ([[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]]). Suraiya's nephew, Hassan ([[Fawad Khan]]) was the son of Bano's first cousin Rasheeda. When Hassan's father died, he and his mother were kicked out of his fathers house by his paternal family and they moved back to Rasheeda's maternal house. Bano, Suraiya, Faheem and Salim and Hassan were childhood friends (and cousins) and all grew up together. When Hassan went to study at University he left home and went to Islamia college in Peshawar. Hassan returns for Saleem and Suraiya's wedding where Hassan and Bano meet for the first time as adults after 3 years. (The last time they met was 3 years ago and they were kids). Hassan starts teasing and flirting with Bano and they slowly begin to develop feelings for each other, with Hassan visiting [[Ludhiana]] every now and then. Hassan is in his final year at the [[Islamia College (Lahore)|Islamia College]] as an engineering student. He is an active supporter of the [[All-India Muslim League]], and the leader of the Ludhiana Branch. He strongly believes in the establishment of Pakistan and is an avid follower of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Qaid-E-Azam]], the leader of the Muslim League and [[Pakistan Movement]]. Meanwhile, Saleem is an active supporter of the [[Indian National Congress]], with all his friends being [[Hindu]]. He strictly believes that the establishment of Pakistan will not help, but rather lessen the position of Muslims in India. The political debate between Saleem and Hassan begins as friendly competition, but intensifies as conditions worsen throughout India for Muslims. Saleem, hot-tempered and rash, begins to bring political debates into family life and eventually forbids Suraiya to visit Hassan, her nephew. But Hassan is not dissuaded. He continues to spread the message of Pakistan throughout Saleem's family, causing Saleem's anger to explode on many occasions. Other than Saleem, his entire family become strong supporters of the Muslim League, especially Bano, who makes posters and signs for the [[Pakistan Movement]].\n\nBibi, [[Samina Peerzada]] tells Suraiya that a marriage proposal has come for Bano from [[Patiala]]. Suraiya panicked and tells her sister Rashida that Bano and Hassan like each other and have become close, and that if they don't get married Bano would commit suicide and Hassan wouldn't marry anyone else either. Upon hearing this rasheeda takes her brother (Kareem bhai) and sister in law (sakina bhabhi) and asks for Banos hand in marriage for Hassan. Saleem overhears this and politely tells them that they can leave because a proposal has come for Bano. Bano's parents become angry and ask Saleem who he had in mind and Saleem tells them for his Hindu friend called Ram. Bano's parent angry at Saleem, panic and agree for Bano's proposal with Hassan.  Hassan and Bano eventually become engaged, and Saleem decides to leave behind his rivalry with Hassan for Bano's sake. Soon, Hassan gets a job in [[Rawalpindi]] and has to leave immediately. He leaves Ludhiana, with the promise that they will be back 4 months later for the wedding.  Meanwhile, Suraiya is 4 months pregnant.\n\nDuring this time tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] escalate dramatically, and violence breaks out all across India. Hate crimes against Muslims become common, and fighting spreads to all states, getting threateningly closer to Ludhiana every day. As the fighting becomes more pronounced, Muslims retaliate, leaving nobody safe. Saleem seems to be under the impression that his [[Hindu]] friends and their families will be able to protect his family from rioters, after he asked them whether him and his entire family and relatives should migrate to Pakistan, but upon trying to get this reassurance from them, they say, \"What will we say to them? Why would they listen to us?\"  Saleem begins sensing a cold distance his [[Hindu]] friends have developed towards him and, while on his way home, encounters a sobbing Muslim man who lost his entire family and home. He begins to realize the importance of the creation of [[Pakistan]] and rushes home, telling his family to tightly lock up their doors and gates and to be ready for any kind of attack.\n\nOn a fateful night, a group of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]] attack the family's home.  All of the men (which includes many other Muslims who sought refuge in their house) stay on the bottom floor with their swords and knives intending to fight. All the women (including Bano, Suraiya, and Bano's mother, Bibi, Sakina Khala and her daughters) are huddled on the roof of the house.  Salim and all the men are brutally murdered in a terrible [[Mass murder|massacre]]. A pregnant Suraiya, upon seeing her husband stabbed, throws herself off the roof to be with her dying husband. She lays next to him, trying to move her bloodied hand to be with his, but a rioter brutally stabs her womb, killing Suraiya and her baby. Sakina Khala and her daughters also throw themselves from the roof while others are carried away to be raped and killed. Bano's other brother, Faheem, before being killed, shouts to his mother: \"Choke Bano!\" Bibi, with Bano's tearful consent, tries to choke her to death to protect her from losing her honor, virtue, and religion from the rapists, but two of Saleem's Hindu friends arrive claiming to save them.\n\nSaleem's friend, Ram, tries to rape Bano, but his other friend saves her by killing Ram out of guilt. Bano, alone with Bibi, manages to escape [[Ludhiana]], where they seek shelter in a refugee camp for Muslims. The [[Muslim]] refugees are headed by a young brave Muslim man who lost his entire family. Thirsty and hungry, they try to walk to [[Pakistan]], encountering poisoned wells along the way. Eventually, [[Hindu]] rioters attack this caravan. Bano is separated from Bibi and both are gang raped. Bano crawls toward her mother's now lifeless body, seeing her [[Ta'wiz]] necklace next to it. Bano, grief-stricken and in shock, wears it and lays next to her body.\n\nA Sikh man ([[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]) stumbles upon Bano and her dead mother, and he helps nurse her back to health. He then boards her on a train heading towards [[Lahore]] and leaves. It was common for trains to arrive in [[Lahore]] full of dead Muslims with only a few survivors and vice versa. Soon this train is attacked by rioters. Basant Singh ([[Babrik Shah (actor)|Babrik Shah]]), a rioter, chases after Bano on the train. She falls unconscious, and Basant Singh kidnaps her, bringing her to his home in [[Kapurthala]]. She awakens in his home where he and his mother live. At first, she refuses to tell them her name, and so Basant Singh calls her Sundar [[Kaur]], meaning \"beautiful princess\" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. He gives her the impression that he will take her to [[Pakistan]] himself once the dangers are gone. He also tells her she can write to Hassan and he'll deliver the letters. Bano believes his lies and cannot wait to go to [[Pakistan]].\n\nNearly a year later, Basant has not lived up to his promise, claiming that the roadways are still blocked and that traveling to Pakistan is too dangerous. Eventually, Bano learns of his plans to forcibly marry her and convert her, and she attempts to run away again. This time though, when Basant catches her, he doesn't treat her gently as the first time. He tries whatever method he can to break her; beating her, raping her, forcing her to become a [[Sikh]], marrying her, and in the end, having her give birth to his child.\n\nAfter many years Basant Singh runs to the roof to go save his child, because he is about to fall off. Instead, he slips, falls, and dies. Bano immediately takes her son and leaves to go to Pakistan. Whilst this is happening, Hassan eventually falls in love with Rabia, his cousin, and they become engaged. Bano is taken in by a lady who sends a letter to Hassan to inform him that Bano has arrived.\n\nHassan receives the letter and takes Bano and the child home. Hassan decides to marry Bano, and wants to break off his engagement to Rabia. Rabia and her mother come to know of this and visit Hassan's house. Rabia's mother tells Rabia to take care of Bano to please Hassan. However, one day, he overhears a conversation between his parents about Rabia taking care of Bano so Hassan can see the goodness in her. He argues with Rabia, but Rabia insists that her love is truer than Bano's. Bano overhears this and interrupts them telling them that if they truly want to do something for her, they should get married. The next day, Hassan finds out that Bano has left the house. Hassan spends many days and weeks searching for Bano. He blames Rabia for this. Bano is living with a family where she does their household chores, she gets a job in a modern family where she realises that Pakistan is not how she thought it would be. She is fired from the job. One day Hassan sees her in the mosque and he runs after her to get her back home but Bano says her friend to go to Hassan and ask him to forget Bano. Hassan then goes home and agrees to marry Rabia as Bano had wished their marriage.\nOne day she goes to a birthday party where she meets a gentleman who has similar thoughts to those of Bano. He offers Bano to come and work in his office where they work for the welfare of people. Bano is very happy and offers his proposal.\nOne day, Rabia comes to know about Bano's whereabouts and she begs to her to marry Hassan. Eventually, Bano agrees and she promises that she will come. She goes to her office where the same gentleman leads her to storage room and attempts to abuse her. She grabs hold of a scissor, and stabs hims to death. She is arrested by police. Bano is taken to a mental asylum for recovery. Later, Hassan and Rabia who are now husband and wife, visit Bano.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fawad Khan]] as Hassan\n* [[Sanam Baloch]] as Bano\n* [[Mehreen Raheel]] as Rabia\n* [[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]] as Saleem (Bano's elder brother)\n* [[Saba Qamar]] as Suraiyyah (Saleem's Wife)\n* [[Saba Hameed]] as Rasheeda (Hassan's Mother)\n* [[Qavi Khan]] as Naseeb Bhai (Bano's Father)\n* [[Samina Peerzada]] as Saliha or \"Bibi\" (Bano's Mother)\n* [[Affan Waheed]] as Nadir (Hassan's Friend)\n* Babrik Shah as Basant Singh\n* [[Seemi Raheel]] as Sakeena (Hassan's Maami)\n* [[Asma Abbas]] as Sultana (Rabia's Mother)\n* [[Naeem Tahir]] as Rabia's Father\n* [[Daniyal Raheel]] as Faheem (Bano's younger Brother)\n* Anita Fatima Camphor as Jameela (Hassan's Aunt)\n* [[Khayyam Sarhadi]] as Jameela's husband\n* Humaira Abbasi as Kaamini\n* [[Fawad Jalal]] as Laxman\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Samina Ahmad]] as orphanage caretaker\n* [[Shazia Afgan]] as Bano's friend\n* [[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]\n* [[Sangeeta (Pakistani actress)|Sangeeta]] as Basanta's mom\n* Nasreen Qureshi as Basanta's aunt\n* Azra Mansoor as Shazia's mother\n* Farooq Zameer\n\n==Locations==\nThe serial takes place at a number of locations.

Meanwhile, Saleem is an active supporter of the [[Indian National Congress]], with all his friends being [[Hindu]]. He strictly believes that the establishment of Pakistan will not help, but rather lessen the position of Muslims in India. The political debate between Saleem and Hassan begins as friendly competition, but intensifies as conditions worsen throughout India for Muslims. Saleem, hot-tempered and rash, begins to bring political debates into family life and eventually forbids Suraiya to visit Hassan, her nephew. But Hassan is not dissuaded. He continues to spread the message of Pakistan throughout Saleem's family, causing Saleem's anger to explode on many occasions. Other than Saleem, his entire family become strong supporters of the Muslim League, especially Bano, who makes posters and signs for the [[Pakistan Movement]].\n\nBibi, [[Samina Peerzada]] tells Suraiya that a marriage proposal has come for Bano from [[Patiala]]. Suraiya panicked and tells her sister Rashida that Bano and Hassan like each other and have become close, and that if they don't get married Bano would commit suicide and Hassan wouldn't marry anyone else either. Upon hearing this rasheeda takes her brother (Kareem bhai) and sister in law (sakina bhabhi) and asks for Banos hand in marriage for Hassan. Saleem overhears this and politely tells them that they can leave because a proposal has come for Bano. Bano's parents become angry and ask Saleem who he had in mind and Saleem tells them for his Hindu friend called Ram. Bano's parent angry at Saleem, panic and agree for Bano's proposal with Hassan.  Hassan and Bano eventually become engaged, and Saleem decides to leave behind his rivalry with Hassan for Bano's sake. Soon, Hassan gets a job in [[Rawalpindi]] and has to leave immediately. He leaves Ludhiana, with the promise that they will be back 4 months later for the wedding.  Meanwhile, Suraiya is 4 months pregnant.\n\nDuring this time tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] escalate dramatically, and violence breaks out all across India. Hate crimes against Muslims become common, and fighting spreads to all states, getting threateningly closer to Ludhiana every day. As the fighting becomes more pronounced, Muslims retaliate, leaving nobody safe. Saleem seems to be under the impression that his [[Hindu]] friends and their families will be able to protect his family from rioters, after he asked them whether him and his entire family and relatives should migrate to Pakistan, but upon trying to get this reassurance from them, they say, \"What will we say to them? Why would they listen to us?\"  Saleem begins sensing a cold distance his [[Hindu]] friends have developed towards him and, while on his way home, encounters a sobbing Muslim man who lost his entire family and home. He begins to realize the importance of the creation of [[Pakistan]] and rushes home, telling his family to tightly lock up their doors and gates and to be ready for any kind of attack.\n\nOn a fateful night, a group of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]] attack the family's home.  All of the men (which includes many other Muslims who sought refuge in their house) stay on the bottom floor with their swords and knives intending to fight. All the women (including Bano, Suraiya, and Bano's mother, Bibi, Sakina Khala and her daughters) are huddled on the roof of the house.  Salim and all the men are brutally murdered in a terrible [[Mass murder|massacre]]. A pregnant Suraiya, upon seeing her husband stabbed, throws herself off the roof to be with her dying husband. She lays next to him, trying to move her bloodied hand to be with his, but a rioter brutally stabs her womb, killing Suraiya and her baby. Sakina Khala and her daughters also throw themselves from the roof while others are carried away to be raped and killed. Bano's other brother, Faheem, before being killed, shouts to his mother: \"Choke Bano!\" Bibi, with Bano's tearful consent, tries to choke her to death to protect her from losing her honor, virtue, and religion from the rapists, but two of Saleem's Hindu friends arrive claiming to save them.\n\nSaleem's friend, Ram, tries to rape Bano, but his other friend saves her by killing Ram out of guilt. Bano, alone with Bibi, manages to escape [[Ludhiana]], where they seek shelter in a refugee camp for Muslims. The [[Muslim]] refugees are headed by a young brave Muslim man who lost his entire family. Thirsty and hungry, they try to walk to [[Pakistan]], encountering poisoned wells along the way. Eventually, [[Hindu]] rioters attack this caravan. Bano is separated from Bibi and both are gang raped. Bano crawls toward her mother's now lifeless body, seeing her [[Ta'wiz]] necklace next to it. Bano, grief-stricken and in shock, wears it and lays next to her body.\n\nA Sikh man ([[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]) stumbles upon Bano and her dead mother, and he helps nurse her back to health. He then boards her on a train heading towards [[Lahore]] and leaves. It was common for trains to arrive in [[Lahore]] full of dead Muslims with only a few survivors and vice versa. Soon this train is attacked by rioters. Basant Singh ([[Babrik Shah (actor)|Babrik Shah]]), a rioter, chases after Bano on the train. She falls unconscious, and Basant Singh kidnaps her, bringing her to his home in [[Kapurthala]]. She awakens in his home where he and his mother live. At first, she refuses to tell them her name, and so Basant Singh calls her Sundar [[Kaur]], meaning \"beautiful princess\" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. He gives her the impression that he will take her to [[Pakistan]] himself once the dangers are gone. He also tells her she can write to Hassan and he'll deliver the letters. Bano believes his lies and cannot wait to go to [[Pakistan]].\n\nNearly a year later, Basant has not lived up to his promise, claiming that the roadways are still blocked and that traveling to Pakistan is too dangerous. Eventually, Bano learns of his plans to forcibly marry her and convert her, and she attempts to run away again. This time though, when Basant catches her, he doesn't treat her gently as the first time. He tries whatever method he can to break her; beating her, raping her, forcing her to become a [[Sikh]], marrying her, and in the end, having her give birth to his child.\n\nAfter many years Basant Singh runs to the roof to go save his child, because he is about to fall off. Instead, he slips, falls, and dies. Bano immediately takes her son and leaves to go to Pakistan. Whilst this is happening, Hassan eventually falls in love with Rabia, his cousin, and they become engaged. Bano is taken in by a lady who sends a letter to Hassan to inform him that Bano has arrived.\n\nHassan receives the letter and takes Bano and the child home. Hassan decides to marry Bano, and wants to break off his engagement to Rabia. Rabia and her mother come to know of this and visit Hassan's house. Rabia's mother tells Rabia to take care of Bano to please Hassan. However, one day, he overhears a conversation between his parents about Rabia taking care of Bano so Hassan can see the goodness in her. He argues with Rabia, but Rabia insists that her love is truer than Bano's. Bano overhears this and interrupts them telling them that if they truly want to do something for her, they should get married. The next day, Hassan finds out that Bano has left the house. Hassan spends many days and weeks searching for Bano. He blames Rabia for this. Bano is living with a family where she does their household chores, she gets a job in a modern family where she realises that Pakistan is not how she thought it would be. She is fired from the job. One day Hassan sees her in the mosque and he runs after her to get her back home but Bano says her friend to go to Hassan and ask him to forget Bano. Hassan then goes home and agrees to marry Rabia as Bano had wished their marriage.\nOne day she goes to a birthday party where she meets a gentleman who has similar thoughts to those of Bano. He offers Bano to come and work in his office where they work for the welfare of people. Bano is very happy and offers his proposal.\nOne day, Rabia comes to know about Bano's whereabouts and she begs to her to marry Hassan. Eventually, Bano agrees and she promises that she will come. She goes to her office where the same gentleman leads her to storage room and attempts to abuse her. She grabs hold of a scissor, and stabs hims to death. She is arrested by police. Bano is taken to a mental asylum for recovery. Later, Hassan and Rabia who are now husband and wife, visit Bano.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fawad Khan]] as Hassan\n* [[Sanam Baloch]] as Bano\n* [[Mehreen Raheel]] as Rabia\n* [[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]] as Saleem (Bano's elder brother)\n* [[Saba Qamar]] as Suraiyyah (Saleem's Wife)\n* [[Saba Hameed]] as Rasheeda (Hassan's Mother)\n* [[Qavi Khan]] as Naseeb Bhai (Bano's Father)\n* [[Samina Peerzada]] as Saliha or \"Bibi\" (Bano's Mother)\n* [[Affan Waheed]] as Nadir (Hassan's Friend)\n* Babrik Shah as Basant Singh\n* [[Seemi Raheel]] as Sakeena (Hassan's Maami)\n* [[Asma Abbas]] as Sultana (Rabia's Mother)\n* [[Naeem Tahir]] as Rabia's Father\n* [[Daniyal Raheel]] as Faheem (Bano's younger Brother)\n* Anita Fatima Camphor as Jameela (Hassan's Aunt)\n* [[Khayyam Sarhadi]] as Jameela's husband\n* Humaira Abbasi as Kaamini\n* [[Fawad Jalal]] as Laxman\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Samina Ahmad]] as orphanage caretaker\n* [[Shazia Afgan]] as Bano's friend\n* [[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]\n* [[Sangeeta (Pakistani actress)|Sangeeta]] as Basanta's mom\n* Nasreen Qureshi as Basanta's aunt\n* Azra Mansoor as Shazia's mother\n* Farooq Zameer\n\n==Locations==\nThe serial takes place at a number of locations.
