It was hosted between 30 May to 14 July across eleven venues in [[England]] and [[Wales]] with the tournament being the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup while for Wales it was their third.\n\nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams the previous edition with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a [[Result (cricket)#No result|result]], [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] finished as the top four with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] missing out by [[net run rate]].\n\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup Final|final]], which was played at [[Lord's]] in London. The final ended in a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 [[run (cricket)|runs]], followed by the first [[Super Over]] in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level.

With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over, however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught on 59. However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two [[Glossary of cricket terms#D|dot balls]], Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' saying only one of the batsmen's runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|title=England Cricket World Cup win: 'Extra run' claims brushed off by Ashley Giles|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2019|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111216/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<ref>{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Marks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|title=England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716093839/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a [[Super Over]]. England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they handled Trent Boult's bowling to accumulate 15 runs without loss. For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]], [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and 1992.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Gardner|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Epic final tied, Super Over tied, England win World Cup on boundary count|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715190820/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England's first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|title=Will apologise to Kane for rest of my life: Stokes|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=16 July 2019|access-date=17 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920221429/https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|archive-date=20 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Single-innings cricket match\n| bg = #eee\n| date = {{anchor|match48}} 14 July 2019\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|NZ}}\n| team2 = {{cr|ENG}}\n| score1 = 241/8 (50 overs)\n| score2 = 241 (50 overs)\n| result = [[2019 Cricket World Cup knockout stage#Final|Match tied]]\n| report = [https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/game/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/ Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Lord's]], London\n| notes = Super Over: England 15/0, New Zealand 15/1.\n*''England won the match on the boundary count back rule (26\u201317).''\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|2019 Cricket World Cup statistics}}\nIndia's Rohit Sharma ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 648 runs from nine matches which featured a 140 against Pakistan at Old Trafford.<ref name=IndiavsPakistan/> He finished ahead of Australia's David Warner (647 runs) and Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan (606 runs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest run scorers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234420/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Australian bowler Mitchell Starc ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets, which surpassed the record set by [[Glenn McGrath]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|title=Mitchell Starc breaks Glenn McGrath's record for most wickets in a World Cup|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=AFP|date=11 July 2019|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722185149/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|archive-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Second was Lockie Ferguson from New Zealand with 21 wickets, while Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh) and Jofra Archer (England) were tied for third place with 20 wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest wicket takers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234533/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Most runs===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Runs\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Player\n!{{Abbr|Inns|Innings}}\n!{{Abbr|HS|High score}}\n!{{Abbr|Ave|Average}}\n!{{Abbr|SR|Strike rate}}\n!{{Abbr|100|Hundreds scored}}\n!{{Abbr|50|Fiftys scored}}\n!{{Abbr|4s|Fours hit}}\n!{{Abbr|6s|Sixes hit}}\n|-\n!

[[cricket]] tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). It was hosted between 30 May to 14 July across eleven venues in [[England]] and [[Wales]] with the tournament being the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup while for Wales it was their third.\n\nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams the previous edition with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a [[Result (cricket)#No result|result]], [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] finished as the top four with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] missing out by [[net run rate]].\n\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup Final|final]], which was played at [[Lord's]] in London. The final ended in a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 [[run (cricket)|runs]], followed by the first [[Super Over]] in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level. Overall, approximately 2.6&nbsp;billion people around the world watched the tournament, making it the most-watched cricket competition {{as of|2019|lc=y|post=.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1277987|title=ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019 shatters audience records|publisher=International Cricket Council|date=12 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715174152/https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1277987|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Hosting==\nThe hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], which was played in Australia and New Zealand.

[[Imad Wasim]] immediately hit 18 runs in the 46th over, and despite losing Shadab Khan to a run out in the 47th, Wasim and Wahab Riaz saw Pakistan home to a three-wicket victory with two balls to spare.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tanya|last=Aldred|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/pakistan-imad-wasim-afghanistan-thriller-cricket-world-cup|title=Pakistan's Imad Wasim holds nerve to see off Afghanistan in thriller|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 June 2019|access-date=5 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702140948/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/pakistan-imad-wasim-afghanistan-thriller-cricket-world-cup|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe return of opener Jason Roy from injury helped England escape their slump as they emerged victorious by 31 runs against the hitherto unbeaten India in a crucial must-win game for the hosts. An opening partnership between Roy (66) and [[Jonny Bairstow]] (111) was the key factor in the victory, while Stokes scored 79 runs off 54 balls for his third consecutive half-century, to help England reach 337/7. The score proved too much for India, despite [[Rohit Sharma]] and [[Virat Kohli]] scoring 102 and 66 respectively, while the returning England bowler [[Liam Plunkett]] took 3/55.<ref>{{cite web|first=Deivarayan|last=Muthu|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144520/england-vs-india-38th-match-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes help end India's unbeaten run|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=30 June 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701220741/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144520/england-vs-india-38th-match-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=1 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Sri Lanka won the dead rubber against the West Indies at [[Chester-le-Street]], where both [[Avishka Fernando]] and [[Nicholas Pooran]] scored their maiden ODI centuries.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tanya|last=Aldred|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/sri-lanka-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-match-report|title=Avishka Fernando hits high notes and Sri Lanka hold nerve against West Indies|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 July 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704210528/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/sri-lanka-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-match-report|archive-date=4 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan made history against India, as he became the first man to score 500 runs and take 10 wickets in a single World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup/news/shakib-al-hasan-world-cup-2019-records-batting-bowling-allrounder-new-zealand-scott-styris/article28263851.ece|title=Shakib Al Hasan first to 500 runs and 10 wickets in single World Cup|work=[[Sportstar]]|date=2 July 2019|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702174447/https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup/news/shakib-al-hasan-world-cup-2019-records-batting-bowling-allrounder-new-zealand-scott-styris/article28263851.ece|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This performance was not enough, though, with a Rohit Sharma century leading India into the semi-finals at their opponents' expense.<ref name=IndiaQ>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Wigmore|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/07/02/bangladesh-vs-india-cricket-world-cup-2019-live-score-latest/|title=India qualify for Cricket World Cup semi-finals after Rohit Sharma's ton against Bangladesh|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2 July 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707040434/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/07/02/bangladesh-vs-india-cricket-world-cup-2019-live-score-latest/|archive-date=7 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Week 6====\n[[File:Shakib_fielding,_23_January,_2009,_Dhaka_SBNS.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shakib Al Hasan]] (pictured in 2009) became the only cricketer in the World Cup history with 600 runs and 10 wickets.<ref name=\"Hasan\">{{cite news|first=Saurabh|last=Kumar|title=Shakib Al Hasan breaks Sachin Tendulkar' World Cup record|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket-world-cup-2019/story/shakib-al-hasan-breaks-sachin-tendulkar-world-cup-record-1563193-2019-07-05|work=India Today|date=5 July 2019|access-date=6 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706023527/https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket-world-cup-2019/story/shakib-al-hasan-breaks-sachin-tendulkar-world-cup-record-1563193-2019-07-05|archive-date=6 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>|alt=Shakib Al Hasan in 2009]]\nThe final round started with England taking on New Zealand, with the winner guaranteed a semi-final position.

However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two [[Glossary of cricket terms#D|dot balls]], Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' saying only one of the batsmen's runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|title=England Cricket World Cup win: 'Extra run' claims brushed off by Ashley Giles|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2019|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111216/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<ref>{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Marks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|title=England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716093839/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a [[Super Over]].

For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]], [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and 1992.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Gardner|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Epic final tied, Super Over tied, England win World Cup on boundary count|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715190820/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England's first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|title=Will apologise to Kane for rest of my life: Stokes|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=16 July 2019|access-date=17 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920221429/https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|archive-date=20 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Single-innings cricket match\n| bg = #eee\n| date = {{anchor|match48}} 14 July 2019\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|NZ}}\n| team2 = {{cr|ENG}}\n| score1 = 241/8 (50 overs)\n| score2 = 241 (50 overs)\n| result = [[2019 Cricket World Cup knockout stage#Final|Match tied]]\n| report = [https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/game/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/ Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Lord's]], London\n| notes = Super Over: England 15/0, New Zealand 15/1.\n*''England won the match on the boundary count back rule (26\u201317).''\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|2019 Cricket World Cup statistics}}\nIndia's Rohit Sharma ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 648 runs from nine matches which featured a 140 against Pakistan at Old Trafford.<ref name=IndiavsPakistan/> He finished ahead of Australia's David Warner (647 runs) and Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan (606 runs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest run scorers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234420/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Australian bowler Mitchell Starc ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets, which surpassed the record set by [[Glenn McGrath]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|title=Mitchell Starc breaks Glenn McGrath's record for most wickets in a World Cup|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=AFP|date=11 July 2019|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722185149/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|archive-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Second was Lockie Ferguson from New Zealand with 21 wickets, while Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh) and Jofra Archer (England) were tied for third place with 20 wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest wicket takers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234533/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Most runs===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Runs\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Player\n!{{Abbr|Inns|Innings}}\n!{{Abbr|HS|High score}}\n!{{Abbr|Ave|Average}}\n!{{Abbr|SR|Strike rate}}\n!{{Abbr|100|Hundreds scored}}\n!{{Abbr|50|Fiftys scored}}\n!{{Abbr|4s|Fours hit}}\n!{{Abbr|6s|Sixes hit}}\n|-\n!
