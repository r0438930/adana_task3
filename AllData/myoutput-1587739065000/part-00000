Work first started in 2009 on the section from Bragg Boulevard ([[North Carolina Highway 24]], NC&nbsp;24) to Murchison Road ([[North Carolina Highway 210|NC&nbsp;210]]) using federal stimulus monies. This was completed in 2014. In March 2011 a contract to construct the portion of the Loop between US&nbsp;401 and Murchison Road was awarded to a [[construction|construction company]], however this did not include final paving. The contract for paving was issued in 2014 and is scheduled to be completed during the summer of 2016, delayed from April 2014.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://www.fayobserver.com/military/contract-awarded-for-next-phase-of-fayetteville-outer-loop/article_6b5e147c-4fed-5743-ab45-9e57f11a22c1.html |title=Contract awarded for next phase of Fayetteville Outer Loop |newspaper=The Fayetteville Observer |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate= August 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn August 4, 2014, a {{convert|1.7|mi|km|adj=on}} new section of the Fayetteville Outer Loop opened between Murchison Road and Bragg Boulevard.
