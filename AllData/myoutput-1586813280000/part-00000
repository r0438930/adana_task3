''Agouti'' works with ''[[extension gene|extension]]'' to regulate the color of [[melanin]] which is produced in hairs. The agouti protein causes red to yellow pheomelanin to be produced, while the competing molecule [[Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone|\u03b1-MSH]] signals production of brown to black eumelanin. In wildtype mice, alternating cycles of agouti and \u03b1-MSH production cause [[agouti (coloration)|agouti coloration]]. Each hair has bands of yellow which grew during agouti production, and black which grew during \u03b1-MSH production. Wildtype mice also have light-colored bellies. The hairs there are a creamy color the whole length because the agouti protein was produced the whole time the hairs were growing.<ref name=Furumura1996>{{cite journal | title = The Interaction of Agouti Signal Protein and Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone to Regulate Melanin Formation in Mammals | last1 = Furumura | first1 = Minao | last2 = Sakai | first2 = Chie | last3 = Abdel-Malek | first3 = Zalfa | last4 = Barsh | first4 = Gregory | last5 = Hearing | first5 = Vincent | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0749.1996.tb00109.x | date = August 1996 | journal = Pigment Cell Research | volume = 9 | issue = 4}}</ref><ref name=OMIM-ASIP>{{OMIM|600201}}</ref>\n\nIn mice and other species, loss of function mutations generally cause a darker color, while gain of function mutations cause a yellower coat.<ref name=Fontanesi2010/>\n\n==Mice==\n[[File:Agouti_Mice.jpg|thumb|right|Both of these mice are viable yellow agouti a<sup>vy</sup>; however, the mouse on the right does not express it due to epigenetic methylation.]]\nAs of 1979, there were 17 known alleles of agouti in mice.<ref name=Silvers1979>{{cite web |url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/wksilvers/frames/frame2-1.shtml |title=The Agouti and Extension series of Alleles, Umbrous and Sable |access-date=2019-05-11 |last=Silvers |first=Willys K. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Springer Verlag |website=The Jackson Laboratory |date=1979}}<!-- What to do with a book published in 1979, posted on the web in 2003, and revised in 2008? --></ref>\n\n*Lethal yellow ''A<sup>y</sup>'' causes yellow coloration and obesity.

This theory also suggested that seal brown horses were black horses with a trait called ''pangare''. Pangar\u00e9 is an ancestral trait also called \"mealy\", which outlines the soft or communicative parts of the horse in buff tan.\n\nThe combination of black and pangar\u00e9 was dismissed as the cause of brown in 2001, when a French research team published ''Mutations in the agouti (ASIP), the extension (MC1R), and the brown (TYRP1) loci and their association to coat color phenotypes in horses (Equus caballus)''. This study used a DNA test to identify the recessive ''a'' allele on the Agouti locus, and found that none of the horses fitting the phenotype of seal brown were homozygous for the ''a'' allele.<ref name=\"Rieder_2001\"/>\n\nSince 2001, the mechanisms of the variations within the \"bay\" category remain unclear.

This theory also suggested that seal brown horses were black horses with a trait called ''pangare''. Pangar\u00e9 is an ancestral trait also called \"mealy\", which outlines the soft or communicative parts of the horse in buff tan.\n\nThe combination of black and pangar\u00e9 was dismissed as the cause of brown in 2001, when a French research team published ''Mutations in the agouti (ASIP), the extension (MC1R), and the brown (TYRP1) loci and their association to coat color phenotypes in horses (Equus caballus)''. This study used a DNA test to identify the recessive ''a'' allele on the Agouti locus, and found that none of the horses fitting the phenotype of seal brown were homozygous for the ''a'' allele.<ref name=\"Rieder_2001\"/>\n\nSince 2001, the mechanisms of the variations within the \"bay\" category remain unclear.
