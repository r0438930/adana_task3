The first championship was held in [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]] and was won by [[Joe Davis]]. Davis won the first 15 championships before retiring from the event, undefeated, after his [[1946 World Snooker Championship|1946]] success. In the 1950s snooker went into a period of decline and the championship was not held after 1952, although an unofficial championship was held until 1957. In 1964 the championship was revived on a challenge basis and in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]] the championship became a knock-out event again. Since [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]] it has been played at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. In the modern era (since 1969), the best record is that of [[Stephen Hendry]], who won the title seven times. [[Steve Davis]] and [[Ray Reardon]] both won six times while [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won five titles. The current champion is [[Judd Trump]], whose 2019 win was his first.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Professional Snooker Championship (1927\u20131934)===\n{{anchor|Professional Snooker Championship}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Previously the draw had been made early in the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue of matches. The change in format proved a great success and [[Thurston's Hall]] became the primary venue for professional snooker matches. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, dead frames were played out, whatever the state of the game.

Ronnie O'Sullivan, the second seed, lost to Ali Carter, while Ding Junhui only made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Barry Hawkins. The final was between two of the \"class of '92\", [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[John Higgins]]. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships - all in semi-finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17\u201315) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17\u201314). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18\u201316 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between consecutive World Championship victories. He won \u00a3425,000.  Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18-9 by [[Judd Trump]]. His prize was a record breaking \u00a3500,000. Trump also bettered O'Sullivan's six centuries in the 2013 final \u2013 making seven \u2013 which was also a record.\n\n== Format ==\nThe format for the World Championship has been largely unchanged since [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. It has a knock-out format with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is a [[May Day#United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]]. Before 1982 there were a number of different formats used for the Championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players played in the final stages at the Crucible. The top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, only 16 players reached the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. Before 1980, the final was not always played over a set number of frames- for example, in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]] [[Ray Reardon]] beat [[Perrie Mans]] in a best-of-49 frames match 25\u201318 and, [[1979 World Snooker Championship|the following year]], [[Terry Griffiths]] defeated [[Dennis Taylor]] 24\u201316 in a best-of-47.\n\n16 of the players reach the final stages directly while the other 16 get there through a qualifying competition. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed (the World Champion is usually seeded 2nd for all ranking tournaments, and The Masters, for the following season, except for the World Championship where is seeded 1st). The remaining direct entries are based on the latest [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]], players being seeded based on these world rankings. Since the defending champion is normally ranked in the top 16, the top 16 ranked players generally receive a direct entry.\n\nThe first round is played over 19 frames, played in two sessions. The second round and quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames played over three sessions while the semi-finals and final are played over four sessions, the semi-finals being over 33 frames and the final 35 frames. For the first 12 days of the tournament two matches are played concurrently. For the last five days (the semi-finals and final) only one table is used.\n\nPrior to 1997 the semi-finals were played over 31 frames. Occasionally the dates of the Championship are changed. In 1982 the Championship ended on Sunday 16 May while in 1985, 1990 and 1995 it ended on the last Sunday in April. In each of these years the tournament started on a Friday but, as of 2019, this has not happened since.\n\nSeveral changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Snooker: Stephen Hendry and other champions could return|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425181726/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|List of world snooker champions}}\n\n===Top performers of the modern era===\nThe 'modern' era is considered to start in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]], when the championship reverted to a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out tournament]] format from a challenge format.

The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. In the modern era (since 1969), the best record is that of [[Stephen Hendry]], who won the title seven times. [[Steve Davis]] and [[Ray Reardon]] both won six times while [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won five titles. The current champion is [[Judd Trump]], whose 2019 win was his first.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Professional Snooker Championship (1927\u20131934)===\n{{anchor|Professional Snooker Championship}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Previously the draw had been made early in the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue of matches. The change in format proved a great success and [[Thurston's Hall]] became the primary venue for professional snooker matches. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, dead frames were played out, whatever the state of the game.

Ronnie O'Sullivan, the second seed, lost to Ali Carter, while Ding Junhui only made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Barry Hawkins. The final was between two of the \"class of '92\", [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[John Higgins]]. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships - all in semi-finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17\u201315) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17\u201314). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18\u201316 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between consecutive World Championship victories. He won \u00a3425,000.  Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18-9 by [[Judd Trump]]. His prize was a record breaking \u00a3500,000. Trump also bettered O'Sullivan's six centuries in the 2013 final \u2013 making seven \u2013 which was also a record.\n\n== Format ==\nThe format for the World Championship has been largely unchanged since [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. It has a knock-out format with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is a [[May Day#United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]]. Before 1982 there were a number of different formats used for the Championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players played in the final stages at the Crucible. The top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, only 16 players reached the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. Before 1980, the final was not always played over a set number of frames- for example, in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]] [[Ray Reardon]] beat [[Perrie Mans]] in a best-of-49 frames match 25\u201318 and, [[1979 World Snooker Championship|the following year]], [[Terry Griffiths]] defeated [[Dennis Taylor]] 24\u201316 in a best-of-47.\n\n16 of the players reach the final stages directly while the other 16 get there through a qualifying competition. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed (the World Champion is usually seeded 2nd for all ranking tournaments, and The Masters, for the following season, except for the World Championship where is seeded 1st). The remaining direct entries are based on the latest [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]], players being seeded based on these world rankings. Since the defending champion is normally ranked in the top 16, the top 16 ranked players generally receive a direct entry.\n\nThe first round is played over 19 frames, played in two sessions. The second round and quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames played over three sessions while the semi-finals and final are played over four sessions, the semi-finals being over 33 frames and the final 35 frames. For the first 12 days of the tournament two matches are played concurrently. For the last five days (the semi-finals and final) only one table is used.\n\nPrior to 1997 the semi-finals were played over 31 frames. Occasionally the dates of the Championship are changed. In 1982 the Championship ended on Sunday 16 May while in 1985, 1990 and 1995 it ended on the last Sunday in April. In each of these years the tournament started on a Friday but, as of 2019, this has not happened since.\n\nSeveral changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Snooker: Stephen Hendry and other champions could return|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425181726/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|List of world snooker champions}}\n\n===Top performers of the modern era===\nThe 'modern' era is considered to start in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]], when the championship reverted to a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out tournament]] format from a challenge format.
