{"title_page": "Uncompressed video", "text_new": "{{short description|High-fidelity digital video signal}}\n{{redirect|Lossless video compression|a list of lossless video codecs|List of codecs#Lossless video compression}}\n'''Uncompressed video''' is [[digital video]] that either has never been [[video compression|compressed]] or was generated by decompressing previously compressed digital video. It is commonly used by video cameras, video monitors, video recording devices (including general purpose computers), and in video processors that perform functions such as image resizing, image rotation, deinterlacing, and text and graphics overlay. It is conveyed over various types of baseband digital video interfaces, such as [[HDMI]], [[DVI]], [[DisplayPort]] and [[Serial digital interface|SDI]]. Standards also exist for carriage of uncompressed video over [[computer network]]s.\n\nSome [[HD video]] cameras output uncompressed video, whereas others compress the video using a lossy compression method such as [[MPEG]] or [[H.264]]. In any lossy compression process, some of the video information is removed, which creates [[compression artifact]]s and reduces the quality of the resulting decompressed video. When editing video, it is preferred to work with video that has never been compressed (or was losslessly compressed) as this maintains the best possible quality, with compression performed after completion of editing.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd743961(v=vs.85).aspx Using Uncompressed Audio and Video Streams] Microsoft</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nA standalone video recorder is a device that receives uncompressed video and stores it in either uncompressed or compressed form. These devices typically have a video output which can be used to monitor or playback recorded video. When playing back compressed video, the compressed video is uncompressed by the device before being output. Such devices may also have a communication interface, such as Ethernet or USB, which can used to exchange video files with an external computer, and in some cases control the recorder from an external computer as well.\n\nRecording to a computer is a relatively inexpensive alternative to implementing a digital video recorder, but the computer and its video storage device (e.g., [[solid-state drive]], [[RAID]]) must be fast enough to keep up with the high video data rate, which in some cases may be [[HD video]] or multiple video sources, or both. Due to the extreme computational and storage system performance demands of real-time video processing, other unnecessary [[Computer program|program]] activity (e.g., [[background process]]es, [[virus scanner]]s) and asynchronous hardware interfaces (e.g., [[computer networks]]) may be disabled, and the [[Computer multitasking|process priority]] of the recording [[Real-time computing|realtime process]] may be increased, to avoid disruption of the recording process.\n\nHDMI, DVI and HD-SDI inputs are available as [[PCI Express]] (partly multi-channel) or [[ExpressCard]], [[USB 3.0]]<ref>[http://www.epiphan.com/products/compare-usb-video-grabbers/ Compare USB Video Grabbers] Epiphan</ref> and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] interface<ref>[http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity/ Intensity models] Blackmagic</ref><ref>[http://www.imperx.com/frame-grabbers/hd-sdi-express34 HD-SDI Express/34] Imperx</ref><ref>[http://www.deltacast.tv/Products/DELTA-hd-SDI-OEM-video-input-output-PCI-Express-card.asp OEM video card for 8-10-12-bit HD-SD SDI digital video to PCI Express] Deltacast</ref> also for [[2160p]] ([[4K resolution]]).<ref>[http://www.magewell.com/hardware?lang=en Capture Card Series] Magewell</ref><ref>[http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink/models DeckLink models] Blackmagic</ref>\n\nSoftware for recording uncompressed video is often supplied with suitable hardware or available for free e.g. [[Ingex]].<ref>[http://ingex.sourceforge.net/studio/ Ingex Studio - Multi-camera Tapeless Recording]</ref>\n\n==Network transmission==\n[[SMPTE 2022]] and [[SMPTE 2110|2110]] are standards for professional digital video over [[IP network]]s.
