The minimum amount that banks are required to hold in liquid assets is determined by the country's [[central bank]], and is called the [[reserve requirement]] or reserve ratio. Banks usually hold more than this minimum amount, keeping [[excess reserves]]. \n\nBank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term \u2013 this requires banks to hold reserves to provide [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] when deposits are withdrawn. Banks, working on the expectation that only a proportion of depositors will seek to withdraw funds at the same time, keep only a fraction of their liabilities as reserves. Thus, they can experience an unexpected [[bank run]], when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow from other banks in the [[interbank lending market]]; or if there is a general lack of liquidity among the banks, the country's central bank may act as [[lender of last resort]] to provide banks with funds to cover this short-term shortfall.<ref name=\"AbelAndrew\" /><ref name=\"Mankiw\"/>\n\nBecause banks hold reserves in amounts that are less than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the [[money supply]] to grow beyond the amount of the underlying [[base money]] originally created by the central bank.<ref name=\"AbelAndrew\"/><ref name=\"Mankiw\">{{Cite book |last=Mankiw |first=N.

These notes gained acceptance as a [[medium of exchange]] for commercial transactions and thus became an early form of circulating [[paper money]].<ref name=\"moneyfacts\">{{cite book |last=United States.

This generated [[income]] for the goldsmiths but left them with more notes on issue than reserves with which to pay them. A process was started that altered the role of the goldsmiths from passive guardians of [[bullion]], charging fees for safe storage, to interest-paying and interest-earning banks.  Thus fractional-reserve banking was born.\n\nIf [[creditor]]s (note holders of gold originally deposited) lost faith in the ability of a bank to pay their notes, however, many would try to redeem their notes at the same time. If, in response, a bank could not raise enough funds by calling in loans or selling bills, the bank would either go into [[insolvency]] or default on its notes. Such a situation is called a [[bank run]] and caused the demise of many early banks.<ref name=\"moneyfacts\"/>\n\nThese early financial crises led to the creation of [[central banks]]. The Swedish [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]] was the world's first central bank, created in 1668. Many nations followed suit in the late 1600s to establish [[central bank]]s which were given the legal power to set the [[reserve requirement]], and to specify the form in which such assets (called the [[monetary base]]) are required to be held.<ref>Charles P. Kindleberger, A Financial History of Western Europe. Routledge 2007</ref> In order to mitigate the impact of bank failures and financial crises, central banks were also granted the authority to centralize banks' storage of precious metal reserves, thereby facilitating transfer of gold in the event of bank runs, to regulate commercial banks, to impose reserve requirements, and to act as lender-of-last-resort if any bank faced a bank run. The emergence of central banks reduced the risk of bank runs which is inherent in fractional-reserve banking, and it allowed the practice to continue as it does today.<ref name=\"Mankiw\"/> \n\nDuring the twentieth century, the role of the central bank grew to include influencing or managing various macroeconomic policy variables, including measures of inflation, unemployment, and the international [[balance of payments]]. In the course of enacting such policy, central banks have from time to time attempted to manage interest rates, reserve requirements, and various measures of the money supply and [[monetary base]].<ref name=\"paf\">[http://www.stls.frb.org:80/publications/pleng/PDF/PlainEnglish.pdf The Federal Reserve in Plain English]  \u2013 An easy-to-read guide to the structure and functions of the Federal Reserve System (See page 5 of the document for the purposes and functions)</ref>\n\n== Regulatory framework==\nIn most legal systems, a bank deposit is not a [[bailment]]. In other words, the funds deposited are no longer the property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a [[deposit account]] (a [[checking account|checking]] or [[savings account]]). That deposit account is a ''liability'' on the [[balance sheet]] of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits.\n\nFractional-reserve banking ordinarily functions smoothly. Relatively few depositors demand payment at any given time, and banks maintain a buffer of reserves to cover depositors' cash withdrawals and other demands for funds.  However, during a bank run or a generalized [[financial crisis]], demands for withdrawal can exceed the bank's funding buffer, and the bank will be forced to raise additional reserves to avoid defaulting on its obligations. A bank can raise funds from additional borrowings (e.g., by borrowing in the [[interbank lending market]] or from the central bank), by selling assets, or by calling in short-term loans. If creditors are afraid that the bank is running out of reserves or is insolvent, they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible before other depositors access the remaining reserves. Thus the fear of a bank run can actually precipitate the crisis.<ref group=\"note\">For an example, see [[Nationalisation of Northern Rock#Run on the bank]]</ref>\n\nMany of the practices of contemporary bank regulation and [[central banking]], including centralized [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] of payments, central bank lending to member banks, regulatory auditing, and government-administered [[deposit insurance]], are designed to prevent the occurrence of such bank runs.\n\n==Economic function==\nFractional-reserve banking allows banks to provide credit, which represent immediate liquidity to depositors. The banks also provide longer-term loans to borrowers, and act as [[Financial intermediary|financial intermediaries]] for those funds.<ref name=\"Mankiw\"/><ref name=\"Abel_Bernanke\">{{Cite book |last=Abel |first=Andrew |last2=Bernanke |first2=Ben |authorlink2=Ben Bernanke |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Pearson |year=2005 |edition=5th|pages=266\u2013269 |chapter=7}}</ref> Less liquid forms of deposit (such as [[time deposits]]) or riskier classes of financial assets (such as equities or long-term bonds) may lock up a depositor's wealth for a period of time, making it unavailable for use on demand.

The practice regarding the currency issue is governed more by convention than by any particular theory. It is well known that the basic concept of currency evolved in order to facilitate exchange. The primitive currency note was in reality a promissory note to pay back to its bearer the original precious metals. With greater acceptability of these promissory notes, these began to move across the country and the banks that issued the promissory notes soon learnt that they could issue more receipts than the gold reserves held by them. This led to the evolution of the fractional-reserve system. It also led to repeated bank failures and brought forth the need to have an independent authority to act as lender-of-the-last-resort. Even after the emergence of central banks, the concerned governments continued to decide asset backing for issue of coins and notes. The asset backing took various forms including gold coins, bullion, foreign exchange reserves and foreign securities. With the emergence of a fractional-reserve system, this reserve backing (gold, currency assets, etc.) came down to a fraction of total currency put in circulation.</ref>\n\n===Central banks===\n{{main article|Central bank}}\nGovernment controls and [[bank regulation]]s related to fractional-reserve banking have generally been used to impose restrictive requirements on note issue and deposit taking on the one hand, and to provide relief from bankruptcy and creditor claims, and/or protect creditors with government funds, when banks defaulted on the other hand. Such measures have included:\n# Minimum [[Reserve requirement|required reserve ratios]] (RRRs)\n# Minimum [[capital ratio]]s\n# Government bond deposit requirements for note issue\n# 100% Marginal Reserve requirements for note issue, such as the [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] (UK)\n# Sanction on bank defaults and protection from creditors for many months or even years, and\n# Central bank support for distressed banks, and government guarantee funds for notes and deposits, both to counteract bank runs and to protect bank creditors.\n\n===Reserve requirements===\nThe currently prevailing view of [[reserve requirement]]s is that they are intended to prevent banks from:\n# generating too much money by making too many loans against the narrow money deposit base;\n# having a shortage of cash when large deposits are withdrawn (although the reserve is thought to be a legal minimum, it is understood that in a crisis or [[bank run]], reserves may be made available on a temporary basis).\n\nIn some jurisdictions, (such as the United States and the European Union), the central bank does not require reserves to be held during the day. Reserve requirements are intended to ensure that the banks have sufficient supplies of highly liquid assets, so that the system operates in an orderly fashion and maintains public confidence.\n\nIn addition to reserve requirements, there are other required [[financial ratio]]s that affect the amount of loans that a bank can fund. The [[Capital requirement|capital requirement ratio]] is perhaps the most important of these other required ratios. When there are [[Reserve requirement#Reserve ratios|no mandatory reserve requirements]], which are considered by some economists to restrict lending, the capital requirement ratio acts to prevent an infinite amount of bank lending.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Liquidity and capital management for a bank===\n{{main article|Capital requirement|Market liquidity}}\nTo avoid defaulting on its obligations, the bank must maintain a minimal reserve ratio that it fixes in accordance with, notably, regulations and its liabilities. In practice this means that the bank sets a reserve ratio target and responds when the actual ratio falls below the target. Such response can be, for instance:\n# Selling or redeeming other assets, or [[securitization]] of illiquid assets,\n# Restricting investment in new loans,\n# Borrowing funds (whether repayable on demand or at a fixed maturity),\n# Issuing additional [[Capital requirement#Regulatory capital|capital instruments]], or\n# Reducing [[dividend]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nBecause different funding options have different costs, and differ in reliability, banks maintain a stock of low cost and reliable sources of liquidity such as:\n# Demand deposits with other banks\n# High quality marketable debt securities\n# Committed lines of credit with other banks{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nAs with reserves, other sources of liquidity are managed with targets.\n\nThe ability of the bank to borrow money reliably and economically is crucial, which is why confidence in the bank's creditworthiness is important to its liquidity. This means that the bank needs to maintain adequate capitalisation and to effectively control its exposures to risk in order to continue its operations. If creditors doubt the bank's assets are worth more than its liabilities, all demand creditors have an incentive to demand payment immediately, causing a bank run to occur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nContemporary bank management methods for liquidity are based on maturity analysis of all the bank's assets and liabilities (off balance sheet exposures may also be included). Assets and liabilities are put into residual contractual maturity buckets such as 'on demand', 'less than 1 month', '2\u20133 months' etc. These residual contractual maturities may be adjusted to account for expected counter party behaviour such as early loan repayments due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. Scenario analysis may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n==Hypothetical example of a bank balance sheet and financial ratios==\nAn example of fractional-reserve banking, and the calculation of the \"reserve ratio\" is shown in the balance sheet below:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Example 2: ANZ National Bank Limited Balance Sheet as of 30 September 2037\n|-\n|'''Assets'''\n| align = \"center\" | '''NZ$m'''\n|'''Liabilities'''\n| align = \"center\" | '''NZ$m'''\n|-\n|Cash\n| align = \"right\" | 201\n|Demand deposits\n| align = \"right\" | 25,482\n|-\n|Balance with Central Bank\n| align = \"right\" | 2,809\n|Term deposits and other borrowings\n| align = \"right\" | 35,231\n|-\n|Other liquid assets\n| align = \"right\" | 1,797\n|Due to other financial institutions\n| align = \"right\" | 3,170\n|-\n|Due from other financial institutions\n| align = \"right\" | 3,563\n|Derivative financial instruments\n| align = \"right\" | 4,924\n|-\n|Trading securities\n| align = \"right\" | 1,887\n|Payables and other liabilities\n| align = \"right\" | 1,351\n|-\n|Derivative financial instruments\n| align = \"right\" | 4,771\n|Provisions\n| align = \"right\" | 165\n|-\n|Available for sale assets\n| align = \"right\" | 48\n|Bonds and notes\n| align = \"right\" | 14,607\n|-\n|Net loans and advances\n| align = \"right\" | 87,878\n|Related party funding\n| align = \"right\" | 2,775\n|-\n|Shares in controlled entities\n| align = \"right\" | 206\n|[subordinated] Loan capital\n| align = \"right\" | 2,062\n|-\n|Current tax assets\n| align = \"right\" | 112\n|'''Total Liabilities'''\n| align = \"right\" | '''99,084'''\n|-\n|Other assets\n| align = \"right\" | 1,045\n|Share capital\n| align = \"right\" | 5,943\n|-\n|Deferred tax assets\n| align = \"right\" | 11\n|[revaluation] Reserves\n| align = \"right\" | 83\n|-\n|Premises and equipment\n| align = \"right\" | 232\n|Retained profits\n| align = \"right\" | 2,667\n|-\n|Goodwill and other intangibles\n| align = \"right\" | 3,297\n|'''Total Equity'''\n| align = \"right\" | '''8,703'''\n|-\n|'''Total Assets'''\n| align = \"right\" | '''107,787'''\n|'''Total Liabilities plus Net Worth'''\n| align = \"right\" | '''107,787'''\n|}\n\nIn this example the cash reserves held by the bank is NZ$3,010m (NZ$201m Cash + NZ$2,809m Balance at Central Bank) and the Demand Deposits (liabilities) of the bank are NZ$25,482m, for a cash reserve ratio of 11.81%.\n\n=== Other financial ratios ===\nThe key [[financial ratio]] used to analyze fractional-reserve banks is the [[cash reserve ratio]], which is the ratio of cash reserves to demand deposits.

Other important financial ratios may require analysis of disclosures in other parts of the bank's financial statements. In particular, for [[liquidity risk]], disclosures are incorporated into a note to the financial statements that provides maturity analysis of the bank's assets and liabilities and an explanation of how the bank manages its liquidity.\n\n== Criticisms of textbook descriptions of the monetary system ==\n[[Glenn Stevens]], governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said of the \"money multiplier\", \"most practitioners find it to be a pretty unsatisfactory description of how the monetary and credit system actually works.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Glen|title=The Australian Economy: Then and Now|url=http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2008/sp-gov-150508.html|publisher=Reserve Bank of Australia}}</ref>\n\nLord [[Adair Turner|Turner]], formerly the UK's chief financial regulator, said \"Banks do not, as too many textbooks still suggest, take deposits of existing money from savers and lend it out to borrowers: they create credit and money [[ex nihilo]] \u2013 extending a loan to the borrower and simultaneously crediting the borrower\u2019s money account\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Adair|title=Credit Money and Leverage, what Wicksell, Hayek and Fisher knew and modern macroeconomics forgot|url=https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/67785745/turner.pdf}}</ref>\n\nFormer Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada [[William White (economist)|William White]] said \"Some decades ago, the academic literature would have emphasised the importance of the reserves supplied by the central bank to the banking system, and the implications (via the money multiplier) for the growth of money and credit.

The minimum amount that banks are required to hold in liquid assets is determined by the country's [[central bank]], and is called the [[reserve requirement]] or reserve ratio. Banks usually hold more than this minimum amount, keeping [[excess reserves]]. \n\nBank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term \u2013 this requires banks to hold reserves to provide [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] when deposits are withdrawn. Banks, working on the expectation that only a proportion of depositors will seek to withdraw funds at the same time, keep only a fraction of their liabilities as reserves. Thus, they can experience an unexpected [[bank run]], when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow from other banks in the [[interbank lending market]]; or if there is a general lack of liquidity among the banks, the country's central bank may act as [[lender of last resort]] to provide banks with funds to cover this short-term shortfall.<ref name=\"AbelAndrew\" /><ref name=\"Mankiw\"/>\n\nBecause banks hold reserves in amounts that are less than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the [[money supply]] to grow beyond the amount of the underlying [[base money]] originally created by the central bank.<ref name=\"AbelAndrew\"/><ref name=\"Mankiw\">{{Cite book |last=Mankiw |first=N.

This generated [[income]] for the goldsmiths but left them with more notes on issue than reserves with which to pay them. A process was started that altered the role of the goldsmiths from passive guardians of [[bullion]], charging fees for safe storage, to interest-paying and interest-earning banks.  Thus fractional-reserve banking was born.\n\nIf [[creditor]]s (note holders of gold originally deposited) lost faith in the ability of a bank to pay their notes, however, many would try to redeem their notes at the same time. If, in response, a bank could not raise enough funds by calling in loans or selling bills, the bank would either go into [[insolvency]] or default on its notes. Such a situation is called a [[bank run]] and caused the demise of many early banks.<ref name=\"moneyfacts\"/>\n\nThese early financial crises led to the creation of [[central banks]]. The Swedish [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]] was the world's first central bank, created in 1668. Many nations followed suit in the late 1600s to establish [[central bank]]s which were given the legal power to set the [[reserve requirement]], and to specify the form in which such assets (called the [[monetary base]]) are required to be held.<ref>Charles P. Kindleberger, A Financial History of Western Europe. Routledge 2007</ref> In order to mitigate the impact of bank failures and financial crises, central banks were also granted the authority to centralize banks' storage of precious metal reserves, thereby facilitating transfer of gold in the event of bank runs, to regulate commercial banks, to impose reserve requirements, and to act as lender-of-last-resort if any bank faced a bank run. The emergence of central banks reduced the risk of bank runs which is inherent in fractional-reserve banking, and it allowed the practice to continue as it does today.<ref name=\"Mankiw\"/> \n\nDuring the twentieth century, the role of the central bank grew to include influencing or managing various macroeconomic policy variables, including measures of inflation, unemployment, and the international [[balance of payments]]. In the course of enacting such policy, central banks have from time to time attempted to manage interest rates, reserve requirements, and various measures of the money supply and [[monetary base]].<ref name=\"paf\">[http://www.stls.frb.org:80/publications/pleng/PDF/PlainEnglish.pdf The Federal Reserve in Plain English]  \u2013 An easy-to-read guide to the structure and functions of the Federal Reserve System (See page 5 of the document for the purposes and functions)</ref>\n\n== Regulatory framework==\nIn most legal systems, a bank deposit is not a [[bailment]]. In other words, the funds deposited are no longer the property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a [[deposit account]] (a [[checking account|checking]] or [[savings account]]). That deposit account is a ''liability'' on the [[balance sheet]] of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits.\n\nFractional-reserve banking ordinarily functions smoothly. Relatively few depositors demand payment at any given time, and banks maintain a buffer of reserves to cover depositors' cash withdrawals and other demands for funds.  However, during a bank run or a generalized [[financial crisis]], demands for withdrawal can exceed the bank's funding buffer, and the bank will be forced to raise additional reserves to avoid defaulting on its obligations. A bank can raise funds from additional borrowings (e.g., by borrowing in the [[interbank lending market]] or from the central bank), by selling assets, or by calling in short-term loans. If creditors are afraid that the bank is running out of reserves or is insolvent, they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible before other depositors access the remaining reserves. Thus the fear of a bank run can actually precipitate the crisis.<ref group=\"note\">For an example, see [[Nationalisation of Northern Rock#Run on the bank]]</ref>\n\nMany of the practices of contemporary bank regulation and [[central banking]], including centralized [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] of payments, central bank lending to member banks, regulatory auditing, and government-administered [[deposit insurance]], are designed to prevent the occurrence of such bank runs.\n\n==Economic function==\nFractional-reserve banking allows banks to provide credit, which represent immediate liquidity to depositors. The banks also provide longer-term loans to borrowers, and act as [[Financial intermediary|financial intermediaries]] for those funds.<ref name=\"Mankiw\"/><ref name=\"Abel_Bernanke\">{{Cite book |last=Abel |first=Andrew |last2=Bernanke |first2=Ben |authorlink2=Ben Bernanke |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Pearson |year=2005 |edition=5th|pages=266\u2013269 |chapter=7}}</ref> Less liquid forms of deposit (such as [[time deposits]]) or riskier classes of financial assets (such as equities or long-term bonds) may lock up a depositor's wealth for a period of time, making it unavailable for use on demand.

The practice regarding the currency issue is governed more by convention than by any particular theory. It is well known that the basic concept of currency evolved in order to facilitate exchange. The primitive currency note was in reality a promissory note to pay back to its bearer the original precious metals. With greater acceptability of these promissory notes, these began to move across the country and the banks that issued the promissory notes soon learnt that they could issue more receipts than the gold reserves held by them. This led to the evolution of the fractional-reserve system. It also led to repeated bank failures and brought forth the need to have an independent authority to act as lender-of-the-last-resort. Even after the emergence of central banks, the concerned governments continued to decide asset backing for issue of coins and notes. The asset backing took various forms including gold coins, bullion, foreign exchange reserves and foreign securities. With the emergence of a fractional-reserve system, this reserve backing (gold, currency assets, etc.) came down to a fraction of total currency put in circulation.</ref>\n\n===Central banks===\n{{main article|Central bank}}\nGovernment controls and [[bank regulation]]s related to fractional-reserve banking have generally been used to impose restrictive requirements on note issue and deposit taking on the one hand, and to provide relief from bankruptcy and creditor claims, and/or protect creditors with government funds, when banks defaulted on the other hand. Such measures have included:\n# Minimum [[Reserve requirement|required reserve ratios]] (RRRs)\n# Minimum [[capital ratio]]s\n# Government bond deposit requirements for note issue\n# 100% Marginal Reserve requirements for note issue, such as the [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] (UK)\n# Sanction on bank defaults and protection from creditors for many months or even years, and\n# Central bank support for distressed banks, and government guarantee funds for notes and deposits, both to counteract bank runs and to protect bank creditors.\n\n===Reserve requirements===\nThe currently prevailing view of [[reserve requirement]]s is that they are intended to prevent banks from:\n# generating too much money by making too many loans against the narrow money deposit base;\n# having a shortage of cash when large deposits are withdrawn (although the reserve is thought to be a legal minimum, it is understood that in a crisis or [[bank run]], reserves may be made available on a temporary basis).\n\nIn some jurisdictions, (such as the United States and the European Union), the central bank does not require reserves to be held during the day. Reserve requirements are intended to ensure that the banks have sufficient supplies of highly liquid assets, so that the system operates in an orderly fashion and maintains public confidence.\n\nIn addition to reserve requirements, there are other required [[financial ratio]]s that affect the amount of loans that a bank can fund. The [[Capital requirement|capital requirement ratio]] is perhaps the most important of these other required ratios. When there are [[Reserve requirement#Reserve ratios|no mandatory reserve requirements]], which are considered by some economists to restrict lending, the capital requirement ratio acts to prevent an infinite amount of bank lending.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Liquidity and capital management for a bank===\n{{main article|Capital requirement|Market liquidity}}\nTo avoid defaulting on its obligations, the bank must maintain a minimal reserve ratio that it fixes in accordance with, notably, regulations and its liabilities. In practice this means that the bank sets a reserve ratio target and responds when the actual ratio falls below the target. Such response can be, for instance:\n# Selling or redeeming other assets, or [[securitization]] of illiquid assets,\n# Restricting investment in new loans,\n# Borrowing funds (whether repayable on demand or at a fixed maturity),\n# Issuing additional [[Capital requirement#Regulatory capital|capital instruments]], or\n# Reducing [[dividend]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nBecause different funding options have different costs, and differ in reliability, banks maintain a stock of low cost and reliable sources of liquidity such as:\n# Demand deposits with other banks\n# High quality marketable debt securities\n# Committed lines of credit with other banks{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nAs with reserves, other sources of liquidity are managed with targets.\n\nThe ability of the bank to borrow money reliably and economically is crucial, which is why confidence in the bank's creditworthiness is important to its liquidity. This means that the bank needs to maintain adequate capitalisation and to effectively control its exposures to risk in order to continue its operations. If creditors doubt the bank's assets are worth more than its liabilities, all demand creditors have an incentive to demand payment immediately, causing a bank run to occur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nContemporary bank management methods for liquidity are based on maturity analysis of all the bank's assets and liabilities (off balance sheet exposures may also be included). Assets and liabilities are put into residual contractual maturity buckets such as 'on demand', 'less than 1 month', '2\u20133 months' etc. These residual contractual maturities may be adjusted to account for expected counter party behaviour such as early loan repayments due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. Scenario analysis may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n==Hypothetical example of a bank balance sheet and financial ratios==\nAn example of fractional-reserve banking, and the calculation of the \"reserve ratio\" is shown in the balance sheet below:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Example 2: ANZ National Bank Limited Balance Sheet as of 30 September 2037\n|-\n|'''Assets'''\n| align = \"center\" | '''NZ$m'''\n|'''Liabilities'''\n| align = \"center\" | '''NZ$m'''\n|-\n|Cash\n| align = \"right\" | 201\n|Demand deposits\n| align = \"right\" | 25,482\n|-\n|Balance with Central Bank\n| align = \"right\" | 2,809\n|Term deposits and other borrowings\n| align = \"right\" | 35,231\n|-\n|Other liquid assets\n| align = \"right\" | 1,797\n|Due to other financial institutions\n| align = \"right\" | 3,170\n|-\n|Due from other financial institutions\n| align = \"right\" | 3,563\n|Derivative financial instruments\n| align = \"right\" | 4,924\n|-\n|Trading securities\n| align = \"right\" | 1,887\n|Payables and other liabilities\n| align = \"right\" | 1,351\n|-\n|Derivative financial instruments\n| align = \"right\" | 4,771\n|Provisions\n| align = \"right\" | 165\n|-\n|Available for sale assets\n| align = \"right\" | 48\n|Bonds and notes\n| align = \"right\" | 14,607\n|-\n|Net loans and advances\n| align = \"right\" | 87,878\n|Related party funding\n| align = \"right\" | 2,775\n|-\n|Shares in controlled entities\n| align = \"right\" | 206\n|[subordinated] Loan capital\n| align = \"right\" | 2,062\n|-\n|Current tax assets\n| align = \"right\" | 112\n|'''Total Liabilities'''\n| align = \"right\" | '''99,084'''\n|-\n|Other assets\n| align = \"right\" | 1,045\n|Share capital\n| align = \"right\" | 5,943\n|-\n|Deferred tax assets\n| align = \"right\" | 11\n|[revaluation] Reserves\n| align = \"right\" | 83\n|-\n|Premises and equipment\n| align = \"right\" | 232\n|Retained profits\n| align = \"right\" | 2,667\n|-\n|Goodwill and other intangibles\n| align = \"right\" | 3,297\n|'''Total Equity'''\n| align = \"right\" | '''8,703'''\n|-\n|'''Total Assets'''\n| align = \"right\" | '''107,787'''\n|'''Total Liabilities plus Net Worth'''\n| align = \"right\" | '''107,787'''\n|}\n\nIn this example the cash reserves held by the bank is NZ$3,010m (NZ$201m Cash + NZ$2,809m Balance at Central Bank) and the Demand Deposits (liabilities) of the bank are NZ$25,482m, for a cash reserve ratio of 11.81%.\n\n=== Other financial ratios ===\nThe key [[financial ratio]] used to analyze fractional-reserve banks is the [[cash reserve ratio]], which is the ratio of cash reserves to demand deposits. However, other important financial ratios are also used to analyze the bank's liquidity, financial strength, profitability etc.\n\nFor example, the ANZ National Bank Limited balance sheet above gives the following financial ratios:\n# The cash reserve ratio is $3,010m/$25,482m, i.e. 11.81%.\n# The liquid assets reserve ratio is ($201m + $2,809m + $1,797m)/$25,482m, i.e. 18.86%.\n# The equity capital ratio is $8,703m/107,787m, i.e. 8.07%.\n# The tangible equity ratio is ($8,703m \u2212 $3,297m)/107,787m, i.e. 5.02%\n# The total capital ratio is ($8,703m + $2,062m)/$107,787m, i.e. 9.99%.\n\nIt is important how the term 'reserves' is defined for calculating the reserve ratio, as different definitions give different results. Other important financial ratios may require analysis of disclosures in other parts of the bank's financial statements. In particular, for [[liquidity risk]], disclosures are incorporated into a note to the financial statements that provides maturity analysis of the bank's assets and liabilities and an explanation of how the bank manages its liquidity.\n\n== Criticisms of textbook descriptions of the monetary system ==\n[[Glenn Stevens]], governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said of the \"money multiplier\", \"most practitioners find it to be a pretty unsatisfactory description of how the monetary and credit system actually works.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Glen|title=The Australian Economy: Then and Now|url=http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2008/sp-gov-150508.html|publisher=Reserve Bank of Australia}}</ref>\n\nLord [[Adair Turner|Turner]], formerly the UK's chief financial regulator, said \"Banks do not, as too many textbooks still suggest, take deposits of existing money from savers and lend it out to borrowers: they create credit and money [[ex nihilo]] \u2013 extending a loan to the borrower and simultaneously crediting the borrower\u2019s money account\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Adair|title=Credit Money and Leverage, what Wicksell, Hayek and Fisher knew and modern macroeconomics forgot|url=https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/67785745/turner.pdf}}</ref>\n\nFormer Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada [[William White (economist)|William White]] said \"Some decades ago, the academic literature would have emphasised the importance of the reserves supplied by the central bank to the banking system, and the implications (via the money multiplier) for the growth of money and credit. Today, it is more broadly understood that no industrial country conducts policy in this way under normal circumstances.\" <ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=William|title=Changing views on how best to conduct monetary policy: the last fifty years|url=http://www.bis.org/speeches/sp011214.htm|publisher=Bank for International Settlements}}</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{Main|Monetary reform}}\n\n=== Criticisms on the basis of instability ===\n\nIn 1935, economist [[Irving Fisher]] proposed a system of 100% reserve banking as a means of reversing the deflation of the [[Great Depression]]. He wrote: \"100 per cent banking ... would give the Federal Reserve absolute control over the money supply. Recall that under the present fractional-reserve system of depository institutions, the money supply is determined in the short run by such non-policy variables as the currency/deposit ratio of the public and the excess reserve ratio of depository institutions.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n | title = 100% Money\n | publisher = Pickering & Chatto Ltd\n | first = Irving\n | last = Fisher\n|authorlink= Irving Fisher\n | isbn = 978-1-85196-236-5\n | year = 1997}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nToday, [[Monetary reform|monetary reformers]] argue that fractional reserve banking leads to unpayable debt, growing [[economic inequality|inequality]], inevitable [[bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and an imperative for perpetual and [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] [[economic growth]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Andrew |last2=Dyson |first2=Ben |title=Modernizing Money.

According to them, not only does money creation cause macroeconomic instability (based on the [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]]), but it is a form of [[embezzlement]] or financial [[fraud]], legalized only due to the influence of powerful rich bankers on corrupt governments around the world.<ref name=rothbard>{{cite book|last1=Rothbard|first1=Murray|title=The Mystery of Banking|date=1983|isbn=9780943940045}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Jes\u00fas Huerta de Soto |title=Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles |url=https://www.mises.org/store/Money-Bank-Credit-and-Economic-Cycles-P290C0.aspx | year=2012 | publisher= Ludwig von Mises Institute | location= Auburn, AL | pages = 881 | edition= 3d | isbn=  9781610161893 | oclc= 807678778}} (with Melinda A.
