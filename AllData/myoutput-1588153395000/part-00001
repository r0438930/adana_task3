His work played a key role in the development of [[theoretical ecology]] through the 1970s and 1980s. He also applied these tools to the study of disease and to the study of [[biodiversity]].\n\nMay was Gordon MacKay Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at [[Harvard University]] (1959\u201361) and returned to the [[University of Sydney]] (1962) as senior lecturer, reader, and professor (1969\u201372) in [[theoretical physics]]. From 1973 until 1988, he was Class of 1977 Professor of Zoology at [[Princeton University]], serving as chairman of the University Research Board 1977{{Ndash}}88. From 1988 until 1995, he held a [[Royal Society]] Research Professorship jointly at [[Imperial College London]] and the [[University of Oxford]], where became a Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford]] and a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]].{{when|date=May 2017}} He was [[Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government|Chief Scientific Adviser to HM Government]] and head of the [[Office of Science and Technology]] (1995\u20132000), and president of the [[Royal Society]] (2000\u20132005).\n\n===Public life===\nMay held subsidiary appointments as executive trustee of the [[Nuffield Foundation]], member of the board of the [[United Kingdom Sports Institute]], foundation trustee of the [[Gates Scholarship|Gates Trust]] ([[University of Cambridge]]), chairman of the board of trustees of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], trustee of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], independent member of the [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]], trustee of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund-UK]], president of the [[British Ecological Society]], and member of the [[Committee on Climate Change]].\n\nIn 1996, May asked [[Ig Nobel]] to stop awarding prizes to British scientists because this might lead the public to treat worthwhile research less seriously (see [[Ig Nobel#Reception|Criticism of Ig Nobel]]).\n\n===Climate change co-operation===\nAlthough an [[atheism|atheist]] since age 11, May stated that religion may help society deal with climate change. While referring to what he believes to be a rigid structure of fundamentalist religion, he stated that the co-operational aspects of non-fundamentalist religion may in fact help with climate change. When asked if religious leaders should be doing more to persuade people to combat climate change, he stated that it was absolutely necessary.<ref>Richard Alleyne, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/richard-alleyne/6146656/Maybe-religion-is-the-answer-claims-atheist-scientist.html \"Maybe religion is the answer\" claims-atheist-scientist], The Daily Telegraph, 7 September 2009]</ref>\n\n===Awards and honours===\nMay was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1996,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54255 |date=30 December 1995 |page=2 |supp=y}}</ref> and a [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in 1998.

While referring to what he believes to be a rigid structure of fundamentalist religion, he stated that the co-operational aspects of non-fundamentalist religion may in fact help with climate change. When asked if religious leaders should be doing more to persuade people to combat climate change, he stated that it was absolutely necessary.<ref>Richard Alleyne, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/richard-alleyne/6146656/Maybe-religion-is-the-answer-claims-atheist-scientist.html \"Maybe religion is the answer\" claims-atheist-scientist], The Daily Telegraph, 7 September 2009]</ref>\n\n===Awards and honours===\nMay was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1996,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54255 |date=30 December 1995 |page=2 |supp=y}}</ref> and a [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in 1998.
