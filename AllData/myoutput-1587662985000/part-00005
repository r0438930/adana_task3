He served as [[president of Mexico]] from 15 January 1851 to 6 January 1853.\n\n==Military==\nHe was born in the state of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]] in colonial [[New Spain]]. Originally an officer in the Spanish Army, Arista later joined the revolutionary army of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. Later, he served under [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], Mexico's on-again/off-again dictator during the attempt to put down the 1836 [[Texas Revolution]].\n\nIn 1846, Arista was given command of the Army of the North and sent to expel American troops from territory claimed by Mexico in Texas. The resulting engagement ignited the bloody [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846\u20131848. Arista was in command of Mexican forces during the [[Battle of Palo Alto]] and the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]], where he was defeated, due largely to superior U.S. artillery.\n\nPersonally quite brave, Arista was a dedicated republican \u2013 a member of Mexico's liberal faction, and therefore the natural enemy of his largely conservative general staff. At both the Battles of [[Battle of Palo Alto|Palo Alto]] and [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma|Resaca de la Palma]], Arista was ill-served by the political division among his staff.\n\nAfter Resaca de la Palma, Mexico's government recalled Arista, and he was removed from command. He requested a [[court-martial]] and was absolved of guilt for the defeats at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/far04 |title=Arista, Mariano |author=David D.

He sought to bring fiscal stability to the nation. Conservative resistance to Arista's rule and an eventual revolt by the conservatives led to his 1853 resignation and exile.\n\nHe died on board the English steamer ''Tagus'' while traveling from [[Lisbon|Lisbon, Portugal]], to France on 7 August 1855.
