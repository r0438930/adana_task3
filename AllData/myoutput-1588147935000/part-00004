The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa. One of these include the [[History of the Jews in Kairouan|Kairuan yeshiva]] in Spain (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e7\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05df) that was established by Chushiel Ben Elchanan (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05dc\u05d7\u05e0\u05df) in 974.<ref>\u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05d3 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e6\u05dc\u05d0\u05dc \u05e1. \u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, '''\u05e2\u05dd \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc - \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea 4000 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 - \u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5'''</ref>\n\nTraditionally, every town [[rabbi]] had the right to maintain a number of full-time or part-time pupils in the town's [[beth midrash]] (study hall), which was usually adjacent to the synagogue. Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a \"yeshiva\".\n\n====Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas====\n[[File:The old Beis Madrash Building of BMG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey -  largest yeshiva outside Israel.<ref name=LargestYeshivaOutsideIsrael>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/04/lakewood-yeshiva-looks-to-use-old-golf-course-for-new-campus.html|title=Lakewood yeshiva looks to use old golf course for new campus|author=Steve Strunsky|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|date=April 16, 2019|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=Beth Medrash Gohova is said to be the world\u2019s largest Jewish-affiliated university outside of Israel.}}</ref><ref name=LargestYeshivaNorthAmerica>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/ocean/2017/08/11_ways_lakewood_is_like_nowhere_else_in_nj.html|title=10 ways Lakewood is unlike anywhere else in N.J.|author=Stephen Stirling|publisher=NJ Advance Media|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=The sea change can be pinned to one event: The founding of the Beth Medrash Govoha yeshiva in the mid-20th century.

After (and during) World War II, numerous other Haredi and Hasidic Yeshivot were re-established there by survivors. The Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem - today the largest Yeshiva in the world - was established in 1944, by Rabbi [[Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (Poland and Jerusalem)|Eliezer Yehuda Finkel]] who had traveled to Palestine to obtain visas for his students. Porat Yosef, the leading Sephardi Yeshiva, was founded in 1914; its  predecessor, Yeshivat Ohel Moed was founded in 1904. From the 1940s and onward, especially following  immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities,  Sephardi leaders, such as [[Ovadia Yosef]] and [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]], established various yeshivot to facilitate Torah education for Sephardi and [[Mizrahi Jews]] (and alternative to Lithuanian yeshivot).\n\nThe Haredi community has grown with time - In 2016, 9% of Israel's population was Haredi, including [[Sephardic Haredim]] -  supporting a large number of yeshivot correspondingly (see [[Israel #Religion]]). Boys and girls here attend separate schools, and proceed to higher Torah study, in a yeshiva or seminary, respectively, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18; see ''[[Chinuch Atzmai]]'' and ''[[Bais Yaakov]]''. A significant proportion of young men then remain in yeshiva until their marriage; thereafter many continue their Torah studies in a kollel. (In 2006, there were 80,000 in full-time learning .<ref name =\"JVL\"/>) Kollel studies usually focus on deep analysis of Talmud, and those Tractates not usually covered in the standard \"undergraduate\" program; see [[#Talmud study]] below. Some Kollels similarly focus on Halacha in total, others specifically on those topics required for ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) or  [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|''Dayanut'']] (qualification as a Rabbinic Judge). The certification in question is often conferred by the Rosh Yeshiva.\n\n[[Mercaz Harav]], the foundational and leading [[Religious Zionism|Religious-Zionist]] yeshiva was established in 1924 by Ashkenazi [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. Many in the Religious Zionist community today attend a [[Hesder]] yeshiva (discussed [[#Types of yeshivot|below]]) during [[Religious_Zionism#Military_service|their national service]]; these offer a kollel for Rabbinical students. (Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].)\nWomen correspondingly study in a [[Midrasha]]. \nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''.\n[[Bar Ilan University]] allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly, which also offers a Haredi track;\nthere are [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'' (these often offer specializations in ''Tanakh'' and ''Machshavah'' - see [[Yeshiva#Curriculum|below]]).\nTraining as a ''Dayan'' in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\nSee [[Religious Zionism #Educational institutions]].\n\n=====United States=====\n:''See: [[:Category:Orthodox yeshivas in the United States]].''\nThe first Orthodox yeshiva in the United States was [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva (Manhattan)|Etz Chaim]] of [[New York City|New York]] (1886), modeled after Volozhin. It developed into the [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (1896; \"RIETS\") and eventually [[Yeshiva University]] in 1945. It was established in the wake of [[History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States#Immigration_of_Central_and_Eastern_European_Jews|the immigration of Central and Eastern European Jews]] (1880's - 1924). \n[[Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem]], founded in 1907, was led by Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] from the 1940s;\n[[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], est 1904, was headed by Rabbi [[Yitzchok Hutner]] from 1943 to 1980.\n[[:Category:Hasidic Judaism in the United States|Many Hasidic dynasties]] have their main Yeshivot in America, typically established in the 1940s; [[770_Eastern_Parkway#Central_Lubavitcher_Yeshiva| the Central Lubavitcher Yeshiva]] now has over 1000 students.\n\nThe postwar establishment of Ashkenazi yeshivot parallels that in Israel; \nas does the educational pattern in [[Haredi_Judaism#United_States|the American Haredi community]], although more obtain a secular education at the college level;\nsee [[#College credit]] above.\n[[Beth Medrash Govoha]] in [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[New Jersey]]  with 3,000 students in the early 2000s was founded in 1943 by R.

On Thursday nights, there may be an extra long night seder, known as ''mishmar'' sometimes lasting beyond 1:00 am, and in some yeshivot even until the following sunrise. On Fridays, there is usually at least one ''seder'' in the morning, with unstructured learning schedules for the afternoon. Saturdays have a special [[Shabbat]] schedule which includes some ''sedarim'' but usually no shiur.\n|}\n[[File:Yeshiva lunchroom.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Mincha]]'',  [[Yeshiva Centre, Melbourne]] ]]\nYeshiva study is differentiated from, for example university study, as regards several structural features - curriculum aside.\nThe year is structured into \"''zmanim''\"; the day is structured into \"''seders''\".\nThe learning itself is delivered through a \"''shiur''\", a lecture with pre-specified sources, or \"''marei mekomot''\";\n<ref name=\"MaareiMekomot_1\">[https://vhalacha.com/wp-content/uploads/MaareiMekomot/maseshabbos.pdf Example ''marei mekomot'' - Halacha] </ref> \n<ref name=\"MaareiMekomot_2\">[http://dafyomireview2.com/ravkaplan/cdd/talmud/5772-Gittin/001-2012_04_24-RavKaplan-gittin-daf2a.gif Example ''marei mekomot'' - Gemara]</ref>\nstudy in general, and particularly the preparation for ''shiur'', takes place in \"''chavruta''\" or paired-study.\nThis study is in a common venue called the ''[[beth midrash|bet midrash]]''.\n\nThe institution is headed by its ''[[Rosh Yeshiva]]'', while other senior Rabbis are referred to as \"Ram\" (''[[Rosh mesivta|Rosh Mesivta]], Reish Metivta''); \nthe [[Mashgiach ruchani|''Mashgiach'']] assumes responsibility for students' spiritual development (''[[Mashpia]]'', in Hasidic Yeshivot).\nA Kollel is headed by its ''[[Rosh Kollel]]'', even when it is part of a Yeshiva.\nA ''sho'el umeishiv'' (lit. \"ask and he answers\") is usually available to consult to students on difficult points in their day's Talmudic studies.\nThe Rabbi responsible for the (Talmud) ''shiur'' is known as a ''[[Maggid Shiur]]''. Students are known as ''talmidim''.\n\n===Academic year===\n{{see also|Bein Hazmanim}}\nIn most yeshivot, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called ''zmanim'' (lit. times; sing. ''zman''). ''Elul zman'' starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]] and extends until the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. Winter ''zman'' starts after [[Sukkot]] and lasts until about two weeks before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]). Summer ''zman'' starts after Passover and lasts until [[Rosh Chodesh]] Av or [[Tisha B'Av]], a duration of about three months.\n\n===Chavruta-style learning===\n{{main|Chavruta}}\nYeshiva students prepare for and review the [[Shiur (Torah)|''shiur'']] (lecture) with their ''chavruta'' during a study session known as a ''seder''.<ref name=\"Forta\"/> In contrast to conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student repeats the information back in tests, ''chavruta''-style learning challenges the student to analyze and explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights of the meaning of the text.<ref name=\"agora\"/><ref name=\"jeff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rebjeff.com/1/category/singing/1.html |title=Bringing the People Together |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |publisher=Reb Jeff}}</ref> A ''chavruta'' helps a student keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, organize his thoughts into logical arguments, and understand another person's viewpoint.<ref name=\"zobin\">{{cite book |pages=104&ndash;106 |title=Breakthrough to Learning Gemora: A Concise, Analytical Guide |last=Zobin |first=Zvi |year=1996 |publisher=Kest-Lebovits}}</ref>\nThe shiur-based system was  [[Telshe_Yeshiva#Rabbi_Eliezer_Gordon|innovated at the Telshe yeshiva]], where there were five levels.\n\nChavruta-style learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other, and then analyze, question, debate, and even argue their points of view to arrive at an understanding of the text.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\n\nPost-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"'' in Israel {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, and not \"yeshiva.\" (Although there are exceptions such as Prospect Park Yeshiva.)\nThe [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. These institutions provide girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skews more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. \nThe curriculum  at Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox ''midrashot'', however, often includes some study of Talmud: often Mishnah, sometimes ''Gemara''; in further distinction, curricula generally entail Chavruta-based study of the ''texts'' of Jewish philosophy, and likewise ''Tanakh'' is studied with commentaries.\nSee [[Midrasha #Structure]] for further discussion.\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in [[Jerusalem]] and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\n[[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], Modern Orthodox, [[Zionism|Zionist]], and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis. This concession is facilitated by arrangements for the student to receive credit towards a college degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.YeshivaDegree.com |title=Guide To Degree Completion Programs for Yeshiva Students |year=2011 |publisher=YeshivaDegree.com |accessdate=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402100219/http://www.yeshivadegree.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n[[Yeshiva University]] in New York provides a year's worth of credit for yeshiva studies.\n\nHaredi institutions with similar arrangements in place include [[Lander College for Men]], [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] and [[Hebrew Theological College]].\nFor historical context see: [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]], [[Volozhin yeshiva #History]], [[Yitzchok Hutner #Rabbinic and teaching career]] and [[Mesivta #Modern-day concept]].\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[Torah study]] at an Orthodox yeshiva comprises the study of [[rabbinic literature]], principally the Talmud, along with the study of ''[[Halacha]]'' (Jewish law); \n[[Musar literature|Musar]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]] are often studied also.\n<ref name=\"Actually\">{{cite news |last=Krakowski|first=Moshe |date=26 December 2018 |title=What Yeshiva Kids Are Actually Studying All Day |url=https://forward.com/life/faith/416616/what-yeshiva-kids-are-actually-studying-all-day/ |work=Forward |location= |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> \nIn some institutions, classical [[Jewish philosophy]] or Kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]). \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-Orthodox institutions]] offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.). [https://jsli.net/apply-online/ordination-weekends/ \"Ordination and Semicha\"], jsli.net</ref> \n(These institutions' focus is also on \"the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work\". <ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ordination-semihah/2/ Ordination (Semicha)], myjewishlearning.com</ref>)\n[[Rabbi#Conservative_Judaism|Conservative programs]] occupy a position midway.<ref name=\"Blane\"/>\n\n===Talmud study===\n:''See also: [[Talmud #Commentaries]]; [[Gemara]]; [[Mishnah]]''\nIn the typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study and analysis, or  ''[[Gemara]]''. Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators;<ref name=\"MaareiMekomot_2\"/> \nthe second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels, in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot, the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus \n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nis in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], sometimes  [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"MaareiMekomot_1\"/>\nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n*''[[Tomer Devorah]]'' by [[Moses Cordovero]].\nAs above, these sessions focus the student on self-understanding and introspection, internalizing the spiritual aims of Judaism, and developing the character-traits, or ''middos'', appropriately.\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). \nHesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy (as well as to ''[[Torat Eretz Yisrael]]'' generally). \nThe Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Jewish educational institution for Torah study}}\n{{About| the Jewish educational system|the private university|Yeshiva University| the website|Yeshiva.co}}\n{{original research|date=April 2019}}\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|religion}} \n[[File:Mirs 14.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Mir Yeshiva (Jerusalem)]] - largest yeshiva in the world]]\n[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical [[beth midrash|''bet midrash'']] - [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]], [[Baltimore]]]]\n[[File:Carteret beis medrash.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chavrusas in study - [[Yeshiva Gedola of Carteret]]]]\n[[File:OrYisrael8885.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Morning ''seder'', [[Petah_Tikva#Schools_and_religious_institutions|Or-Yisrael]] (a yeshiva founded by the [[Chazon Ish]])]]\n[[File:RoyLindmanRabbinicalSchoolJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'', [[Jerusalem]]]]\n[[File:Rav_Kav_giving_Shiur_Klali_in_Yeshivas_Kerem_B'Yavne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Shiur klali'', [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]]]]\nA '''yeshiva''' ({{IPAc-en|j|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0283|i\u02d0|v|\u0259}}; {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4||sitting}}; pl. {{rtl-lang|he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea}}, {{transl|he|yeshivot}} or {{transl|he|yeshivos}}) is a [[Jewish education|Jewish]] [[educational institution]] that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Torah]], and [[Halacha]] (Jewish law).

The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a \"yeshiva\".\n\n====Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas====\n[[File:The old Beis Madrash Building of BMG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey -  largest yeshiva outside Israel.<ref name=LargestYeshivaOutsideIsrael>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/04/lakewood-yeshiva-looks-to-use-old-golf-course-for-new-campus.html|title=Lakewood yeshiva looks to use old golf course for new campus|author=Steve Strunsky|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|date=April 16, 2019|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=Beth Medrash Gohova is said to be the world\u2019s largest Jewish-affiliated university outside of Israel.}}</ref><ref name=LargestYeshivaNorthAmerica>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/ocean/2017/08/11_ways_lakewood_is_like_nowhere_else_in_nj.html|title=10 ways Lakewood is unlike anywhere else in N.J.|author=Stephen Stirling|publisher=NJ Advance Media|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=The sea change can be pinned to one event: The founding of the Beth Medrash Govoha yeshiva in the mid-20th century.

[[Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva |Shaar Hashamayim]] was established in 1906, [[Hebron Yeshiva]] in 1924. After (and during) World War II, numerous other Haredi and Hasidic Yeshivot were re-established there by survivors. The Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem - today the largest Yeshiva in the world - was established in 1944, by Rabbi [[Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (Poland and Jerusalem)|Eliezer Yehuda Finkel]] who had traveled to Palestine to obtain visas for his students. Porat Yosef, the leading Sephardi Yeshiva, was founded in 1914; its  predecessor, Yeshivat Ohel Moed was founded in 1904. From the 1940s and onward, especially following  immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities,  Sephardi leaders, such as [[Ovadia Yosef]] and [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]], established various yeshivot to facilitate Torah education for Sephardi and [[Mizrahi Jews]] (and alternative to Lithuanian yeshivot).\n\nThe Haredi community has grown with time - In 2016, 9% of Israel's population was Haredi, including [[Sephardic Haredim]] -  supporting a large number of yeshivot correspondingly (see [[Israel #Religion]]). Boys and girls here attend separate schools, and proceed to higher Torah study, in a yeshiva or seminary, respectively, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18; see ''[[Chinuch Atzmai]]'' and ''[[Bais Yaakov]]''. A significant proportion of young men then remain in yeshiva until their marriage; thereafter many continue their Torah studies in a kollel. (In 2006, there were 80,000 in full-time learning .<ref name =\"JVL\"/>) Kollel studies usually focus on deep analysis of Talmud, and those Tractates not usually covered in the standard \"undergraduate\" program; see [[#Talmud study]] below. Some Kollels similarly focus on Halacha in total, others specifically on those topics required for ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) or  [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|''Dayanut'']] (qualification as a Rabbinic Judge). The certification in question is often conferred by the Rosh Yeshiva.\n\n[[Mercaz Harav]], the foundational and leading [[Religious Zionism|Religious-Zionist]] yeshiva was established in 1924 by Ashkenazi [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. Many in the Religious Zionist community today attend a [[Hesder]] yeshiva (discussed [[#Types of yeshivot|below]]) during [[Religious_Zionism#Military_service|their national service]]; these offer a kollel for Rabbinical students. (Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].)\nWomen correspondingly study in a [[Midrasha]]. \nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''.\n[[Bar Ilan University]] allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly, which also offers a Haredi track;\nthere are [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'' (these often offer specializations in ''Tanakh'' and ''Machshavah'' - see [[Yeshiva#Curriculum|below]]).\nTraining as a ''Dayan'' in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\nSee [[Religious Zionism #Educational institutions]].\n\n=====United States=====\n:''See: [[:Category:Orthodox yeshivas in the United States]].''\nThe first Orthodox yeshiva in the United States was [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva (Manhattan)|Etz Chaim]] of [[New York City|New York]] (1886), modeled after Volozhin.

The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. Winter ''zman'' starts after [[Sukkot]] and lasts until about two weeks before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]).

Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe.

These institutions provide girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skews more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. \nThe curriculum  at Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox ''midrashot'', however, often includes some study of Talmud: often Mishnah, sometimes ''Gemara''; in further distinction, curricula generally entail Chavruta-based study of the ''texts'' of Jewish philosophy, and likewise ''Tanakh'' is studied with commentaries.\nSee [[Midrasha #Structure]] for further discussion.\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in [[Jerusalem]] and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\n[[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], Modern Orthodox, [[Zionism|Zionist]], and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis. This concession is facilitated by arrangements for the student to receive credit towards a college degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.YeshivaDegree.com |title=Guide To Degree Completion Programs for Yeshiva Students |year=2011 |publisher=YeshivaDegree.com |accessdate=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402100219/http://www.yeshivadegree.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n[[Yeshiva University]] in New York provides a year's worth of credit for yeshiva studies.\n\nHaredi institutions with similar arrangements in place include [[Lander College for Men]], [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] and [[Hebrew Theological College]].\nFor historical context see: [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]], [[Volozhin yeshiva #History]], [[Yitzchok Hutner #Rabbinic and teaching career]] and [[Mesivta #Modern-day concept]].\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[Torah study]] at an Orthodox yeshiva comprises the study of [[rabbinic literature]], principally the Talmud, along with the study of ''[[Halacha]]'' (Jewish law); \n[[Musar literature|Musar]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]] are often studied also.\n<ref name=\"Actually\">{{cite news |last=Krakowski|first=Moshe |date=26 December 2018 |title=What Yeshiva Kids Are Actually Studying All Day |url=https://forward.com/life/faith/416616/what-yeshiva-kids-are-actually-studying-all-day/ |work=Forward |location= |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> \nIn some institutions, classical [[Jewish philosophy]] or Kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]). \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-Orthodox institutions]] offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.). [https://jsli.net/apply-online/ordination-weekends/ \"Ordination and Semicha\"], jsli.net</ref> \n(These institutions' focus is also on \"the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work\". <ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ordination-semihah/2/ Ordination (Semicha)], myjewishlearning.com</ref>)\n[[Rabbi#Conservative_Judaism|Conservative programs]] occupy a position midway.<ref name=\"Blane\"/>\n\n===Talmud study===\n:''See also: [[Talmud #Commentaries]]; [[Gemara]]; [[Mishnah]]''\nIn the typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study and analysis, or  ''[[Gemara]]''. Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels, in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot, the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus \n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nis in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], sometimes  [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"MaareiMekomot_1\"/>\nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n*''[[Tomer Devorah]]'' by [[Moses Cordovero]].\nAs above, these sessions focus the student on self-understanding and introspection, internalizing the spiritual aims of Judaism.\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). \nHesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy (as well as to ''[[Torat Eretz Yisrael]]'' generally). \nThe Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCurriculum", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva"}
