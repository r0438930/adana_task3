The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', and the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>).

The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', and the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.
