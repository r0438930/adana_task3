The fighting occurred during a limited UN offensive by US [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]], codenamed [[Operation Commando (1951)|Operation Commando]]. This offensive ultimately pushed the PVA back from the [[Imjin River]] to the [[Jamestown Line]] and destroyed elements of four PVA [[Field army|armies]] following heavy fighting.{{refn|In Chinese military nomenclature, the term \"Army\" (\u519b) means [[Corps]], while the term \"Army Group\" (\u96c6\u56e2\u519b) means [[Field Army]].|group=Note}} The much smaller battle at Maryang San took place over a five-day period, and saw the [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (3 RAR) dislodge a numerically superior PVA force from the tactically important [[:ko:\uace0\uc655\uc0b0|Kowang san]] (Hill 355) and [[:ko:\ub9c8\ub7c9\uc0b0|Maryang san]] (Hill 317) features, in conjunction with other units of the [[1st Commonwealth Division]].\n\nUsing tactics first developed against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] during the [[Second World War]], the Australians gained the advantage of the high ground and assaulted the PVA positions from unexpected directions. They then repelled repeated PVA [[counterattack]]s aimed at re-capturing Maryang San, with both sides suffering heavy casualties before the Australians were finally relieved by a British battalion. However, with the [[Korean Armistice Agreement#Armistice discussions|peace-talks]] ongoing, these operations proved to be the last actions in the war of manoeuvre, which had lasted the previous sixteen months. It was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences reminiscent of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1915\u201317. A month later, the PVA [[Second Battle of Maryang-san|re-captured Maryang San during fierce fighting]], and it was never re-gained. Today, the battle is widely regarded as one of the [[Australian Army]]'s greatest accomplishments during the war.\n\n==Background==\n===Military situation===\n{{main|Military history of Australia during the Korean War}}\nFollowing [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s dismissal as Commander-in-Chief of UN forces in Korea, he was replaced by [[General (United States)|General]] [[Matthew Ridgway|Matthew B. Ridgway]]. Consequently, on 14 April 1951, [[General]] [[James Van Fleet]] replaced Ridgway as commander of the US [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]] and the UN ground forces in Korea.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=132}} The [[Chinese Spring Offensive]] during April and May 1951 ended in its defeat, while the [[UN May\u2013June 1951 counteroffensive]] erased all PVA gains. In July the ''Kansas'' and ''Wyoming Lines'' were strengthened, while a limited offensive in the east-central sector in mid-August seized the high ground around the [[Battle of the Punchbowl|''Punchbowl'']] and [[Battle of Bloody Ridge|''Bloody Ridge'']]. In September the offensive in this sector continued, targeting the next hill complex north of ''Bloody Ridge'', known as [[Battle of Heartbreak Ridge|''Heartbreak Ridge'']].{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=165}}\n\nMeanwhile, the organisation of British Commonwealth ground forces fighting in Korea as part of the UN Command had undergone considerable change in the months following the battles of the [[Battle of the Imjin River|Imjin River]] and [[Battle of Kapyong|Kapyong]] in late-April 1951. 3 RAR had been transferred from [[27th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|27th British Infantry Brigade]] to the [[28th British Commonwealth Brigade]] when that formation departed for [[Hong Kong]]. Meanwhile, after protracted negotiations between the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution, as well as facilitating the solution of the logistic and operational problems faced by the various Commonwealth contingents.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=166}}\n\nThe [[1st Commonwealth Division]] was formed on 28 July 1951, with the division including the [[25th Canadian Infantry Brigade|25th Canadian]], 28th British Commonwealth and [[29th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th British]] infantry brigades under the command of [[Major General]] [[James Cassels (British Army officer)|James Cassels]], and was part of US [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]].{{sfn|Grey|1988|pp=192\u2013195}} Since its formation, the division had occupied part of the west-central sector of the UN line, approximately {{convert|48|km|mi}} north of the capital [[Seoul]].{{sfn|Grey|1988|p=135}} The 28th Brigade included three infantry battalions\u2014the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers]] (1 KOSB), [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry|1st Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] (1 KSLI) and the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\u2014under the command of [[Brigadier]] [[George Taylor (soldier)|George Taylor]].{{sfn|Grey|1988|pp=192\u2013195}} During this period 3 RAR was commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel (Australia)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Francis Hassett]].{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=266}} Peace-talks at [[Kaesong]] during July and September led to a lull in the fighting and 3 RAR undertook mainly defensive duties, helping to construct the defences of the ''Kansas Line'' south of the [[Imjin River]], as well as conducting extensive patrolling on the northern side.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=238}} The battalion also used the reduced operational tempo as an opportunity to train reinforcements. The period culminated in a limited, and largely unopposed, divisional advance {{convert|12|km|mi}} north of the Imjin to the ''Wyoming Line'', codenamed [[Operation Minden]], in September.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=238}}{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=72}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===Opposing forces===\n{{Main|Operation Commando (1951)}}\n[[File:British Centurion tank Korea May 1953 (AWM HOBJ4255).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A British [[Centurion tank]] similar to those used at Maryang San|alt=A main battle tank in a hull down position, its turret traversed to aft. In the foreground is a soldier kneeling.]]\nIn late-September and early-October\u2014even while continuing the attack against ''Heartbreak Ridge'', Van Fleet developed a plan for a limited offensive in the western section, known as Operation Commando, to advance {{convert|10|km|mi}} north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]], with the aim of pushing PVA forces back and giving United Nations forces more leverage at the truce negotiations now occurring at [[Panmunjom]].{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=165}} Operation Commando was scheduled for 3\u20135 October 1951 and the US I Corps commander, [[Lieutenant General]] [[John W. O'Daniel]], envisioned a concept of operations in which three of the Corps' four [[Division (military)|divisions]] would advance on a broad front in conjunction with US [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] on the left flank of the neighbouring US [[IX Corps (United States)|IX Corps]], seizing a new defensive line known as the [[Jamestown Line]].{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=72}} The divisions to be used in the advance included the 1st Commonwealth Division, US [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] and the [[Republic of Korea Army]] (ROK) [[9th Infantry Division (South Korea)|9th Division]]. The ROK [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Division]] would remain in its existing position on the left flank.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=181}}\n\nIn the sector occupied by 1st Commonwealth Division, PVA forces were dug into a group of hills overlooking the Imjin River.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=166}} The division faced 6,000 troops from the PVA [[191st Motorized Infantry Brigade (People's Republic of China)|191st Division]], [[64th Group Army|64th Army]] under the overall command of Xie Zhengrong.{{sfn|Hu|Ma|1987|p=89}}{{sfn|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=120}}{{refn|The Chinese military did not have [[military rank|ranks]] during the 1950s, except for the title of \"Commander\" or \"Commissar\". Xie was the commander of the Chinese 191st Division.|group=Note}} The PVA forces were divided into three [[regiment]]s of about 2,000 men each, with two regiments dug-in in well prepared defensive positions with overhead protection, and a third regiment in support. The 28th Brigade faced one of the two forward regiments\u2014the 571st Regiment\u2014which was deployed with one battalion on Hill 355, a second battalion astride Hill 217 and Hill 317, and a third battalion in reserve to the west.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=184}}\n\nThe task allocated to the British Commonwealth force was to take these positions with the intention of advancing the line from the southern bank of the Imjin to a line of hills to the north, in total an objective that stretched more than {{convert|15|km|mi}}.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=166}} The primary objectives of the advance would be the capture of [[:ko:\uace0\uc655\uc0b0|Kowang San]] (Hill 355) and Maryang San (Hill 317) and the task of taking these positions was allocated to the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, with this formation bearing the brunt of the fighting.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=266}}{{refn|Kowang-San (Hill 355) was also known as ''Little Gibraltar'' to the Americans, British and Australians and is often referred to as such in histories of the battle.|group=Note}} Cassels planned on capturing the Jamestown Line in three phases. In the first phase, scheduled for 3 October, the 28th Brigade would take Hill 355 in the east-central sector. During the second phase, on 4 October, the 25th Brigade would assault the two Hill 187 features and the south-western ridge running to the [[Samichon]] (Sami River). Lastly during the third phase, scheduled for 5 October, the 28th Brigade would capture Hills 217 and 317.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|pp=183\u2013184}} As such, the bulk of the division's strength would be concentrated on the right flank, to be held by the 28th Brigade; meanwhile, the 25th Brigade would hold the left flank and the 29th Brigade would be held in reserve while providing a [[battalion]] to each of the other [[brigade]]s as reinforcements.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=183}}\n\nKowang-San would be assaulted during the first phase by 1 KOSB with 1 KSLI and 3 RAR in support, while Maryang San would be taken in the third phase of the operation by 3 RAR and the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers|1st Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] (1 RNF), which was detached from the 29th Brigade to the 28th Brigade for the duration of Operation Commando.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=72}} Careful reconnaissance and planning took place in the week prior to the commencement of the operation and Taylor emphasised the use of indirect fires, air support and infiltration tactics to limit casualties, as well as the exploitation of weak points in the PVA defences.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=184}}{{sfn|Malkasian|2002|p=151}} In direct support of the brigade was [[16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery]] with its {{convert|3.45|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25-pounder]] [[field gun]]s, in addition to divisional and corps assets which included {{convert|4.2|in|mm|adj=on}} mortars, {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} howitzers and {{convert|155|mm|in|adj=on}} heavy artillery; in total more than 120 guns and mortars.

Two previous attempts to take Maryang San by American troops had been unsuccessful.<ref name=awm /> Regardless, utilising tactics first developed against the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War of running along the tops of ridges, he intended to gain the advantage of the high ground, while utilising the cover afforded by the vegetation and the ease of movement along the crest-lines, in order to assault the PVA positions from unexpected directions.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=184}} Meanwhile, the PVA defenders on Maryang San were also testing a newly developed tactic called the \"mobile positional defense\", in which only small units were stationed on the hills in order to exhaust the UN attackers, while the bulk of the PVA defenders would later counterattack before the UN forces could consolidate into their newly gained positions.{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=161}}\n\nHowever, during the first phase of the operation the Australians would be tasked with capturing a PVA outpost on Hill 199 to allow tanks and medium machine-guns to provide direct fires onto the northern and eastern slopes of Hill 355 in support of an attack by the Borderers from the south-east. Likewise, the Shropshires would assault and capture Hill 208. Finally then, two days before the start of Operation Commando, the 28th Brigade crossed the Imjin river to assemble behind the 25th Brigade on 1 October. The following day the 3 RAR, less D Company, and the Borderers moved forward carefully into their assembly areas, ready to advance the following morning.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=185}} C Company advanced to a position {{convert|1500|m|yd}} in front of the Canadian positions, north-east of Hill 355. B Company was {{convert|200|m|yd}} to the rear. In the afternoon C Company was subjected to heavy shelling, losing one soldier wounded.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}} D Company\u2014under the command of Major Basil Hardiman\u2014was detached to 25th Brigade to strengthen its extended front, and it would not be available until the afternoon of 3 October. {{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=185}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Capture of Hill 199, 3 October 1951===\n[[File:Battle of Maryang San 2-8 October 1951.png|thumb|right|281px|alt=Map of the movements of 3 RAR during the battle as described in the text|The First Battle of Maryang San, 2\u20138 October 1951.]]\nAt 03:00 on 3 October, B Company 3 RAR moved north {{convert|2000|m|yd}} toward Hill 199, crossing the open valley under the cover of darkness and heavy mist. A Company then moved up behind C Company.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}} Artillery and mortar fire targeted known PVA artillery positions with [[counter-battery fire]] prior to dawn, before switching to support the Borderers in their assault on Hill 355. Simultaneously, the Shropshires were assaulting Hill 208 and with the support of A Squadron, 8th Royal Irish Hussars they reached the positions without opposition by 06:00.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=21}}{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}} By 08:00 B Company had gained the high ground to the north and then proceeded to patrol the short distance to west to the objective which was then taken with three wounded; five PVA were killed and one captured.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=21}} By mid-morning, both the Shropshires and the Australians had successfully captured their objectives.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=23}}\n\nExpecting a counter-attack, the Australians on Hill 199 began digging-in, however no such attack occurred. D Company subsequently returned and was allocated a position between C Company and the Borderers. C and B Companies both received shelling during the day, wounding two men.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=21}} At 10:00 A Company\u2014under Captain Jim Shelton\u2014took over the defence of Hill 199, and B Company went into reserve behind A Company.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}} According to plan a troop of Centurion tanks and a [[section (military unit)|section]] of medium machine-guns were then moved up onto Hill 199 and began directing their fire onto the northern slopes of Hill 355 in support of the Borderers.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}} Meanwhile, at 07:15, following preparation by artillery and mortar fire, the lead British assault companies had begun to advance on Hill 355. However, with the PVA expecting an assault from that direction, the initial British moves met strong resistance and the Borderers were forced to withdraw and reorganise. At 14:15 a second assault reached the objectives on the lower slopes, and these gains were consolidated by nightfall.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=23}}\n\nThe attack was now behind schedule. Indeed, the Borderers were still more than {{convert|1000|yd|m}} short of their final objective, and with stubborn resistance being encountered during the initial phase, Hill 355 would now not be secured until the afternoon of 4 October.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=267}} The assault was being slowed by two positions on the northeast slopes of Hill 355\u2014known as Hill 220\u2014from which the PVA held the British right flank in [[enfilade]]. C Company 3 RAR would be detached to assist the attack on Kowang-San the next morning, with the Australians tasked with outflanking the PVA defences and capturing this position.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=23}}{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Heavy PVA artillery fire had also slowed progress with more than 2,500 rounds falling in the 28th Brigade area in the previous twenty-four hours, although this total was dwarfed many times over by the weight of allied artillery fired across the brigade front, which included 22,324 rounds.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}} On the division's left flank, the delay also meant that the Canadian attack scheduled for 06:00 the next day in the 25th Brigade sector would have to be postponed until 11:00, due to the continuing requirement to use the divisional artillery in support of 28th Brigade.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}}\n\n===Capture of Hill 220 and the fall of Kowang-San, 4 October 1951===\nOn 4 October, C Company 3 RAR\u2014under the command of [[Major]] [[Jack Gerke]]\u2014attacked the long spur running east from the peak of Hill 355, known as Hill 220. Launching their assault at 09:00, the Australians quickly killed or drove off the defenders before pressing on up the spur and routing the remainder of a PVA [[company (military)|company]]. Reaching their objectives by 10:00, the Australians then took advantage of the initiative gained so far, pushing a platoon towards the summit of Hill 355. Amid heavy fighting, the Australians cleared the eastern slopes of Kowang-San by 12:00, despite having received no orders to do so.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}} Thirteen PVA were killed and three captured in the fighting, while Australian casualties included 11 wounded, one of whom subsequently died.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Gerke was later awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for his leadership.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=114}} C Company withdrew to the rear of the 3 RAR position and were replaced by D Company, who occupied the position held by A Company {{convert|500|m|yd}} north of Hill 199.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Meanwhile, led by a [[bagpipes|bagpiper]], the Borderers made a simultaneous assault up the western face of Kowang-San, and fearing they may be caught between two attacks the PVA defenders abandoned Hill 355, withdrawing northwest under heavy indirect fire.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}}\n\nGiven the strong resistance exhibited by the PVA, the Canadians expected a tough fight as 25th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives as part of the second phase of the divisional plan. Yet with the loss of Hill 355 and 210 the PVA unexpectedly withdrew from their well-prepared defensive positions, with Hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition. Only the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry|2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] encountered any opposition before they captured the two Hill 187 features, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 PVA were also killed. Indeed, the ease with which the Canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on, attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy PVA artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. The Canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty-two months of fighting.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\nMeanwhile, on the 28th Brigade's left flank the Shropshires met slight resistance, securing Hill 210 southwest of Kowang-San by 10:10. They were then relieved by the Canadians by nightfall in preparation for the third phase of the operation.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|pp=165\u2013166}} The brigade plan was now a day behind schedule, although with the unexpected ease experienced by the Canadians, overall, the divisional attack was still running according to plan.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=34}} However, determined to hold on following the loss of Hill 355, the PVA moved in fresh troops, heavily reinforcing a number of positions, including Maryang San.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=37}}\n\n===Fall of Maryang San, 5 October 1951===\n[[File:F-51Ds 2 Sqn SAAF Korea May 1951.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|No. 2 Squadron SAAF [[P-51 Mustang|Mustang]] fighters during the [[Korean War]]|alt=Two piston engined fighter aircraft lined up ready for take-off on a runway.]]\nThe final objective was Maryang San, a steep hill rising {{convert|200|m|ft}} above the valley about {{convert|2500|m|yd}} north of Hill 355.<ref name=awm /> However, following the delay in capturing Hill 355, Hassett would not be ready to implement his plan until early the next day.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=267}} As such the third phase would begin on 5 October, with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers scheduled to attack an intermediate objective\u2014Hill 217, adjacent Kowang-San\u2014before assisting the Australians assault Hill 317.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} The Australians moved into position northeast of Hill 199 on the afternoon of 4 October, while over the night of 4/5 October the divisional artillery hit PVA positions, with two batteries of {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} howitzers and another two {{convert|155|mm|in|adj=on}} batteries supplementing them. [[Air strikes]] by the [[P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]] of [[2 Squadron SAAF|No. 2 Squadron, South African Air Force]] were also planned, targeting PVA concentrations north and west of the objectives to cut-off supplies and reinforcements.{{sfn|Breen|1994|pp=35\u201336}} Both the Australians and Fusiliers were scheduled to begin their attacks at first light\u2014at 05:45\u2014following a heavy artillery preparation.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=188}}\n\nIn the dark the Fusiliers moved off, but amid dense fog they found it difficult to maintain their bearings and were not in position in time to commence the attack as planned. By 10:00 they had struggled to within {{convert|300|m|yd}} from their objective, and following further delays the assault was commenced at 11:00. After initially achieving surprise a number of the forward PVA outposts fell to the Fusiliers. Occupying strong defensive positions on Hill 217, the PVA regained the initiative however, and poured heavy machine-gun and rifle fire onto the attackers as they crossed the valley, forcing them to withdraw after suffering heavy casualties and running low on ammunition.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=61}} Having expected the main axis of assault from the south, the PVA positions were stronger than previously considered and the Fusiliers were unable to gain the summit, despite one company gaining a toehold on the summit by midday.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=61}}{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}}\n\nEarlier that morning, at 04:45, B and D Companies 3 RAR had moved north across the valley, while Anti-Tank Platoon crossed the Imjin, taking up positions further north in order to protect the right flank. The assaulting companies would then move west towards a series of objectives before assaulting Hill 317.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Initially 3 RAR was to attack from the east, while 1 RNF would attack from the southwest through Hill 217, however with the Fusiliers facing stiff resistance on Hill 217 itself they were unable to get forward to assist.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} The previous attempts to capture Maryang San had failed due to the approach to steep eastern slopes of the feature being across a wide, open valley that was dominated by enfilade fire from mutually supporting PVA positions. Consequently, the Australians planned to cross the valley under cover of darkness and position themselves on the PVA flank in the foothills, before scaling the position at first light. A Company would create a diversion on the left flank, while B Company would clear the lower slopes before D Company passed through to assault the PVA main defensive position, known as the 'Victor' feature, in a one-up, one-in-depth assault.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=267}} However, following the casualties of previous nights on Hill 199, 220 and 355, and the effect of constant shelling, 3 RAR was now reduced to just 320 men. In contrast, the Australians faced two fresh PVA battalions on Maryang San, in total about 1,200 men. {{sfn|Breen|1994|p=37}}\n\n[[File:Chinese defend Maryang San.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese soldiers from the 64th Army defending Maryang San|alt=Five Asian soldiers firing weapons and throwing grenades from grass-covered a hilltop.

The Australian approach had surprised the PVA however, who were apparently expecting the assault from the north, and D Company succeeded in closing to within [[grenade]] range of the PVA on Victor. During a fierce twenty-minute fire-fight the Australians cleared their first objective with the assistance of direct fire from supporting tanks, and indirect fire support from artillery, losing three killed and 12 wounded.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=267}}{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Included among the Australian wounded was the company commander and one of the platoon commanders, both of whom remained in command despite gunshot wounds.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=44}} PVA losses included 30 killed and 10 captured.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=43}}\n\nDuring the initial phase A Company had attacked southwest along a spur leading to Hill 317 and had met stiff opposition.{{sfn|Horner|1990|pp=446\u2013447}} The diversion was largely successful however, causing the PVA to reinforce against the attack, which they believed to be the main effort.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=49}} Meanwhile, D Company continued to press their attack along the high ground towards the 'Uniform' feature, assaulting the deeply entrenched PVA positions, which included heavy automatic weapons. By 16:00 it had successfully captured the last of the intermediate objectives assigned to it and a platoon from B Company was pushed forward to assist in the clearance of the feature. Later, Lieutenant L.G. Clark was awarded the Military Cross while Sergeant W.J. Rowlinson was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for their actions during the fighting.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=192}} By this time total PVA casualties included 98 killed and 40 captured, while the Australians believed that a large number of PVA had also been wounded.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Following the progress of B and D Companies, C Company was moved up behind them and with the capture of final objective they immediately commenced an assault on Hill 317, capturing 10 prisoners for no loss.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=447}} Although the PVA had been well dug-in, there were no barbed wire obstacles to hamper the attackers and the Australians had rapidly gained the position.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=239}} By 17:00, Maryang San had fallen to the Australians, with the PVA withdrawing under heavy artillery, mortar and machine-gun fire.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=57}}\n\n[[File:Abandoned Chinese positions Korea Oct 1951 (AWM HOBJ2502).jpg|thumb|left|160px|Abandoned Chinese positions|alt=Abandoned earthworks on a tree covered slope.

Later, a platoon was detached to assist C Company consolidate the defence of Maryang San following its capture, while the remaining two platoons were withdrawn rearwards, again under heavy artillery fire.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=447}} Indeed, although it had played a supporting role in the attack, the efforts of A Company had been vital, suffering 20 casualties while killing at least 25 PVA and capturing two.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=58}} Now with Maryang San captured the Australians began digging-in, modifying the south-facing linear PVA trench system into an all-round defensive position with mutually supporting weapons pits.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=59}} Fully expecting a PVA counter-attack that evening, Hasset moved the Assault Pioneer Platoon to bolster the hasty defences.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=57}} Meanwhile, the PVA still occupied three key ridgeline positions\u2014the 'Sierra' feature, the 'Hinge' and the summit of Hill 317 itself\u2014which they continued to furiously defend. These would be the scene of considerable fighting in the days to come as the Australians attempted to clear them.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=73}}\n\n===The Hinge, 6\u20138 October 1951===\nWith both sides exhausted from the fighting the night of 5/6 October was less eventful than expected, and the Australians used the opportunity to develop their position.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=62}} To add further depth to their defences and to probe the PVA positions, Taylor ordered the Australians to capture the central remaining PVA position, the Sierra feature\u2014a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of Maryang San and the Hinge\u2014the next day.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=268}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=63}} Meanwhile, the Fusiliers would renew their attack on Hill 217.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}} The southern approach to Hill 217 had proved to be too strongly defended by the PVA and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome Taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders. To do this the high ground to the north-west of Maryang San, known as the Hinge, would be vital.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=65}} Indeed, adjacent to Hill 217, the Hinge dominated it from the north.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=268}} As such for the next assault, planned for the morning, the Fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the Hinge from the east, using the Australian positions on Maryang San as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on Hill 217.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=65}}\n\nAt 07:00 on 6 October, 9 Platoon C Company\u2014under the command of Lieutenant Arthur Pembroke\u2014moved forward to Sierra, using the heavy mist to conceal their movements.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=63}} Under-strength and not expecting the feature to be occupied, instead the Australians found a large number of PVA in well prepared defensive positions. Without fire support and outnumbered, the Australians immediately conducted a quick attack and, using grenades and [[bayonet]]s, they inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA before forcing the survivors to withdraw.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=64}} Although subjected to constant shelling, 9 Platoon continued to hold the knoll, repelling several counterattacks over the next 13 hours, cutting down each assault through the tree-line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine-gun fire, forcing the PVA to withdraw leaving their dead and wounded behind. One Australian was killed in the initial assault on Sierra, while a number were later wounded during the defence. PVA casualties included 19 killed, 30 wounded and seven captured. Pembroke was later awarded the [[Military Cross]].{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}}\n\n[[File:Australian machine gunners Maryang San Oct 1951 (AWM HOBJ2432).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Australian [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] machine-gunners firing in support of the assault by C Company 3 RAR on Hill 317.|alt=Soldiers firing a machine-gun towards a hillside in the distance.

Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by PVA small arms fire and grenades.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}} 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the PVA then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=66}} Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=65}} Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective.{{refn|1 RNF was overdue for rotation and many now felt they had done their share of the fighting. Indeed the battalion was the last of the original 29th Brigade battalions, with the other two already having been replaced by fresh battalions from Hong Kong and Great Britain.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=66}}|group=Note}} It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}} In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}}{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=268}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=67}}\n\nIn the early hours of 7 October the allied artillery and mortar bombardment began, targeting PVA positions on the Hinge.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=67}} Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure, allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=239}} Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 08:00. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth, using the trees and long grass for concealment. Initially it seemed that the PVA had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09:20 the Hinge finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. PVA casualties included more than 20 killed.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=268}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=67}} As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J. Park and Corporal E.F. Bosworth were awarded the [[Military Medal]].{{sfn|Breen|1994|pp=68\u201369}} Yet even as the surviving PVA withdrew, artillery and mortar fire began to fall on the Hinge. B Company moved quickly to consolidate the position, but were hampered by the shelling, while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=197}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=70}}\n\nFor the remainder of the day B Company was subjected to intense indirect fire on the Hinge, as was C Company on Hill 317. The Anti-Tank Platoon and Assault Pioneer Platoon reinforced C Company, with a platoon of C Company moved forward to the Hinge to support B Company.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=447}} At 20:00 both the Hinge and Hill 317 were again heavily shelled for 45 minutes, heralding the beginning of the inevitable PVA counterattack. Heavy mist concealed the PVA advance, and this assisted many to penetrate the Australian perimeter. Throughout the night of 7/8 October the Hinge was attacked on three occasions from both the front and the flanks by a force of battalion strength, however the Australians beat back the PVA in desperate hand-to-hand combat.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=447}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=82}} The PVA swept forward, but were stopped by intense small arms and artillery fire.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=198}} During one such assault Sergeant P.J. O'Connell, on seeing one of his platoon's [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] gunners wounded, manned the light machine-gun himself, breaking up a PVA assault, while controlling the fire of the men around him. Meanwhile, Sergeant R.W. Strong arranged the resupply of ammunition to the forward Australian sections.

The tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=199}}\n\nThe battle was also noted for the pioneering use of [[tunnel warfare]] by the PVA in the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=162}} During the fighting, a PVA company had defended their positions from a U-shaped tunnel capable of housing 100 men, which had served as both a bomb shelter and a base for counterattacks.{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=162}} The company leader later claimed that the tunnel enabled the defenders to inflict 700 UN casualties while suffering only 21 casualties in return.{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=162}} Impressed by the report, the PVA commander [[Peng Dehuai]], later ordered the construction of {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} deep tunnels along the entire front line, and it formed a formidable obstacle for UN forces to overcome during the stalemate period.{{sfn|Zhang|1995|pp=162\u2013164}}<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 2006|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-stale/stale.htm|title=Years of Stalemate July 1951\u2013 July 1953|page=20|publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n[[File:Australian casualties Operation Commando Oct 1951 (AWM HOBJ2443).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Australian casualties being evacuated during [[Operation Commando (1951)|Operation Commando]], October 1951|alt=Soldiers carrying a man on a stretcher.]]\nOperation Commando finally ended on 15 October with the US I Corps having successfully seized the Jamestown Line and destroying elements of the PVA [[42nd Army (People's Republic of China)|42nd]], 47th, 64th and 65th Armies.{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=99}} PVA losses were estimated at 21,000 casualties, while UN losses were 4,000\u2014the majority of them in the US 1st Cavalry Division which had borne the brunt of the fighting.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|pp=170\u2013171.}} Although a few hills south of the line remained in PVA/KPA hands\u2014requiring a follow-up operation known as [[Operation Polecharge]] which succeeded in capturing these positions by 19 October\u2014UN supply lines near Seoul were now free from PVA interdiction.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=170}}{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=101}} With the peace-talks ongoing, these operations proved to be last actions in the war of manoeuvre, which had lasted the previous sixteen months.

The fighting occurred during a limited UN offensive by US [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]], codenamed [[Operation Commando (1951)|Operation Commando]]. This offensive ultimately pushed the PVA back from the [[Imjin River]] to the [[Jamestown Line]] and destroyed elements of four PVA [[Field army|armies]] following heavy fighting.{{refn|In Chinese military nomenclature, the term \"Army\" (\u519b) means [[Corps]], while the term \"Army Group\" (\u96c6\u56e2\u519b) means [[Field Army]].|group=Note}} The much smaller battle at Maryang San took place over a five-day period, and saw the [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (3 RAR) dislodge a numerically superior PVA force from the tactically important [[:ko:\uace0\uc655\uc0b0|Kowang san]] (Hill 355) and [[:ko:\ub9c8\ub7c9\uc0b0|Maryang san]] (Hill 317) features, in conjunction with other units of the [[1st Commonwealth Division]].\n\nUsing tactics first developed against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] during the [[Second World War]], the Australians gained the advantage of the high ground and assaulted the PVA positions from unexpected directions. They then repelled repeated PVA [[counterattack]]s aimed at re-capturing Maryang San, with both sides suffering heavy casualties before the Australians were finally relieved by a British battalion. However, with the [[Korean Armistice Agreement#Armistice discussions|peace-talks]] ongoing, these operations proved to be the last actions in the war of manoeuvre, which had lasted the previous sixteen months. It was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences reminiscent of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1915\u201317. A month later, the PVA [[Second Battle of Maryang-san|re-captured Maryang San during fierce fighting]], and it was never re-gained. Today, the battle is widely regarded as one of the [[Australian Army]]'s greatest accomplishments during the war.\n\n==Background==\n===Military situation===\n{{main|Military history of Australia during the Korean War}}\nFollowing [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s dismissal as Commander-in-Chief of UN forces in Korea, he was replaced by [[General (United States)|General]] [[Matthew Ridgway|Matthew B. Ridgway]]. Consequently, on 14 April 1951, [[General]] [[James Van Fleet]] replaced Ridgway as commander of the US [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]] and the UN ground forces in Korea.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=132}} The [[Chinese Spring Offensive]] during April and May 1951 ended in its defeat, while the [[UN May\u2013June 1951 counteroffensive]] erased all PVA gains. In July the ''Kansas'' and ''Wyoming Lines'' were strengthened, while a limited offensive in the east-central sector in mid-August seized the high ground around the [[Battle of the Punchbowl|''Punchbowl'']] and [[Battle of Bloody Ridge|''Bloody Ridge'']]. In September the offensive in this sector continued, targeting the next hill complex north of ''Bloody Ridge'', known as [[Battle of Heartbreak Ridge|''Heartbreak Ridge'']].{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=165}}\n\nMeanwhile, the organisation of British Commonwealth ground forces fighting in Korea as part of the UN Command had undergone considerable change in the months following the battles of the [[Battle of the Imjin River|Imjin River]] and [[Battle of Kapyong|Kapyong]] in late-April 1951. 3 RAR had been transferred from [[27th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|27th British Infantry Brigade]] to the [[28th British Commonwealth Brigade]] when that formation departed for [[Hong Kong]]. Meanwhile, after protracted negotiations between the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution, as well as facilitating the solution of the logistic and operational problems faced by the various Commonwealth contingents.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=166}}\n\nThe [[1st Commonwealth Division]] was formed on 28 July 1951, with the division including the [[25th Canadian Infantry Brigade|25th Canadian]], 28th British Commonwealth and [[29th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th British]] infantry brigades under the command of [[Major General]] [[James Cassels (British Army officer)|James Cassels]], and was part of US [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]].{{sfn|Grey|1988|pp=192\u2013195}} Since its formation, the division had occupied part of the west-central sector of the UN line, approximately {{convert|48|km|mi}} north of the capital [[Seoul]].{{sfn|Grey|1988|p=135}} The 28th Brigade included three infantry battalions\u2014the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers]] (1 KOSB), [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry|1st Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] (1 KSLI) and the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\u2014under the command of [[Brigadier]] [[George Taylor (soldier)|George Taylor]].{{sfn|Grey|1988|pp=192\u2013195}} During this period 3 RAR was commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel (Australia)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Francis Hassett]].{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=266}} Peace-talks at [[Kaesong]] during July and September led to a lull in the fighting and 3 RAR undertook mainly defensive duties, helping to construct the defences of the ''Kansas Line'' south of the [[Imjin River]], as well as conducting extensive patrolling on the northern side.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=238}} The battalion also used the reduced operational tempo as an opportunity to train reinforcements. The period culminated in a limited, and largely unopposed, divisional advance {{convert|12|km|mi}} north of the Imjin to the ''Wyoming Line'', codenamed [[Operation Minden]], in September.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=238}}{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=72}}\n\n==Prelude==\n===Opposing forces===\n{{Main|Operation Commando (1951)}}\n[[File:British Centurion tank Korea May 1953 (AWM HOBJ4255).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A British [[Centurion tank]] similar to those used at Maryang San|alt=A main battle tank in a hull down position, its turret traversed to aft. In the foreground is a soldier kneeling.]]\nIn late-September and early-October\u2014even while continuing the attack against ''Heartbreak Ridge'', Van Fleet developed a plan for a limited offensive in the western section, known as Operation Commando, to advance {{convert|10|km|mi}} north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]], with the aim of pushing PVA forces back and giving United Nations forces more leverage at the truce negotiations now occurring at [[Panmunjom]].{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=165}} Operation Commando was scheduled for 3\u20135 October 1951 and the US I Corps commander, [[Lieutenant General]] [[John W. O'Daniel]], envisioned a concept of operations in which three of the Corps' four [[Division (military)|divisions]] would advance on a broad front in conjunction with US [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] on the left flank of the neighbouring US [[IX Corps (United States)|IX Corps]], seizing a new defensive line known as the [[Jamestown Line]].{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=72}} The divisions to be used in the advance included the 1st Commonwealth Division, US [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] and the [[Republic of Korea Army]] (ROK) [[9th Infantry Division (South Korea)|9th Division]]. The ROK [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st Division]] would remain in its existing position on the left flank.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=181}}\n\nIn the sector occupied by 1st Commonwealth Division, PVA forces were dug into a group of hills overlooking the Imjin River.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=166}} The division faced 6,000 troops from the PVA [[191st Motorized Infantry Brigade (People's Republic of China)|191st Division]], [[64th Group Army|64th Army]] under the overall command of Xie Zhengrong.{{sfn|Hu|Ma|1987|p=89}}{{sfn|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=120}}{{refn|The Chinese military did not have [[military rank|ranks]] during the 1950s, except for the title of \"Commander\" or \"Commissar\". Xie was the commander of the Chinese 191st Division.|group=Note}} The PVA forces were divided into three [[regiment]]s of about 2,000 men each, with two regiments dug-in in well prepared defensive positions with overhead protection, and a third regiment in support. The 28th Brigade faced one of the two forward regiments\u2014the 571st Regiment\u2014which was deployed with one battalion on Hill 355, a second battalion astride Hill 217 and Hill 317, and a third battalion in reserve to the west.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=184}}\n\nThe task allocated to the British Commonwealth force was to take these positions with the intention of advancing the line from the southern bank of the Imjin to a line of hills to the north, in total an objective that stretched more than {{convert|15|km|mi}}.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=166}} The primary objectives of the advance would be the capture of [[:ko:\uace0\uc655\uc0b0|Kowang San]] (Hill 355) and Maryang San (Hill 317) and the task of taking these positions was allocated to the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, with this formation bearing the brunt of the fighting.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=266}}{{refn|Kowang-San (Hill 355) was also known as ''Little Gibraltar'' to the Americans, British and Australians and is often referred to as such in histories of the battle.|group=Note}} Cassels planned on capturing the Jamestown Line in three phases. In the first phase, scheduled for 3 October, the 28th Brigade would take Hill 355 in the east-central sector. During the second phase, on 4 October, the 25th Brigade would assault the two Hill 187 features and the south-western ridge running to the [[Samichon]] (Sami River). Lastly during the third phase, scheduled for 5 October, the 28th Brigade would capture Hills 217 and 317.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|pp=183\u2013184}} As such, the bulk of the division's strength would be concentrated on the right flank, to be held by the 28th Brigade; meanwhile, the 25th Brigade would hold the left flank and the 29th Brigade would be held in reserve while providing a [[battalion]] to each of the other [[brigade]]s as reinforcements.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=183}}\n\nKowang-San would be assaulted during the first phase by 1 KOSB with 1 KSLI and 3 RAR in support, while Maryang San would be taken in the third phase of the operation by 3 RAR and the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers|1st Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] (1 RNF), which was detached from the 29th Brigade to the 28th Brigade for the duration of Operation Commando.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=72}} Careful reconnaissance and planning took place in the week prior to the commencement of the operation and Taylor emphasised the use of indirect fires, air support and infiltration tactics to limit casualties, as well as the exploitation of weak points in the PVA defences.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=184}}{{sfn|Malkasian|2002|p=151}} In direct support of the brigade was [[16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery]] with its {{convert|3.45|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25-pounder]] [[field gun]]s, in addition to divisional and corps assets which included {{convert|4.2|in|mm|adj=on}} mortars, {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} howitzers and {{convert|155|mm|in|adj=on}} heavy artillery; in total more than 120 guns and mortars.

Two previous attempts to take Maryang San by American troops had been unsuccessful.<ref name=awm /> Regardless, utilising tactics first developed against the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War of running along the tops of ridges, he intended to gain the advantage of the high ground, while utilising the cover afforded by the vegetation and the ease of movement along the crest-lines, in order to assault the PVA positions from unexpected directions.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=184}} Meanwhile, the PVA defenders on Maryang San were also testing a newly developed tactic called the \"mobile positional defense\", in which only small units were stationed on the hills in order to exhaust the UN attackers, while the bulk of the PVA defenders would later counterattack before the UN forces could consolidate into their newly gained positions.{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=161}}\n\nHowever, during the first phase of the operation the Australians would be tasked with capturing a PVA outpost on Hill 199 to allow tanks and medium machine-guns to provide direct fires onto the northern and eastern slopes of Hill 355 in support of an attack by the Borderers from the south-east. Likewise, the Shropshires would assault and capture Hill 208. Finally then, two days before the start of Operation Commando, the 28th Brigade crossed the Imjin river to assemble behind the 25th Brigade on 1 October. The following day the 3 RAR, less D Company, and the Borderers moved forward carefully into their assembly areas, ready to advance the following morning.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=185}} C Company advanced to a position {{convert|1500|m|yd}} in front of the Canadian positions, north-east of Hill 355. B Company was {{convert|200|m|yd}} to the rear. In the afternoon C Company was subjected to heavy shelling, losing one soldier wounded.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}} D Company\u2014under the command of Major Basil Hardiman\u2014was detached to 25th Brigade to strengthen its extended front, and it would not be available until the afternoon of 3 October. {{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=185}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Capture of Hill 199, 3 October 1951===\n[[File:Battle of Maryang San 2-8 October 1951.png|thumb|right|281px|alt=Map of the movements of 3 RAR during the battle as described in the text|The First Battle of Maryang San, 2\u20138 October 1951.]]\nAt 03:00 on 3 October, B Company 3 RAR moved north {{convert|2000|m|yd}} toward Hill 199, crossing the open valley under the cover of darkness and heavy mist. A Company then moved up behind C Company.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}} Artillery and mortar fire targeted known PVA artillery positions with [[counter-battery fire]] prior to dawn, before switching to support the Borderers in their assault on Hill 355. Simultaneously, the Shropshires were assaulting Hill 208 and with the support of A Squadron, 8th Royal Irish Hussars they reached the positions without opposition by 06:00.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=21}}{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}} By 08:00 B Company had gained the high ground to the north and then proceeded to patrol the short distance to west to the objective which was then taken with three wounded; five PVA were killed and one captured.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=21}} By mid-morning, both the Shropshires and the Australians had successfully captured their objectives.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=23}}\n\nExpecting a counter-attack, the Australians on Hill 199 began digging-in, however no such attack occurred. D Company subsequently returned and was allocated a position between C Company and the Borderers. C and B Companies both received shelling during the day, wounding two men.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=21}} At 10:00 A Company\u2014under Captain Jim Shelton\u2014took over the defence of Hill 199, and B Company went into reserve behind A Company.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}} According to plan a troop of Centurion tanks and a [[section (military unit)|section]] of medium machine-guns were then moved up onto Hill 199 and began directing their fire onto the northern slopes of Hill 355 in support of the Borderers.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=445}} Meanwhile, at 07:15, following preparation by artillery and mortar fire, the lead British assault companies had begun to advance on Hill 355. However, with the PVA expecting an assault from that direction, the initial British moves met strong resistance and the Borderers were forced to withdraw and reorganise. At 14:15 a second assault reached the objectives on the lower slopes, and these gains were consolidated by nightfall.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=23}}\n\nThe attack was now behind schedule. Indeed, the Borderers were still more than {{convert|1000|yd|m}} short of their final objective, and with stubborn resistance being encountered during the initial phase, Hill 355 would now not be secured until the afternoon of 4 October.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=267}} The assault was being slowed by two positions on the northeast slopes of Hill 355\u2014known as Hill 220\u2014from which the PVA held the British right flank in [[enfilade]]. C Company 3 RAR would be detached to assist the attack on Kowang-San the next morning, with the Australians tasked with outflanking the PVA defences and capturing this position.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=23}}{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Heavy PVA artillery fire had also slowed progress with more than 2,500 rounds falling in the 28th Brigade area in the previous twenty-four hours, although this total was dwarfed many times over by the weight of allied artillery fired across the brigade front, which included 22,324 rounds.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}} On the division's left flank, the delay also meant that the Canadian attack scheduled for 06:00 the next day in the 25th Brigade sector would have to be postponed until 11:00, due to the continuing requirement to use the divisional artillery in support of 28th Brigade.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}}\n\n===Capture of Hill 220 and the fall of Kowang-San, 4 October 1951===\nOn 4 October, C Company 3 RAR\u2014under the command of [[Major]] [[Jack Gerke]]\u2014attacked the long spur running east from the peak of Hill 355, known as Hill 220. Launching their assault at 09:00, the Australians quickly killed or drove off the defenders before pressing on up the spur and routing the remainder of a PVA [[company (military)|company]]. Reaching their objectives by 10:00, the Australians then took advantage of the initiative gained so far, pushing a platoon towards the summit of Hill 355. Amid heavy fighting, the Australians cleared the eastern slopes of Kowang-San by 12:00, despite having received no orders to do so.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}} Thirteen PVA were killed and three captured in the fighting, while Australian casualties included 11 wounded, one of whom subsequently died.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Gerke was later awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for his leadership.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=114}} C Company withdrew to the rear of the 3 RAR position and were replaced by D Company, who occupied the position held by A Company {{convert|500|m|yd}} north of Hill 199.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Meanwhile, led by a [[bagpipes|bagpiper]], the Borderers made a simultaneous assault up the western face of Kowang-San, and fearing they may be caught between two attacks the PVA defenders abandoned Hill 355, withdrawing northwest under heavy indirect fire.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=165}}\n\nGiven the strong resistance exhibited by the PVA, the Canadians expected a tough fight as 25th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives as part of the second phase of the divisional plan. Yet with the loss of Hill 355 and 210 the PVA unexpectedly withdrew from their well-prepared defensive positions, with Hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition. Only the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry|2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] encountered any opposition before they captured the two Hill 187 features, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 PVA were also killed. Indeed, the ease with which the Canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on, attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy PVA artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. The Canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty-two months of fighting.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\nMeanwhile, on the 28th Brigade's left flank the Shropshires met slight resistance, securing Hill 210 southwest of Kowang-San by 10:10.

[[Air strikes]] by the [[P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]] of [[2 Squadron SAAF|No. 2 Squadron, South African Air Force]] were also planned, targeting PVA concentrations north and west of the objectives to cut-off supplies and reinforcements.{{sfn|Breen|1994|pp=35\u201336}} Both the Australians and Fusiliers were scheduled to begin their attacks at first light\u2014at 05:45\u2014following a heavy artillery preparation.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=188}}\n\nIn the dark the Fusiliers moved off, but amid dense fog they found it difficult to maintain their bearings and were not in position in time to commence the attack as planned. By 10:00 they had struggled to within {{convert|300|m|yd}} from their objective, and following further delays the assault was commenced at 11:00. After initially achieving surprise a number of the forward PVA outposts fell to the Fusiliers. Occupying strong defensive positions on Hill 217, the PVA regained the initiative however, and poured heavy machine-gun and rifle fire onto the attackers as they crossed the valley, forcing them to withdraw after suffering heavy casualties and running low on ammunition.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=61}} Having expected the main axis of assault from the south, the PVA positions were stronger than previously considered and the Fusiliers were unable to gain the summit, despite one company gaining a toehold on the summit by midday.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=61}}{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}}\n\nEarlier that morning, at 04:45, B and D Companies 3 RAR had moved north across the valley, while Anti-Tank Platoon crossed the Imjin, taking up positions further north in order to protect the right flank. The assaulting companies would then move west towards a series of objectives before assaulting Hill 317.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Initially 3 RAR was to attack from the east, while 1 RNF would attack from the southwest through Hill 217, however with the Fusiliers facing stiff resistance on Hill 217 itself they were unable to get forward to assist.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} The previous attempts to capture Maryang San had failed due to the approach to steep eastern slopes of the feature being across a wide, open valley that was dominated by enfilade fire from mutually supporting PVA positions. Consequently, the Australians planned to cross the valley under cover of darkness and position themselves on the PVA flank in the foothills, before scaling the position at first light. A Company would create a diversion on the left flank, while B Company would clear the lower slopes before D Company passed through to assault the PVA main defensive position, known as the 'Victor' feature, in a one-up, one-in-depth assault.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=267}} However, following the casualties of previous nights on Hill 199, 220 and 355, and the effect of constant shelling, 3 RAR was now reduced to just 320 men. In contrast, the Australians faced two fresh PVA battalions on Maryang San, in total about 1,200 men. {{sfn|Breen|1994|p=37}}\n\n[[File:Chinese defend Maryang San.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese soldiers from the 64th Army defending Maryang San|alt=Five Asian soldiers firing weapons and throwing grenades from grass-covered a hilltop.

The Australian approach had surprised the PVA however, who were apparently expecting the assault from the north, and D Company succeeded in closing to within [[grenade]] range of the PVA on Victor. During a fierce twenty-minute fire-fight the Australians cleared their first objective with the assistance of direct fire from supporting tanks, and indirect fire support from artillery, losing three killed and 12 wounded.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=267}}{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Included among the Australian wounded was the company commander and one of the platoon commanders, both of whom remained in command despite gunshot wounds.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=44}} PVA losses included 30 killed and 10 captured.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=43}}\n\nDuring the initial phase A Company had attacked southwest along a spur leading to Hill 317 and had met stiff opposition.{{sfn|Horner|1990|pp=446\u2013447}} The diversion was largely successful however, causing the PVA to reinforce against the attack, which they believed to be the main effort.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=49}} Meanwhile, D Company continued to press their attack along the high ground towards the 'Uniform' feature, assaulting the deeply entrenched PVA positions, which included heavy automatic weapons. By 16:00 it had successfully captured the last of the intermediate objectives assigned to it and a platoon from B Company was pushed forward to assist in the clearance of the feature. Later, Lieutenant L.G. Clark was awarded the Military Cross while Sergeant W.J. Rowlinson was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for their actions during the fighting.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=192}} By this time total PVA casualties included 98 killed and 40 captured, while the Australians believed that a large number of PVA had also been wounded.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=446}} Following the progress of B and D Companies, C Company was moved up behind them and with the capture of final objective they immediately commenced an assault on Hill 317, capturing 10 prisoners for no loss.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=447}} Although the PVA had been well dug-in, there were no barbed wire obstacles to hamper the attackers and the Australians had rapidly gained the position.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=239}} By 17:00, Maryang San had fallen to the Australians, with the PVA withdrawing under heavy artillery, mortar and machine-gun fire.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=57}}\n\n[[File:Abandoned Chinese positions Korea Oct 1951 (AWM HOBJ2502).jpg|thumb|left|160px|Abandoned Chinese positions|alt=Abandoned earthworks on a tree covered slope.

Later, a platoon was detached to assist C Company consolidate the defence of Maryang San following its capture, while the remaining two platoons were withdrawn rearwards, again under heavy artillery fire.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=447}} Indeed, although it had played a supporting role in the attack, the efforts of A Company had been vital, suffering 20 casualties while killing at least 25 PVA and capturing two.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=58}} Now with Maryang San captured the Australians began digging-in, modifying the south-facing linear PVA trench system into an all-round defensive position with mutually supporting weapons pits.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=59}} Fully expecting a PVA counter-attack that evening, Hasset moved the Assault Pioneer Platoon to bolster the hasty defences.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=57}} Meanwhile, the PVA still occupied three key ridgeline positions\u2014the 'Sierra' feature, the 'Hinge' and the summit of Hill 317 itself\u2014which they continued to furiously defend. These would be the scene of considerable fighting in the days to come as the Australians attempted to clear them.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=73}}\n\n===The Hinge, 6\u20138 October 1951===\nWith both sides exhausted from the fighting the night of 5/6 October was less eventful than expected, and the Australians used the opportunity to develop their position.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=62}} To add further depth to their defences and to probe the PVA positions, Taylor ordered the Australians to capture the central remaining PVA position, the Sierra feature\u2014a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of Maryang San and the Hinge\u2014the next day.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=268}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=63}} Meanwhile, the Fusiliers would renew their attack on Hill 217.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}} The southern approach to Hill 217 had proved to be too strongly defended by the PVA and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome Taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders. To do this the high ground to the north-west of Maryang San, known as the Hinge, would be vital.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=65}} Indeed, adjacent to Hill 217, the Hinge dominated it from the north.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=268}} As such for the next assault, planned for the morning, the Fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the Hinge from the east, using the Australian positions on Maryang San as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on Hill 217.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=65}}\n\nAt 07:00 on 6 October, 9 Platoon C Company\u2014under the command of Lieutenant Arthur Pembroke\u2014moved forward to Sierra, using the heavy mist to conceal their movements.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=63}} Under-strength and not expecting the feature to be occupied, instead the Australians found a large number of PVA in well prepared defensive positions. Without fire support and outnumbered, the Australians immediately conducted a quick attack and, using grenades and [[bayonet]]s, they inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA before forcing the survivors to withdraw.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=64}} Although subjected to constant shelling, 9 Platoon continued to hold the knoll, repelling several counterattacks over the next 13 hours, cutting down each assault through the tree-line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine-gun fire, forcing the PVA to withdraw leaving their dead and wounded behind. One Australian was killed in the initial assault on Sierra, while a number were later wounded during the defence. PVA casualties included 19 killed, 30 wounded and seven captured. Pembroke was later awarded the [[Military Cross]].{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}}\n\n[[File:Australian machine gunners Maryang San Oct 1951 (AWM HOBJ2432).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Australian [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] machine-gunners firing in support of the assault by C Company 3 RAR on Hill 317.|alt=Soldiers firing a machine-gun towards a hillside in the distance.

Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by PVA small arms fire and grenades.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}} 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the PVA then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=66}} Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=65}} Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective.{{refn|1 RNF was overdue for rotation and many now felt they had done their share of the fighting. Indeed the battalion was the last of the original 29th Brigade battalions, with the other two already having been replaced by fresh battalions from Hong Kong and Great Britain.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=66}}|group=Note}} It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}} In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=195}}{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=268}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=67}}\n\nIn the early hours of 7 October the allied artillery and mortar bombardment began, targeting PVA positions on the Hinge.{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=67}} Hassett moved the 3 RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure, allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support.{{sfn|Kuring|2004|p=239}} Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 08:00. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth, using the trees and long grass for concealment. Initially it seemed that the PVA had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back and by 09:20 the Hinge finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. PVA casualties included more than 20 killed.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=268}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=67}} As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J.

The Anti-Tank Platoon and Assault Pioneer Platoon reinforced C Company, with a platoon of C Company moved forward to the Hinge to support B Company.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=447}} At 20:00 both the Hinge and Hill 317 were again heavily shelled for 45 minutes, heralding the beginning of the inevitable PVA counterattack. Heavy mist concealed the PVA advance, and this assisted many to penetrate the Australian perimeter. Throughout the night of 7/8 October the Hinge was attacked on three occasions from both the front and the flanks by a force of battalion strength, however the Australians beat back the PVA in desperate hand-to-hand combat.{{sfn|Horner|1990|p=447}}{{sfn|Breen|1994|p=82}} The PVA swept forward, but were stopped by intense small arms and artillery fire.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=198}} During one such assault Sergeant P.J. O'Connell, on seeing one of his platoon's [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] gunners wounded, manned the light machine-gun himself, breaking up a PVA assault, while controlling the fire of the men around him.

The tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.{{sfn|O'Neill|1985|p=199}}\n\nThe battle was also noted for the pioneering use of [[tunnel warfare]] by the PVA in the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=162}} During the fighting, a PVA company had defended their positions from a U-shaped tunnel capable of housing 100 men, which had served as both a bomb shelter and a base for counterattacks.{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=162}} The company leader later claimed that the tunnel enabled the defenders to inflict 700 UN casualties while suffering only 21 casualties in return.{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=162}} Impressed by the report, the PVA commander [[Peng Dehuai]], later ordered the construction of {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} deep tunnels along the entire front line, and it formed a formidable obstacle for UN forces to overcome during the stalemate period.{{sfn|Zhang|1995|pp=162\u2013164}}<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 2006|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-stale/stale.htm|title=Years of Stalemate July 1951\u2013 July 1953|page=20|publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n[[File:Australian casualties Operation Commando Oct 1951 (AWM HOBJ2443).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Australian casualties being evacuated during [[Operation Commando (1951)|Operation Commando]], October 1951|alt=Soldiers carrying a man on a stretcher.]]\nOperation Commando finally ended on 15 October with the US I Corps having successfully seized the Jamestown Line and destroying elements of the PVA [[42nd Army (People's Republic of China)|42nd]], 47th, 64th and 65th Armies.{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=99}} PVA losses were estimated at 21,000 casualties, while UN losses were 4,000\u2014the majority of them in the US 1st Cavalry Division which had borne the brunt of the fighting.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|pp=170\u2013171.}} Although a few hills south of the line remained in PVA/KPA hands\u2014requiring a follow-up operation known as [[Operation Polecharge]] which succeeded in capturing these positions by 19 October\u2014UN supply lines near Seoul were now free from PVA interdiction.{{sfn|Johnston|2003|p=170}}{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=101}} With the peace-talks ongoing, these operations proved to be last actions in the war of manoeuvre, which had lasted the previous sixteen months.
