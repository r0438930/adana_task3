His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to study the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work.  There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves.<ref name=\"Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99\">''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained'' (1995). pp. 67\u201399</ref> An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments. Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex. In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.\n\n[[File:Expo 1931 Angkor nuit.jpg|thumb|left|The grand replica of Angkor Wat in Paris Colonial Exposition 1931, represent the immense grandeur of French colony; the [[French protectorate of Cambodia]].]]\nThe 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Glaize p. 59.</ref> Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple.

Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief.

A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of [[Flag of Cambodia|Cambodian national flags]] since the introduction of the first version circa 1863.<ref>Flags of the World, [http://flagspot.net/flags/kh_hstry.html Cambodian Flag History]</ref> From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride ''sui generis'' but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937.<ref>Falser, Michael (2011).

This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431.<ref>Penny Edwards (2007).''Cambodge: The Cultivation of a Nation, 1860\u20131945'' {{ISBN|978-0-8248-2923-0}}</ref> Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as [[UNESCO World Heritage]] in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.<ref>Falser, Michael: Clearing the Path towards Civilization \u2013 150 Years of \"Saving Angkor\".

By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of [[sandstone]] (rather than brick or [[laterite]]) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural [[resin]]s or [[slaked lime]] has been suggested.<ref>[http://www.gacp-angkor.de/ German Apsara Conservation Project] Building Techniques, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple \"attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style.\"<ref>Glaize p. 25.</ref>\n\nArchitecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the [[Ogive|ogival]], redented towers shaped like [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds; half-[[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas (or apsaras)]], [[bas-relief]]s, and on [[pediment]]s extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work.<ref>APSARA authority, [http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/angkor/art/styles/angkorian/angkor_vat.html Angkor Vat Style]</ref> Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including [[gilding|gilded]] [[stucco]] on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.<ref>Freeman and Jacques p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Features===\n\n====Outer enclosure====\n[[File:Buddhist Monk at Angkor Wat 1.jpg|thumb|left|View of the gates and west wall of the outer enclosure of Angkor Wat from accross the moat]]\nThe outer wall, {{convert|1024|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|802|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, is surrounded by a {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} apron of open ground and a moat {{convert|190|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and over 5 kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) in perimeter.<ref name=Jarus2018 /> The moat extends 1.5 kilometres from east to west and 1.3 kilometres from north to south.<ref name=\"Angkor Wat: An Introduction\">{{cite journal |last1=Fletcher |first=Roland |first2=Damian |last2=Evans |first3=Christophe |last3=Pottier |first4=Chhay |last4=Rachna |title=Angkor Wat: An introduction |journal=Antiquity |date=December 2015 |volume=89 |issue=348 |page=1395 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2015.178 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286412358_Angkor_Wat_An_introduction |access-date=March 27, 2020 |via=ResearchGate}}</ref> Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge.<ref name=\"multiref4\">Freeman and Jacques p. 49.</ref> There are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gopura|gopuras]] at each of the [[cardinal point]]s; the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers.

These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]], including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.\n\n[[File:Angkor Wat 005.jpg|thumb|right|Northern library]]\nThe outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets.<ref name=\"Freeman and Jacques p. 50\">Freeman and Jacques p. 50.</ref> Most of the area is now covered by forest. A {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with [[Architecture of Cambodia#Naga|naga]] balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|library]] with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.<ref name=\"Freeman and Jacques p. 50\"/>\n\n====Central structure====\n[[File:Angot war.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the central structure; in front of the central structure lies the cruciform terrace.]]\nThe temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, [[Brahma]], the moon, and [[Vishnu]].<ref name=\"Ohio\" /> Each gallery has a [[gopura]] at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Quincunx|quincunx]] with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer =\n| align = right\n| image1 = Angkor Wat Tempel 34.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The central tower symbolizes the sacred [[Mount Meru]].\n| link1 =\n| image2 = Awatcornertower01.JPG\n| width2 = 160\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =One of the four corner towers of Angkor Wat\n| link2 =\n}}\n\nThe outer gallery measures {{convert|187|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called ''Preah Poan'' (the \"Hall of a Thousand Gods\"). [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] but others in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water.<ref>Glaize p. 63.</ref> North and south of the cloister are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|libraries]].\n\n[[File:Angkor (IV).jpg|thumb|left|View of the outer gallery of Angkor Wat]]\nBeyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]] abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and may originally have been flooded to represent the [[ocean]] around [[Mount Meru]].<ref>Ray, ''Lonely Planet guide to Cambodia'' p. 195.</ref> Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods.<ref>Ray p. 199.</ref> This inner gallery, called the ''Bakan'', is a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine, and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers. The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or [[garuda]]s. Carved [[Architecture of Cambodia#Lintels and pediments|lintels and pediments]] decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines.\nThe tower above the central shrine rises {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} to a height of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four.<ref>Briggs p. 199.</ref> The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to [[Theravada Buddhism]], the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouv\u00e9 excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of [[gold leaf]] two metres above ground level.<ref>Glaize p. 65.</ref>\n\n====Decoration====\n[[File:Angkor Wat - 047 Apsaras (8581709930).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devatas]] are characteristic of the Angkor Wat style.]]\nIntegrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of [[bas-relief]] friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the Hindu epics the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. Higham has called these, \"the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving\".<ref>Higham, ''Early Cultures of Mainland Southeast Asia'' p. 318.</ref> From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka (from the Ramayana, in which [[Rama]] defeats [[Ravana]]) and the [[Kurukshetra War|Battle of Kurukshetra]] (from the Mahabharata, showing the mutual annihilation of the [[Kaurava]] and [[Pandava]] clans).

The blocks were held together by [[mortise and tenon]] joints in some cases, while in others they used dovetails and gravity. The blocks were presumably put in place by a combination of elephants, [[coir]] ropes, pulleys and [[bamboo scaffolding]]. Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep, with more holes on the larger blocks. Some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods, but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place.\n\nThe monument was made out of 5 million to 10 million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/24440-angkor-wat-canals.html|title=Mystery of Angkor Wat Temple's Huge Stones Solved|date=31 October 2012|last=Ghose|first=Tia|work=livescience.com}}</ref> In fact, the entire city of [[Angkor]] used up far greater amounts of stone than all the Egyptian pyramids combined, and occupied an area significantly greater than modern-day [[Paris]].

The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts.<ref>[http://ospiti.thunder.it/gacp German Apsara Conservation Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205015542/http://ospiti.thunder.it/gacp/ |date=5 February 2005 }}, Conservation, Risk Map, p. 2.</ref> Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/apsara/about_apsara/publication/yashodhara/yashodhara_6.html\n |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526071420/http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/apsara/about_apsara/publication/yashodhara/yashodhara_6.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=26 May 2012\n |title=Infrastructures in Angkor Park\n |accessdate=25 April 2008\n |work=Yashodhara no. 6: January \u2013 June 2002\n |publisher=APSARA Authority\n}}</ref> while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/apsara/about_apsara/news/angkorvat_ceremony.html |title=The Completion of the Restoration Work of the Northern Library of Angkor Wat |accessdate=25 April 2008  |date=3 June 2005 |publisher=APSARA Authority}}</ref> \n\n[[World Monuments Fund]] began conservation work on the Churning of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition.

The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials on the roof of the gallery in 2013.\n\nMicrobial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at Angkor Wat, Preah Khan, and the Bayon and West Prasat in Angkor. The dehydration- and radiation-resistant filamentous cyanobacteria can produce organic acids that degrade the stone.

His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to study the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work.  There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites.

Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex. In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.\n\n[[File:Expo 1931 Angkor nuit.jpg|thumb|left|The grand replica of Angkor Wat in Paris Colonial Exposition 1931, represent the immense grandeur of French colony; the [[French protectorate of Cambodia]].]]\nThe 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Glaize p. 59.</ref> Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple.

Typical decorative elements are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas (or apsaras)]], [[bas-relief]]s, and on [[pediment]]s extensive garlands and narrative scenes.
