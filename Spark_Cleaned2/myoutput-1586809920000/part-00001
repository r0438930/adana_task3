At the time of release and in the years since, the film has garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]]. This is the final film to feature actor [[Matthew McGrory]] before his death the same year (although McGrory did have an uncredited posthumous cameo in 2017's ''[[The Evil Within (2017 film)|The Evil Within]]'', which was filmed in 2002). The film's DVD release is dedicated to his \"loving memory\".\n\n==Plot==\nSeven months later after the Halloween sacrifice, on May 18, 1978, [[Texas]] Sheriff John Quincey Wydell and a large posse of [[state troopers]] issue a [[search and destroy]] mission on the Firefly family for over 75 [[homicide]]s and disappearances over the past several years. The family arm themselves and fire on the officers. Rufus is killed and Mother Firefly is taken into custody, while Otis and Baby escape. They steal a car and, after killing the driver, they go to Kahiki Palms, a run-down motel.\n\nWhile at the motel, Otis and Baby take a band called Banjo and Sullivan hostage in their room, and Otis shoots the roadie when he returns. Meanwhile, Baby's father, [[Captain Spaulding]], decides to rendezvous with Baby and Otis. En route, his truck runs out of gas, and he frightens a boy and assaults the boy's mother before stealing her car. Back at the motel, Otis rapes Roy's wife Gloria and demands Adam and Roy come with him on an errand.\n\nOtis drives his two prisoners to a place where he buried weapons. While walking to the location, the two prisoners attack Otis, but Otis bludgeons Roy and cuts Adam's face off. Back at the motel, Adam's wife Wendy tries to escape out the bathroom window. When Gloria attempts to rebel, Baby kills her. Wendy runs out of the motel but is caught by Captain Spaulding, who knocks her unconscious. Otis returns, and all three leave the motel together in the band's van.\n\nThe motel maid comes to clean the room, and she discovers the murder scene. The maid enters the bathroom, where she sees \"The Devil's Rejects\" written on the wall in blood; she is startled by Wendy, who is accidentally killed when she runs out to the highway to seek help while she is in shock. Wydell calls a pair of amoral bounty hunters\u2014the \"Unholy Two\"\u2014Rondo and Billy Ray, to help him find the Fireflys. While investigating, they discover an associate of Spaulding's named Charlie Altamont. Wydell begins to lose his sanity when Mother Firefly reveals that she murdered his brother. After having a dream in which his brother commands him to avenge his death, Wydell stabs Mother Firefly to death. The surviving Fireflys gather at a brothel owned by Charlie, where he offers them shelter from the police.\n\nAfter he leaves the brothel, Wydell threatens Charlie to give up the Fireflys. With the help of the \"Unholy Two\", the sheriff takes the family back to the Firefly house where he tortures them, using similar methods they used on their own victims. He nails Otis' hands to his chair and staples crime scene photographs to Otis's and Baby's stomachs; he then beats and shocks Captain Spaulding and Otis with a cattle prod and taunts Baby about the death of her mother.\n\nWydell sets the house on fire and leaves Otis and Spaulding to burn, but he lets Baby loose outside so he can hunt her for sport. Charlie returns to save the Firefly family, but he is killed by Wydell. Baby gets shot in the calf of her left leg, brutally horse-whipped, and then strangled by Wydell. Tiny suddenly arrives and intervenes, breaking Wydell's neck and saving the Firefly family. Otis, Baby, and Spaulding escape in Charlie's 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]], leaving behind Tiny, who [[Suicide|walks back into the burning house]]. The trio drives, badly injured and seemingly humbled by their experience with a clearer understanding of the torment and anguish that they had put their past victims through. As Otis drives down the road with Baby and Spaulding asleep in the back seat he notices a police barricade ahead of them. Realizing that they will not make it out alive, he wakes Baby and Spaulding and hands them each a gun. As [[Free Bird|a song playing on the radio declares they \"can't change\"]], they speed toward the barricade, guns blazing, as the police return fire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Firefly (film series) characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Sid Haig]] as [[Captain Spaulding]] / \"Cutter\"\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Otis Driftwood\n* [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] as Vera-Ellen \"Baby\" Firefly\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Sheriff John Quincey Wydell\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Charlie Altamont\n* [[Matthew McGrory]] as Tiny Firefly\n* [[Leslie Easterbrook]] as Gloria Firefly\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Officer Ray Dobson\n* [[Elizabeth Daily|E.

The maid enters the bathroom, where she sees \"The Devil's Rejects\" written on the wall in blood; she is startled by Wendy, who is accidentally killed when she runs out to the highway to seek help while she is in shock. Wydell calls a pair of amoral bounty hunters\u2014the \"Unholy Two\"\u2014Rondo and Billy Ray, to help him find the Fireflys. While investigating, they discover an associate of Spaulding's named Charlie Altamont. Wydell begins to lose his sanity when Mother Firefly reveals that she murdered his brother. After having a dream in which his brother commands him to avenge his death, Wydell stabs Mother Firefly to death. The surviving Fireflys gather at a brothel owned by Charlie, where he offers them shelter from the police.\n\nAfter he leaves the brothel, Wydell threatens Charlie to give up the Fireflys. With the help of the \"Unholy Two\", the sheriff takes the family back to the Firefly house where he tortures them, using similar methods they used on their own victims. He nails Otis' hands to his chair and staples crime scene photographs to Otis's and Baby's stomachs; he then beats and shocks Captain Spaulding and Otis with a cattle prod and taunts Baby about the death of her mother.\n\nWydell sets the house on fire and leaves Otis and Spaulding to burn, but he lets Baby loose outside so he can hunt her for sport. Charlie returns to save the Firefly family, but he is killed by Wydell. Baby gets shot in the calf of her left leg, brutally horse-whipped, and then strangled by Wydell. Tiny suddenly arrives and intervenes, breaking Wydell's neck and saving the Firefly family. Otis, Baby, and Spaulding escape in Charlie's 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]], leaving behind Tiny, who [[Suicide|walks back into the burning house]]. The trio drives, badly injured and seemingly humbled by their experience with a clearer understanding of the torment and anguish that they had put their past victims through. As Otis drives down the road with Baby and Spaulding asleep in the back seat he notices a police barricade ahead of them. Realizing that they will not make it out alive, he wakes Baby and Spaulding and hands them each a gun. As [[Free Bird|a song playing on the radio declares they \"can't change\"]], they speed toward the barricade, guns blazing, as the police return fire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Firefly (film series) characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Sid Haig]] as [[Captain Spaulding]] / \"Cutter\"\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Otis Driftwood\n* [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] as Vera-Ellen \"Baby\" Firefly\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Sheriff John Quincey Wydell\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Charlie Altamont\n* [[Matthew McGrory]] as Tiny Firefly\n* [[Leslie Easterbrook]] as Gloria Firefly\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Officer Ray Dobson\n* [[Elizabeth Daily|E.
