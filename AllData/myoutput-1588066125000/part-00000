Dialectal divergences are observable between the northern and southern forms of Galician-Portuguese in 13th-century texts but the two dialects were similar enough to maintain a high level of cultural unity until the middle of the 14th century, producing the medieval [[Galician-Portuguese lyric]].

During the 16th century the Galician language stopped being used in legal documentation, becoming de facto an oral language spoken by the vast majority of the Galicians, but having just some minor written use in lyric, theatre and private letters.\n\nIt was not until the {{ordinal|18}} century that linguists elaborated the first Galician dictionaries, and the language did not recover a proper literature till the {{ordinal|19}} century; only since the last quarter of the {{ordinal|20}} century is it taught in schools and used in lawmaking.

It is supposed by law to be taught bilingually, alongside Spanish, in both primary and secondary education, although the accomplishment of this law is allegedly doubted. It is also used at the three universities established in Galicia, having also the consideration of official language of the three institutions. Galician has also legal recognition in the [[Bierzo]] region in [[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], and in four municipalities in [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]].

There are those defending these linguistic varieties as [[dialect continuum|dialects of transition]] to the [[Astur-Leonese group]] on the one hand, and those defending it as clearly Galician varieties on the other. The recent edition of the cartularies of Oscos in [[W: Es: Antiguo concejo de Castropol|Eonavia]] and cartularies of [[Obona]], [[Cornellana]], [[Corias]] and [[Belmonte de Miranda|Belmonte]] in middle west of Asturias have shown a huge difference in the medieval speech between both banks of the Navia river.<ref>''Like a rainbow between two close colours, there is a moment, in the way of the West, when we get to feel us into the Galician area, and another side, to the East, in which we get to feel us into Asturian, but there is also a mixed zone, in which, after all, the distinction depends on our way to appreciate and read will depend on a serial linguistics facts.

Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Galicia was united with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, and later with the Kingdom of Castile, under kings of the [[House of Burgundy]]. The Galician and Portuguese standards of the language diverged over time, following independent evolutionary paths. Portuguese was the official language of the Portuguese chancellery, while Galician was the usual language not only of troubadours and peasants, but also of local noblemen and clergy, and of their officials, so forging and maintaining two slightly different standards.\n\n[[File:13th-century unknown painters - Cantigas de Alfonso el Sabio - WGA16031.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]], 13th century]]\nDuring the reign of [[Alfonso X]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] became the official language of the chancellery of the Kingdom of Castile. However, in Galicia and neighboring regions of Asturias and Le\u00f3n in 1200\u20131500, the local languages remained the usual written languages in any type of document, either legal or narrative, public or private. Spanish was progressively introduced through Royal decrees and the edicts of foreign churchmen and officials.

Other important sources are a number of [[sonnet]]s and other lyric poetry, as well as other literate productions, including the forgery of allegedly mediaeval scriptures or chronicles under diverse pretensions\u2014usually to show the ancient nobility of the forger's family\u2014being these writings elaborated in an archaic looking Galician which nevertheless could not conceal the state of the language during this period.\n\nMiddle Galician is characterized by a series of phonetic processes which led to a further separation from Portuguese, and to the apparition of some of the more notorious dialectal features, among other phenomenons: emergence of the ''gheada'' or pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0261/}} as a pharyngeal fricative; denasalization of nasal vowels in most of Galicia, becoming oral vowels in the east, or a group formed by an oral vowels plus a nasal in the west; reduction of the sibilant system, with the confluence (except in the ''Baixa Limia'' region) of voiced and voiceless fricatives, followed by a process of de-affrication which led to different results in the west and in the east.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mari\u00f1o Paz|1998|pp=265\u2013288}}</ref>\n\nThe most important author during this period of the language was the [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] scholar [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]], unconditional defender and the first researcher of Galician language (history, evolution, lexicon, etymology, onomastics).

opinion de Garc\u00eda de Diego de que non-se pode falar de dialectos propiamente ditos no galego. Nos mapas deste cap\u00edtulo pode apreciarse a extensi\u00f3n xeogr\u00e1fica desigual dalg\u00fans fen\u00f3menos ling\u00fc\u00edsticos (\u2026) e tam\u00e9n como as isoglosas (\u2026) poucas veces coinciden\" {{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|p=36}}</ref> Despite this, Galician local varieties are collected in three main [[dialect]]al blocks, each block comprising a series of areas, being local linguistic varieties that are all [[mutually intelligible]]. Some of the main features which distinguish the three blocks are:\n* The resolution of medieval [[nasalized vowels]] and [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]: these sometimes turned into [[diphthongs]] in the east, while in the center and west the vowels in the hiatus were sometimes assimilated. Later, in the eastern\u2014except Ancarese Galician\u2014and central blocks, the nasal trait was lost, while in the west the nasal trait usually developed into an implosive{{clarify|reason= implosive usually means a consonant articulated with ingressive airflow, and it is, to my knowledge, always a stop consonant. What is meant by implosive here? |date=December 2019}}<ref>Ferreiro 1999:132; Fern\u00e1ndez Rei 2003: 58</ref> nasal consonant {{IPA|/\u014b/}}. In general, these led to important dialectal variability in the inflection in genre and number of words ended in a nasal consonant. So, from medieval ''irm\u00e3o'' 'brother', ''ladr\u00f5es'' 'robbers', ''irm\u00e3as'' 'sisters' we have eastern Galician ''irmao'', ''ladrois'', ''irm\u00e1s''; central Galician ''irmao'', ''ladr\u00f3s'', ''irm\u00e1s''; western Galician ''irm\u00e1n'', ''ladr\u00f3ns'', ''irm\u00e1ns''.<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|pp=59\u201367}}</ref>\n: An exception to this rule is constituted by the hiatus in which the first vowel was a nasalized i or u. In those cases, a nasal, palatal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} or velar {{IPA|/\u014b/}} was usually inserted: ''\u0169a'' 'a / one (fem.)' > ''unha'' (Portuguese ''uma''), -''ina'' > -''\u0129a'' > -''i\u00f1a'' (Portuguese -''inha''). Nevertheless, in Ancarese and Asturian Galician, this process did not take place: A-G ''vec\u00eda'', Ancarese ''vec\u0129a'' vs. standard ''veci\u00f1a'' '(female) neighbor' (Port. ''vizinha''), A-G ''\u00faa'', Ancarese ''\u0169a'' vs. standard ''unha'' (Port. uma).\n* The resolution of hiatus formed by oral vowels had similar developments, most notably those derived from the loss of {{IPA|/l/}}, which again had important consequences for the declension of words ending in {{IPA|/l/}}. So, Medieval Galician ''animaes'' 'animals' (sing. ''animal''); central and western Galician ''anim\u00e1s''; eastern Galician ''animais''; Asturian Galician ''animales'' ({{IPA|/l/}} is preserved).<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|pp=64\u201365}}</ref>\n* In the west, {{IPA|/\u0261/}} is rendered as a fricative {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|x}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u0127}} ~ {{IPAplink|h}}]}} (''[[gheada]]''), except after a nasal, where it can become a stop {{IPAblink|k}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|pp=163\u2013189}}</ref>\n* Stressed vowel [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]] is most notable in the west and center, while in the east it is unknown. It is triggered by a final {{IPA|/o/}}, which tends to close [[open-mid vowel]]s, or by a final {{IPA|/a/}} which tends to open [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]] ones.\n* There are three main [[sibilant]] systems, all derived from the medieval Galician one, which were richer and more complex:<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|p=213}}</ref>\n** The common one, extended in the eastern and center regions, presents an opposition {{IPA|/\u0283/ \u2013 /s/ \u2013 /\u03b8/}}. In the westernmost parts of this area the opposition of {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is lost in postnuclear position, in the coda, both being produced {{IPA|/s/}}.\n** In the coastal western areas the opposition is {{IPA|/\u0283/ \u2013 /s/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} being produced in some regions as a laminal or in some others as an apical. Sometimes this system is even further reduced to just a single {{IPA|/s/}}. On the other hand, in some areas final {{IPA|/s/}} is produced as {{IPA|/\u0283/}}.\n** In the Limia Baixa region an old six sibilant system is still preserved, with voiced/voiceless opposition: {{IPA|/\u0283/ \u2013 /\u0292/}}; {{IPA|/s\u033a/ \u2013 /z\u033a/}} (apical) and {{IPA|/s\u033b/ \u2013 /z\u033b/}} (laminal).<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|p=57}}</ref>\n\nEach dialectal area is then further defined by these and other more restricted traits or isoglosses:\n*'''Eastern Galician''': Asturian area ([[Eonavian]]), Ancares area, Zamora area and Central-Eastern area.\n*'''Central Galician''': Mindoniense area, Lucu-auriense area, Central Transitional area, and Eastern Transitional area.\n*'''Western Galician''': Berganti\u00f1os area, Fisterra area, Pontevedra area and Lower Limia area.\nStandard Galician is usually based on Central Galician characteristics, but it also incorporates western and eastern traits and features.\n\n=== Examples ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Galician !! rowspan=\"2\" | Medieval Galician (13th\u201315th c.) !! rowspan=\"2\" | Portuguese !! rowspan=\"2\" | Spanish !! rowspan=\"2\" | Latin !! rowspan=\"2\" | English\n|-\n!

After many centuries of close contact between the two languages, Galician has also adopted many loan words from Spanish, and some [[calques]] of Spanish syntax.\n\nGalician usually makes the difference according to gender and categorizes words as masculine \"o rapaz\" (the young man) or feminine \"a rapaza\" (the young woman). This difference is present in the articles \"o / a / os/ as\" (the), nouns \"o can / a cadela\" (the dog / the (female) dog), pronouns \"el / ela\", (he / she) and adjectives \"boniti\u00f1o / boniti\u00f1a\" (pretty, beautiful). There is also a neuter set of demonstrative pronouns \"isto, iso, aquilo\" (this / that). The most typical ending for masculine words is -o, whereas the most typical ending for feminine is -a \"o prato / a tixola\" (the plate / the frying pan). The difference in the grammatical gender of a word may correspond to a real gender difference in the physical world \"xuicioso / xuiciosa\" (sensible); the former adjective will qualify a male, and the latter, a female. However, there is no particular reason for objects to be adscribed to a particular grammatical gender or another, it has to do with the gender having been ascribed by tradition and the use of speakers as in the following examples: \"o xis / o samba / a mesa / a caricatura\" (chalk / the samba / the table / the caricature).\n\nGalician expresses the difference in number with a form for the singular and another for the plural. The most typical suffix to express a plural number is \"s\", \"cantiga / cantigas\".\n\nThere are two different ways of addressing people: one is the most usual informal pronoun \"ti\" for the second person singular and \"vos\" for the second person plural. There are formal ways of addressing directly people \"vostede\" for the singular and \"vostedes\" for the plural.\n\nThe last review of the official grammar has established that the exclamation and question marks will appear only at the end of the sentence if there is no risk of confusion, thus deprecating the general use of Spanish-like [[inverted question and exclamation marks]].\n\nThe verb is inflected. There are regular and irregular verbs in the language. All verbs will appear listed by means of their infinitive form in dictionaries, and there are three typical endings for verbs \"-ar / -er / ir\".\n\nAll words have accent in Galician, considering that the accent is the fact of a particular syllable carrying the most stress in a word. The \"tilde\" (\u00b4) is a small line written over some vowels to show in some cases which syllable carries the accent, \"paspall\u00e1s\" (quail), \"m\u00f3bil\" (mobile) \"c\u00e1rcere\" (jail, gaol).\n\nThe tilde has some other functions. Sometimes the tilde is written to show that there is not a diphthong among two vowels which happen to be alongside one another within the same word \"a\u00ednda\" (yet). If the tilde happens to be necessary on a capitalized letter, it must be written regardless: \"\u00d3scar\". Another use is the differentiation of meaning: there are words which can be differentiated by the presence or absence of the tilde: \"c\u00f3mpre\" (it is necessary) versus \"compre\" (buy) as in \"C\u00f3mpre que compre un reloxio\" (It's necessary that I buy a clock).\n\n== Orthography == <!-- Courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[Galician alphabet]] redirects here -->\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe current official Galician orthography is guided by the \"Normas ortogr\u00e1ficas e morfol\u00f3xicas do Idioma Galego\"<ref>{{Citation |title=Normas ortogr\u00e1ficas e morfol\u00f3xicas do idioma galego |date=March 2012 |url=https://academia.gal/documents/10157/704901/Normas+ortogr%C3%A1ficas+e+morfol%C3%B3xicas+do+idioma+galego.pdf |edition=23rd}}</ref> (NOMIGa), first introduced in 1982, by the Royal Galician Academy (RAG), based on a report by the Instituto da Lingua Galega (ILG). These norms were not accepted by some sectors desiring a norm closer to modern Portuguese (see [[reintegrationism]]). In July 2003, the Royal Galician Academy modified the language normative to admit and promote some archaic Galician-Portuguese forms conserved in modern Portuguese, merging the NOMIG and the main proposals of the moderate sectors of reintegrationism; the resulting orthography is used by the vast majority of media, cultural production and virtually all official matters including education. \n\nThere still exists a minoritary reintegrationist movement that opts for the use of writing systems that range from adapted to whole Portuguese orthography.\n\n=== Examples ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

The language is also spoken in some border zones of the neighboring Spanish regions of [[Asturias]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]], as well as by Galician migrant communities in the rest of Spain, in Latin America including Puerto Rico, the United States, [[Switzerland]] and elsewhere in Europe.\n\nModern Galician is part of the [[West Iberian languages]] group, a family of [[Romance languages]] that includes the [[Portuguese language]], which developed locally from [[Vulgar Latin]] and evolved into what modern scholars have called [[Galician-Portuguese]]. Dialectal divergences are observable between the northern and southern forms of Galician-Portuguese in 13th-century texts but the two dialects were similar enough to maintain a high level of cultural unity until the middle of the 14th century, producing the medieval [[Galician-Portuguese lyric]]. The divergence has continued to this day, producing the modern languages of Galician and Portuguese.<ref>{{cite book|last=de Azevedo Maia|first=Clarinda|title=Hist\u00f3ria do galego-portugu\u00eas: estado lingu\u00edstico da Galiza e do noroeste de Portugal desde o s\u00e9culo XIII ao s\u00e9culo XVI (com refer\u00eancia \u00e0 situa\u00e7\u00e3o do galego moderno)|year=1997|publisher=Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Calouste Gulbenkian|location=Lisboa|isbn=9789723107463|edition=Reimpress\u00e3 da edi\u00e7\u00e3o do INIC (1986)|pages=883\u2013891}}</ref>\n\nThe [[lexicon]] of Galician is predominantly of [[Latin]] extraction, although it also contains a moderate number of words of [[List of Galician words of Germanic origin|Germanic]] and [[List of Galician words of Celtic origin|Celtic]] origin, among other [[substratum (linguistics)|substrates]] and [[adstrate]]s, having also received, mainly via Spanish, a number of nouns from [[Andalusian Arabic]].\n\nThe language is officially regulated in Galicia by the [[Royal Galician Academy]].

This common ancestral stage developed from [[Vulgar Latin]] in the territories of the old [[Kingdom of Galicia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Northern Portugal]], as a Western [[Romance language]]. In the {{ordinal|13}} century it became a written and cultivated language with two main varieties,<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|p=17}}</ref> but during the {{ordinal|14}} century the standards of these varieties, Galician and Portuguese, began to diverge, as Portuguese became the official language of the independent [[kingdom of Portugal]] and its chancellery, while Galician was the language of the scriptoria of the lawyers, noblemen and churchmen of the Kingdom of Galicia, then integrated in the [[crown of Castile]] and open to influence from Spanish language, culture, and politics. During the 16th century the Galician language stopped being used in legal documentation, becoming de facto an oral language spoken by the vast majority of the Galicians, but having just some minor written use in lyric, theatre and private letters.\n\nIt was not until the {{ordinal|18}} century that linguists elaborated the first Galician dictionaries, and the language did not recover a proper literature till the {{ordinal|19}} century; only since the last quarter of the {{ordinal|20}} century is it taught in schools and used in lawmaking. The first complete translation of the [[Bible]] from the original languages dates from 1989.

It is supposed by law to be taught bilingually, alongside Spanish, in both primary and secondary education, although the accomplishment of this law is allegedly doubted. It is also used at the three universities established in Galicia, having also the consideration of official language of the three institutions. Galician has also legal recognition in the [[Bierzo]] region in [[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], and in four municipalities in [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]]. The other languages with official status elsewhere in Spain are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (or [[Valencian language|Valencian]]), [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Aranese language|Aranese]]. Galician has also been accepted orally as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] in the [[European Parliament]], having been used by some Galician representatives, among others: [[Jos\u00e9 Posada]], [[Camilo Nogueira]] and [[Xos\u00e9 Manuel Beiras]].\n\nControversy exists regarding the inclusion of [[Eonavian]] (spoken in the western end of [[Asturias]], bordering [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) into the Galician language, as it has some traits in common with [[Asturian language|Western Asturian or bable occidental]] (spoken in the middle west of Asturias). There are those defending these linguistic varieties as [[dialect continuum|dialects of transition]] to the [[Astur-Leonese group]] on the one hand, and those defending it as clearly Galician varieties on the other. The recent edition of the cartularies of Oscos in [[W: Es: Antiguo concejo de Castropol|Eonavia]] and cartularies of [[Obona]], [[Cornellana]], [[Corias]] and [[Belmonte de Miranda|Belmonte]] in middle west of Asturias have shown a huge difference in the medieval speech between both banks of the Navia river.<ref>''Like a rainbow between two close colours, there is a moment, in the way of the West, when we get to feel us into the Galician area, and another side, to the East, in which we get to feel us into Asturian, but there is also a mixed zone, in which, after all, the distinction depends on our way to appreciate and read will depend on a serial linguistics facts.

Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Galicia was united with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, and later with the Kingdom of Castile, under kings of the [[House of Burgundy]]. The Galician and Portuguese standards of the language diverged over time, following independent evolutionary paths. Portuguese was the official language of the Portuguese chancellery, while Galician was the usual language not only of troubadours and peasants, but also of local noblemen and clergy, and of their officials, so forging and maintaining two slightly different standards.\n\n[[File:13th-century unknown painters - Cantigas de Alfonso el Sabio - WGA16031.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]], 13th century]]\nDuring the reign of [[Alfonso X]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] became the official language of the chancellery of the Kingdom of Castile.

opinion de Garc\u00eda de Diego de que non-se pode falar de dialectos propiamente ditos no galego. Nos mapas deste cap\u00edtulo pode apreciarse a extensi\u00f3n xeogr\u00e1fica desigual dalg\u00fans fen\u00f3menos ling\u00fc\u00edsticos (\u2026) e tam\u00e9n como as isoglosas (\u2026) poucas veces coinciden\" {{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|p=36}}</ref> Despite this, Galician local varieties are collected in three main [[dialect]]al blocks, each block comprising a series of areas, being local linguistic varieties that are all [[mutually intelligible]]. Some of the main features which distinguish the three blocks are:\n* The resolution of medieval [[nasalized vowels]] and [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]: these sometimes turned into [[diphthongs]] in the east, while in the center and west the vowels in the hiatus were sometimes assimilated. Later, in the eastern\u2014except Ancarese Galician\u2014and central blocks, the nasal trait was lost, while in the west the nasal trait usually developed into an implosive{{clarify|reason= implosive usually means a consonant articulated with ingressive airflow, and it is, to my knowledge, always a stop consonant. What is meant by implosive here? |date=December 2019}}<ref>Ferreiro 1999:132; Fern\u00e1ndez Rei 2003: 58</ref> nasal consonant {{IPA|/\u014b/}}. In general, these led to important dialectal variability in the inflection in genre and number of words ended in a nasal consonant. So, from medieval ''irm\u00e3o'' 'brother', ''ladr\u00f5es'' 'robbers', ''irm\u00e3as'' 'sisters' we have eastern Galician ''irmao'', ''ladrois'', ''irm\u00e1s''; central Galician ''irmao'', ''ladr\u00f3s'', ''irm\u00e1s''; western Galician ''irm\u00e1n'', ''ladr\u00f3ns'', ''irm\u00e1ns''.<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|pp=59\u201367}}</ref>\n: An exception to this rule is constituted by the hiatus in which the first vowel was a nasalized i or u. In those cases, a nasal, palatal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} or velar {{IPA|/\u014b/}} was usually inserted: ''\u0169a'' 'a / one (fem.)' > ''unha'' (Portuguese ''uma''), -''ina'' > -''\u0129a'' > -''i\u00f1a'' (Portuguese -''inha''). Nevertheless, in Ancarese and Asturian Galician, this process did not take place: A-G ''vec\u00eda'', Ancarese ''vec\u0129a'' vs. standard ''veci\u00f1a'' '(female) neighbor' (Port. ''vizinha''), A-G ''\u00faa'', Ancarese ''\u0169a'' vs. standard ''unha'' (Port. uma).\n* The resolution of hiatus formed by oral vowels had similar developments, most notably those derived from the loss of {{IPA|/l/}}, which again had important consequences for the declension of words ending in {{IPA|/l/}}. So, Medieval Galician ''animaes'' 'animals' (sing. ''animal''); central and western Galician ''anim\u00e1s''; eastern Galician ''animais''; Asturian Galician ''animales'' ({{IPA|/l/}} is preserved).<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|pp=64\u201365}}</ref>\n* In the west, {{IPA|/\u0261/}} is rendered as a fricative {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|x}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u0127}} ~ {{IPAplink|h}}]}} (''[[gheada]]''), except after a nasal, where it can become a stop {{IPAblink|k}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|pp=163\u2013189}}</ref>\n* Stressed vowel [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]] is most notable in the west and center, while in the east it is unknown. It is triggered by a final {{IPA|/o/}}, which tends to close [[open-mid vowel]]s, or by a final {{IPA|/a/}} which tends to open [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]] ones.\n* There are three main [[sibilant]] systems, all derived from the medieval Galician one, which were richer and more complex:<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|p=213}}</ref>\n** The common one, extended in the eastern and center regions, presents an opposition {{IPA|/\u0283/ \u2013 /s/ \u2013 /\u03b8/}}. In the westernmost parts of this area the opposition of {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is lost in postnuclear position, in the coda, both being produced {{IPA|/s/}}.\n** In the coastal western areas the opposition is {{IPA|/\u0283/ \u2013 /s/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} being produced in some regions as a laminal or in some others as an apical. Sometimes this system is even further reduced to just a single {{IPA|/s/}}. On the other hand, in some areas final {{IPA|/s/}} is produced as {{IPA|/\u0283/}}.\n** In the Limia Baixa region an old six sibilant system is still preserved, with voiced/voiceless opposition: {{IPA|/\u0283/ \u2013 /\u0292/}}; {{IPA|/s\u033a/ \u2013 /z\u033a/}} (apical) and {{IPA|/s\u033b/ \u2013 /z\u033b/}} (laminal).<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Rei|2003|p=57}}</ref>\n\nEach dialectal area is then further defined by these and other more restricted traits or isoglosses:\n*'''Eastern Galician''': Asturian area ([[Eonavian]]), Ancares area, Zamora area and Central-Eastern area.\n*'''Central Galician''': Mindoniense area, Lucu-auriense area, Central Transitional area, and Eastern Transitional area.\n*'''Western Galician''': Berganti\u00f1os area, Fisterra area, Pontevedra area and Lower Limia area.\nStandard Galician is usually based on Central Galician characteristics, but it also incorporates western and eastern traits and features.\n\n=== Examples ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Galician !! rowspan=\"2\" | Medieval Galician (13th\u201315th c.) !! rowspan=\"2\" | Portuguese !! rowspan=\"2\" | Spanish !! rowspan=\"2\" | Latin !! rowspan=\"2\" | English\n|-\n!

After many centuries of close contact between the two languages, Galician has also adopted many loan words from Spanish, and some [[calques]] of Spanish syntax.\n\nGalician usually makes the difference according to gender and categorizes words as masculine \"o rapaz\" (the young man) or feminine \"a rapaza\" (the young woman). This difference is present in the articles \"o / a / os/ as\" (the), nouns \"o can / a cadela\" (the dog / the (female) dog), pronouns \"el / ela\", (he / she) and adjectives \"boniti\u00f1o / boniti\u00f1a\" (pretty, beautiful). There is also a neuter set of demonstrative pronouns \"isto, iso, aquilo\" (this / that). The most typical ending for masculine words is -o, whereas the most typical ending for feminine is -a \"o prato / a tixola\" (the plate / the frying pan). The difference in the grammatical gender of a word may correspond to a real gender difference in the physical world \"xuicioso / xuiciosa\" (sensible); the former adjective will qualify a male, and the latter, a female. However, there is no particular reason for objects to be adscribed to a particular grammatical gender or another, it has to do with the gender having been ascribed by tradition and the use of speakers as in the following examples: \"o xis / o samba / a mesa / a caricatura\" (chalk / the samba / the table / the caricature).\n\nGalician expresses the difference in number with a form for the singular and another for the plural. The most typical suffix to express a plural number is \"s\", \"cantiga / cantigas\".\n\nThere are two different ways of addressing people: one is the most usual informal pronoun \"ti\" for the second person singular and \"vos\" for the second person plural. There are formal ways of addressing directly people \"vostede\" for the singular and \"vostedes\" for the plural.\n\nThe last review of the official grammar has established that the exclamation and question marks will appear only at the end of the sentence if there is no risk of confusion, thus deprecating the general use of Spanish-like [[inverted question and exclamation marks]].\n\nThe verb is inflected. There are regular and irregular verbs in the language. All verbs will appear listed by means of their infinitive form in dictionaries, and there are three typical endings for verbs \"-ar / -er / ir\".\n\nAll words have accent in Galician, considering that the accent is the fact of a particular syllable carrying the most stress in a word. The \"tilde\" (\u00b4) is a small line written over some vowels to show in some cases which syllable carries the accent, \"paspall\u00e1s\" (quail), \"m\u00f3bil\" (mobile) \"c\u00e1rcere\" (jail, gaol).\n\nThe tilde has some other functions. Sometimes the tilde is written to show that there is not a diphthong among two vowels which happen to be alongside one another within the same word \"a\u00ednda\" (yet). If the tilde happens to be necessary on a capitalized letter, it must be written regardless: \"\u00d3scar\". Another use is the differentiation of meaning: there are words which can be differentiated by the presence or absence of the tilde: \"c\u00f3mpre\" (it is necessary) versus \"compre\" (buy) as in \"C\u00f3mpre que compre un reloxio\" (It's necessary that I buy a clock).\n\n== Orthography == <!-- Courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[Galician alphabet]] redirects here -->\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe current official Galician orthography is guided by the \"Normas ortogr\u00e1ficas e morfol\u00f3xicas do Idioma Galego\"<ref>{{Citation |title=Normas ortogr\u00e1ficas e morfol\u00f3xicas do idioma galego |date=March 2012 |url=https://academia.gal/documents/10157/704901/Normas+ortogr%C3%A1ficas+e+morfol%C3%B3xicas+do+idioma+galego.pdf |edition=23rd}}</ref> (NOMIGa), first introduced in 1982, by the Royal Galician Academy (RAG), based on a report by the Instituto da Lingua Galega (ILG). These norms were not accepted by some sectors desiring a norm closer to modern Portuguese (see [[reintegrationism]]). In July 2003, the Royal Galician Academy modified the language normative to admit and promote some archaic Galician-Portuguese forms conserved in modern Portuguese, merging the NOMIG and the main proposals of the moderate sectors of reintegrationism; the resulting orthography is used by the vast majority of media, cultural production and virtually all official matters including education. \n\nThere still exists a minoritary reintegrationist movement that opts for the use of writing systems that range from adapted to whole Portuguese orthography.\n\n=== Examples ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!
