Certainly in the 700s there was a [[Viking]] town there. Recent research has dated the building of the first city wall to 934. Aarhus must have been a town of some importance in the [[Viking Age]], as there are six [[Rune stone|runestones]] in or near the city. The name is known as Aros, Arus, Aarhus or Aars, as early as the 15th century. The city's charter of 1449 names it \"Aarss\". After the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]], the name \"Aarhus\" became current.\n\nAarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a [[Lumber|timber]] structure, was built during the reign of [[Frode]] King of Jutland around year 900 on top of the city's [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] in what was then the center of town.<ref name=VIKINGAROS>Damm, Annette. ''Viking Aros'' (2005) {{ISBN|87-87334-63-1}}.</ref> The first [[bishop]] was [[Reginbrand]], a [[missionary]] bishop of Aros in 948 under the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg]]. Aros came under the rule of the Archbishop of [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] in 1060. According to [[Adam of Bremen]], Aros was made a dependent [[diocese]] before 998.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16001a.htm  |title= Ancient See of Aarhus in Denmark|publisher =   New Advent|author=  Kevin Knight \n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/bispesaede.htm  |title= Reginbrand er navnet p\u00e5 \u00c5rhus\u00b4 f\u00f8rste biskop|publisher =vikingemuseet    \n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSt. Nikolai's church was the first [[cathedral]] of Aros. The second cathedral was a timber structure built in 1102 by bishop [[Ulfketil, Bishop of Aarhus|Ulfketil]] near the present site to house the relics of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]].  St. Clement was an early Bishop of [[Rome]] who was [[martyr]]ed by having an [[anchor]] tied to his neck and thrown into the [[Black Sea]], according to a fictional biography of the saint.  Clement was the patron saint of [[sailor]]s and especially popular in [[Scandinavia]]. The first St. Clement's church burned at some point before the 1190s.  \n<ref>{{cite web|url =  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Pope_St._Clement_I |title=  Pope St. Clement I|publisher =  Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis timber church was the center of the local veneration of St. [[Niels of Aarhus]] (also called St. Nickolas). St. Niels was a younger son of [[Canute V of Denmark|King Canute V]].  As a young man, Prince Niels lost interest in life at [[court]] and withdrew to the village of Skibby near Aarhus and built a church with his own hands.  He lived a [[saint]]ly life and helped the people in the area around Aarhus.  One day, as he and a few men from the town were felling trees to build the church at [[Viby J|Viby]] near the sea, one of the men complained that he was thirsty. St. Niels prayed for water and a spring appeared to slake the man's thirst; St. Niels's Spring has run ever since.  It has been a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of years and many miraculous healings are said to have taken place there, especially on [[Midsummer Day|St. John's Day]]. On his death bed in 1180, St. Niels asked to be buried in \"the little church by the sea\" (St. Clements). He was buried in the churchyard at St. Clements.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/dbl/12/0204.html|title= Hellig Niels|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Aarhus Cathedral===\nThe construction of Aarhus Cathedral began in the decade after year 1190, by Bishop [[Peder Vognsen]]  (d.11 April 1204) of the powerful [[Hvide]] family from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]. Bishop Vognsen built the cathedral around St. Clement's church because local people venerated St. Niels, and Vognsen wanted to harness that devotion for his cathedral. Vognsen also established the [[cathedral school]] of [[Aarhus Katedralskole]], before the cathedral was completed. The church was finished in 1300 in typical [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style with half-rounded arches supporting a flat timber ceiling.  The second St. Clements was built of large red [[brick]]s, a new building material that became popular all over Scandinavia and [[northern Germany]] for ecclesiastical and public buildings.  Four [[chapel]]s were built into the north [[transept]]. The episcopal chair was moved from Our Lady Church to St. Clements.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =   http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kirke_og_tro/Biskop/Peder_Vognsen|title= Peder Vognsen|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral altar back.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] (with paint restored in 1999), windows and the back of the [[altar]] in the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nHowever, in 1330, the cathedral and much of the town burned down, and the church was abandoned until 1449. By then the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style of architecture had reached Denmark, and the cathedral was enlarged in stages until it reached its present size in year 1500. The [[nave]] was lengthened to 93 meters, the longest in Denmark.  The transept was widened, and the typical [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] raised the ceilings and permitted high windows which fill the building with light.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed life in and around the cathedral in many significant ways. In 1524 [[Hans Tausen]] (1494\u20131561), the Danish [[Martin Luther|Luther]], taught a [[Good Friday]] sermon at Antvarskov Abbey proclaiming the doctrines of Luther.  His superior ordered him imprisoned in the [[Hospitallers]] monastery in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], Jutland.  Tausen taught from his cell and ordinary people responded with enthusiasm.  His superior tried to silence Tausen, but a near riot forced his release.  In the beginning, he was allowed to preach in the open air but his supporters broke open a [[Franciscan]] church, and soon Tausen had more followers than the church could accommodate.  Within a year, he was the king's own [[chaplain]].  Luther's ideas quickly spread to Aarhus and soon the townspeople demanded the right to hear the [[liturgy]] in Danish.  The bishop and [[Canon (priest)|canons]] attempted to stop the spread of the Lutheran doctrine in their [[diocese]], but Tausen had caught the imagination of the people and they would not be cowed by anything the bishop might threaten. Most nobles were staunchly [[Catholic]], and that brought even more support from common people.  By 1528 most of the cities had begun the process of reforming their churches. Tausen taught that tearing apart ancient churches was wrong and that orderly change should be used to reform the church.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Religion_og_mystik/Danske_folkekirke/Hans_Tausen|title=  Hans Tausen\n|publisher =  Den Store Danske, Gyldendal |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1533 [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederik I]] died and his son, [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] was proclaimed King of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (Danish: [[Thing (assembly)|''Landsting'']]), but the State Council denominated by the Catholic bishops refused to accept the election and called upon [[count]] [[Christopher of Oldenburg]] to assist in restoring Catholic Christian II to the throne. This resulted in a two-year war called the [[Count's Feud]]. Despite the odds, Christian III prevailed and in the summer of 1536 arrested several of the bishops and threw them into prison. The last Roman Catholic Bishop of Aarhus, [[Ove Bille]] (d. 1555) was imprisoned in the summer of 1536 when Denmark officially became a Lutheran nation.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kirke_og_tro/Biskop/Ove_Bille|title= Ove Bille|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe tower is the tallest in Denmark at 96 meters. It received its present form in 1931.\nIn 1642 lightning struck the tower and set it ablaze, destroying some of the historic bells, but damage to the interior of the church was minimal.\n\n== Interior ==\n[[Image:Kalkmaleri2.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval fresco in typical Danish style]]\n[[File:Skt. Georg og dragen.jpg|left|thumb|A fresco of St. George with the dragon inside the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\n===The fresco paintings and the stained glass window===\nAarhus Cathedral has a number of [[Church frescos in Denmark|fresco paintings]] dating from the 1470 to 1520.  Until the Reformation, most of the church's walls were covered in frescoes, of which many were lost. The cathedral still has 220 m<sup>2</sup> of frescoes, more than any other church in Denmark. One pre-1470 painting was saved from the first Romanesque-style cathedral in the northwest corner, the so-called ''Lazarus Window'', painted about 1300. It is believed that the window was used to give food to the [[leper]]s who weren't permitted inside the building.\n\nThe paintings of [[St Christopher]] and St Clement are the tallest in the country. Other figures include [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]] and [[St George]] with the dragon (pictured, left).\n\nSt Clements only has one [[Stained glass|stained glass window]].  It was created by  [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] artist [[Emanuel Vigeland]] (1875\u20131948) in 1926. Its theme is taken from [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]]'s [[ hymn]] ''Da livtr\u00e6et f\u00e6stet i graven rod''. It stands 14 m high and is the largest stained glass window in all of Denmark. Three scenes are painted on the window: at the bottom, Christ's lying in his grave on [[Calvary|Golgotha]]; next, Christ crucified, and topmost, Christ standing in golden light. The most unusual feature is the [[Crucifixion]] scene, which (for an unknown reason) shows Jesus's head falling to the left, unlike traditional scenes which always show Jesus's head falling to the right.\n<ref>{{cite web|url = https://nbl.snl.no/Emanuel_Vigeland|title= Emanuel Vigeland|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=  Nils Messel\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url = http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/great-danes/writers/nikolai-frederik-severin-grundtvig |title= Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig\n|publisher =   Gyldendal Leksikon|author=  Flemming Lundgreen-Nielsen |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Altertavle-domkirken.jpg|thumb|left|Altar by [[Bernt Notke]]]]\n\n===The altar===\nThe cathedral has a wonderful altar piece (pictured, left) carved by the famous [[L\u00fcbeck]] sculptor and painter [[Bernt Notke]]) (c. 1440\u2013c. 1509).

It was a gift of Bishop Jens Ivarsen Lange,  (d. 1482) who just two years earlier had given the great altar piece to St Clements.  The font stands on the heads of the [[four evangelists]] in human form, but with the heads of the animals that often symbolize the four [[gospel]]s in ecclesiastic art: [[John the Evangelist|John]] is [[eagle]]-headed, [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] is [[lion]]-headed, [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] bears the head of an [[ox]], while [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] alone has the head of a man.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/dbl/10/0030.html|title= Lange, Jens Iversen, \u20131482, Biskop|publisher =   \tDansk biografisk Lexikon\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe font has four scenes, carved in relief, from the life of [[Christ]] and nine of the [[twelve apostles|apostles]] (the rest of the figures cannot be identified). The scenes are the [[Baptism#Baptism_of_Jesus|Baptism]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], Christ on [[Last Judgment|Judgement Day]], and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary's]] heavenly coronation.\n\nFor the first hundred years the font was open and the priest dipped the child three times; later there were added a [[brass]] top and a [[silver]] tray used for the baptism of children, which is now over 300 years old.<ref name=DOMKIRKE />\n\n===Golden gates, the bells and the model ship===\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral golden gate.jpg|right|thumb|One of the golden gates inside the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nThe \"Golden Door\" is one of five wrought [[iron]] gates that separate the nave from the [[choir (architecture)|choir]], a reminder of the separation between the clergy and public in Catholic times.

Frichs bell.\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Domkirke ship.jpg|left|thumb|A model [[ship]] exhibited inside the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nAs is the custom in many parts of Denmark, a [[ship]] hangs at the crossing as a reminder of those lost at sea and of Denmark's close connection to the sea (pictured, left).  The cathedral's ship (dated 1720) is named ''Enigheden'' (lit. English ''Unity'') and it might have been built in Holland: the [[Russians|Russian]] [[tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] ordered war ships from ship builders in Holland; instead of sketches, he was offered a model of the upcoming ship, which was sent by sea to [[Russia]]. A storm sank the transport by [[Skagen]], and the model made it to shore almost intact. Some fishermen from Aarhus bought the model, and subsequently offered it as a [[votive offering|votive gift]] to the Aarhus Domkirke.\n\nWith the model ship's length of 2.65 m and height of 3.50 m, it is the largest church ship in any Danish church, and it is thought of as a symbol of man's sail from [[Bassinet|cradle]] to [[grave (burial)|grave]].<ref name=DOMKIRKE />\n\n===Tombs and memorials===\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral tomb.jpg|right|thumb|A memorial plaque (dated 1587) above a tomb of a noble woman in the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral donation.jpg|right|thumb|A memorial plaque (in [[Danish language|Danish]]) remembering a donation of 100 [[Thaler]]s left to the cathedral in 1702 by an elderly married couple]]\nThe crypt of the cathedral houses the remains of thousands of people of all ranks.\nThe church has several chapels and [[tomb]]s (in both Romanesque and Baroque styles), and a number of [[memorials]].

It has been restored, enlarged, and updated several times, but the [[baroque]] facade has been maintained.

Certainly in the 700s there was a [[Viking]] town there. Recent research has dated the building of the first city wall to 934. Aarhus must have been a town of some importance in the [[Viking Age]], as there are six [[Rune stone|runestones]] in or near the city. The name is known as Aros, Arus, Aarhus or Aars, as early as the 15th century. The city's charter of 1449 names it \"Aarss\". After the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]], the name \"Aarhus\" became current.\n\nAarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a [[Lumber|timber]] structure, was built during the reign of [[Frode]] King of Jutland around year 900 on top of the city's [[Germanic paganism|pagan burial site]] in what was then the center of town.<ref name=VIKINGAROS>Damm, Annette. ''Viking Aros'' (2005) {{ISBN|87-87334-63-1}}.</ref> The first [[bishop]] was [[Reginbrand]], a [[missionary]] bishop of Aros in 948 under the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg]]. Aros came under the rule of the Archbishop of [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] in 1060. According to [[Adam of Bremen]], Aros was made a dependent [[diocese]] before 998.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16001a.htm  |title= Ancient See of Aarhus in Denmark|publisher =   New Advent|author=  Kevin Knight \n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/bispesaede.htm  |title= Reginbrand er navnet p\u00e5 \u00c5rhus\u00b4 f\u00f8rste biskop|publisher =vikingemuseet    \n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSt. Nikolai's church was the first [[cathedral]] of Aros. The second cathedral was a timber structure built in 1102 by bishop [[Ulfketil, Bishop of Aarhus|Ulfketil]] near the present site to house the relics of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]].  St. Clement was an early Bishop of [[Rome]] who was [[martyr]]ed by having an [[anchor]] tied to his neck and thrown into the [[Black Sea]], according to a fictional biography of the saint.  Clement was the patron saint of [[sailor]]s and especially popular in [[Scandinavia]]. The first St. Clement's church burned at some point before the 1190s.  \n<ref>{{cite web|url =  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Pope_St._Clement_I |title=  Pope St. Clement I|publisher =  Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis timber church was the center of the local veneration of St. [[Niels of Aarhus]] (also called St. Nickolas). St. Niels was a younger son of [[Canute V of Denmark|King Canute V]].  As a young man, Prince Niels lost interest in life at [[court]] and withdrew to the village of Skibby near Aarhus and built a church with his own hands.  He lived a [[saint]]ly life and helped the people in the area around Aarhus.  One day, as he and a few men from the town were felling trees to build the church at [[Viby J|Viby]] near the sea, one of the men complained that he was thirsty. St. Niels prayed for water and a spring appeared to slake the man's thirst; St. Niels's Spring has run ever since.  It has been a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of years and many miraculous healings are said to have taken place there, especially on [[Midsummer Day|St. John's Day]]. On his death bed in 1180, St. Niels asked to be buried in \"the little church by the sea\" (St. Clements). He was buried in the churchyard at St. Clements.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/dbl/12/0204.html|title= Hellig Niels|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Aarhus Cathedral===\nThe construction of Aarhus Cathedral began in the decade after year 1190, by Bishop [[Peder Vognsen]]  (d.11 April 1204) of the powerful [[Hvide]] family from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]. Bishop Vognsen built the cathedral around St. Clement's church because local people venerated St. Niels, and Vognsen wanted to harness that devotion for his cathedral. Vognsen also established the [[cathedral school]] of [[Aarhus Katedralskole]], before the cathedral was completed. The church was finished in 1300 in typical [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style with half-rounded arches supporting a flat timber ceiling.  The second St. Clements was built of large red [[brick]]s, a new building material that became popular all over Scandinavia and [[northern Germany]] for ecclesiastical and public buildings.  Four [[chapel]]s were built into the north [[transept]]. The episcopal chair was moved from Our Lady Church to St. Clements.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =   http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kirke_og_tro/Biskop/Peder_Vognsen|title= Peder Vognsen|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral altar back.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] (with paint restored in 1999), windows and the back of the [[altar]] in the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nHowever, in 1330, the cathedral and much of the town burned down, and the church was abandoned until 1449. By then the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style of architecture had reached Denmark, and the cathedral was enlarged in stages until it reached its present size in year 1500. The [[nave]] was lengthened to 93 meters, the longest in Denmark.  The transept was widened, and the typical [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] raised the ceilings and permitted high windows which fill the building with light.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed life in and around the cathedral in many significant ways. In 1524 [[Hans Tausen]] (1494\u20131561), the Danish [[Martin Luther|Luther]], taught a [[Good Friday]] sermon at Antvarskov Abbey proclaiming the doctrines of Luther.  His superior ordered him imprisoned in the [[Hospitallers]] monastery in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], Jutland.  Tausen taught from his cell and ordinary people responded with enthusiasm.  His superior tried to silence Tausen, but a near riot forced his release.  In the beginning, he was allowed to preach in the open air but his supporters broke open a [[Franciscan]] church, and soon Tausen had more followers than the church could accommodate.  Within a year, he was the king's own [[chaplain]].  Luther's ideas quickly spread to Aarhus and soon the townspeople demanded the right to hear the [[liturgy]] in Danish.  The bishop and [[Canon (priest)|canons]] attempted to stop the spread of the Lutheran doctrine in their [[diocese]], but Tausen had caught the imagination of the people and they would not be cowed by anything the bishop might threaten. Most nobles were staunchly [[Catholic]], and that brought even more support from common people.  By 1528 most of the cities had begun the process of reforming their churches. Tausen taught that tearing apart ancient churches was wrong and that orderly change should be used to reform the church.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Religion_og_mystik/Danske_folkekirke/Hans_Tausen|title=  Hans Tausen\n|publisher =  Den Store Danske, Gyldendal |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1533 [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederik I]] died and his son, [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] was proclaimed King of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (Danish: [[Thing (assembly)|''Landsting'']]), but the State Council denominated by the Catholic bishops refused to accept the election and called upon [[count]] [[Christopher of Oldenburg]] to assist in restoring Catholic Christian II to the throne. This resulted in a two-year war called the [[Count's Feud]]. Despite the odds, Christian III prevailed and in the summer of 1536 arrested several of the bishops and threw them into prison. The last Roman Catholic Bishop of Aarhus, [[Ove Bille]] (d. 1555) was imprisoned in the summer of 1536 when Denmark officially became a Lutheran nation.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kirke_og_tro/Biskop/Ove_Bille|title= Ove Bille|publisher =   Dansk Biografisk Leksikon\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe tower is the tallest in Denmark at 96 meters. It received its present form in 1931.\nIn 1642 lightning struck the tower and set it ablaze, destroying some of the historic bells, but damage to the interior of the church was minimal.\n\n== Interior ==\n[[Image:Kalkmaleri2.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval fresco in typical Danish style]]\n[[File:Skt. Georg og dragen.jpg|left|thumb|A fresco of St. George with the dragon inside the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\n===The fresco paintings and the stained glass window===\nAarhus Cathedral has a number of [[Church frescos in Denmark|fresco paintings]] dating from the 1470 to 1520.  Until the Reformation, most of the church's walls were covered in frescoes, of which many were lost. The cathedral still has 220 m<sup>2</sup> of frescoes, more than any other church in Denmark. One pre-1470 painting was saved from the first Romanesque-style cathedral in the northwest corner, the so-called ''Lazarus Window'', painted about 1300. It is believed that the window was used to give food to the [[leper]]s who weren't permitted inside the building.\n\nThe paintings of [[St Christopher]] and St Clement are the tallest in the country. Other figures include [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]] and [[St George]] with the dragon (pictured, left).\n\nSt Clements only has one [[Stained glass|stained glass window]].  It was created by  [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] artist [[Emanuel Vigeland]] (1875\u20131948) in 1926. Its theme is taken from [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]]'s [[ hymn]] ''Da livtr\u00e6et f\u00e6stet i graven rod''. It stands 14 m high and is the largest stained glass window in all of Denmark. Three scenes are painted on the window: at the bottom, Christ's lying in his grave on [[Calvary|Golgotha]]; next, Christ crucified, and topmost, Christ standing in golden light. The most unusual feature is the [[Crucifixion]] scene, which (for an unknown reason) shows Jesus's head falling to the left, unlike traditional scenes which always show Jesus's head falling to the right.\n<ref>{{cite web|url = https://nbl.snl.no/Emanuel_Vigeland|title= Emanuel Vigeland|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=  Nils Messel\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url = http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/great-danes/writers/nikolai-frederik-severin-grundtvig |title= Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig\n|publisher =   Gyldendal Leksikon|author=  Flemming Lundgreen-Nielsen |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Altertavle-domkirken.jpg|thumb|left|Altar by [[Bernt Notke]]]]\n\n===The altar===\nThe cathedral has a wonderful altar piece (pictured, left) carved by the famous [[L\u00fcbeck]] sculptor and painter [[Bernt Notke]]) (c. 1440\u2013c. 1509).

It was a gift of Bishop Jens Ivarsen Lange,  (d. 1482) who just two years earlier had given the great altar piece to St Clements.  The font stands on the heads of the [[four evangelists]] in human form, but with the heads of the animals that often symbolize the four [[gospel]]s in ecclesiastic art: [[John the Evangelist|John]] is [[eagle]]-headed, [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] is [[lion]]-headed, [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] bears the head of an [[ox]], while [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] alone has the head of a man.\n<ref>{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/dbl/10/0030.html|title= Lange, Jens Iversen, \u20131482, Biskop|publisher =   \tDansk biografisk Lexikon\n|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe font has four scenes, carved in relief, from the life of [[Christ]] and nine of the [[twelve apostles|apostles]] (the rest of the figures cannot be identified).

Frichs bell.\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Domkirke ship.jpg|left|thumb|A model [[ship]] exhibited inside the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n\nAs is the custom in many parts of Denmark, a [[ship]] hangs at the crossing as a reminder of those lost at sea and of Denmark's close connection to the sea (pictured, left).  The cathedral's ship (dated 1720) is named ''Enigheden'' (lit. English ''Unity'') and it might have been built in Holland: the [[Russians|Russian]] [[tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] ordered war ships from ship builders in Holland; instead of sketches, he was offered a model of the upcoming ship, which was sent by sea to [[Russia]]. A storm sank the transport by [[Skagen]], and the model made it to shore almost intact. Some fishermen from Aarhus bought the model, and subsequently offered it as a [[votive offering|votive gift]] to the Aarhus Domkirke.\n\nWith the model ship's length of 2.65 m and height of 3.50 m, it is the largest church ship in any Danish church, and it is thought of as a symbol of man's sail from [[Bassinet|cradle]] to [[grave (burial)|grave]].<ref name=DOMKIRKE />\n\n===Tombs and memorials===\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral tomb.jpg|right|thumb|A memorial plaque (dated 1587) above a tomb of a noble woman in the Aarhus Cathedral]]\n[[Image:Aarhus Cathedral donation.jpg|right|thumb|A memorial plaque (in [[Danish language|Danish]]) remembering a donation of 100 [[Thaler]]s left to the cathedral in 1702 by an elderly married couple]]\nThe crypt of the cathedral houses the remains of thousands of people of all ranks.\nThe church has several chapels and [[tomb]]s (in both Romanesque and Baroque styles), and a number of [[memorials]].

It has been restored, enlarged, and updated several times, but the [[baroque]] facade has been maintained.
