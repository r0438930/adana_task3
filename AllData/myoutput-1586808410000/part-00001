It is the fifth installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. ''Final Destination 5'' stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]], and [[Tony Todd]].\n\nDespite ''[[The Final Destination]]'' being originally announced as the final film in the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on [[DVD]] on December 27, 2011.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews; this is the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise.\n\n==Plot==\nSam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it actually does collapse, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \"Death doesn't like to be cheated\", and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.\n\nLater, Candice goes to the gym to practice, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below, popping her eyeball out of its socket, causing it to roll away. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.\n\nThat evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe that he claimed Block's life.\n\nTwo weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, they notice [[Final Destination (film)|a couple passengers being removed from the plane]] with one of them, [[Alex Browning]], warning the other passengers still in the plane to get off. This reveals that the plane they are on is Vol\u00e9e Airlines  [[Boeing 747]] Flight 180 from [[Final Destination (film)|the first film]]. Sam and Molly are confused but take their seats nonetheless. When the lights dim for take off, Sam looks at his plane ticket, dated May 13, 2000, revealing that the previous events took place in April. Upon takeoff, Sam gets the same signs that he got on the bridge collapse and overhears from an airhostess telling another passenger that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction and realizes it is too late for him to leave, and both he and Molly perish in the explosion that follows. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns that Roy had a [[Intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] that was close to bursting, and was due to die \"any day now.\" As Nathan realizes he is still in danger, the landing gear from the plane breaks through the roof and crushes Nathan, setting off the events of the [[Final Destination|first four films]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Final Destination characters}}\n[[File:Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, Tony Todd on Dulce Osuna for Final Destination 5.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Tony Todd]] interviewed by Dulce Osuna about ''Final Destination 5'']]\n[[File:P.

It is the fifth installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. ''Final Destination 5'' stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]], and [[Tony Todd]].\n\nDespite ''[[The Final Destination]]'' being originally announced as the final film in the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on [[DVD]] on December 27, 2011.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews; this is the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise.\n\n==Plot==\nSam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it actually does collapse, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \"Death doesn't like to be cheated\", and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.\n\nLater, Candice goes to the gym to practice, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below, popping her eyeball out of its socket, causing it to roll away. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.\n\nThat evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe that he claimed Block's life.\n\nTwo weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, they notice [[Final Destination (film)|a couple passengers being removed from the plane]] with one of them, [[Alex Browning]], warning the other passengers still in the plane to get off. This reveals that the plane they are on is Vol\u00e9e Airlines  [[Boeing 747]] Flight 180 from [[Final Destination (film)|the first film]]. Sam and Molly are confused but take their seats nonetheless. When the lights dim for take off, Sam looks at his plane ticket, dated May 13, 2000, revealing that the previous events took place in April. Upon takeoff, Sam gets the same signs that he got on the bridge collapse and overhears from an airhostess telling another passenger that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction and realizes it is too late for him to leave, and both he and Molly perish in the explosion that follows. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns that Roy had a [[Intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] that was close to bursting, and was due to die \"any day now.\" As Nathan realizes he is still in danger, the landing gear from the plane breaks through the roof and crushes Nathan, setting off the events of the [[Final Destination|first four films]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Final Destination characters}}\n[[File:Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, Tony Todd on Dulce Osuna for Final Destination 5.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Tony Todd]] interviewed by Dulce Osuna about ''Final Destination 5'']]\n[[File:P.
