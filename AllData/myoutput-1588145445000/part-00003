In these, Arctic species of fish survived, due often to the sheer depth of the lakes and the colder temperatures. For the young endemic fish varieties of the British Isles, it is usually controversial whether they should be considered as distinct taxa (species or [[subspecies]]) or just as isolated populations of their ancestral species.\n\nAs global warming affects the British climate there is some concern for these species, some confined to a handful of lakes. Action has been taken to protect them, as is the case with [[Coregonus vandesius|vendace]] which has been moved to [[Tarn (lake)|tarns]] in nearby mountains due to the cooler temperatures.

A few Arctic-Alpine species have subspecies in the British Isles, some have been in the islands since the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last Ice Age]], but many spread in the immediate [[Sub-Arctic]] conditions as the ice retreated.\nFurther more these species were latter reinforced by newer arrivals as the climate assumed temperatures and conditions more similar to the present day.\n\n[[Image:MotacillaAlbaDistribution.svg|right|thumb|Distribution of [[white wagtail]] subspecies, with British [[pied wagtail]] (Motacillia alba yarellii) highlighted in blue.]]\n\n*[[Red grouse]] \u2013 classified either as a distinct species or a subspecies of [[willow grouse]] \u2013 doesn't change plumage in winter as willow grouse does \u2013 Upland and Moorland areas of Great Britain and Ireland.\n*[[Pied wagtail#Subspecies|Pied wagtail]] \u2013 British subspecies of the [[Pied wagtail|pied / white wagtail]]\u2013throughout British Isles.\n*[[Troglodytes troglodytes zetlandicus|Shetland wren]] \u2013 [[Shetland Islands]], [[Scotland]] only.\n*[[Fair Isle wren]] \u2013 [[Fair Isle]], [[Scotland]] only.\n*[[St Kilda wren]] \u2013 [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] Islands, [[Scotland]] only.\n*[[Scottish crossbill]] \u2013 Highlands, [[Scotland]] only.\n*British Isles subspecies of [[White-throated dipper#Taxonomy|white-throated dipper]]\n\n==Mammals==\n\nBritain has a few subspecies of mammals but no endemic species.

In these, Arctic species of fish survived, due often to the sheer depth of the lakes and the colder temperatures. For the young endemic fish varieties of the British Isles, it is usually controversial whether they should be considered as distinct taxa (species or [[subspecies]]) or just as isolated populations of their ancestral species.\n\nAs global warming affects the British climate there is some concern for these species, some confined to a handful of lakes. Action has been taken to protect them, as is the case with [[Coregonus vandesius|vendace]] which has been moved to [[Tarn (lake)|tarns]] in nearby mountains due to the cooler temperatures. It is hoped that these will act as refuges should the species die-out in the lower-level lakes where they occur naturally.\n*[[Killarney shad]] (''Alosa killarnensis'')  \u2013 [[Ireland]] only.\n*[[Gwyniad]] (''Coregonus pennantii'') \u2013 [[Snowdonia]] only.\n*[[Schelly]] (''Coregonus stigmaticus'') \u2013 [[Lake District]] only.\n*[[Coregonus vandesius|Vendace]] (''Coregonus vandesius'') \u2013 Lake District and [[Dumfries and Galloway]] only.\n*[[Pollan (fish)|Pollan]] (''Coregonus pollan'') \u2013 Ireland only.\n*[[Powan]] (''Coregonus clupeoides'') \u2013 [[Scotland]] only.\n*[[Ferox trout]] (''Salmo ferox'') \u2013 Ireland, Scotland, [[Cumbria]] and [[Wales]] only, validity questionable (possibly a [[brown trout]] variant)\n*[[Gillaroo]] (''Salmo stomachicus'') \u2013 Ireland only\n*[[Salmo nigripinnis|Sonaghan]] (''Salmo nigripinnis'') \u2013 Ireland only\n*[[Haddy charr]] (''Salvelinus killinensis'') \u2013 Scotland only\n*''[[Salvelinus colii]]''  \u2013 [[Republic of Ireland]] only\n*''[[Salvelinus fimbriatus]]'' \u2013 Republic of Ireland only\n*''[[Salvelinus gracillimus]]'' \u2013 [[Shetland Islands]] and perhaps Scotland\n*[[Salvelinus grayi|Melvin charr]] (''Salvelinus grayi'') \u2013 Ireland only\n*[[Orkney charr]] (''Salvelinus inframundus'') \u2013 [[Orkney Islands]] (where [[Local extinction|extirpated]]) and Scotland only\n*''[[Salvelinus lonsdalii]]'' \u2013 Cumbria only\n*''[[Salvelinus mallochi]]'' \u2013 Scotland only\n*''[[Salvelinus maxillaris]]'' \u2013 Scotland only\n*''[[Salvelinus obtusus]]'' \u2013 Republic of Ireland only\n*''[[Salvelinus perisii]]'' \u2013 Wales only\n*''[[Salvelinus struanensis]]'' \u2013 Scotland only\n*[[Salvelinus youngeri|Golden charr]] (''Salvelinus youngeri'') \u2013 Scotland only\n*''[[Salvelinus willughbii]]'' \u2013 Cumbria only\n\n==Extinct==\n{{Expand section|this article as it requires expansion.|date=September 2011}}\n\n*Presumed British subspecies of [[grey wolf]]\n*[[Essex emerald moth]] (British subspecies)\n*[[St Kilda house mouse]]\n*[[Lycaena dispar dispar]]\n*[[Hieracium cambricogothicum]]\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe distribution of endemic species seems to have a North Western bias and with endemic species on the whole showing an oceanic / alpine distribution with most endemics being found in upland areas or islands.\n\n==Endemic livestock breeds==\n{{See also|Rare Breeds Survival Trust}}\nHuman bred-animals are not usually classified as distinct subspecies but rather breeds which is a similar concept.
