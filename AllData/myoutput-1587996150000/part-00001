The portrayal of women in games often reflects traditional [[gender role]]s, [[sexual objectification]], or stereotypes such as that of the \"[[damsel in distress]]\". Male characters are often stereotypically depicted as big and muscular, and [[LGBT]] characters have been slow to appear in video games as a result of the [[heteronormativity]] of the medium. Women have a major role of being cast as supporting characters because of gamer preferences and sales.\n\nResearch indicates that how genders are portrayed in games can influence players' perception of gender roles, and that young girls prefer to play a character of their own gender much more than boys do. On average, female-led games sell fewer copies than male-led ones, but also have lower marketing budgets.\n\n== Gamer demographics ==\n{{Main|Women and video games#Demographics of female players}}\n[[File:Girl plays Pac Man.JPG|thumb|A young girl playing ''[[Pac-Man Championship Edition]]'']]\n\nA 2008 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll indicated that men and women each make up half of all American video game players.<ref>{{cite book| url = | title = Using Storytelling to Introduce Girls to Computer Programming| last = Kelleher| first = Caitlin| date = 2008| work = Beyond Barbie & Mortal Kombat: New Perspectives on Gender and Gaming| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-11319-9| editor-last = Kafai| editor-first = Yasmin B.| page = 247| editor-last2 = Heeter| editor-first2 = Carrie| editor-last3 = Sun| editor-first3 = Jennifer Y.| accessdate = }}</ref> In 2014 in the UK and in Spain, women comprised 52% and 48% of video game players respectively.<ref name=PlayGround>{{cite web|title=Ellas tambi\u00e9n juegan, o por qu\u00e9 el machismo gamer no tiene ning\u00fan sentido|author=Natxo Medina|url=http://www.playgroundmag.net/articulos/reportajes/videojuegos-mujeres-gamer-feminismo_0_1396060382.html|accessdate=2014-09-29|date=2014-09-24}}</ref> According to a 2008 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], \"Fully 99% of boys and 94% of girls play videogames.\"<ref name=Lenhart>Lenhart, Amanda, Joseph Kahne, Ellen Middaugh, Alexandra Macgill, Chris Evans, and Jessica Vitak. \"Teens, Video Games and Civics.\" Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech.
