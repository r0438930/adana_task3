In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant. Some of Shivaji's ministers such as Annaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand and other conspirators were executed on charges of conspiracy and treason.<ref name=\"Mehta2005\"/>{{rp|48}}<ref name=\"SharmaL\u0101\u02bcibrer\u012b2004\">{{cite book|author1=Sunita Sharma|author2=K\u0332h\u0332ud\u0101 Bak\u0332h\u0332sh Oriyan\u1e6dal Pablik L\u0101\u02bcibrer\u012b|title=Veil, sceptre, and quill: profiles of eminent women, 16th- 18th centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2kaAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=30 September 2012|year=2004|publisher=Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library|page=139}} \u2013 ''By June 1680 three months after Shivaji's death Rajaram was made a prisoner in the fort of [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]].\"</ref> Sambhaji arrived at Raigad and put Soyarabai and Rajaram under house arrest.
