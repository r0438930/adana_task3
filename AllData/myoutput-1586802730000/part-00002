Magazines also cannot be accepted, as only a select few have access to episode information before their official release date. Also, do not change the Japanese names to their English translations '''UNTIL''' they have finished airing in an English speaking nation in the English dub. Being just \"close\" to airing in English is not enough; they must actually air beforehand in whatever timezone is the country of the original English airing - in the U.S. in most cases, episodes generally air in the Saturday morning time slot starting 9:00 Am - 9:30 AM EST/EDT or on Saturday evening 6:00 pm - 6:30pm EST/EDT, although there can be unique time slots. To comply with WP:CRYSTAL, you must cite a source for future air dates - only remove the citation once the episode has actually aired in the United States, and the fact that there is \"usually\" a weekly airing schedule when Pok\u00e9mon airs on Disney XD is also unreliable as other programs can be aired on the network in place of Pok\u00e9mon's time slot, delaying new English episodes by a week. Also, do not re-add or remove hidden titles before the announcement date; do not used Wikia such as fake release date are not followed scheduled.
