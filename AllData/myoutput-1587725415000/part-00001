Elves generally used straight swords while Orcs generally used curved swords. Both races have exceptions: Egalmoth of [[Gondolin]] used a curved sword and the [[Uruk-hai]] of [[Isengard]] used short, broad blades. Tolkien often mentions the use of shields together with (one-handed) swords.<ref name=\"piela\"/>\n\nIn ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy most Elvish swords are curved but some named swords are interpreted as two-handed [[longsword]]s. The films also embellished upon Tolkien's descriptions of swords (and other weapons) by making up inscriptions for these items.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n===Knives===\nKnives are mentioned in Tolkien's works, sometimes as backup weapons\u2014such as the nondescript long knife of [[Legolas]] the archer.<ref name=\"piela\"/> However, some individual knives are given more significance through naming (e.g. [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], see below).<ref name=\"burdge\"/> Weapons that were only knives or short swords for adult [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] or [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] could function as formidable swords in the hands of [[Hobbits]], a diminutive people.\n\nIn \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\", [[Saruman]] attempts to stab Frodo with a knife, but is foiled by [[Mithril#The mithril-coat|the mithril shirt]] Frodo wore under his jacket. Shortly afterwards Saruman's throat was fatally cut with a knife born by [[Wormtongue]].\n\nFor ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, some characters such as [[Aragorn]] was gifted with an Elven hunting knife which he retained well towards the Battle of the Black Gate. [[Boromir]]'s costume design included [[throwing knives]], and Legolas now possessed twin fighting knives carried in sheaths near his quiver.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n====Special unnamed knives====\nThere are some knives in Tolkien's fiction which do not have proper formal names, but nevertheless play important roles in the plot.\n\n=====Morgul-blades=====\n{{anchor|Morgul-blade}}\nThe [[Witch-king of Angmar]], leader of the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], used a magical [[dagger]] called a \"[[Minas Morgul|Morgul]]-blade\" to wound [[Frodo Baggins]] at [[Weathertop]]. The dark magic of the knife gravely affects Frodo's well-being, threatening to turn him into a wraith, especially because its detachable point migrated in Frodo's body for more than two weeks before it could be extracted, thus causing great damage. Recurring ill effects from the wound contribute to Frodo's eventual departure to [[Valinor]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', p. 208, 210; ''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 333</ref> The weapon may owe something to the Old English tradition of the \"[[elf-shot]]\". The term appears in Old English medical texts and charms and refers to illnesses of presumed supernatural origin.<ref name=\"morgul\">{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]|editor1-first=Michael|editor1-last=Drout|editor1-link=Michael Drout|chapter=Elf-shot|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-96942-0}}</ref>\n\n=====Barrow-blades=====\nFour magical daggers, which had been forged by the Men of [[N\u00famenor|Westernesse]] to fight the powers of [[Mordor]], are recovered from a tomb in the [[Barrow-downs]] by [[Tom Bombadil]]. He gives them to [[Frodo Baggins]] and his Hobbit companions, for whom the daggers are effectively swords. One of these \"Barrow-blades\" \u2013 that given to [[Merry Brandybuck]] \u2013 proves instrumental in bringing about the death of the [[Witch-king]].<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"The [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]\", p. 117: \"No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will.\"</ref>\n\nThe three other daggers had varying fates in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. When the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] attacked [[Aragorn]] and the hobbits on [[Weathertop]], Frodo slashed at one of them with his dagger but only damaged its cloak. He broke the blade when he fell from a horse, and left it behind in Rivendell, taking Bilbo's sword Sting instead. [[Sam Gamgee]] left his beside Frodo in [[Cirith Ungol]] and later had it returned to him by [[Gandalf]]. [[Pippin Took]] made use of his dagger in the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] to slay a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]]-chief.\n\n===Axes===\n[[Battle axe]]s are especially favoured by [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] in Tolkien's writings;<ref name=\"piela\"/> they famously used the [[battle cry]]: ''Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!'' ([[Khuzdul]]: ''Baruk Khaz\u00e2d! Khaz\u00e2d ai-m\u00eanu!'').<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"The Battle of Helm's Deep\"</ref> For ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] the Dwarf was assigned various axes of different makes during the course of the films.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nThe use of battle axes in other races tended to be more exceptional. The Sindarin Elves of [[Doriath]] favoured axes as weapons during the [[First Age]]. Other notable axe-bearers were [[Tuor]] (the wielder of [[#Dramboleg|Dramborleg]]), the [[White Mountains (Middle-earth)#Peoples and history|Men of the White Mountains]] who marched to the defence of [[Minas Tirith]] in ''The Lord of the Rings'', and a contingent of [[Easterlings#\"Easterlings with axes\"|Easterlings]] among the besiegers of Minas Tirith.\n\n===Bows and arrows===\n[[Bow and arrow|Bow]]s of different sizes and construction are featured in Tolkien's works. [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], and [[Uruk-hai]] used [[longbow]]s, while Elves of [[Mirkwood]] and [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] of [[Mordor]] used smaller ones. These bows are said to be made of wood, horn and even steel.<ref name=\"piela\"/>\n\nThe most famous bowman in Tolkien's stories of the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth is the Elf [[Beleg]]; his bow was named [[#Belthronding|Belthronding]], and his arrow [[#Dailir|Dailir]]. Infamously Curufin, a lord of the [[Noldor]], attempts to shoot the Elf-princess [[L\u00fathien]] with the bow of his brother [[Celegorm]]. His first arrow is intercepted by [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]; [[Beren]] attempts to intercept the second shot, and is wounded.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'' ch. 19 \"Of Beren and Luthien\" p.177; {{ISBN|0 04 823139 8}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in the late [[Third Age]], a bow is the main weapon of [[Legolas]], the Elf-member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. When the Fellowship meet [[Galadriel]], she gives Legolas a new bow. He later uses it to shoot all the way across the great river [[Anduin]] and bring down an airborne [[Nazg\u00fbl]].\n\n[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The films of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] assign a bow to [[Aragorn]] and [[crossbow]]s to the Uruk-hai. However, in Tolkien's writings Aragorn is armed only with the sword [[And\u00faril]] (below), and crossbows are nowhere mentioned.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nSometimes individual [[arrow]]s are given special mention in Tolkien's works. In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the ''[[#Black Arrow|Black Arrow]]'' was a royal heirloom used by [[Bard the Bowman]] to kill the dragon [[Smaug]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]''</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'', the [[Red Arrow (Middle-earth)|''Red Arrow'']] was a token used by [[Gondor]] to summon its allies in time of need.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 72; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 364, 411</ref> In the '' Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, the Red Arrow is omitted and its role is conflated with the [[Beacons of Gondor]].<ref name=\"timmons\">{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R.

As with other items of war, Elves and Dwarves produced the best armour. [[Mithril#The mithril-coat|The mail shirt]] forged by Dwarves from the fictional metal ''[[mithril]]'' appears in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', worn in turn by the protagonists [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and Frodo Baggins.<ref name=\"piela\"/><ref name=\"mithril\" group=T>{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R.

The [[Rohirrim]] were partly modeled on the [[Anglo-Saxons]], who wore [[Weaponry in Anglo-Saxon England|elaborate helmets]]; [[\u00c9omer]]'s helmet had a long white horse-tail. The Crown of Gondor was a jewelled battle-helmet; [[Aragorn]] received it at his coronation. [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Sam Gamgee]] use [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-helmets as part of their disguise in [[Mordor]].\n\nIn the [[First Age]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] made dragon-helms, which were said to protect against [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]]. The most famous of these was the [[#Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min|Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min]].\n\nThe [[Second Age]] was dominated by [[N\u00famenor]]. The N\u00famen\u00f3rean helmet, the '''''karma''''', reached particularly elaborate forms. Those of the [[N\u00famenor#Uinendili|Uinendili]], a guild of mariners, were \"made of overlapping plates of metal, the 'fish-crest' of leather embossed and coloured\".<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', inside rear dust-jacket</ref> Tolkien's coloured drawing of the ''karma'' of a Uinendili captain features on the cover of ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n\n==Named items==\nTolkien emulated his Northern European mythological and literary sources in creating weapons and armour with names (real examples of named weapons include [[Hrunting]] and [[N\u00e6gling]] in ''Beowulf'', [[Tyrfing]] in the ''[[Elder Edda]]'' and [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] in the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]''). The items illustrate the passage of time and the transfer of power or fate to their future bearers.<ref name=\"burdge\"/>\n\n===Named swords and knives===\n====Anglachel====\n\nAnglachel ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of the Flaming Star'') was a sword forged of [[meteoritic iron]] by E\u00f6l the Dark [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]], given to [[Thingol]] King of [[Doriath]] as a fee for leave to dwell in Nan Elmoth. It could cleave all earth-delved iron. Later wielded by [[Beleg]] Strongbow and ultimately [[T\u00farin]];<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 201-202, 206-210, 316; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 148, 419</ref><ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 226</ref><ref group=T>''The Silmarillion'', p. 225.</ref> Anglachel was reforged and renamed '''Gurthang''' ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of Death''<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. p. 443</ref>). T\u00farin used Gurthang to kill Glaurung, the Father of [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]], and later used the sword to take his own life in recompense for the accidental slaying of Beleg and the unjust slaying of Brandir. The stories endow the sword with a personality; Melian the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]] perceived malice in it as it was given to Beleg C\u00fathalion, and the elf Gwindor observed that Anglachel (so named then) seemed to mourn the death of Beleg at the hand of his friend T\u00farin by Anglachel itself. T\u00farin asked the sword whether it would slay him swiftly if he cast himself on its point, and it responded at length (the only instance of Gurthang speaking with voice). The depiction of the sword was influenced by that of the sword of the Finnish character [[Kullervo]] in the ''[[Kalevala]]''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref name=\"petty\">{{cite book |title=[[J.R.R.

[[Beren]], who had taken it from Curufin, used it to cut a magical [[Silmaril]] jewel out of [[Morgoth]]'s Iron Crown; as Beren attempted to remove another, the knife snapped.<ref name=\"burdge\" /><ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', pp. 177, 181</ref> In the earliest version of Beren's story in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', he uses an ordinary household knife; the element of Curufin's involvement in Beren's affairs came later.<ref group=T>{{ME-ref|BOLT2|\"The Tale of Tin\u00faviel}}</ref>\n\n====Anguirel====\n\nAnguirel ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of Eternity'') is the sword forged by E\u00f6l the Dark Elf, similar to Anglachel which was given to [[Thingol]] of Doriath in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. It was the mate of Anglachel, was made of the same meteoritic iron, and had the same physical properties and capabilities as Anglachel, but there is no evidence of sentience in Anguirel. Anguirel was kept by E\u00f6l until it was stolen by his son, Maeglin.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 202</ref>\n\n====Aranr\u00fath====\n\nAranr\u00fath ([[Sindarin]]: ''King's Ire''<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]''. p. 317</ref>) is the sword wielded by King [[Thingol]] of Doriath in ''The Silmarillion''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 201, 279; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 171</ref> Later the sword of the Kings of N\u00famenor.\n\n====Glamdring====\n\n[[File:Glamdring-no-bg.png|thumb|75 px|An example of the sword Glamdring forged after the description in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\nGlamdring ([[Sindarin]]: '''Foe-hammer'''<ref name=\"The Hobbit. p. 62\" group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]''. \"A Short Rest\", p. 62</ref>) is a sword in ''The Hobbit'', ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''Unfinished Tales''<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', p. 53; ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', p. 293, 324; ''[[The Two Towers]]'', p. 115; ''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 272; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 54</ref> forged in the [[First Age]] by the [[Noldor|High Elves]] of the hidden city of [[Gondolin]].

It was the mate of [[#Orcrist|Orcrist]], and like Orcrist would glow blue whenever orcs were nearby.

By the end of the [[Second Age]] Narsil was borne by [[Elendil]]; it was broken in the struggle of Elendil and [[Gil-galad]] against [[Sauron]]. [[Isildur]] used the hilt-shard to cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's hand. The shards, acquiring the additional name '''the Sword that was Broken''', remained an heirloom of Isildur's heirs throughout the [[Third Age]], and were thus inherited by [[Aragorn]]. In T. A. 3018 the sword was reforged as '''And\u00faril''' (Quenya: ''Flame of the West''<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 437</ref>).\n\nIn the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|motion picture series]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Narsil was broken into six parts (rather than two), which were kept in [[Rivendell]], and broke not when [[Elendil]] fell but rather when Isildur reached for it and Sauron stomped on it. It is also not reforged into And\u00faril until the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third film]], when [[Arwen]] persuades [[Elrond]] to have [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elven]] smiths reforge it from the shards of Narsil and bring it to Aragorn. In the book<!--LOTR is one book in three published parts-->, he actually wears the broken blade and shows it to the [[Hobbit]]s when they meet at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and its reforging prior to the departure of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] is a decisive move toward kingship.\n\nThe incident involving Aragorn disarming reluctantly before entering King [[Th\u00e9oden]]'s palace [[Meduseld]] is omitted from the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|second film]] on the grounds that the sword he surrenders there is not And\u00faril. However, the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|first film]] does include an invented scene of Aragorn reverently placing the hilt of Narsil back into the display after [[Boromir]] knocks it from its podium onto the floor.\n\nIn the ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship of the Ring]]''<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book II, Chapter III, \"The RIng Goes South\"</ref> And\u00faril is described as a [[Longsword|long sword]], and Boromir's sword is like And\u00faril but of less lineage. And in the [[The Return of the King|Return of the King]] And\u00faril is described as a great sword (a longsword) when seen on Aragorn's lap by Frodo at the Field of Cormallen,<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Book VI, Chapter IV, \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref> In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Aragorn obtains a shield from [[Th\u00e9oden]]'s armoury during the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. However it is never explicitly stated (nor is it impossible to use a long sword with a shield) that he uses the shield he received, and it is never referenced again (but the mail he received is), and it is quite likely that he intended to use the shield in his off-hand while mounted since a sword long or short can only be used in one-hand while mounted, but a shield may still be used in the off-hand while holding the reins of a horse, and as the host of Th\u00e9oden rode out from Edoras with the intention of engaging the hordes of Isengard in open battle the lack of a shield being mentioned could be explained by the changed course to Helm's Deep, this would explain why no reference to the shield is made, while many other shields most notably Th\u00e9oden's Golden shield are mentioned. The idea that technology in Middle-Earth is the same as [[Dark Age]] Europe is often misinterpreted from an incomplete understanding of letter 211 in which Tolkien compared the clothing of the Rohirrim and only the Rohirrim to the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], but he viewed the knights and general technology of his story to be Arthurian (e.g. long swords, chain mail, great shields, spears, longbows, [[vambrace]]s, greaves).<ref name=\"Tolkien Bayeux\" group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', p. 295 \"The Rohirrim were not 'mediaeval', in our sense. The styles of the Bayeux Tapestry (made in England) fit them well enough, if one remembers that the kind of tennis-nets [the] soldiers seem to have on are only a clumsy conventional sign for chainmail of small rings\"</ref> Technology works backwards in Middle-Earth with the First Age being the time of the most skilled and incredible creations in crafting, and the later Ages being periods of decline eventually leading to the Last Battle and the breaking of the World eventually leading to our world, and would suggest that And\u00faril was depicted correctly as a long sword in the ''Lord of the Rings'' motion picture series. \n\nThe filmmakers opted not to make And\u00faril glow at all, keeping that property only for [[#Sting|Sting]]. ([[Gandalf]]'s sword [[#Glamdring|Glamdring]] also did not glow in the presence of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]]. Peter Jackson notes, in his DVD commentary on ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', that this was an oversight, not a deliberate change from the books.) The filmmakers had Anduril made with runes engraved on the blade of the sword that read as \"''Anar N\u00e1ny\u00eb And\u00faril i n\u00e9 Narsil i macil Elendilo. Lercuvanten i m\u00f3li Mord\u00f3r\u00ebo. Isil''\" (Quenya. 'Sun. I am And\u00faril who once was Narsil, sword of Elendil. The slaves of Mordor shall flee from me. Moon.'), and another inscription on the hilt ''Narsil essenya, macil meletya; Telchar carn\u00e9ron N\u00e1varotesse'' (Quenya. Narsil is my name, a mighty sword; Telchar made me in Nogrod)\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] suggested that Narsil was introduced during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' rather spontaneously: \"It is possible that the Sword that was Broken actually emerged from the verse '[[All that is Gold Does Not Glitter|All that is gold does not glitter]]': on this view, in the earliest form of the verse ... the words ''a king may yet be without crown, A blade that was broken be brandished'' were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral [that not everything is what it appears to be].\"<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', p. 137</ref> Following this, references to the Sword were introduced during major recastings of \"At the Sign of the [[Prancing Pony]]\" and \"The [[Council of Elrond]]\" chapters.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', pp. 77-80, 120.</ref>\n\nOriginally the sword was only referred to as \"the Sword of Elendil\" or \"the Broken Sword\"; later the name '''''Branding''''' (from [[Old English]] ''brand'' 'sword') was devised for the Sword Reforged.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', p. 290</ref> This was replaced by ''And\u00faril'' after the emergence of ''Narsil''.\n\n====Orcrist====\nOrcrist ([[Sindarin]]: '''[[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblin]]-cleaver'''<ref name=\"The Hobbit. p. 62\" group=T/>), a sword in ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', p. 53, 303</ref> was originally forged in [[Gondolin]] and was nicknamed \"'''Biter'''\" by the goblins of the [[Misty Mountains]]. After finding it in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll]]-hoard, [[Thorin Oakenshield]] carried the sword through the Misty Mountains and [[Mirkwood]] before being taken prisoner by the [[Silvan Elves#Mirkwood|Elves]], and it was laid on his tomb after he died in the Battle of Five Armies. It is the mate of [[#Glamdring|Glamdring]].\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], the sword is found and wielded by Thorin Oakenshield but ends up in the possession of [[Legolas]], who uses it in battle with the Orc Bolg but later returns it to Thorin so that the Dwarf may wield it against Azog the Defiler. Like [[#And\u00faril|And\u00faril]] and Glamdring in the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' films]], it was not shown to glow in the presence of orcs due to the film-makers fearing that doing that made it resemble a [[lightsaber]]. Although described as the mate of Glamdring in the books, Orcrist in the films takes on a significantly different appearance akin to that of a [[Messer (weapon)|kriegsmesser]], being a two-handed, single-edged sword, with a deep, heavy belly and pronounced curve.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ringil====\n\nRingil ([[Sindarin]]: ''Cold-Star / Cold-Spark'') is a sword wielded by [[Fingolfin]] in ''The Silmarillion'' and ''The Lays of Beleriand''. It bit with chilling cold, and glittered like ice with a pale light.<ref name=\"burdge\"/> This was the sword with which Fingolfin wounded [[Morgoth]] seven times, causing the first dark lord to limp forever afterward.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', pp. 153\u2013154, 347</ref><ref group=T>''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', \"The Lay of Leithian\", Canto XII}}</ref>\n\nIn Tolkien's early writings, Ringil was the name of one of the two pillars supporting the Two Lamps of primeval Middle-earth.<ref group=T>''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' (Part I) pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n====Sting====\n{{Main|Sting (Middle-earth)|l1=Sting}}\n\nSting is a knife in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.

The arrow was lost with the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]]'s corpse in the [[Long Lake (Middle-earth)|Long Lake]].\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], the Black Arrow's significance was elaborated on. Instead of being a regular-sized arrow, the Black Arrow was the size of a short spear, and was used as ammunition for a windlance (a [[Ballista|ballista-type weapon]]) in Dale. All but one were used to defend the city from Smaug during his invasion, but it only broke one of his scales, and Dale was subsequently destroyed. The final Black Arrow was kept by Bard's family as an heirloom. When Smaug attacks Lake Town, Bard attempts to shoot Smaug with a normal longbow, but his arrows inflict no harm to Smaug. After receiving the Black Arrow from his son Bain, Bard constructs an improvised ballista and fires the Black Arrow at Smaug's weak spot, which successfully hits its mark and kills Smaug.\n\n====Dailir====\nDailir is the arrow favoured by [[Beleg]], the great bowman of the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth.

Elves generally used straight swords while Orcs generally used curved swords. Both races have exceptions: Egalmoth of [[Gondolin]] used a curved sword and the [[Uruk-hai]] of [[Isengard]] used short, broad blades. Tolkien often mentions the use of shields together with (one-handed) swords.<ref name=\"piela\"/>\n\nIn ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy most Elvish swords are curved but some named swords are interpreted as two-handed [[longsword]]s.

Shortly afterwards Saruman's throat was fatally cut with a knife born by [[Wormtongue]].\n\nFor ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, some characters such as [[Aragorn]] was gifted with an Elven hunting knife which he retained well towards the Battle of the Black Gate. [[Boromir]]'s costume design included [[throwing knives]], and Legolas now possessed twin fighting knives carried in sheaths near his quiver.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n====Special unnamed knives====\nThere are some knives in Tolkien's fiction which do not have proper formal names, but nevertheless play important roles in the plot.\n\n=====Morgul-blades=====\n{{anchor|Morgul-blade}}\nThe [[Witch-king of Angmar]], leader of the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], used a magical [[dagger]] called a \"[[Minas Morgul|Morgul]]-blade\" to wound [[Frodo Baggins]] at [[Weathertop]]. The dark magic of the knife gravely affects Frodo's well-being, threatening to turn him into a wraith, especially because its detachable point migrated in Frodo's body for more than two weeks before it could be extracted, thus causing great damage.

When the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] attacked [[Aragorn]] and the hobbits on [[Weathertop]], Frodo slashed at one of them with his dagger but only damaged its cloak. He broke the blade when he fell from a horse, and left it behind in Rivendell, taking Bilbo's sword Sting instead. [[Sam Gamgee]] left his beside Frodo in [[Cirith Ungol]] and later had it returned to him by [[Gandalf]]. [[Pippin Took]] made use of his dagger in the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] to slay a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]]-chief.\n\n===Axes===\n[[Battle axe]]s are especially favoured by [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] in Tolkien's writings;<ref name=\"piela\"/> they famously used the [[battle cry]]: ''Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!'' ([[Khuzdul]]: ''Baruk Khaz\u00e2d! Khaz\u00e2d ai-m\u00eanu!'').<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"The Battle of Helm's Deep\"</ref> For ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] the Dwarf was assigned various axes of different makes during the course of the films.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nThe use of battle axes in other races tended to be more exceptional. The Sindarin Elves of [[Doriath]] favoured axes as weapons during the [[First Age]]. Other notable axe-bearers were [[Tuor]] (the wielder of [[#Dramboleg|Dramborleg]]), the [[White Mountains (Middle-earth)#Peoples and history|Men of the White Mountains]] who marched to the defence of [[Minas Tirith]] in ''The Lord of the Rings'', and a contingent of [[Easterlings#\"Easterlings with axes\"|Easterlings]] among the besiegers of Minas Tirith.\n\n===Bows and arrows===\n[[Bow and arrow|Bow]]s of different sizes and construction are featured in Tolkien's works. [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], and [[Uruk-hai]] used [[longbow]]s, while Elves of [[Mirkwood]] and [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] of [[Mordor]] used smaller ones. These bows are said to be made of wood, horn and even steel.<ref name=\"piela\"/>\n\nThe most famous bowman in Tolkien's stories of the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth is the Elf [[Beleg]]; his bow was named [[#Belthronding|Belthronding]], and his arrow [[#Dailir|Dailir]]. Infamously Curufin, a lord of the [[Noldor]], attempts to shoot the Elf-princess [[L\u00fathien]] with the bow of his brother [[Celegorm]]. His first arrow is intercepted by [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]; [[Beren]] attempts to intercept the second shot, and is wounded.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'' ch. 19 \"Of Beren and Luthien\" p.177; {{ISBN|0 04 823139 8}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in the late [[Third Age]], a bow is the main weapon of [[Legolas]], the Elf-member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. When the Fellowship meet [[Galadriel]], she gives Legolas a new bow. He later uses it to shoot all the way across the great river [[Anduin]] and bring down an airborne [[Nazg\u00fbl]].\n\n[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The films of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] assign a bow to [[Aragorn]] and [[crossbow]]s to the Uruk-hai. However, in Tolkien's writings Aragorn is armed only with the sword [[And\u00faril]] (below), and crossbows are nowhere mentioned.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nSometimes individual [[arrow]]s are given special mention in Tolkien's works. In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the ''[[#Black Arrow|Black Arrow]]'' was a royal heirloom used by [[Bard the Bowman]] to kill the dragon [[Smaug]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]''</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'', the [[Red Arrow (Middle-earth)|''Red Arrow'']] was a token used by [[Gondor]] to summon its allies in time of need.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 72; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 364, 411</ref> In the '' Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, the Red Arrow is omitted and its role is conflated with the [[Beacons of Gondor]].<ref name=\"timmons\">{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R.

As with other items of war, Elves and Dwarves produced the best armour. [[Mithril#The mithril-coat|The mail shirt]] forged by Dwarves from the fictional metal ''[[mithril]]'' appears in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', worn in turn by the protagonists [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and Frodo Baggins.<ref name=\"piela\"/><ref name=\"mithril\" group=T>{{cite book|title=[[J.R.R.

The [[Rohirrim]] were partly modeled on the [[Anglo-Saxons]], who wore [[Weaponry in Anglo-Saxon England|elaborate helmets]]; [[\u00c9omer]]'s helmet had a long white horse-tail. The Crown of Gondor was a jewelled battle-helmet; [[Aragorn]] received it at his coronation. [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Sam Gamgee]] use [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-helmets as part of their disguise in [[Mordor]].\n\nIn the [[First Age]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] made dragon-helms, which were said to protect against [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]]. The most famous of these was the [[#Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min|Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min]].\n\nThe [[Second Age]] was dominated by [[N\u00famenor]]. The N\u00famen\u00f3rean helmet, the '''''karma''''', reached particularly elaborate forms. Those of the [[N\u00famenor#Uinendili|Uinendili]], a guild of mariners, were \"made of overlapping plates of metal, the 'fish-crest' of leather embossed and coloured\".<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', inside rear dust-jacket</ref> Tolkien's coloured drawing of the ''karma'' of a Uinendili captain features on the cover of ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n\n==Named items==\nTolkien emulated his Northern European mythological and literary sources in creating weapons and armour with names (real examples of named weapons include [[Hrunting]] and [[N\u00e6gling]] in ''Beowulf'', [[Tyrfing]] in the ''[[Elder Edda]]'' and [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] in the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]''). The items illustrate the passage of time and the transfer of power or fate to their future bearers.<ref name=\"burdge\"/>\n\n===Named swords and knives===\n====Anglachel====\n\nAnglachel ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of the Flaming Star'') was a sword forged of [[meteoritic iron]] by E\u00f6l the Dark [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]], given to [[Thingol]] King of [[Doriath]] as a fee for leave to dwell in Nan Elmoth. It could cleave all earth-delved iron. Later wielded by [[Beleg]] Strongbow and ultimately [[T\u00farin]];<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 201-202, 206-210, 316; ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', p. 148, 419</ref><ref>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 226</ref><ref group=T>''The Silmarillion'', p. 225.</ref> Anglachel was reforged and renamed '''Gurthang''' ([[Sindarin]]: ''Iron of Death''<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. p. 443</ref>). T\u00farin used Gurthang to kill Glaurung, the Father of [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]], and later used the sword to take his own life in recompense for the accidental slaying of Beleg and the unjust slaying of Brandir. The stories endow the sword with a personality; Melian the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]] perceived malice in it as it was given to Beleg C\u00fathalion, and the elf Gwindor observed that Anglachel (so named then) seemed to mourn the death of Beleg at the hand of his friend T\u00farin by Anglachel itself. T\u00farin asked the sword whether it would slay him swiftly if he cast himself on its point, and it responded at length (the only instance of Gurthang speaking with voice). The depiction of the sword was influenced by that of the sword of the Finnish character [[Kullervo]] in the ''[[Kalevala]]''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref name=\"petty\">{{cite book |title=[[J.R.R.

It was the mate of Anglachel, was made of the same meteoritic iron, and had the same physical properties and capabilities as Anglachel, but there is no evidence of sentience in Anguirel.

It was the mate of [[#Orcrist|Orcrist]], and like Orcrist would glow blue whenever orcs were nearby.

By the end of the [[Second Age]] Narsil was borne by [[Elendil]]; it was broken in the struggle of Elendil and [[Gil-galad]] against [[Sauron]]. [[Isildur]] used the hilt-shard to cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's hand. The shards, acquiring the additional name '''the Sword that was Broken''', remained an heirloom of Isildur's heirs throughout the [[Third Age]], and were thus inherited by [[Aragorn]]. In T. A. 3018 the sword was reforged as '''And\u00faril''' (Quenya: ''Flame of the West''<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', p. 437</ref>).\n\nIn the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|motion picture series]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Narsil was broken into six parts (rather than two), which were kept in [[Rivendell]], and broke not when [[Elendil]] fell but rather when Isildur reached for it and Sauron stomped on it. It is also not reforged into And\u00faril until the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third film]], when [[Arwen]] persuades [[Elrond]] to have [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elven]] smiths reforge it from the shards of Narsil and bring it to Aragorn. In the book<!--LOTR is one book in three published parts-->, he actually wears the broken blade and shows it to the [[Hobbit]]s when they meet at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and its reforging prior to the departure of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] is a decisive move toward kingship.\n\nThe incident involving Aragorn disarming reluctantly before entering King [[Th\u00e9oden]]'s palace [[Meduseld]] is omitted from the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|second film]] on the grounds that the sword he surrenders there is not And\u00faril. However, the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|first film]] does include an invented scene of Aragorn reverently placing the hilt of Narsil back into the display after [[Boromir]] knocks it from its podium onto the floor.\n\nIn the ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship of the Ring]]''<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book II, Chapter III, \"The RIng Goes South\"</ref> And\u00faril is described as a [[Longsword|long sword]], and Boromir's sword is like And\u00faril but of less lineage. And in the [[The Return of the King|Return of the King]] And\u00faril is described as a great sword (a longsword) when seen on Aragorn's lap by Frodo at the Field of Cormallen,<ref group=T>''[[The Return of The King]]'', Book VI, Chapter IV, \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref> In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Aragorn obtains a shield from [[Th\u00e9oden]]'s armoury during the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. However it is never explicitly stated (nor is it impossible to use a long sword with a shield) that he uses the shield he received, and it is never referenced again (but the mail he received is), and it is quite likely that he intended to use the shield in his off-hand while mounted since a sword long or short can only be used in one-hand while mounted, but a shield may still be used in the off-hand while holding the reins of a horse, and as the host of Th\u00e9oden rode out from Edoras with the intention of engaging the hordes of Isengard in open battle the lack of a shield being mentioned could be explained by the changed course to Helm's Deep, this would explain why no reference to the shield is made, while many other shields most notably Th\u00e9oden's Golden shield are mentioned. The idea that technology in Middle-Earth is the same as [[Dark Age]] Europe is often misinterpreted from an incomplete understanding of letter 211 in which Tolkien compared the clothing of the Rohirrim and only the Rohirrim to the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], but he viewed the knights and general technology of his story to be Arthurian (e.g. long swords, chain mail, great shields, spears, longbows, [[vambrace]]s, greaves).<ref name=\"Tolkien Bayeux\" group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', p. 295 \"The Rohirrim were not 'mediaeval', in our sense. The styles of the Bayeux Tapestry (made in England) fit them well enough, if one remembers that the kind of tennis-nets [the] soldiers seem to have on are only a clumsy conventional sign for chainmail of small rings\"</ref> Technology works backwards in Middle-Earth with the First Age being the time of the most skilled and incredible creations in crafting, and the later Ages being periods of decline eventually leading to the Last Battle and the breaking of the World eventually leading to our world, and would suggest that And\u00faril was depicted correctly as a long sword in the ''Lord of the Rings'' motion picture series. \n\nThe filmmakers opted not to make And\u00faril glow at all, keeping that property only for [[#Sting|Sting]]. ([[Gandalf]]'s sword [[#Glamdring|Glamdring]] also did not glow in the presence of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]]. Peter Jackson notes, in his DVD commentary on ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', that this was an oversight, not a deliberate change from the books.) The filmmakers had Anduril made with runes engraved on the blade of the sword that read as \"''Anar N\u00e1ny\u00eb And\u00faril i n\u00e9 Narsil i macil Elendilo. Lercuvanten i m\u00f3li Mord\u00f3r\u00ebo. Isil''\" (Quenya. 'Sun. I am And\u00faril who once was Narsil, sword of Elendil. The slaves of Mordor shall flee from me. Moon.'), and another inscription on the hilt ''Narsil essenya, macil meletya; Telchar carn\u00e9ron N\u00e1varotesse'' (Quenya. Narsil is my name, a mighty sword; Telchar made me in Nogrod)\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] suggested that Narsil was introduced during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' rather spontaneously: \"It is possible that the Sword that was Broken actually emerged from the verse '[[All that is Gold Does Not Glitter|All that is gold does not glitter]]': on this view, in the earliest form of the verse ... the words ''a king may yet be without crown, A blade that was broken be brandished'' were no more than a further exemplification of the general moral [that not everything is what it appears to be].\"<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', p. 137</ref> Following this, references to the Sword were introduced during major recastings of \"At the Sign of the [[Prancing Pony]]\" and \"The [[Council of Elrond]]\" chapters.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', pp. 77-80, 120.</ref>\n\nOriginally the sword was only referred to as \"the Sword of Elendil\" or \"the Broken Sword\"; later the name '''''Branding''''' (from [[Old English]] ''brand'' 'sword') was devised for the Sword Reforged.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'', p. 290</ref> This was replaced by ''And\u00faril'' after the emergence of ''Narsil''.\n\n====Orcrist====\nOrcrist ([[Sindarin]]: '''[[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblin]]-cleaver'''<ref name=\"The Hobbit. p. 62\" group=T/>), a sword in ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"burdge\"/><ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', p. 53, 303</ref> was originally forged in [[Gondolin]] and was nicknamed \"'''Biter'''\" by the goblins of the [[Misty Mountains]]. After finding it in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll]]-hoard, [[Thorin Oakenshield]] carried the sword through the Misty Mountains and [[Mirkwood]] before being taken prisoner by the [[Silvan Elves#Mirkwood|Elves]], and it was laid on his tomb after he died in the Battle of Five Armies. It is the mate of [[#Glamdring|Glamdring]].\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], the sword is found and wielded by Thorin Oakenshield but ends up in the possession of [[Legolas]], who uses it in battle with the Orc Bolg but later returns it to Thorin so that the Dwarf may wield it against Azog the Defiler. Like [[#And\u00faril|And\u00faril]] and Glamdring in the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' films]], it was not shown to glow in the presence of orcs due to the film-makers fearing that doing that made it resemble a [[lightsaber]]. Although described as the mate of Glamdring in the books, Orcrist in the films takes on a significantly different appearance akin to that of a [[Messer (weapon)|kriegsmesser]], being a two-handed, single-edged sword, with a deep, heavy belly and pronounced curve.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ringil====\n\nRingil ([[Sindarin]]: ''Cold-Star / Cold-Spark'') is a sword wielded by [[Fingolfin]] in ''The Silmarillion'' and ''The Lays of Beleriand''.

An heirloom from many generations of Bard's family and believed by him to have been made in the forges of the [[Durin's folk#Kings of Durin's folk|King under the Mountain]]; Bard recites its history before urging it to \"go now and speed well\" and successfully shooting [[Smaug]]. The arrow was lost with the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]]'s corpse in the [[Long Lake (Middle-earth)|Long Lake]].\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], the Black Arrow's significance was elaborated on. Instead of being a regular-sized arrow, the Black Arrow was the size of a short spear, and was used as ammunition for a windlance (a [[Ballista|ballista-type weapon]]) in Dale. All but one were used to defend the city from Smaug during his invasion, but it only broke one of his scales, and Dale was subsequently destroyed. The final Black Arrow was kept by Bard's family as an heirloom. When Smaug attacks Lake Town, Bard attempts to shoot Smaug with a normal longbow, but his arrows inflict no harm to Smaug. After receiving the Black Arrow from his son Bain, Bard constructs an improvised ballista and fires the Black Arrow at Smaug's weak spot, which successfully hits its mark and kills Smaug.\n\n====Dailir====\nDailir is the arrow favoured by [[Beleg]], the great bowman of the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth.
