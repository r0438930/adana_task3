In turn, the leaching of [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] silica stocks from soils has also increased, delivering higher concentrations of dissolved silica in rivers.<ref name=\":4\" /> Conversely, increased damming has led to a reduction in silica supply to the ocean due to uptake by freshwater diatoms behind dams.
