Benson, players take on an adventure to save the bees' production of honey through [[New York City]]. Players get to experience Barry's life within the hive and navigate their way around the world from the feature film using many techniques. Players can drive through the city using racecars, scooters, taxicabs, and trucks. Players can \"fly\" Barry at high speed through the sky. Using the Pollinator, players can ''Blast'' through obstacles or they can ''Buzz'' to cause a chain reaction. Players get to ''Stop Time'' by using Barry's bee reflexes. The video game features 2-person multiplayer mini games.\n\nThe video game ''[[Shrek the Third (video game)|Shrek the Third]]'' includes a demo which has Barry chase a truck.  The name \"Honey Farms\" is omitted in this demo.\n\n[[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[John Goodman]], [[Patrick Warburton]], and [[Tress MacNeille]] reprise their voices from the movie in this game.\n\n==Synopsis==\nA [[honey bee]] named Barry B. Benson stars on a new show known as \"New Hive Tonight\". On the show, Barry talks about how he changed the lives of honey bees and [[human]]s, bringing them together.\n  \nOn his graduation day from BU University (which is the only university in the entire [[bee hive|hive]], and also maybe a spoof of Boston University, having the same abbreviation), Barry and his best friend Adam Flayman head to a honey factory called \"Honex\", where they are to work for the rest of their lives. Adam enjoys working, but Barry does not, thinking that everything they do in Honex is making honey, and longs to do something else in the remaining stage of his life. The game focuses on Barry's various job skills which are not in the movie such as [[car racing]], [[Taxi]], playing [[video arcade game]]s, delivering food to owners, car fixing and doing Honex jobs while not in a mission.\n\nBarry decides that he wants to go to the outside and joins the Pollen Jocks, a group of bees who go to the \"outside\" to collect [[nectar]] from [[flower]]s and bring them back. A Pollen Jock manages to train Barry so he would be a Pollen Jock such as how to make flowers bloom, and getting Nectar from them. He also teaches him to kill other non-bee insects such as [[hornet]]s, [[wasp]]s, and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]]. However, while Barry is resting, it starts to rain, but he manages to find cover in the apartment of a couple: Vanessa and Ken. After distracting a few party guests in the apartment, Ken tries to smash Barry, but Vanessa allows him to escape. Barry soon discovers that the humans \"steal\" their honey regularly, so he goes to get the honey back. Upon arriving at the grocery store, he duels the owner, Hector, in order to tell him the whereabouts where the honey came from. After chasing a [[truck]] delivering [[honey]], he finds himself in a honey farm, where he takes [[picture]]s of it to prove to the rest of the bees that the humans are \"stealing\" their honey. However, a squad of wasps arrive at the apiary to take away the bees and kill Barry but he manages to fend them off and rout them, foiling their plans. Then, Freddy the head Beekeeper manages to smoke all the bees but Barry and the other bees defeat the Beekeeper which he bumps his head on the tree.\n\nBarry and Adam chase after the [[car]] of a main defense lawyer named Layton T Montgomery, and secretly listen to a conversation between him and his associate about the human-stealing-honey case while they are in a [[restaurant]] called La Couchon. He sneaks into Montgomery's house along with Vanessa and Barry disguises himself as a [[fly]] in a Tron-like suit to gain access to a safe which holds papers explaining Montgomery's plan, but it is revealed to be a trick and he is attacked by a group of hornets, but he manages to defeat them.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| DS = true\n| PC = true\n| PS2 = true\n| WII = true\n| X360 = true\n| na = true\n| GI_X360 = 6.5/10<ref>{{cite journal |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |title=Bee Movie Game (X360) |url=http://www.gameinformer.com:80/NR/exeres/12966B84-6081-45F5-8FF5-BFFBAB94E308.htm |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |issue=177 |date=January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203180429/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/12966B84-6081-45F5-8FF5-BFFBAB94E308.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |accessdate=April 17, 2017 }}</ref>\n| GSpot_DS = 5/10<ref>{{cite web |last=Provo |first=Frank |date=November 20, 2007 |title=Bee Movie Game Review (DS) |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bee-movie-game/1900-6183197/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n| GSpot_PS2 = 6.5/10<ref name=GSpot>{{cite web |last=Provo |first=Frank |date=November 19, 2007 |title=Bee Movie Game Review (PS2, Wii, X360) |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bee-movie-game-review/1900-6183146/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n| GSpot_WII = 6.5/10<ref name=GSpot/>\n| GSpot_X360 = 6.5/10<ref name=GSpot/>\n| GameZone_DS = 6.2/10<ref>{{cite web |last=Kuvin |first=Scott |date=November 4, 2007 |title=Bee Movie Game -
