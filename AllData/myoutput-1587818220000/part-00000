Drama serial \"Yaar-e-Bewafa\" is also focusing on the issue that how selfish a person can behave, when they get a little hope for the better future, even they forget their present belongings and relationships. This play revolves around two different families which will connect each other with the progression of events.\n\nZaid is living with his mother, wife and a son. His mother raises him with lots of sufferings and difficulties after the death of his father. She made sure about his quality studies despite their financial problems. Zaid met his wife (Fiza) in university and they fall in love with each other. Fiza belongs to a rich family while Zaid is just a white collar guy. Fiza's parent opposes her below standard choice and discontinues their connection with her after wedding.\n\nAnother dimension of the play is Saleem's family, who live with his wife (Amna) and a son. He is kind of short-tempered, truculent and works in a chemical factory. Once he gets ill and after a complete diagnosis, shocking news reveals that he is suffering from lungs cancer. Now Amna faces financial crises due to Saleem's illness.\n\nThe fate brings another woman in Zaid's life after the departure of Fiza. They both develop strong bonding, affection and soft corner for each other. Fiza who is busy in collecting materialistic happiness for her close ones, seems like she is losing them forever.\n\nIs it a sensible act to value our future happiness while ignoring present happiness?\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Imran Abbas (actor)|Imran Abbas]] as Zaid\n*[[Sarah Khan]] as Amna, Saleem's wife and Zaid's Second Wife\n*[[Arij Fatyma]] as Fiza, Zaid's First Wife\n*Saleem Mairaj as Saleem, Amna's First Husband\n*[[Samina Ahmed]] as Humera\n*Ray Khan\n*Saad Faridi\n*Tahir Jatao\n*Birjees Farooqui\n*Mehboob Sultan\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe [[Original Soundtrack|original soundtrack]] of Yaar-e-Bewafa is composed and sung by [[Imran Abbas]], the lead actor of the drama serial.
