Its objective was to increase security by providing data confidentiality of management frames, mechanisms that enable data integrity, [[data origin authenticity]], and replay protection. These extensions interact with [[IEEE 802.11r]] and [[IEEE 802.11u]].\n=== Overview ===\n* Single and unified solution needed for all IEEE 802.11 Protection-capable Management Frames.\n* It uses the existing security mechanisms rather than creating new security scheme or new management frame format.\n* It is an optional feature in 802.11 and is required for 802.11 implementations that support TKIP or CCMP. \n* Its use is optional and can be negotiable between STAs.\n\n=== Classes ===\n* Class 1\n** Beacon and probe request/response\n** Authentication and de-authentication\n** Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)\n** Spectrum management action\n** Radio measurement action between STAs in IBSS\n* Class 2\n** Association request/response\n** Re-association request/response\n** Disassociation\n* Class 3\n** Disassociation/de-authentication\n** QoS action frame\n** Radio measurement action in infrastructure BSS\n** Future 11v management frames\n\n==Unprotected frames==\nIt is infeasible/not possible to protect the frame sent before four-ways handshake because it is sent prior to key establishment. The management frames, which are sent after key establishment, can be protected.\n\nInfeasible to protect:\n* Beacon and probe request/response\n* Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)\n* Authentication\n* Association request/response\n* Spectrum management action\n\n==Protected frames==\nProtection-capable management frames are those sent after key establishment that can be protected using existing protection key hierarchy in 802.11 and its amendments.\n\nOnly TKIP/AES frames are protected and WEP/open frames are not protected.\n\n* Disassociation and deauthentication\n* Radio measurement action for infrastructure BSS (802.11k frames)\n* QoS action frame (802.11e frames)\n* Future 11v management frames (802.11v frames)\n\nProtection-capable Management Frames are protected by the same cipher suite as an ordinary data [[MPDU]].\n\n* MPDU payload is TKIP or CCMP encrypted.\n* MPDU payload and header are TKIP or CCMP integrity protected.\n* Protected frame subfield of frame control field is set.\n* Only cipher suites already implemented are required.\n* Sender's pairwise temporal key (PTK) protects unicast management frame, and group temporal key (GTK) is used to protect broadcast/multicast management frame.\n* An RSN (802.11i) IE capability bit is used to signal whether Protection-capable Management frames are protected.\n\n== Replay protection ==\nReplay protection is provided by already existing mechanisms. Specifically, there is a (per-station per-key per-priority) counter of each transmitted frame; this is used as a nonce/initialisation vector (IV) in cryptographic encapsulation/decapsulation, and the receiving station ensures that the received counter is increasing.\n\n==Usage==\nThe 802.11w standard is implemented in Linux and BSD's as part of the 80211mac driver code base, which is used by several wireless driver interfaces; i.e., ath9k. The feature is easily enabled in most recent kernels and Linux OS's using these combinations. [[OpenWrt]] in particular provides an easy toggle as part of the base distribution. The feature has been implemented for the first time into [[Microsoft]] [[operating systems]] in Windows 8. This has caused a number of compatibility issues particularly with wireless access points that are not compatible with the standard. Rolling back the wireless adapter driver to one from Windows 7 usually fixes the issue.\n\n<!-- Add specific details here -->\n[[Wireless LAN]]s send system management information in unprotected frames, which makes them vulnerable.
