At the time of European contact, tribes were moving around and becoming displaced due to conflicts such as the Iroquois wars, as well as the changing economic patterns brought about by the fur trade.  As a result, it's difficult for archaeologists to place tribes accurately in their prehistoric homeland.  Furthermore, after contact with Europeans, the tribes traded for items such as brass kettles and steel knives which replaced the native pottery and stone tools.  Thus, the material culture vanished and in many cases created a disconnect in the archaeological record between the prehistoric and historic periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mason |first1=Ronald J. |title=Great Lakes Archaeology |date=1981 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York NY |pages=389-404}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Mason |first1=Ronald J. |title=Rock Island: Historical Indian Archaeology in the Northern Lake Michigan Basin |date=1986 |publisher=Kent State University Press}}</ref>\n\nWith the discovery of the Bell site, for the first time Fox material culture could be observed in an intact early historic context.
