Pupils are prepared for the ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]'' ({{IPA-fr|bakal\u0254\u0281e\u02c8a|}}) (baccalaureate, colloquially known as ''le bac''), which can lead to higher education studies or directly to professional life. There are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'': the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'', the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'', and the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel''.\n\n==School year==\n\nThe school year starts in early September and ends in early July. Metropolitan [[French school holidays]] are scheduled by the [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]] by dividing the country into three zones (A, B, and C) to prevent overcrowding by family holidaymakers of [[tourist]] destinations, such as the [[Mediterranean]] coast and ski resorts. [[Lyon]], for example, is in zone A, [[Marseille]] is in zone B and [[Paris]] and [[Bordeaux]] are in zone C.\n\nIn contrast to the practice in most other education systems, the school years in France are numbered on a decreasing scale. Thus, pupils begin their secondary education in the ''sixi\u00e8me'' (6th class) and transfer to a ''lyc\u00e9e'' in the ''seconde'' (2nd class). The final year is the ''terminale''.\n\nIn French, the word ''\u00e9tudiant(e)'' is usually reserved for [[university]]-level students, and ''coll\u00e8ge'' and ''lyc\u00e9e'' students are referred to as ''\u00e9l\u00e8ves'' (''pupils'' or ''students'' in English).\n\nThe curriculum (''le programme officiel'') is standardized for all French public institutions. Changes to the programme are made every year by the French Ministry of Education and are published in the Ministry's ''Bulletin Officiel de l'\u00c9ducation Nationale'' (''BO''), the official reference bulletin for educators.\n\n==Coll\u00e8ge==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" width=300\n|- \n| colspan=3 align=center bgcolor=orange| '''''Coll\u00e8ge'''''\n|- \n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

Along with 3-4 weekly hours of [[physical education]], a typical school week consists of some 26 hours of schooling. [[French language]] and [[French language|literature]] occupy the most time, 4-5 hours per week, followed by 4 hours per week of [[mathematics]]; other subjects occupy 1-3.5 hours per week.\n\nThe curriculum is devised by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|French Ministry of National Education]] and applies to all ''coll\u00e8ges'' in France and also for [[Agence pour l'enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger|AEFE-dependent]] institutions. ''Acad\u00e9mies'' and individual schools have little margin for curriculum customisation. Teachers compose [[Syllabus|syllabi]] per precise government educational regulations and choose [[textbook]]s accordingly, and every major French publishing house has a textbook branch.\n\n=== Process and purpose ===\nUsually a different \"professeur\" or teacher teaches each subject; most teachers teach several different age groups. ''Coll\u00e8ge'' pupils stay in the same class throughout the school year and in every subject (except for optional courses such as foreign languages, where students from several classes mix), so each year-group is divided into as many classes as necessary. The strong belief in teaching in mixed-ability classes means that [[Tracking (education)| streaming]] occurs only rarely.\n\nClass sizes vary from school to school, but usually range from 20 to 35 pupils. Each class has a ''professeur principal'' (main teacher or class tutor) who acts as the link between the teaching staff, administration and pupils.<ref>{{cite book|title= The French Education System|author= H. D. Lewis|pages= 58|year= 1985|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 0-7099-1683-3}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the ''coll\u00e8ge'' has the task of preparing students for the advanced subjects of the ''lyc\u00e9e''. At the end of the ''troisi\u00e8me'' class, students sit for [[National diploma (France) | ''le dipl\u00f4me national du brevet'']], an end-of-''coll\u00e8ge'' [[Test (assessment)| examination]]. The ''brevet'' is not required for entrance to the ''lyc\u00e9e'', and passing it does not guarantee that a pupil will progress to the higher-level school.\n\nDuring the last ''conseil de classe'' of the year, held in June, teachers and administrators decide whether or not a pupil can progress to the next grade. In deciding, they evaluate the student's [[skills]], participation, and [[behaviour]]. One of three outcomes is possible:\n \n# The student progresses to the next grade.\n# His or her ''redoublement'' (repeating the year) can be required.\n# He or she can, in specific cases, be offered to skip a grade and be promoted two grades.\n \nA student asked to repeat a grade can [[appeal]] said decision. The decision of the appeals council is final.\n\n== Lyc\u00e9e ==\n\nThe ''lyc\u00e9e'' is the second, and last, stage of [[secondary education]] in the [[French educational system]]. The City of Paris refers to a lyc\u00e9e in English as a \"[[sixth form college]]\".<ref name=\"Parisschools\"/> A pupil attending a lyc\u00e9e is a ''lyc\u00e9en'' (masculine) or a ''lyc\u00e9enne'' (feminine).\n\nUntil 1959, the term lyc\u00e9e designated a secondary school with a full curriculum (7 years, the present college + lyc\u00e9e) directly under the supervision of the State, then from 1959 to 1963 any secondary school with a full curriculum.<ref>Jean-Michel Chapoulie.

There are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' and which are completely different: the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general baccalaureate), the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'' (technological baccalaureate), and the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate).\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" width=300\n|- \n| colspan=3 align=center bgcolor=orange| '''''Lyc\u00e9e'''''\n|- \n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

General and technological education courses are provided in \"standard\" ''lyc\u00e9es'', while vocational courses are provided in separate professional ''lyc\u00e9es''.\n\nIn practice, competent pupils at a vocational ''lyc\u00e9e professionnel'' can also apply to take short-term, post\u2013baccalaur\u00e9at studies leading to the ''Brevet de technicien sup\u00e9rieur'' (BTS), a vocational qualification. That option is available also to pupils at a ''lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.\n\n===Lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and lyc\u00e9e technologique===\n====General streams (''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'')====\nIn France, the ''lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' is the usual stepping stone to [[university]] degrees. \n\nBefore 2021, the students of the general baccalaureate choose one of three streams (termed ''s\u00e9ries'') in the penultimate ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). During the ''seconde'', students mostly take the same courses, despite having different academic skills and interests, so it is usually thought to be an easier year than either the ''premi\u00e8re'' or the ''terminale''.\n\nThe ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' examination is different for all three ''s\u00e9ries'', and subjects are weighted according to the course taken.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|'''Streams'''||'''S'''<br /> ''scientifique''<br /> (sciences) ||'''ES'''<br />''\u00e9conomique et social''<br /> (economics and social sciences) ||'''L'''<br />''litt\u00e9raire''<br /> (literature)\n|-\n|'''Description'''|| The science stream (''bac S - bac scientifique'') requires a high level in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[biology]] & [[geology]] and, if available, [[Engineering|engineering sciences]] and [[computer science]]. || The ''bac ES'' (''bac \u00e9conomique et social'') requires a high level in [[economics]] and [[Social science|social]] courses of studies; also in [[mathematics]], [[history]] & [[geography]]. || The ''bac L'' (''bac litt\u00e9raire'') weighs [[French literature]], [[philosophy]], [[Foreign language|foreign languages]] and [[The arts|arts]] heavily. Students in ''premi\u00e8re litt\u00e9raire'' (1\u00e8reL or 1L) have no maths and only a small amount of sciences unless they choose the 'maths' option. Students in ''Terminale Litt\u00e9raire'' (TleL or TL) have no maths, physics and chemistry or biology unless they chose the 'maths' option in 1L.\n|}\n\nAccording to the official statistics, for the 2003\u20132004 school year, 33 per cent of all students chose ''s\u00e9rie S''; 19 per cent chose ''s\u00e9rie ES''; and 11 per cent chose ''s\u00e9rie L''.<ref>[ftp://trf.education.gouv.fr/pub/edutel/dpd/rers2004/chap4_12.pdf official statistics]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAll students take [[philosophy]] courses in ''terminale'', while [[French language]] classes end in the ''premi\u00e8re'', excepting the ''s\u00e9rie L'', where they become [[French literature]] classes, where pupils are to study two books during the year, from French writers, or foreign books translated into French (e.g. ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' during the school year 2007\u20132008, or ''[[The Leopard]]'' from Italian author [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]]).\n\nThere also is a required option for further specialisation in all ''s\u00e9ries'', although it is restricted to the chosen course. For example, a student in ''s\u00e9rie S'' can choose to specialise in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], \"[[:fr:Sciences de la vie et de la terre|''SVT'']]{{-\"}} ([[biology]] and [[geology]]) or \"[[engineering]] sciences\" but not in [[philosophy]].\n\nA student in ''s\u00e9rie L'' can choose to specialise in one of his or her foreign languages (English being the most popular), a third foreign language or a dead language such as Latin, or one of the following arts: music, theatre, circus, \"plastiques\". Specialisation adds a separate, weekly two-hour class in the chosen discipline; also, it increases the weight of the chosen subject at the ''baccalaur\u00e9at''. The [[syllabus]] in the specialisation class is unrelated to the material learned in the common class. Specialisation plays no role in the choice of a post\u2013secondary career or subject at [[university]], except for a few courses aimed for students from a given ''s\u00e9rie'' that can also accept students from other ''s\u00e9ries'' if they have taken a given specialisation.\n\nIn 2021, the S, ES and L streams of the general baccalaureate are deleted. On this date, students of the general baccalaureate now choose three specialty courses, then keep two in the final year. There are 12 specialties : [[The arts|arts]], [[ecology]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[humanities]], [[Language|languages]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[Economics|economic]] and [[Social science|social sciences]], [[Engineering|engineering sciences]], [[biology]] & [[geology]]. These specialties are added to a part common to all : [[French language|french]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[Language|languages]], [[Science|sciences]], [[sport]]. A large part of the tests is now in continuous control but the students also have a final [[Oral tradition|oral]] test.\n\n==== Technical streams (''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'') ====\nAfter the ''seconde'', students can also go on the ''lyc\u00e9e technologique'' to obtain the ''baccalaureat technologique.'' It includes eight other streams, called ''s\u00e9ries technologiques'':\n\n* ''sciences et technologies de la gestion'' (Management Sciences and Technologies, ''STG'') (replaced ''sciences et technologies tertiaires'' (Service Sciences and Technologies, ''STT'') for the June 2007 Bac Exam)\n* ''sciences et technologies de l'industrie et du d\u00e9veloppement durable'' (Industrial Science and Technologies and sustainable development, ''STI2D'')\n* ''sciences et technologies de laboratoire'' (Laboratory Science and Technologies, ''STL'')\n* ''sciences m\u00e9dico-sociales'' (Health and Social Sciences, ''SMS''): The name was changed in 2007 and became: ''Sciences et technologies de la sant\u00e9 et du social'' (Sciences and Technologies in Health and Social, ''ST2S'')\n* ''sciences et technologies du produit agroalimentaire'' (Food Science and Technologies, ''STPA'')\n* ''sciences et technologies de l'agronomie et de l'environnement'' (Agronomy and Environment Science and Technologies, ''STAE'')\n* ''techniques de la musique et de la danse'' (Music and Dance Techniques, ''TMD'')\n* ''h\u00f4tellerie'' (Hotel and restaurants management)\n\nThe STPA and STAE stream are available only in ''lyc\u00e9es agricoles'', speciality schools for [[agricultural sciences]].\n\nThe teaching of the lessons is based on inductive reasoning and experimentation. It allows you to work or to pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management etc.).\n\n===Lyc\u00e9e professionnel===\nThe ''lyc\u00e9e professionnel'' leads to the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel''. The courses are designed for students who do not plan to continue into higher education. The vocational training is for craftspeople and involves internships in commercial enterprises. The courses are suitable for students who are more interested in a hands-on educational approach than in academic schooling. There are nearly 100 specialties like : Leather crafts; Building technician; Maintenance of industrial equipment; Cooked; Road freight transport driver; Butcher etc.\n\n== Carte scolaire ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}\n[[File:Lycee Rennes DSC08932.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A lyc\u00e9e in [[Rennes]], from the 19th century.]]\nFrench parents are not free to choose the state school that their children will attend; unless the children have special learning needs, they will attend the school allocated to them by the ''carte scolaire'' (school map). Reasons for attending a state school that is not their nearest include studying an option unavailable in the school to which they were originally assigned (e.g. a rare foreign language).\n\nFor many reasons, many parents consider the allocated school inadequate, particularly if they do not like the idea of their children mixing with some of the other pupils at the school. That is especially the case in poor neighbourhoods with large foreign [[immigrant]] populations. In any city, there are \"better\" lyc\u00e9es and coll\u00e8ges, which parents would prefer their children attend (usually dating from the 19th century, in the city centre). The two main methods used in such circumstances to get children into a school other than their assigned school are:\n\n* paying for partly subsidised private schooling;\n* having the child choose an unusual option (e.g. Ancient Greek) available only in the preferred school.\n\nA similar trick is used if some classes in a school are seen as \"better\" than others. For organisational reasons, students taking certain options are grouped into special classes, which may be academically attractive. They typically include classes taking German as a first foreign language, or Latin or Ancient Greek as options.\n\n==Outside France==\n{{main article|Agence pour l'enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|France|Education}}\n* [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]]\n* [[Grandes \u00e9coles]]\n* [[Education in France]]\n* [[Agency for French Education Abroad]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.education.gouv.fr/index.php French Ministry of Education (in French)]\n* [http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/default.htm ''Bulletin Officiel'' (in French)]\n* [http://www.cndp.fr/secondaire/ ''Centre national de documentation p\u00e9dagogique'' website (in French)]\n* [http://about-france.com/primary-secondary-schools.htm The school system and education in France (in English)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secondary Education In France}}\n[[Category:Education in France]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in France| ]]\n[[Category:Secondary education by country|France]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A level of French education}}\n{{Redirect|Lyc\u00e9e}}\n{{citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Vesoul Lyc\u00e9e des Haberges.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Lyc\u00e9e in [[Vesoul]]]]\n\nIn [[France]], '''secondary education ''' is in two stages:\n\n* '''''Coll\u00e8ges''''' ({{IPA-fr|k\u0254\u02c8l\u025b\u0292}}) cater for the first four years of [[secondary education]] from the ages of 11 to 15.\n* '''''Lyc\u00e9es''''' ({{IPA-fr|li\u02c8se|}}) provide a three-year course of further secondary education for children between the ages of 15 and 18.

Along with 3-4 weekly hours of [[physical education]], a typical school week consists of some 26 hours of schooling. [[French language]] and [[French language|literature]] occupy the most time, 4-5 hours per week, followed by 4 hours per week of [[mathematics]]; other subjects occupy 1-3.5 hours per week.\n\nThe curriculum is devised by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|French Ministry of National Education]] and applies to all ''coll\u00e8ges'' in France and also for [[Agence pour l'enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger|AEFE-dependent]] institutions. ''Acad\u00e9mies'' and individual schools have little margin for curriculum customisation. Teachers compose [[Syllabus|syllabi]] per precise government educational regulations and choose [[textbook]]s accordingly, and every major French publishing house has a textbook branch.\n\n=== Process and purpose ===\nUsually a different \"professeur\" or teacher teaches each subject; most teachers teach several different age groups. ''Coll\u00e8ge'' pupils stay in the same class throughout the school year and in every subject (except for optional courses such as foreign languages, where students from several classes mix), so each year-group is divided into as many classes as necessary. The strong belief in teaching in mixed-ability classes means that [[Tracking (education)| streaming]] occurs only rarely.\n\nClass sizes vary from school to school, but usually range from 20 to 35 pupils. Each class has a ''professeur principal'' (main teacher or class tutor) who acts as the link between the teaching staff, administration and pupils.<ref>{{cite book|title= The French Education System|author= H. D. Lewis|pages= 58|year= 1985|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 0-7099-1683-3}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the ''coll\u00e8ge'' has the task of preparing students for the advanced subjects of the ''lyc\u00e9e''. At the end of the ''troisi\u00e8me'' class, students sit for [[National diploma (France) | ''le dipl\u00f4me national du brevet'']], an end-of-''coll\u00e8ge'' [[Test (assessment)| examination]]. The ''brevet'' is not required for entrance to the ''lyc\u00e9e'', and passing it does not guarantee that a pupil will progress to the higher-level school.\n\nDuring the last ''conseil de classe'' of the year, held in June, teachers and administrators decide whether or not a pupil can progress to the next grade. In deciding, they evaluate the student's [[skills]], participation, and [[behaviour]]. One of three outcomes is possible:\n \n# The student progresses to the next grade.\n# His or her ''redoublement'' (repeating the year) can be required.\n# He or she can, in specific cases, be offered to skip a grade and be promoted two grades.\n \nA student asked to repeat a grade can [[appeal]] said decision. The decision of the appeals council is final.\n\n== Lyc\u00e9e ==\n\nThe ''lyc\u00e9e'' is the second, and last, stage of [[secondary education]] in the [[French educational system]]. The City of Paris refers to a lyc\u00e9e in English as a \"[[sixth form college]]\".<ref name=\"Parisschools\"/> A pupil attending a lyc\u00e9e is a ''lyc\u00e9en'' (masculine) or a ''lyc\u00e9enne'' (feminine).\n\nUntil 1959, the term lyc\u00e9e designated a secondary school with a full curriculum (7 years, the present college + lyc\u00e9e) directly under the supervision of the State, then from 1959 to 1963 any secondary school with a full curriculum.<ref>Jean-Michel Chapoulie.

Maison des Sciences de l'Homme. p3. {{ISBN|2-7351-0203-3}}.</ref> Older lyc\u00e9es still include a ''coll\u00e8ge'' section,<ref>ex : [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV]]</ref> so a pupil attending a lyc\u00e9e may actually be a ''coll\u00e9gien''.\n\nAt the end of the final year of schooling, most students take the [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] diploma. There are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' and which are completely different: the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general baccalaureate), the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'' (technological baccalaureate), and the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate).\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" width=300\n|- \n| colspan=3 align=center bgcolor=orange| '''''Lyc\u00e9e'''''\n|- \n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

General and technological education courses are provided in \"standard\" ''lyc\u00e9es'', while vocational courses are provided in separate professional ''lyc\u00e9es''.\n\nIn practice, competent pupils at a vocational ''lyc\u00e9e professionnel'' can also apply to take short-term, post\u2013baccalaur\u00e9at studies leading to the ''Brevet de technicien sup\u00e9rieur'' (BTS), a vocational qualification. That option is available also to pupils at a ''lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.\n\n===Lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and lyc\u00e9e technologique===\n====General streams (''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'')====\nIn France, the ''lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' is the usual stepping stone to [[university]] degrees. \n\nBefore 2021, the students of the general baccalaureate choose one of three streams (termed ''s\u00e9ries'') in the penultimate ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). During the ''seconde'', students mostly take the same courses, despite having different academic skills and interests, so it is usually thought to be an easier year than either the ''premi\u00e8re'' or the ''terminale''.\n\nThe ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' examination is different for all three ''s\u00e9ries'', and subjects are weighted according to the course taken.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|'''Streams'''||'''S'''<br /> ''scientifique''<br /> (sciences) ||'''ES'''<br />''\u00e9conomique et social''<br /> (economics and social sciences) ||'''L'''<br />''litt\u00e9raire''<br /> (literature)\n|-\n|'''Description'''|| The science stream (''bac S - bac scientifique'') requires a high level in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[biology]] & [[geology]] and, if available, [[Engineering|engineering sciences]] and [[computer science]]. || The ''bac ES'' (''bac \u00e9conomique et social'') requires a high level in [[economics]] and [[Social science|social]] courses of studies; also in [[mathematics]], [[history]] & [[geography]]. || The ''bac L'' (''bac litt\u00e9raire'') weighs [[French literature]], [[philosophy]], [[Foreign language|foreign languages]] and [[The arts|arts]] heavily. Students in ''premi\u00e8re litt\u00e9raire'' (1\u00e8reL or 1L) have no maths and only a small amount of sciences unless they choose the 'maths' option. Students in ''Terminale Litt\u00e9raire'' (TleL or TL) have no maths, physics and chemistry or biology unless they chose the 'maths' option in 1L.\n|}\n\nAccording to the official statistics, for the 2003\u20132004 school year, 33 per cent of all students chose ''s\u00e9rie S''; 19 per cent chose ''s\u00e9rie ES''; and 11 per cent chose ''s\u00e9rie L''.<ref>[ftp://trf.education.gouv.fr/pub/edutel/dpd/rers2004/chap4_12.pdf official statistics]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAll students take [[philosophy]] courses in ''terminale'', while [[French language]] classes end in the ''premi\u00e8re'', excepting the ''s\u00e9rie L'', where they become [[French literature]] classes, where pupils are to study two books during the year, from French writers, or foreign books translated into French (e.g. ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' during the school year 2007\u20132008, or ''[[The Leopard]]'' from Italian author [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]]).\n\nThere also is a required option for further specialisation in all ''s\u00e9ries'', although it is restricted to the chosen course. For example, a student in ''s\u00e9rie S'' can choose to specialise in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], \"[[:fr:Sciences de la vie et de la terre|''SVT'']]{{-\"}} ([[biology]] and [[geology]]) or \"[[engineering]] sciences\" but not in [[philosophy]].\n\nA student in ''s\u00e9rie L'' can choose to specialise in one of his or her foreign languages (English being the most popular), a third foreign language or a dead language such as Latin, or one of the following arts: music, theatre, circus, \"plastiques\". Specialisation adds a separate, weekly two-hour class in the chosen discipline; also, it increases the weight of the chosen subject at the ''baccalaur\u00e9at''. The [[syllabus]] in the specialisation class is unrelated to the material learned in the common class. Specialisation plays no role in the choice of a post\u2013secondary career or subject at [[university]], except for a few courses aimed for students from a given ''s\u00e9rie'' that can also accept students from other ''s\u00e9ries'' if they have taken a given specialisation.\n\nIn 2021, the S, ES and L streams of the general baccalaureate are deleted. On this date, students of the general baccalaureate now choose three specialty courses, then keep two in the final year. There are 12 specialties : [[The arts|arts]], [[ecology]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[humanities]], [[Language|languages]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[Economics|economic]] and [[Social science|social sciences]], [[Engineering|engineering sciences]], [[biology]] & [[geology]]. These specialties are added to a part common to all : [[French language|french]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[Language|languages]], [[Science|sciences]], [[sport]]. A large part of the tests is now in continuous control but the students also have a final [[Oral tradition|oral]] test.\n\n==== Technical streams (''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'') ====\nAfter the ''seconde'', students can also go on the ''lyc\u00e9e technologique'' to obtain the ''baccalaureat technologique.'' It includes eight other streams, called ''s\u00e9ries technologiques'':\n\n* ''sciences et technologies de la gestion'' (Management Sciences and Technologies, ''STG'') (replaced ''sciences et technologies tertiaires'' (Service Sciences and Technologies, ''STT'') for the June 2007 Bac Exam)\n* ''sciences et technologies de l'industrie et du d\u00e9veloppement durable'' (Industrial Science and Technologies and sustainable development, ''STI2D'')\n* ''sciences et technologies de laboratoire'' (Laboratory Science and Technologies, ''STL'')\n* ''sciences m\u00e9dico-sociales'' (Health and Social Sciences, ''SMS''): The name was changed in 2007 and became: ''Sciences et technologies de la sant\u00e9 et du social'' (Sciences and Technologies in Health and Social, ''ST2S'')\n* ''sciences et technologies du produit agroalimentaire'' (Food Science and Technologies, ''STPA'')\n* ''sciences et technologies de l'agronomie et de l'environnement'' (Agronomy and Environment Science and Technologies, ''STAE'')\n* ''techniques de la musique et de la danse'' (Music and Dance Techniques, ''TMD'')\n* ''h\u00f4tellerie'' (Hotel and restaurants management)\n\nThe STPA and STAE stream are available only in ''lyc\u00e9es agricoles'', speciality schools for [[agricultural sciences]].\n\nThe teaching of the lessons is based on inductive reasoning and experimentation. It allows you to work or to pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management etc.).\n\n===Lyc\u00e9e professionnel===\nThe ''lyc\u00e9e professionnel'' leads to the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel''. The courses are designed for students who do not plan to continue into higher education. The vocational training is for craftspeople and involves internships in commercial enterprises. The courses are suitable for students who are more interested in a hands-on educational approach than in academic schooling. There are nearly 100 specialties like : Leather crafts; Building technician; Maintenance of industrial equipment; Cooked; Road freight transport driver; Butcher etc.\n\n== Carte scolaire ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}\n[[File:Lycee Rennes DSC08932.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A lyc\u00e9e in [[Rennes]], from the 19th century.]]\nFrench parents are not free to choose the state school that their children will attend; unless the children have special learning needs, they will attend the school allocated to them by the ''carte scolaire'' (school map). Reasons for attending a state school that is not their nearest include studying an option unavailable in the school to which they were originally assigned (e.g. a rare foreign language).\n\nFor many reasons, many parents consider the allocated school inadequate, particularly if they do not like the idea of their children mixing with some of the other pupils at the school. That is especially the case in poor neighbourhoods with large foreign [[immigrant]] populations. In any city, there are \"better\" lyc\u00e9es and coll\u00e8ges, which parents would prefer their children attend (usually dating from the 19th century, in the city centre). The two main methods used in such circumstances to get children into a school other than their assigned school are:\n\n* paying for partly subsidised private schooling;\n* having the child choose an unusual option (e.g. Ancient Greek) available only in the preferred school.\n\nA similar trick is used if some classes in a school are seen as \"better\" than others. For organisational reasons, students taking certain options are grouped into special classes, which may be academically attractive. They typically include classes taking German as a first foreign language, or Latin or Ancient Greek as options.\n\n==Outside France==\n{{main article|Agence pour l'enseignement fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|France|Education}}\n* [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]]\n* [[Grandes \u00e9coles]]\n* [[Education in France]]\n* [[Agency for French Education Abroad]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.education.gouv.fr/index.php French Ministry of Education (in French)]\n* [http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/default.htm ''Bulletin Officiel'' (in French)]\n* [http://www.cndp.fr/secondaire/ ''Centre national de documentation p\u00e9dagogique'' website (in French)]\n* [http://about-france.com/primary-secondary-schools.htm The school system and education in France (in English)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secondary Education In France}}\n[[Category:Education in France]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in France| ]]\n[[Category:Secondary education by country|France]]\n", "name_user": "Largoplazo", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education_in_France"}
