{"title_page": "The Game of Chess (Sofonisba Anguissola)", "text_new": "{{Infobox artwork/wikidata}}\n'''''The Game of Chess''''' (or ''Portrait of the artist's sisters playing chess'') is a painting by [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] from [[1555]]. Anguissola was around 20 years old when she painted it. \n\nThe painting is signed and dated on the edge of the chessboard, where Anguissola left this inscription : \"SOPHONISBA ANGUSSOLA VIRGO AMILCARIS FILIA EX VERA EFFIGIE TRES SUAS SORORES ET ANCILLAM PINXIT MDLV\" - \"Sofonisba Angussola virgin daughter of Amilcare painted these three sisters and a maid from life.\"\n\n== History ==\n[[Giorgio Vasari]], visiting Cremona, was a guest in the house of Amilcare Anguissola and there admired paintings by Amilcare's daughters. About ''The Game of Chess'' he wrote, \"I have seen this year in Cremona, in the house of her father a painting made much with much diligence, the depiction of his three daughters, in the act of playing chess, and with them a old housemaid, done with such diligence and facility, that they appear alive, and they only thing missing is speech.\" This is the oldest document that mentions this painting, that remained hanging in the Anguissola family house for several years.<ref>Centro culturale \u2018Citt\u00e0 di Cremona\u2019 in S. Maria della Piet\u00e0 (Italy), et al., editors. ''Sofonisba Anguissola e Le Sue Sorelle''. Leonardo arte, 1994, p190</ref>\n\nThe painting later arrived in Rome, together with the ''[[Self-Portrait at a Spinet|Self Portrait at a Spinet]]'', and two of Anguissola's drawings ([[Child Bitten by a Lobster]] and an another unidentified drawing) in the holdings of the humanist and collector [[Fulvio Orsini]]. They were then inherited by Cardinale [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Odoardo Farnese]]. The Game of Chess then turned up in Naples, after the Farnese inheritance had passed to the Bourbons, and it was eventually acquired by [[Lucien Bonaparte|Luciano Bonaparte]]. It changed hands once more after this and arrived in the collection that today forms part of the [[National Museum, Pozna\u0144|Museo Narodowe]] in Poznan, Poland. \n\nThree engravings based on this painting are known.  \n\nThe painting has undergone evident repaintings. \n\n== Description ==\nIn an agreeable garden Luca, the third born of the Anguissola children, is moving some chess pieces; in front of her is Minerva, the fourth born, who is reacting to her adversary. She attracts the attention of the youngest sister, Europe (the fifth born) who is following the game and laughing. Minerva appears in a later painting (Portrait of the ''[[Portrait of the Artist's Family|Anguissola family),]]'' but as an adolescent. The Portrait of Europa was painted by [[Lucia Anguissola]] possibly in the year after. Europa Anguissola is also identifiable as the child in the pencil drawing, ''Old Woman Studying the Alphabet with a Laughing Girl,'' today in the Uffizi, where the maid is also present, but older than the woman that appears in ''The Game of Chess''. \n\nLucia is in action, while the housemaid observes the scene. There is a clear contrast in physiognomy between the younger (rich) women and the elder (common) woman. The young Anguissola women have jewels, embroidered clothes, elaborate hairstyles. Minerva wears the same necklace as the ''Portrait of a Lady'' that is in Berlin and now identified as Bianca Ponzoni Anguissola - the mother of the three girls around the chessboard. The picture takes place in a domestic setting, circled with friendly figures, but the competitiveness of a game of chess is also visible. \n\nIn the garden an old oak tree grows, laden in branches: it is a symbol of the solidity of family relationships. In the background is a light blue landscape, painted in the Flemish style.\n\nThe small youthful poem of the Cremonese poet and bishop of Alba [[Marco Girolamo Vida|Marco Gerolamo Vida]], entitled ''Scacchia Ludus'' was published in 1550.<ref>{{Citation|author=Marco Girolamo Vida|title=Poemata omnia.
