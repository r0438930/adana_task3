Based in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] and later in [[DeSoto, Texas]], the Sky Ryders was a member corps of [[Drum Corps International]] and a six time DCI World Championship Finalist.<ref name=\"sky\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Sky Ryders History]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe organization was first established as a junior corps in 1952 called the Lysle Rishel Post 68 Drum & Bugle Corps and led by director Ken Fairbrother, a former member of the Hawthorne Caballeros. In 1955, under the direction of H.D. \"Prof\" McCosh, the corps was reorganized and adopted the name Sky Ryders.  In 1957, they began winning competitions in Kansas, and in 1959 they started competing in American Legion national competitions. They won their first [[American Legion]] Kansas state Championship in 1959, repeated in 1960-62, and won another in 1964. In 1959, the corps also attended its first American Legion National championship, placing tenth of 24 junior corps. This was followed by American Legion Nationals finishes of 6th, 5th, and 4th the following three seasons and 3rd in 1964.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\">{{cite book | title=A History of Drum & Bugle Corps | volume=Vol. 2 | first=Steve | last=Vickers | publisher=Drum Corps World | date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe corps experienced financial and membership issues in 1966, taking the season off after nearly disbanding. When it returned in 1967, it was largely with members of their feeder corps, the Jets, and with girls allowed into the brass and percussion sections rather than being restricted to the color guard.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1969, brass instructor John Simpson recruited Larry Kerchner to collaborate on the corps' music. The corps had a successful year, again winning the Kansas American Legion title and placing 7th at the American Legion Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1967 through 1971, the corps mostly confined its travel to Kansas and the surrounding states. At around that same time, the Sky Ryders were one of the first corps to make the switch from French horns to mellophones for mid-range voices.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1972, the Sky Ryders traveled to [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] for the inaugural Drum Corps International World Championship, placing 20th of the 39 corps from across the USA and Canada. The corps would not return to the DCI Championships until competing as a Class A corps at [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Denver]] in 1977, where they finished in 3rd place. Up until that time, the Sky Ryders had always been a hometown corps, drawing its members exclusively from the Hutchinson area, but in 1977, the corps began to recruit from a wider area.  In 1978, the corps switched from Class A to Open Class and had increasing success, placing 31st in Denver that year and to 22nd  and 17th in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] the next two years. During that time, corps director George Tuthill and brass instructor John Simpson attracted many members from Oklahoma and Texas, and Kerchner's unique and melodic arrangements were popular with fans and judges.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Tuthill set out to get the Sky Ryders into DCI's elite Top 12. In 1981, they placed 14th in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] at the first DCI Championships held outside the United States. In 1982, Tuthill's goal was accomplished with a 10th-place finish in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The corps' huge rainbow flag, unfolded behind the corps during their show and displayed in the stands afterwards, and their closing number of \"Over the Rainbow\" quickly became Sky Ryders traditions.  In 1983, the Sky Ryders received particular attention performing Kerchner's Grammy-nominated jazz arrangement of \"Home on the Range,\" and for the second year in a row, the corps placed in DCI's Top 12 with a 12th-place finish in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nThe corps dropped out of DCI Finals in 1984, placing 17th in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1985, the corps had a stronger year with a 15th-place finish at [[Camp Randall Stadium]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], performing the first of two successive productions of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Starting in 1986, under the direction of alumnus Dale Antoine and a design team led by Tommy Keenum, the Sky Ryders returned to DCI's Top 12. Over the next three years, they entertained audiences with dramatized productions of the popular musicals \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"West Side Story,\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and gained a reputation as \"The Great Story Tellers.\" Their \"Wizard of Oz\" show in 1986 included elements such as a Wicked Witch riding a bicycle, gold lam\u00e9 \"yellow brick road\" flags, and colorful guard costumes for the various characters in the film. They finished the year with the corps' highest placement of 9th in Madison.1987's \"West Side Story\" placed 12th as did 1988's \"The Sound of Music\", with both of those programs also containing costuming and actions that helped to tell the story.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nAfter achieving popularity, the corps suddenly switched directions in 1989 with cadet-style uniforms and a more darkly themed show, including \"March (from Symphonic Metamorphosis)\" and selections from \"Carmina Burana.\" The corps finished the season out of DCI Finals with a Semifinals tie for 14th place. The stylistic change and the fall from Finals were elements in the  financial difficulties the corps faced in 1990. From its roots as a hometown corps, the Sky Ryders had evolved into a corps with mostly out-of-state members, with the bulk of those members coming from Texas, so, in order to survive, the corps' leadership relocated the organization to [[De Soto, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].  After the challenges of the move to Texas, the corps finished the 1990 season in 19th place during DCI Semifinals in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the Sky Ryders once again regained DCI Top 12 status with a return to the corps' tradition of popular musicals, this time with Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot.\" The corps placed 12th in DCI Finals held in their new hometown of Dallas. The corps performed another popular Lerner and Loewe musical in 1992 with the Scottish-themed \"Brigadoon,\" but during DCI's 20th Anniversary Championships in Madison, the corps only placed 15th in Semifinals.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the Sky Ryders once more abandoned their successful formula for a \"more contemporary show\", including \"Connotations\" by Edward Gregson and \"Symphony No. 2\" by David Diamond, and the corps finished their last full season of competition with a placement of 20th in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. Despite plans for a 1994 season, the corps' continuing financial difficulties resulted in bankruptcy and the disbanding of the corps. Although the corps had departed the scene, the efforts of the unit's director during its Texas tenure, Paul Proctor, saw that all of the corps' substantial debt was eventually paid off.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\n== Show summary (1960\u20131993)==\nThe following is a list of Sky Ryders shows from 1960 to 1993.<ref name=\"songhistory\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpsdet&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Song History for Sky Ryders]</ref>\n\n''Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.''\n\n{|border = \"1\" style = \"text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse; width:100%\"\n|-\n!

Up until that time, the Sky Ryders had always been a hometown corps, drawing its members exclusively from the Hutchinson area, but in 1977, the corps began to recruit from a wider area.  In 1978, the corps switched from Class A to Open Class and had increasing success, placing 31st in Denver that year and to 22nd  and 17th in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] the next two years. During that time, corps director George Tuthill and brass instructor John Simpson attracted many members from Oklahoma and Texas, and Kerchner's unique and melodic arrangements were popular with fans and judges.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Tuthill set out to get the Sky Ryders into DCI's elite Top 12. In 1981, they placed 14th in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] at the first DCI Championships held outside the United States. In 1982, Tuthill's goal was accomplished with a 10th-place finish in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The corps' huge rainbow flag, unfolded behind the corps during their show and displayed in the stands afterwards, and their closing number of \"Over the Rainbow\" quickly became Sky Ryders traditions.  In 1983, the Sky Ryders received particular attention performing Kerchner's Grammy-nominated jazz arrangement of \"Home on the Range,\" and for the second year in a row, the corps placed in DCI's Top 12 with a 12th-place finish in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nThe corps dropped out of DCI Finals in 1984, placing 17th in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1985, the corps had a stronger year with a 15th-place finish at [[Camp Randall Stadium]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], performing the first of two successive productions of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Starting in 1986, under the direction of alumnus Dale Antoine and a design team led by Tommy Keenum, the Sky Ryders returned to DCI's Top 12. Over the next three years, they entertained audiences with dramatized productions of the popular musicals \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"West Side Story,\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and gained a reputation as \"The Great Story Tellers.\" Their \"Wizard of Oz\" show in 1986 included elements such as a Wicked Witch riding a bicycle, gold lam\u00e9 \"yellow brick road\" flags, and colorful guard costumes for the various characters in the film. They finished the year with the corps' highest placement of 9th in Madison.1987's \"West Side Story\" placed 12th as did 1988's \"The Sound of Music\", with both of those programs also containing costuming and actions that helped to tell the story.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nAfter achieving popularity, the corps suddenly switched directions in 1989 with cadet-style uniforms and a more darkly themed show, including \"March (from Symphonic Metamorphosis)\" and selections from \"Carmina Burana.\" The corps finished the season out of DCI Finals with a Semifinals tie for 14th place. The stylistic change and the fall from Finals were elements in the  financial difficulties the corps faced in 1990. From its roots as a hometown corps, the Sky Ryders had evolved into a corps with mostly out-of-state members, with the bulk of those members coming from Texas, so, in order to survive, the corps' leadership relocated the organization to [[De Soto, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].  After the challenges of the move to Texas, the corps finished the 1990 season in 19th place during DCI Semifinals in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the Sky Ryders once again regained DCI Top 12 status with a return to the corps' tradition of popular musicals, this time with Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot.\" The corps placed 12th in DCI Finals held in their new hometown of Dallas. The corps performed another popular Lerner and Loewe musical in 1992 with the Scottish-themed \"Brigadoon,\" but during DCI's 20th Anniversary Championships in Madison, the corps only placed 15th in Semifinals.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the Sky Ryders once more abandoned their successful formula for a \"more contemporary show\", including \"Connotations\" by Edward Gregson and \"Symphony No. 2\" by David Diamond, and the corps finished their last full season of competition with a placement of 20th in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. Despite plans for a 1994 season, the corps' continuing financial difficulties resulted in bankruptcy and the disbanding of the corps. Although the corps had departed the scene, the efforts of the unit's director during its Texas tenure, Paul Proctor, saw that all of the corps' substantial debt was eventually paid off.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\n== Show summary (1960\u20131993)==\nThe following is a list of Sky Ryders shows from 1960 to 1993.<ref name=\"songhistory\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpsdet&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Song History for Sky Ryders]</ref>\n\n''Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.''\n\n{|border = \"1\" style = \"text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse; width:100%\"\n|-\n!
