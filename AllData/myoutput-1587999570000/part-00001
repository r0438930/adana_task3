Built in 1927-1929 in the [[Neo-Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles, it was designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris]].\n\nThe current structure is the third to be erected on the same plot, as the [[Bank of New York]] had previously erected buildings on the site in 1797 and 1858. The structure was erected during a period when many skyscrapers were being erected in Lower Manhattan. 48 Wall Street is designed with a multitude of neo-Georgian details. The lowest three stories, built over a raised [[basement]], were used as the banking floor and feature large arched windows on the second story, as well as [[pediment]]s over the entrances. The top of the building contains a [[cupola]] designed in the [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style and topped by a statue of an eagle.\n\nIn 2007, its former banking hall was modified to house the [[Museum of American Finance]], which closed in 2018 and was replaced by Will & Wall, a multi-purpose event venue. The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001, and was designated a city landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1998.\n\n==Site==\n48 Wall Street is located at the northeast corner of [[Wall Street|Wall]] and [[William Street (Manhattan)|William Streets]], facing Wall Street to the south and William Street to the west.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://maps.nyc.gov/|title=NYCityMap|last=|first=|date=|website=NYC.gov|publisher=[[New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref>  The building has a frontage of {{Convert|99|ft||abbr=}} on Wall Street and {{Convert|125|ft||abbr=}} on William Street.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 4\" /><ref name=\"NPS p. 3\">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2003|ps=.|p=3}}</ref> The lot is largely rectangular with \"slightly irregular\" variations.

The lowest three stories, built over a raised [[basement]], were used as the banking floor and feature large arched windows on the second story, as well as [[pediment]]s over the entrances.
