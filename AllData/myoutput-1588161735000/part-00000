The original layout was a central high pulpit with galleries either side. Later it was remodelled into two rooms, the galleries were removed and the pulpit remodelled. A large maintenance was undertaken by [[Alexander_Ross_(architect)]] which included adding skews. In the final remodelling a gallery was placed at the opposite end to the pulpit. Under the gallery are two vestry rooms, steps up to the gallery and a passageway to the porch. The entrance porch was an addition during the remodelling. This is a newer front door as the original access was through two doors either side of the pulpit, these were blocked up when two doors in the rear wall were added, one of these was blocked up when the new porch entrance was added. In fact, the blocked entrance door in the west rear wall was turned into a window. At some point the raised wooden floors were added, as before that it was a soil floor with boards over. <ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lochcarronchurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lochcarronchurchhistory.pdf|title=History of Church PDF|website=lochcarronchurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lochcarronchurchhistory.pdf|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nMajor alterations summary:<br>\n1. Initial design: one large room, galleries either side, high central pulpit with external doors either side of it. The 700 to 800 person capacity.<br>\n2.

Returned to a large room with a gallery installed, with vestry rooms under, at the opposite end to the pulpit. External door opened under gallery. Rear west door sealed.\n\nThe building still contains a '''rare long central communion table''' (similar to the ones in Ardchattan Kirk near Oban and [[Howmore#Church]] in the Outer Hebrides, although the East Kirk table is a continuous table, without a break) and the remodelled pulpit and altar. The wooden floors are intact. It is 26 feet from the floor to the rafters. Though the building looks small from the outside, it is actually very large.

The glass is clear, and not stained glass, in order to 'let in the light of the lord'.\n\n'''History: '''The building is private hands since the council sold it in 2005. Previous to 2005 the building had been used for a long time for only funerals. Its size counted against it, as the church divided several times after its being built, starting with the [[Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843\u20131900)|division]] between the Church of Scotland and the Free Church. The large kirk was no longer needed as other churches were built in the village. In addition to East Kirk and the old East Kirk, there are four more churches in Lochcarron, three currently active. The East Kirk was always notoriously hard to heat with 30 inch thick stone walls, and most remember it as a very cold building to be in. Hence, over its later life the building was rather neglected. From 2005 to 2018 it was left mostly untouched after that owner removed the pews, organ and plaster walls. All this was burnt. In 2018 it changed hands again and it now in a process of renovation. The current owners intend to restore it to original condition, although the roof has \"nail sickness\" and needs attention first. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lochcarronchurch.com/about/|title=Lochcarronchurh.com|website=lochcarronchurch.com/about/|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
