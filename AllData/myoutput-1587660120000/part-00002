The show was later renamed ''[[Seinfeld]]'' to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom ''The Marshall Chronicles''. By its third season, it had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-run. Along with Seinfeld, the show starred ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veteran [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and experienced actors [[Michael Richards]] and [[Jason Alexander]]. Alexander played George, a caricature of [[Larry David]]. Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode of the show.<ref>Jason Alexander did not appear in \"[[The Pen]]\"; Julia Louis-Dreyfus did not appear in [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot]], \"[[The Trip, Part 1]]\", or \"[[The Trip, Part 2]]\"; and Michael Richards did not appear in \"[[The Chinese Restaurant]]\" or \"The Pen\".</ref>\n\nSeinfeld has said that his show was influenced by the 1950s sitcom ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. In the \"Seinfeld Season 6\" DVD set, commenting on the episode \"[[The Gymnast]]\", Seinfeld cited [[Jean Shepherd]] as an influence, saying, \"He really formed my entire comedic sensibility\u2014I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.\" From 2004 to 2007, the former ''Seinfeld'' cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show.\n\n===Post-''Seinfeld''===\nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to [[New York City]] to make a comeback with his [[stand-up comedy]] rather than stay in [[Los Angeles]] and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines. In the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan \"[[Think different]]\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] of ''Seinfeld''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |title=Seinfeld's commercial |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221221/http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>[[File:Jerry Seinfeld (1997).jpg|thumb|Seinfeld at the [[1996 Emmy Awards]]|alt=|left|235x235px]] In 2004, Seinfeld appeared in two commercial [[webisode]]s promoting [[American Express]], titled ''[[The Adventures of Seinfeld & Superman]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/30/business/media-business-advertising-seinfeld-superman-join-forces-again-spots-for.html |title=Seinfeld and Superman join forces again in spots for American Express, this time on the Web. |last=Elliott |first=Stuart |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 30, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref> In these, Seinfeld appeared with a cartoon rendering of [[Superman]], who was referenced in numerous episodes of ''Seinfeld'' as Seinfeld's hero, voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]] (character [[David Puddy]] on ''Seinfeld'').

The show was later renamed ''[[Seinfeld]]'' to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom ''The Marshall Chronicles''. By its third season, it had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-run. Along with Seinfeld, the show starred ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veteran [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and experienced actors [[Michael Richards]] and [[Jason Alexander]]. Alexander played George, a caricature of [[Larry David]]. Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode of the show.<ref>Jason Alexander did not appear in \"[[The Pen]]\"; Julia Louis-Dreyfus did not appear in [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot]], \"[[The Trip, Part 1]]\", or \"[[The Trip, Part 2]]\"; and Michael Richards did not appear in \"[[The Chinese Restaurant]]\" or \"The Pen\".</ref>\n\nSeinfeld has said that his show was influenced by the 1950s sitcom ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. In the \"Seinfeld Season 6\" DVD set, commenting on the episode \"[[The Gymnast]]\", Seinfeld cited [[Jean Shepherd]] as an influence, saying, \"He really formed my entire comedic sensibility\u2014I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.\" From 2004 to 2007, the former ''Seinfeld'' cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show.\n\n===Post-''Seinfeld''===\nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to [[New York City]] to make a comeback with his [[stand-up comedy]] rather than stay in [[Los Angeles]] and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines. In the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan \"[[Think different]]\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] of ''Seinfeld''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |title=Seinfeld's commercial |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221221/http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>[[File:Jerry Seinfeld (1997).jpg|thumb|Seinfeld at the [[1996 Emmy Awards]]|alt=|left|235x235px]] In 2004, Seinfeld appeared in two commercial [[webisode]]s promoting [[American Express]], titled ''[[The Adventures of Seinfeld & Superman]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/30/business/media-business-advertising-seinfeld-superman-join-forces-again-spots-for.html |title=Seinfeld and Superman join forces again in spots for American Express, this time on the Web. |last=Elliott |first=Stuart |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 30, 2004 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref> In these, Seinfeld appeared with a cartoon rendering of [[Superman]], who was referenced in numerous episodes of ''Seinfeld'' as Seinfeld's hero, voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]] (character [[David Puddy]] on ''Seinfeld'').

Seinfeld and \"Superman\" were also interviewed by [[Matt Lauer]] in a specially recorded interview for the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show. On November 18, 2004, Seinfeld appeared at the [[National Museum of American History]] to donate the \"puffy shirt\" he wore in the ''Seinfeld'' episode [[The Puffy Shirt|of the same name]]. He also gave a speech when presenting the \"puffy shirt\", saying humorously that \"This is the most embarrassing moment of my life.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} On May 13, 2006, Seinfeld had a cameo appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'' as host Julia Louis-Dreyfus' assassin. Louis-Dreyfus in her opening monolog mentioned the \"Seinfeld curse\". While talking about how ridiculous the \"curse\" was, a [[Stage lighting instrument|stage light]] suddenly fell next to her. The camera moved to a [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalk]] above the stage where Seinfeld was standing, holding a large pair of bolt cutters. He angrily muttered, \"Damn it!\" upset that it did not hit her. Louis-Dreyfus continued to say that she is indeed not cursed.\n\nOn February 25, 2007, Seinfeld appeared at the [[79th Academy Awards]] as the presenter for \"Best Documentary\".

In August 2008, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Jerry Seinfeld would be the pitchman for [[Windows Vista]], as part of a $300-million advertising campaign by Microsoft.
