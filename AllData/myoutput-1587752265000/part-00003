The single peaked at number 20 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B Singles]] chart. There was no music video made for the song.\n\nThe song is about two good friends that realize that they have romantic feelings for each other and are more than just friends \u2014 they love each other, and they \"didn't know.\" Houston and Wonder performed the song on an episode of ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' in December 1990.\n\n[[Arista Records]] stopped working the album's singles to top 40 after \"[[My Name Is Not Susan]]\" became her first solo single to not reach the top ten. The duet was thus never sent to pop radio. \"We Didn't Know\" and the prior release, \"[[I Belong to You (Whitney Houston song)|I Belong To You]],\" were both R&B-only releases. The song managed a decent placing despite no video and being a nearly two-year-old track by the time of its release.\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' adored the song and praised it with a long review: \"Still, the key to the kind of music Houston sings on I'm Your Baby Tonight \u2014 the black-and-white, funk-and-dance-driven pop that is the soundtrack of this cultural moment \u2014 is \"We Didn't Know,\" Houston's duet with producer Stevie Wonder.
