Venezuela disputed Schomburgk's placing of border markers at the Orinoco river, and in 1844 claimed all of Guiana west of the [[Essequibo River]]. Also in 1844, a British proposal to Venezuela to modify the border to give Venezuela full control of the Orinoco river mouth and adjacent territory was ignored.

This treaty specifically stipulated the legal framework for the arbitration, and its first article stated that'' \"An arbitral Tribunal shall be immediately appointed to determine the boundary line between the United States of Venezuela and the Colony of British Guiana\".''\n\nThe Treaty provided the legal framework, procedures and conditions for the Tribunal in order to solve the issue and reach to determinate a border. Its third article established that ''\"The Tribunal shall investigate and ascertain the extent of the territories belonging to, or that might lawfully be claimed by the United Netherlands or by the Kingdom of Spain respectively at the time of the acquisition by Great Britain of the Colony of British Guiana, and shall determine the boundary line between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela\"''.

Venezuela reiterated its claim to the district immediately west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near its junction with the [[Mazaruni River]], and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border. \n\nOn 3 October 1899 the Tribunal [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895#Arbitration|ruled largely in favour of Britain]]. The Schomburgk Line was, with two deviations, established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" /> One deviation was that Venezuela received [[Barima Point]] at the mouth of the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second placed the border at the [[Wenamu River]] rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela substantial territory east of the line. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the gold mines.<ref>King (2007:260)</ref>\n\nThe Venezuelan representatives, claiming that Britain had unduly influenced the decision of the Russian member of the tribunal, protested the outcome. Periodic protests, however, were confined to the domestic political arena and international diplomatic forums.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/venezuela/forrel-guyana.htm Globalsecurity.org, \"Venezuela \u2013 Guyana Relations\"]</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Essequiborivermap.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of Guyana, showing the [[Essequibo River]] and (shaded dark) the river's drainage basin.

This territory included the Attacuri river and Point Barima, which is of the greatest value strategically and commercially. The award  gives Point Barima, with a strip of land fifty miles long, to Venezuela, which thereby obtains entire control of the River Orinoco. Three thousand square miles in the interior are also awarded to Venezuela. Thus, by a decision in which the British arbitrators concurred, the position taken by Great Britain in 1895 is shown to be unfounded [...] The President of the tribunal in his closing address today had commented upon the unanimity of the present judgment and had referred to it as a proof of the success of the arbitration, but it did not require much intelligence to penetrate behind this superficial statement and to see that the line drawn is a line of compromise and not a line of right. If the British contention was right, the line should have been drawn further west; if it were wrong, the line should have been drawn much further east. There was nothing in the history of the controversy, nor in the legal principle involved, which could adequately explain why the line should be drawn where it had been. So long as arbitration was conducted on such principles, it could not be regarded as a success, at least by those who believe that arbitration should result in the admission of legal rights and not in compromises really diplomatic in character. Venezuela had gained much, but was entitled to much more, and if the arbitrators were unanimous, it must be because their failure to agree would have confirmed Great Britain in the possession of even more territory\".''<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=37&dat=18991004&id=tV0DAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tigDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3846,6830090 \"Venezuelan Award: the decision of the Commission regarded as a Compromise\"], in ''Saint John Daily Sun'', Canada.

As early as 7 October 1899 Venezuela voiced her condemnation of the Award, and demanded the renegotiation of her eastern border with British Guiana: that day, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Andrade made clear that the Arbitral Award was the product of political collusion and it should not be adhered to by Venezuela..<ref name=\":6\">Kissler, Betty Jane, ''Venezuela-Guyana boundary dispute :1899\u20131966'', University of Texas (USA, 1972). pages 166, 172</ref><ref name=\":7\">Kaiyan Homi Kaikobad, ''Interpretation and Revision of International Boundary Decisions'', Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law (Cambridge University, U.K., 2007). p. 43</ref> \n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n==== Renewed dispute ====\nOn 26 October 1899 in a letter to a colleague, [[Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle|Severo Mallet-Prevost]], the Official Secretary of the US\u2013Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration, stated that the Arbitral Award was the result of pressures brought on the judges by the President of the Tribunal, [[Friedrich Martens]].\n\nAfter numerous bilateral diplomatic attempts failed to convince Great Britain of her seriousness to nullify the award, Venezuela denounced it before the first assembly of the United Nations, in 1945.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government a memorandum written by Mallet-Prevost, which was written in 1944 to be published only after his death.

The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3 to 2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens to avoid depriving Venezuela of even more territory.<ref name=\"Schoenrich\" /> This memorandum provided a motive for Venezuela's contentions that there had in fact been a political deal between the British judges and the Russian judge at the Arbitral Tribunal, and led to Venezuela's revival of its claim to the disputed territory.<ref>Isidro Morales Pa\u00fal, ''An\u00e1lisis Cr\u00edtico del Problema Fronterizo \"Venezuela-Gran Breta\u00f1a\"'', in La Reclamaci\u00f3n Venezolana sobre la Guayana Esequiba, Biblioteca de la Academia de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas y Sociales.

Guyana did not accept that the 1899 decision was invalid, and held that its participation on the commission was only to resolve Venezuela's assertions. \n*Rather than that, the Venezuelan counterparts argued that the Commission did not have a juridical nature or purpose but a deal-making one, so it should go ahead to find \"a practical and satisfactory solution\", as agreed in the treaty. Venezuela also claimed that the nullity of the Arbitral Award of 1899 was implicit, or otherwise the existence of the agreement would be meaningless.\n\nThe fifth article of the Geneva Agreement established the status of the disputed territories. The provisions state that no acts or activities taking place on the disputed territories while the Agreement is in force \"shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty\". The agreement also has a provision prohibiting both nations from pursuing the issue except through official inter-government channels.\n\nIn its note of recognition of the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela stated:\n\n<blockquote>Venezuela recognises as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.</blockquote>\n\n====Annexation of Ankoko Island====\nFive months after Guyana's independence from the United Kingdom, Venezuelan troops began their occupation of [[Ankoko Island]] in October 1966. Venezuelan troops quickly constructed military installations and an airstrip.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Latin America and Caribbean Contemporary Record: 1982-1983, Volume 2|last=Hopkins|first=Jack

Their concern led to the Port of Spain Protocol in 1970.\n\n====Port of Spain Protocol====\nIn 1970, after the expiration of the Mixed Commission established according to the Geneva Agreement, Presidents [[Rafael Caldera]] and [[Forbes Burnham]] signed the Port of Spain Protocol, which declared a 12-year moratorium on Venezuela's reclamation of Guayana Esequiba, with the purpose of allowing both governments to promote cooperation and understanding while the border claim was in abeyance. Venezuelan maps produced since 1970 show the entire area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the \"Zone in Reclamation\".<ref>[http://www.guyana.org/features/trail_diplomacy.html Ishmael, Dr. Odeen. \"The Trail of Diplomacy \u2013 A Documentary History of the Guyana-Venezuela Border Issue\"]</ref>\n\nIn 1983 the deadline of the Port of Spain Protocol expired, and the Venezuelan President [[Luis Herrera Campins]] decided not to extend it anymore and resume the effective claim over the territory.

The Norwegian [[Dag Nylander]] appointed in March 2017, is the latest personal representative in these efforts selected by the UN Secretary General [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]]. It was stated that if by December 2017 the UN understood that there was no \"significant progress\" in resolving the dispute, Guterres would refer the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, unless the two countries explicitly requested it not to do so.

This treaty specifically stipulated the legal framework for the arbitration, and its first article stated that'' \"An arbitral Tribunal shall be immediately appointed to determine the boundary line between the United States of Venezuela and the Colony of British Guiana\".''\n\nThe Treaty provided the legal framework, procedures and conditions for the Tribunal in order to solve the issue and reach to determinate a border. Its third article established that ''\"The Tribunal shall investigate and ascertain the extent of the territories belonging to, or that might lawfully be claimed by the United Netherlands or by the Kingdom of Spain respectively at the time of the acquisition by Great Britain of the Colony of British Guiana, and shall determine the boundary line between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela\"''.

Venezuela reiterated its claim to the district immediately west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near its junction with the [[Mazaruni River]], and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border. \n\nOn 3 October 1899 the Tribunal [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895#Arbitration|ruled largely in favour of Britain]]. The Schomburgk Line was, with two deviations, established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela.<ref name=\"Humphreys\" /> One deviation was that Venezuela received [[Barima Point]] at the mouth of the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second placed the border at the [[Wenamu River]] rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela substantial territory east of the line. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the gold mines.<ref>King (2007:260)</ref>\n\nThe Venezuelan representatives, claiming that Britain had unduly influenced the decision of the Russian member of the tribunal, protested the outcome. Periodic protests, however, were confined to the domestic political arena and international diplomatic forums.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/venezuela/forrel-guyana.htm Globalsecurity.org, \"Venezuela \u2013 Guyana Relations\"]</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Essequiborivermap.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of Guyana, showing the [[Essequibo River]] and (shaded dark) the river's drainage basin.

This territory included the Attacuri river and Point Barima, which is of the greatest value strategically and commercially. The award  gives Point Barima, with a strip of land fifty miles long, to Venezuela, which thereby obtains entire control of the River Orinoco. Three thousand square miles in the interior are also awarded to Venezuela. Thus, by a decision in which the British arbitrators concurred, the position taken by Great Britain in 1895 is shown to be unfounded [...] The President of the tribunal in his closing address today had commented upon the unanimity of the present judgment and had referred to it as a proof of the success of the arbitration, but it did not require much intelligence to penetrate behind this superficial statement and to see that the line drawn is a line of compromise and not a line of right. If the British contention was right, the line should have been drawn further west; if it were wrong, the line should have been drawn much further east. There was nothing in the history of the controversy, nor in the legal principle involved, which could adequately explain why the line should be drawn where it had been. So long as arbitration was conducted on such principles, it could not be regarded as a success, at least by those who believe that arbitration should result in the admission of legal rights and not in compromises really diplomatic in character. Venezuela had gained much, but was entitled to much more, and if the arbitrators were unanimous, it must be because their failure to agree would have confirmed Great Britain in the possession of even more territory\".''<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=37&dat=18991004&id=tV0DAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tigDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3846,6830090 \"Venezuelan Award: the decision of the Commission regarded as a Compromise\"], in ''Saint John Daily Sun'', Canada.

As early as 7 October 1899 Venezuela voiced her condemnation of the Award, and demanded the renegotiation of her eastern border with British Guiana: that day, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Andrade made clear that the Arbitral Award was the product of political collusion and it should not be adhered to by Venezuela..<ref name=\":6\">Kissler, Betty Jane, ''Venezuela-Guyana boundary dispute :1899\u20131966'', University of Texas (USA, 1972). pages 166, 172</ref><ref name=\":7\">Kaiyan Homi Kaikobad, ''Interpretation and Revision of International Boundary Decisions'', Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law (Cambridge University, U.K., 2007). p. 43</ref> \n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n==== Renewed dispute ====\nOn 26 October 1899 in a letter to a colleague, [[Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle|Severo Mallet-Prevost]], the Official Secretary of the US\u2013Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration, stated that the Arbitral Award was the result of pressures brought on the judges by the President of the Tribunal, [[Friedrich Martens]].\n\nAfter numerous bilateral diplomatic attempts failed to convince Great Britain of her seriousness to nullify the award, Venezuela denounced it before the first assembly of the United Nations, in 1945.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government a memorandum written by Mallet-Prevost, which was written in 1944 to be published only after his death.

The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3 to 2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens to avoid depriving Venezuela of even more territory.<ref name=\"Schoenrich\" /> This memorandum provided a motive for Venezuela's contentions that there had in fact been a political deal between the British judges and the Russian judge at the Arbitral Tribunal, and led to Venezuela's revival of its claim to the disputed territory.<ref>Isidro Morales Pa\u00fal, ''An\u00e1lisis Cr\u00edtico del Problema Fronterizo \"Venezuela-Gran Breta\u00f1a\"'', in La Reclamaci\u00f3n Venezolana sobre la Guayana Esequiba, Biblioteca de la Academia de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas y Sociales.

By searching on the British official archives, Wetter provided further evidence of the deal between Britain and Russia, what made him conclude that the ruling was marred by serious procedural and substantive defects, evidence that it was more a political compromise than a court ruling. Uruguayan jurist Eduardo Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga, former President of the [[International Court of Justice]], came to similar conclusions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Geneva Agreement====\nAt a meeting in [[Geneva]] on 17 February 1966, the governments of British Guiana, the United Kingdom and Venezuela signed the \"Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana\", best known thereafter as the [[Geneva Agreement (1966)]]. This agreement established the regulatory framework to be followed by the parties in order to resolve the issue. According to the agreement a Mixed Commission was installed with the purpose of seeking satisfactory solutions for the practical settlement of the border controversy,<ref>[http://peacemaker.un.org/guyana-venezuela-border66 Treaty of Geneva 1966], Document Retrieval, UN Department of Political Affairs</ref> but the parties never agreed to implement a solution within this Commission due to different interpretations of the agreement.\n\n*Guyana argued that prior to starting the negotiations over the border issue, Venezuela should prove that the Arbitral Award of 1899 was null and void. Guyana did not accept that the 1899 decision was invalid, and held that its participation on the commission was only to resolve Venezuela's assertions. \n*Rather than that, the Venezuelan counterparts argued that the Commission did not have a juridical nature or purpose but a deal-making one, so it should go ahead to find \"a practical and satisfactory solution\", as agreed in the treaty. Venezuela also claimed that the nullity of the Arbitral Award of 1899 was implicit, or otherwise the existence of the agreement would be meaningless.\n\nThe fifth article of the Geneva Agreement established the status of the disputed territories. The provisions state that no acts or activities taking place on the disputed territories while the Agreement is in force \"shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty\". The agreement also has a provision prohibiting both nations from pursuing the issue except through official inter-government channels.\n\nIn its note of recognition of the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela stated:\n\n<blockquote>Venezuela recognises as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.</blockquote>\n\n====Annexation of Ankoko Island====\nFive months after Guyana's independence from the United Kingdom, Venezuelan troops began their occupation of [[Ankoko Island]] in October 1966.

Venezuelan maps produced since 1970 show the entire area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the \"Zone in Reclamation\".<ref>[http://www.guyana.org/features/trail_diplomacy.html Ishmael, Dr. Odeen. \"The Trail of Diplomacy \u2013 A Documentary History of the Guyana-Venezuela Border Issue\"]</ref>\n\nIn 1983 the deadline of the Port of Spain Protocol expired, and the Venezuelan President [[Luis Herrera Campins]] decided not to extend it anymore and resume the effective claim over the territory.

The Norwegian [[Dag Nylander]] appointed in March 2017, is the latest personal representative in these efforts selected by the UN Secretary General [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]]. It was stated that if by December 2017 the UN understood that there was no \"significant progress\" in resolving the dispute, Guterres would refer the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, unless the two countries explicitly requested it not to do so.
