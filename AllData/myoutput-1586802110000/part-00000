While still at college he acted as a sub-editor of ''Chambers's Etymological Dictionary,'' and subsequently became assistant to [[Samuel Halkett]], librarian of the [[Advocates' Library]].\n\nIn June 1871, on Halkett's death, Jamieson was appointed keeper of the library, and the work of printing the catalogue passed into his care. In 1872 he wrote a prefatory notice for an edition of [[Archie Armstrong]]'s ''Banquet of Jests,'' and in 1874 edited a reprint of Barclay's translation of Brandt's ''Ship of Fools,'' to which he prefixed a notice of [[Sebastian Brandt]] and his writings. In 1874 he also privately printed a ''Notice of the Life and Writings of [[Alexander Barclay]].''\n\nThe fire which occurred in the Advocates' Library in the summer of 1875 roused him to exertions beyond his strength, and he died at 7 Gillespie Crescent, [[Edinburgh]], on 9 January 1876, aged only 32. He married, on 11 June 1872, Jane Alison Kilgour, by whom he left two children.\n\n==References==\n*{{DNB|wstitle=Jamieson, Thomas Hill}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Jamieson,+T.+H.+(Thomas+Hill) | name=Thomas Hill Jamieson}}\n* {{Internet Archive author}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2010}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jamieson, Thomas Hill}}\n[[Category:1843 births]]\n[[Category:1876 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Arbroath]]\n[[Category:Scottish librarians]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n", "text_old": "'''Thomas Hill Jamieson''' (1843\u20131876) was a Scottish librarian.\n\n==Biography==\n\nJamieson, born in August 1843 at Bonnington, near [[Arbroath]], in Scotland, was educated at the burgh and parochial school of that town, and afterwards (1862) at [[Edinburgh High School]] and University.
