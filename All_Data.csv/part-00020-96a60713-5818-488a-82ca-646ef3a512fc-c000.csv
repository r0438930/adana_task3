'''Lacombe''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|m}}) is a city in central [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It is located approximately {{convert|25|km|mi}} north of [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], the nearest major city, and {{convert|125|km|mi}} south of [[Edmonton]], the nearest metropolitan area. The city is set in the rolling parkland of [[central Alberta]], between the [[Rocky Mountains]] foothills to the west and the flatter Alberta prairie to the east.

Lacombe became [[List of cities in Alberta|Alberta's 17th city]] on September 5, 2010.<ref name=CityStatusOC>{{cite web |url= http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/orders/orders_in_council/2010/710/2010_223.html |author=Alberta Queen's Printer |title=Order in Council (O.C.) 223/2010 |accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref>

== History ==
{{stack|[[File:Lacombe 7 (HS85-10-19886).jpg|thumb|200px|Downtown Lacombe in 1908]]}}
Lacombe is named after [[Albert Lacombe]] (28 February 1827 &mdash; 12 December 1916), a French-Canadian Roman Catholic [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Oblate]] missionary what  lived among and evangelized the [[Cree]] and [[Blackfoot]] First Nations of western Canada.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url= http://www.lacombe.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=334&Itemid=86 | title= History | author= Town of Lacombe | date= February 2007 | accessdate= 2007-03-08 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131223/http://www.lacombe.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=334&Itemid=86 | archivedate= 2007-09-28 }}</ref> He is now remembered for having brokered a peace between the Cree and Blackfoot, negotiating construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through Blackfoot territory, and securing a promise from the Blackfoot leader Crowfoot to refrain from joining the North-West Rebellion of 1885. The [[Lacombe Police Service]] have policed the community since 1900.

In 1880 the first land surveys of the Lacombe area took place and three years later, in 1883,<ref>Most historical accounts give 1883 for the arrival of Barnett. Barnett's grandson, Doug Barnett, gives the date 1884. He writes: \"In February 1883 he travelled north in a buckboard with four horses as far as the Red Deer River. The only source of supplies was by a wagon train running every week or so between Calgary and Edmonton. Ed came across a couple of drifters and the three of them built a log cabin by the Red Deer River where they remained over the winter of 1883-84. They survived the winter on a diet of rabbit and flour until spring brought a welcome addition of ducks and geese from the south. Barnett was still looking for a good place to start ranching and farming. He therefore moved farther north in the summer of 1884, across the Blindman River to the area where Lacombe stands today.\" See [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ed+Barnett%3A+from+mountie+to+rancher.-a0167508634 Barnett, Doug.

</ref> the first permanent settler arrived, Ed Barnett. Barnett was a retired member of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) who had served a mere three years. He left [[Fort Macleod]] in August 1881 at 23 years of age. According to his own diary and his official obituary in the RCMP Quarterly, spring 1940, on July 19, 1881, Barnett was among a small NWMP party that escorted Chief Sitting Bull and his people to the Canada–US border. Along the Calgary-Edmonton Trail, he established a \"[[stopping house]]\" for travelers on a land grant given to him for serving his service in the NWMP. His family and friends from Ontario moved out and the community began to grow. The stopping house then became known as Barnett's Siding.<ref>[http://www.lacombe.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1410&Itemid=42 City of Lacombe website.

The Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in 1891. This provided better access to the area and new opportunities for settlement. By 1893 the downtown blocks and lots were surveyed. Village status was granted in 1896 and town status in 1902.<ref name = Barnett/>

Nestled in one of Central Alberta's most fertile valleys between Calgary and Edmonton, the local economy includes a strong agricultural base supplemented by oil and gas industry.

The city is also home to the [[#Lacombe Research Centre|Lacombe Research Centre]] where the first livestock breed developed in Canada, the [[Lacombe (pig)|Lacombe hog]], was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/features/100days/story.html?id=191d76fa-7ae4-482c-82f2-ba07580fdf42 |title=First Livestock Breed Developed in Canada |accessdate=2008-04-19 |date=2005-05-27 |work=[[Edmonton Journal]]}}</ref>

=== Lacombe Research Centre ===
For more than a century, the federal government has funded agricultural research through a network of research centres strategically placed in almost every province. This research program has played a major role in developing the more than $120-billion Canadian agrifood industry.<ref name = \"Agri\" >{{Citation

The Lacombe Research Centre (LRC) is one of a network of 19 national agricultural research centres operated by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. The Centre conducts research in field crops and livestock production relevant to the central Alberta region. The Centre's main research focuses on the factors that influence red meat: yield, quality, safety and preservation. The Centre also develops integrated, sustainable crop and animal production systems and crop varieties for the short-season environments of the parkland and northwestern Canada.<ref name = \"LRC\" >{{Citation

The LRC developed a variety of hog called [[Lacombe (pig)|Lacombe]]. Work began in 1947. It took 12 years to develop the 'Lacombe' variety which is noted for its characteristics suitable to the harsh prairie environment. 'Lacombe' is 55% [[Danish Landrace pig|Danish Landrace]], 22% [[Chester White]], and 23% [[Berkshire (pig)|Berkshire]]. The 'Lacombe' hog was the first livestock breed to be developed in Canada.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FEnGUlTdwaUC&pg=PA1980&dq=%22Lacombe,+alberta%22&hl=en&ei=9pGGTbXbGPO-0QGD-ujMCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22Lacombe%2C%20alberta%22&f=false Pukite, John (1999).

'''Lacombe''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|m}}) is a city in central [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It is located approximately {{convert|25|km|mi}} north of [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], the nearest major city, and {{convert|125|km|mi}} south of [[Edmonton]], the nearest metropolitan area. The city is set in the rolling parkland of [[central Alberta]], between the [[Rocky Mountains]] foothills to the west and the flatter Alberta prairie to the east.

Lacombe became [[List of cities in Alberta|Alberta's 17th city]] on September 5, 2010.<ref name=CityStatusOC>{{cite web |url= http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/orders/orders_in_council/2010/710/2010_223.html |author=Alberta Queen's Printer |title=Order in Council (O.C.) 223/2010 |accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref>

== History ==
{{stack|[[File:Lacombe 7 (HS85-10-19886).jpg|thumb|200px|Downtown Lacombe in 1908]]}}
Lacombe is named after [[Albert Lacombe]] (28 February 1827 &mdash; 12 December 1916), a French-Canadian Roman Catholic [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Oblate]] missionary what  lived among and evangelized the [[Cree]] and [[Blackfoot]] First Nations of western Canada.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url= http://www.lacombe.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=334&Itemid=86 | title= History | author= Town of Lacombe | date= February 2007 | accessdate= 2007-03-08 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131223/http://www.lacombe.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=334&Itemid=86 | archivedate= 2007-09-28 }}</ref> He is now remembered for having brokered a peace between the Cree and Blackfoot, negotiating construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through Blackfoot territory, and securing a promise from the Blackfoot leader Crowfoot to refrain from joining the North-West Rebellion of 1885. The [[Lacombe Police Service]] have policed the community since 1900.

In 1880 the first land surveys of the Lacombe area took place and three years later, in 1883,<ref>Most historical accounts give 1883 for the arrival of Barnett. Barnett's grandson, Doug Barnett, gives the date 1884. He writes: \"In February 1883 he travelled north in a buckboard with four horses as far as the Red Deer River. The only source of supplies was by a wagon train running every week or so between Calgary and Edmonton. Ed came across a couple of drifters and the three of them built a log cabin by the Red Deer River where they remained over the winter of 1883-84. They survived the winter on a diet of rabbit and flour until spring brought a welcome addition of ducks and geese from the south. Barnett was still looking for a good place to start ranching and farming. He therefore moved farther north in the summer of 1884, across the Blindman River to the area where Lacombe stands today.\" See [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ed+Barnett%3A+from+mountie+to+rancher.-a0167508634 Barnett, Doug.

He left [[Fort Macleod]] in August 1881 at 23 years of age. According to his own diary and his official obituary in the RCMP Quarterly, spring 1940, on July 19, 1881, Barnett was among a small NWMP party that escorted Chief Sitting Bull and his people to the Canada–US border. Along the Calgary-Edmonton Trail, he established a \"[[stopping house]]\" for travelers on a land grant given to him for serving his service in the NWMP. His family and friends from Ontario moved out and the community began to grow.

=== Lacombe Research Centre ===
For more than a century, the federal government has funded agricultural research through a network of research centres strategically placed in almost every province. This research program has played a major role in developing the more than $120-billion Canadian agrifood industry.<ref name = \"Agri\" >{{Citation

The Lacombe Research Centre (LRC) is one of a network of 19 national agricultural research centres operated by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. The Centre conducts research in field crops and livestock production relevant to the central Alberta region. The Centre's main research focuses on the factors that influence red meat: yield, quality, safety and preservation. The Centre also develops integrated, sustainable crop and animal production systems and crop varieties for the short-season environments of the parkland and northwestern Canada.<ref name = \"LRC\" >{{Citation

The LRC developed a variety of hog called [[Lacombe (pig)|Lacombe]]. Work began in 1947. It took 12 years to develop the 'Lacombe' variety which is noted for its characteristics suitable to the harsh prairie environment. 'Lacombe' is 55% [[Danish Landrace pig|Danish Landrace]], 22% [[Chester White]], and 23% [[Berkshire (pig)|Berkshire]]. The 'Lacombe' hog was the first livestock breed to be developed in Canada.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FEnGUlTdwaUC&pg=PA1980&dq=%22Lacombe,+alberta%22&hl=en&ei=9pGGTbXbGPO-0QGD-ujMCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22Lacombe%2C%20alberta%22&f=false Pukite, John (1999).

* [[Irene Parlby]] helped to found the first women's local of the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] in 1913. In 1921, she was elected to the [[Alberta]] Legislature for the riding of [[Lacombe (provincial electoral district)|Lacombe]], holding the riding for 14 years. Appointed as minister without portfolio, she was the first woman [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta. Parlby was one of the [[The Famous Five (Canada)|Famous Five]] who by means of a court battle known as the [[Persons Case]] established that women were \"qualified Persons\" in the meaning of the [[Constitution of Canada]] and therefore entitled to sit in the [[Senate of Canada]]. A lifelong advocate for rural Canadian women and children, Parlby was president of the United Farm Women of Alberta from 1916 to 1919.

→‎History:group,safe,Peipsi-Pihkva,"'''Eastern European people''' are a pan-ethnic group, or multi-ethnic regional grouping, and the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]]. '''East''' or '''Eastern Europeans''' can usually trace back full or partial heritage to [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[European Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other nations bordering with or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the region.

Mainly comprised of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicities, in its strictest geographical terms [[Moldova]] is the sole majority-Romance ethnic nation in the region; with significant numbers of [[Moldovans in Ukraine|Moldovans]] and [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanians]] also native to other areas of Eastern Europe, such as in the [[Western Ukrainian]] borderland province [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and parts of Russia.

There are also many descriptions of Eastern Europeans which include ancestry from nations in [[Central Europe]], and countries of the [[South Slavs]], particularly in diasporic identification. There is a large Eastern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in North America ([[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians|Canadians]]), as well as Oceania ([[Eastern European Australians]]).

==Background==
Eastern Europeans have been discussed academically, researched and reported on as a pan-ethnic group, which is most usually based on full or partial ancestry to Eastern Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cee-communism/closed-borders-no-shops-been-there-done-that-say-east-europeans-idUSKBN21E2KO |title=Closed borders, no shops?

==History==
In 1964, the [[Assembly of Captive European Nations]] published material suggesting how, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the \"Eastern European people were sealed off from the West and held down by Soviet-patterned police apparatuses\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=George Meany|authorlink1=George Meany|title=ACEN News|date=1964|publisher=[[Assembly of Captive European Nations]]}}</ref> The attitudes of Eastern Europeans and their relationship to the state, government and society underwent transformation during the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Markus Schatten|title=Recovering the Past.

Russia's richest one percent earned 3.5 percent of national income (by 2019, this had risen to 27 percent).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/30/young-lefty-eastern-europe-socialism |title=Why it’s not easy being a young lefty in eastern Europe  |authorlink=|author=Paula Erizanu|date=October 30, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Since the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], despite the fact that eastern European states have became wealthier, the poor in these states have become poorer and the rich richer. In the 1980s, the total earnings of the poorer half of east Europeans was equivalent to 25-35% of national income. Since the end of communism, this figure has dropped to 17% in some countries. The most unequal country in the region is Russia, where the richest 1% now earns 27% of national income – a dramatic increase from 3.5% before the fall of the iron curtain.}}</ref>

In 1989, historian [[Thaddeus Gromada]] claimed that non-Russian Eastern European people generally had more affinity with Western European culture than Russian culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thaddeus Gromada|authorlink1=Thaddeus V. Gromada|title=Report of the New Jersey Governor's Commission on Eastern European and Captive Nation History|date=1989|publisher=[[New Jersey Civil Service Commission]]|quote=There are great cultural differences between Russians and other Eastern European people. Most non-Russian East Europeans do not have any affinity with Russian culture. Rather, they feel more kinship with Western European culture}}</ref> Political scientists [[Ivan Krastev]] and [[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]] have argued that this form of Western cultural aspiration drove the [[revolutions of 1989]] and acted as a shared mission for the group.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/western-liberalism-failed-post-communist-eastern-europe |title=How liberalism became ‘the god that failed’ in eastern Europe |authorlink1=Ivan Krastev|authorlink2=Stephen Holmes (academic)|author1= Ivan Krastev|author2=Stephen Holmes|date=October 24, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=When the [[cold war]] ended, racing to join [[Western world|the west]] was the shared mission of central and eastern Europeans.

During the economic reforms of the 1990s, as the region partially fell away from the economic sphere of Russia, Eastern Europeans suffered financially with, at first, growing costs and less disposable income.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Counts|title=Effects of Eastern European Reforms on World Trade in Forest Products|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|quote=The Eastern European people were faced with the dual problem of having less money to spend while at the same time facing increasingly high prices on virtually all goods and services.}}</ref> In the 21st-century, the process of [[EU enlargement]] has occasionally exposed cultural differences in between Western and Eastern Europeans, with the Soviet history of the region influencing the latter's political worldviews.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dieter Gosewinkel|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|date=2014|page=157|isbn=978-1782384250|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|quote=However, the [[EU enlargement|European enlargement]] process since the end of the [[Cold War]] has brought to the surface significant differences in opinions concerning the future of the union between so-called Old and New Europe. This could be seen as an indication that the communist conception of Europe did have an impact on the Eastern European people.}}</ref>

In 2019, a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that between 58 and 65 percent of Eastern Europeans felt positively about [[living standards]], education and [[national pride]] in the post-Communist era.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=30 years after communism, eastern Europe divided on democracy's impact |authorlink=|author=Jon Henley|date=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Asked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%).

In 2020, it was reported how the [[European Union]]'s policy of free movement had enabled or encouraged millions of Eastern Europeans to return home from Germany, and other large European economies, after job losses created by the [[coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=After coronavirus: how will Europe rebuild? |authorlink=|author=Katherine Butler|date=12 April 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=If Germany’s success in handling the pandemic is partly down to an army of migrant doctors and nurses, it should not be to the detriment of central and eastern Europe. Free movement of labour has also, paradoxically, led to the return home of millions of eastern Europeans.}}</ref>

==Academic research==
A 2013 study at [[Bucharest University]] proposed how a culture where Eastern European people seem under interrogation, for all political and cultural decisions taken by them, has developed due to the cultural conflict caused by public transition from communism to democracy.<ref>{{cite study|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Bojan Todosijevic|author3=Guido Boella|title=Political Attitudes and Mentalities.

In a 2018 [[Feminist Media Studies]] journal piece, [[University of Vienna]] Research Fellow Katharina Wiedlack criticized Western cultural perceptions, which she argued can frame Eastern Europeans as unthinking, unoriginal or possessing lower morality.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Katharina Wiedlack|title=In/visibly different: Melania Trump and the othering of Eastern European women in US culture|date=2017|page=179|isbn=978-0748624164|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|quote=The view on Eastern European people as unable to produce original thinking, and accordingly stealing from their Western peers, does not only confirm their questionable morals and character, it also confirms the superiority of Western (here US) thinking, culture, and being.}}</ref> A 2019 [[Roskilde University]] study was critical of discriminatory Danish media representations of Eastern European people, which it described as portraying them as a racially inferior working-class, prone to criminality, who's 'otherness' was to be subsumed by integration into a \"Danish '[[whiteness studies|whiteness]]'\".<ref>{{cite study|author1=Agnieszka Feliksik|author2=Valeriia Karamysheva|author3=Irina Fedorova|title=The Representation of Eastern Europeans in Danish Media|date=1989|page=43|publisher=[[Roskilde University]]|quote=They are presented as an ‘inferior race’ consisting of ‘cheap labor’ and criminals, who ‘invade’ Denmark and cause economical and security problems for Danish population. The notions ‘Us”’ (Danish people) and ‘Them’ (Eastern Europeans) are common in Eastern European discourse in Danish media. The integration of Eastern Europeans is considered as converting them to Danish ‘whiteness’}}</ref>

==Diaspora==
Large numbers of Eastern Europeans have emigrated from the region between the 18th and 21st centuries, driven by many factors, including wars, discrimination and opportunity. Significant proportions of such people, and their descendents, constitute the modern populations of [[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians]] in the North American continent, and [[Eastern European Australians]] in Oceania.

===Europe===
Since the opening up of [[EU accession]] in the early 21st-century, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to other parts of Europe, especially to Central, Western, and Northern Europe; gaining access to the job markets of large economies in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in particular.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\" />

[[Russell Deacon]] has written of the tension created in the mid-2000s, from Eastern Europeans emigrating to [[Welsh-speaking]] areas of Wales, with pressure group [[Cymuned]] lobbying the Welsh government to prioritize housing for locals, as a reactionary response.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Russell Deacon|author2=Alan Sandry|authorlink1=Russell Deacon|title=Devolution in the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland|date=2007|page=179|isbn=978-0748624164|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|quote=The problem of solely English-speaking or Eastern European people moving into predominantly Welsh-speaking areas has at times been a sensitive political issue.

By 2014, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' society-piece by [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]], outlined multiple years of apparent social problems created by large numbers of immigrants from Eastern Europe (and its bordering regions) which included reports of mafias, intra-ethnic conflicts, murders, as well as positive elements such as the revival of town centres.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/16/fear-anger-wisbech-cambridgeshire-insecurity-immigration |title=Fear and anger in once-wealthy town divided by insecurity and immigration |authorlink=|author=John Harris|date=16 June 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> In 2015, most Eastern Europeans living in [[Suffolk]] were young working-age adults.<ref>{{Cite article|url=https://www.healthysuffolk.org.uk/uploads/Migrants_from_Eastern_Europe_.pdf |title=Health and Wellbeing Suffolk: Joint Strategic Needs Assessment - Migrants from Eastern Europe|date=1 July 2015|publisher=[[Suffolk County Council]]|quote=

===North America===
====19th-century====
Eastern Europeans arrived in large numbers to the United States during the 1880s and 1890s, settling in industry towns and cities, such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohiodigitalnetwork.org/historic-ethnic-groups-in-ohio/|title=Historic Ethnic Groups in Ohio|publisher=[[State Library of Ohio]]|quote=[[Cleveland, Ohio]], likewise, saw many Eastern Europeans choosing its city as their new home. While thousands of [[Germans]] often chose rural areas throughout Ohio as their new residence, they also settled in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. In fact, at the beginning of the 20th century, at least 50 percent of Cleveland residents were German. Over 75 percent of Cleveland’s population was foreign born by 1900.}}</ref> Implications of the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' in 1914, which authorized the designation of \"aliens of enemy nationality\", included Eastern European Canadians born or resident in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Martin Louis Kovacs|title=Ethnic Canadians: Culture and Education|date=1978|publisher=[[University of Regina]]|isbn=978-0889770096|chapter=Volume 8|page=132|quote=The conflict between clashing loyalties for the Ukrainian and some other Central Eastern European Canadians was exacerbated by the war measures.}}</ref> Continuing into the 1920s, Eastern European Canadians faced persecution, along with [[African Canadians]], during economic recession and post-[[World War I]] unrest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sarah-Jane Mathieu|title=North of the Color Line: Migration and Black Resistance in Canada, 1870–1955|date=2010|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|isbn=978-0807834299|chapter=Fighting the Empire|page=114|quote=Throughout the 1920s, eastern European Canadians, like [[African Canadians]], became the country's convenient scapegoats for postwar labor unrest, peacetime economic recession, and urban demise.}}</ref> In the US from 1900 (until the [[Hart–Celler Act]] of 1965 ended it), the majority of immigration into the US was comprised of people arriving from Southern Europe, and large numbers of Eastern Europeans.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irmo Marini|title=The Professional Counselor's Desk Reference|date=2009|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|isbn=978-0826171818|chapter=Counseling White Americans|page=249|quote=[[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans. After 1900, and prior to the [[1965 Immigration Act]], most immigrants to the United States came from southern and eastern European countries.}}</ref> This post-war period enabled Eastern European people to become significant percentages of US populations, in places such as the [[Pittsburg, Kansas]] mining community, nicknamed as the \"Little [[Balkans]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/amazon-army/16702|title=Amazon Army|publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]]|date=February 1, 2011|quote=These local families were immigrants from many [[European nations]] who had brought their mining skills to southeast Kansas.

====World War II====
After the outbreak of [[World War II]], Eastern European citizens of Canada received training at [[Camp X]], many going on to serve their adoptive country in the [[Special Operations Executive]].<ref name=\"saturdaynight1982\">{{cite news|title=Saturday Night, Volume 97|date=1982|work=[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]|quote=Similarly out of the mainstream were those central and eastern European Canadians, now condescendingly called \"ethnics.\" Of those who served with SOE , most were Yugoslavs who had immigrated to Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.}}</ref> In the US, however, Americans of Eastern European heritage faced government-enforced restrictions. Speaking to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], [[Russ Feingold]] acknowledged how \"Eastern European Americans were unfairly arrested, detained, interned, or relocated\" in a 2003 address.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/feingold_statement_10_16_03.pdf|title=Statement of The Honorable Russ Feingold|publisher=[[Senate Judiciary Committee]]|date=October 16, 2003|quote=Thousands of [[German Americans]], Italian Americans, and Eastern European Americans were unfairly arrested, detained, interned, or relocated. Our government confiscated the personal property of many [[European Americans]] and restricted their travel rights.}}</ref>

In both Canada and the United States, in the post-WWII period, politically active Eastern European people were forced to tread a careful line of diplomacy in both North American nations; demonstrating loyalty to their countries, while advocating for interventional policy which might aid people in their ancestral homelands.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H. L'Homedieu |title=Baltic Exiles and the U.S. Congress: Investigations and Legacies of the House Select Committee, 1953-1955|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois Press|edition=Volume 31|chapter=Journal of American Ethnic History|page=41|quote=Politically motivated Eastern European Americans rejected the postwar political settlement in their former homelands.

====Social breakthrough====
Eastern Europeans in Canada were shown to be underrepresented in professional occupations (and overrepresented in the [[personal service sector]]) by a 1961 census.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irwin Taylor Sanders|author2=Ewa T.

In the unskilled occupations Eastern Europeans reached the national mean in 1961.}}</ref> Cultural assimilation of Eastern Europeans was increasingly common in mid-20th-century North America. Professor [[Marc Shell]] has written regarding the Canadian government's enforcement of the [[anglicisation of names]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marc Shell|authorlink=Marc Shell|title=Polio and Its Aftermath: The Paralysis of Culture|date=2005|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0674013155|chapter=One Polio Story|page=55|quote=I became [[de jure]] Mark Shell in 1967 by means of an official [[Order of Council]]. (Such name changes were not untypical among assimilating Eastern Europeans in Canada.)}}</ref>

In the US, Eastern Europeans were also gradually being accepted into mainstream American culture. Historian [[David Halberstam]], speaking in a [[New England Board of Higher Education]] interview, discussed how access to [[white society]] became plausible for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nebhe.org/fall-2005-connection-50-years-of-new-england-higher-education-and-economic-development/|title=Fall 2005 Connection: 50 Years of New England Higher Education and Economic Development|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[New England Board of Higher Education]]|quote= But in retrospect, it was narrower than we thought. We perceived ourselves in the ‘50s as a white society, and the breakthrough was mostly limited to people who were descendents of Italian-Americans, Eastern European Americans, children of Jewish immigrants.”}}</ref> Perhaps respresenting this social change best, the [[US Census Bureau]] found that the Eastern European  born in this time period (between 1956 and 1965) were indistinguishable, in education results, with [[British Americans]].  Eastern European Americans were found to have also outperformed US citizens of solely British heritage in the completion of [[bachelor's degrees]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dominic J. Pulera|title=Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America|date=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0826418296|chapter=A Nation of 100 Million|page=30|quote=The Census Bureau found that 55.9% of white men born between 1956 and 1965 had attended college and 25.5% of them had completed bachelor's degrees. However, the percentages had virtually converged for two groups in this cohort: men of solely [[British ancestry]] (66.3% and 31.8%, respectively) and Southern and Eastern European men (66.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too. While the [[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans began to prosper in America, [[African Americans]] continued to suffer from discrimination and diminished life chances}}</ref>

====Late 20th-century====

[[Category:Eastern Europeans in the United States]]
[[Category:Ethnic groups in Europe]]","'''Eastern European people''' are a pan-ethnic group, or multi-ethnic regional grouping, and the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]]. '''East''' or '''Eastern Europeans''' can usually trace back full or partial heritage to [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[European Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other nations bordering with or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the region.

Mainly comprised of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicities, in its strictest geographical terms [[Moldova]] is the sole majority-Romance ethnic nation in the region; with significant numbers of [[Moldovans in Ukraine|Moldovans]] and [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanians]] also native to other areas of Eastern Europe, such as in the [[Western Ukrainian]] borderland province [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and parts of Russia.

There are also many descriptions of Eastern Europeans which include ancestry from nations in [[Central Europe]], and countries of the [[South Slavs]], particularly in diasporic identification. There is a large Eastern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in North America ([[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians|Canadians]]), as well as Oceania ([[Eastern European Australians]]).

Eastern Europeans have been discussed academically, researched and reported on as a pan-ethnic group, which is most usually based on full or partial ancestry to Eastern Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cee-communism/closed-borders-no-shops-been-there-done-that-say-east-europeans-idUSKBN21E2KO |title=Closed borders, no shops?

In 1964, the [[Assembly of Captive European Nations]] published material suggesting how, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the \"Eastern European people were sealed off from the West and held down by Soviet-patterned police apparatuses\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=George Meany|authorlink1=George Meany|title=ACEN News|date=1964|publisher=[[Assembly of Captive European Nations]]}}</ref> The attitudes of Eastern Europeans and their relationship to the state, government and society underwent transformation during the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Markus Schatten|title=Recovering the Past.

In 1989, historian [[Thaddeus Gromada]] claimed that non-Russian Eastern European people generally had more affinity with Western European culture than Russian culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thaddeus Gromada|authorlink1=Thaddeus V.

During the economic reforms of the 1990s, as the region partially fell away from the economic sphere of Russia, Eastern Europeans suffered financially with, at first, growing costs and less disposable income.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Counts|title=Effects of Eastern European Reforms on World Trade in Forest Products|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|quote=The Eastern European people were faced with the dual problem of having less money to spend while at the same time facing increasingly high prices on virtually all goods and services.}}</ref> In the 21st-century, the process of [[EU enlargement]] has occasionally exposed cultural differences in between Western and Eastern Europeans, with the Soviet history of the region influencing the latter's political worldviews.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dieter Gosewinkel|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|date=2014|page=157|isbn=978-1782384250|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|quote=However, the [[EU enlargement|European enlargement]] process since the end of the [[Cold War]] has brought to the surface significant differences in opinions concerning the future of the union between so-called Old and New Europe.

In 2019, a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that between 58 and 65 percent of Eastern Europeans felt positively about [[living standards]], education and [[national pride]] in the post-Communist era.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=30 years after communism, eastern Europe divided on democracy's impact |authorlink=|author=Jon Henley|date=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Asked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%).

In 2020, it was reported how the [[European Union]]'s policy of free movement had enabled or encouraged millions of Eastern Europeans to return home from Germany, and other large European economies, after job losses created by the [[coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=After coronavirus: how will Europe rebuild? |authorlink=|author=Katherine Butler|date=12 April 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=If Germany’s success in handling the pandemic is partly down to an army of migrant doctors and nurses, it should not be to the detriment of central and eastern Europe.

==Academic research==
A 2013 study at [[Bucharest University]] proposed how a culture where Eastern European people seem under interrogation, for all political and cultural decisions taken by them, has developed due to the cultural conflict caused by public transition from communism to democracy.<ref>{{cite study|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Bojan Todosijevic|author3=Guido Boella|title=Political Attitudes and Mentalities.

The integration of Eastern Europeans is considered as converting them to Danish ‘whiteness’}}</ref>

==Diaspora==
Large numbers of Eastern Europeans have emigrated from the region between the 18th and 21st centuries, driven by many factors, including wars, discrimination and opportunity. Significant proportions of such people, and their descendents, constitute the modern populations of [[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians]] in the North American continent, and [[Eastern European Australians]] in Oceania.

===Europe===
Since the opening up of [[EU accession]] in the early 21st-century, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to other parts of Europe, especially to Central, Western, and Northern Europe; gaining access to the job markets of large economies in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in particular.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\" />

===North America===
====19th-century====
Eastern Europeans arrived in large numbers to the United States during the 1880s and 1890s, settling in industry towns and cities, such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohiodigitalnetwork.org/historic-ethnic-groups-in-ohio/|title=Historic Ethnic Groups in Ohio|publisher=[[State Library of Ohio]]|quote=[[Cleveland, Ohio]], likewise, saw many Eastern Europeans choosing its city as their new home.

In both Canada and the United States, in the post-WWII period, politically active Eastern European people were forced to tread a careful line of diplomacy in both North American nations; demonstrating loyalty to their countries, while advocating for interventional policy which might aid people in their ancestral homelands.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H.

====Social breakthrough====
Eastern Europeans in Canada were shown to be underrepresented in professional occupations (and overrepresented in the [[personal service sector]]) by a 1961 census.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irwin Taylor Sanders|author2=Ewa T.

Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too.

====Late 20th-century====
During the 1970s, the majority of Eastern Europeans resident in Canada lived in the country's main urban centers.

In 2008, a genetic research investigation consecutively tested over five hundred Eastern European US citizens, in order to identify [[human leukocyte antigen]] alleles.

→‎History:quote,safe,Peipsi-Pihkva,"'''Eastern European people''' are a pan-ethnic group, or multi-ethnic regional grouping, and the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]]. '''East''' or '''Eastern Europeans''' can usually trace back full or partial heritage to [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[European Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other nations bordering with or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the region.

Mainly comprised of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicities, in its strictest geographical terms [[Moldova]] is the sole majority-Romance ethnic nation in the region; with significant numbers of [[Moldovans in Ukraine|Moldovans]] and [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanians]] also native to other areas of Eastern Europe, such as in the [[Western Ukrainian]] borderland province [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and parts of Russia.

There are also many descriptions of Eastern Europeans which include ancestry from nations in [[Central Europe]], and countries of the [[South Slavs]], particularly in diasporic identification. There is a large Eastern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in North America ([[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians|Canadians]]), as well as Oceania ([[Eastern European Australians]]).

In 1964, the [[Assembly of Captive European Nations]] published material suggesting how, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the \"Eastern European people were sealed off from the West and held down by Soviet-patterned police apparatuses\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=George Meany|authorlink1=George Meany|title=ACEN News|date=1964|publisher=[[Assembly of Captive European Nations]]}}</ref> The attitudes of Eastern Europeans and their relationship to the state, government and society underwent transformation during the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Markus Schatten|title=Recovering the Past.

In 1989, historian [[Thaddeus Gromada]] claimed that non-Russian Eastern European people generally had more affinity with Western European culture than Russian culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thaddeus Gromada|authorlink1=Thaddeus V.

During the economic reforms of the 1990s, as the region partially fell away from the economic sphere of Russia, Eastern Europeans suffered financially with, at first, growing costs and less disposable income.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Counts|title=Effects of Eastern European Reforms on World Trade in Forest Products|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|quote=The Eastern European people were faced with the dual problem of having less money to spend while at the same time facing increasingly high prices on virtually all goods and services.}}</ref> In the 21st-century, the process of [[EU enlargement]] has occasionally exposed cultural differences in between Western and Eastern Europeans, with the Soviet history of the region influencing the latter's political worldviews.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dieter Gosewinkel|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|date=2014|page=157|isbn=978-1782384250|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|quote=However, the [[EU enlargement|European enlargement]] process since the end of the [[Cold War]] has brought to the surface significant differences in opinions concerning the future of the union between so-called Old and New Europe.

In 2019, a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that between 58 and 65 percent of Eastern Europeans felt positively about [[living standards]], education and [[national pride]] in the post-Communist era.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=30 years after communism, eastern Europe divided on democracy's impact |authorlink=|author=Jon Henley|date=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Asked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%).

==Academic research==
A 2013 study at [[Bucharest University]] proposed how a culture where Eastern European people seem under interrogation, for all political and cultural decisions taken by them, has developed due to the cultural conflict caused by public transition from communism to democracy.<ref>{{cite study|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Bojan Todosijevic|author3=Guido Boella|title=Political Attitudes and Mentalities.

==Diaspora==
Large numbers of Eastern Europeans have emigrated from the region between the 18th and 21st centuries, driven by many factors, including wars, discrimination and opportunity. Significant proportions of such people, and their descendents, constitute the modern populations of [[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians]] in the North American continent, and [[Eastern European Australians]] in Oceania.

===Europe===
Since the opening up of [[EU accession]] in the early 21st-century, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to other parts of Europe, especially to Central, Western, and Northern Europe; gaining access to the job markets of large economies in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in particular.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\" />

====Social breakthrough====
Eastern Europeans in Canada were shown to be underrepresented in professional occupations (and overrepresented in the [[personal service sector]]) by a 1961 census.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irwin Taylor Sanders|author2=Ewa T.

In the unskilled occupations Eastern Europeans reached the national mean in 1961.}}</ref> Cultural assimilation of Eastern Europeans was increasingly common in mid-20th-century North America. Professor [[Marc Shell]] has written regarding the Canadian government's enforcement of the [[anglicisation of names]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marc Shell|authorlink=Marc Shell|title=Polio and Its Aftermath: The Paralysis of Culture|date=2005|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0674013155|chapter=One Polio Story|page=55|quote=I became [[de jure]] Mark Shell in 1967 by means of an official [[Order of Council]]. (Such name changes were not untypical among assimilating Eastern Europeans in Canada.)}}</ref>

In the US, Eastern Europeans were also gradually being accepted into mainstream American culture. Historian [[David Halberstam]], speaking in a [[New England Board of Higher Education]] interview, discussed how access to [[white society]] became plausible for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nebhe.org/fall-2005-connection-50-years-of-new-england-higher-education-and-economic-development/|title=Fall 2005 Connection: 50 Years of New England Higher Education and Economic Development|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[New England Board of Higher Education]]|quote= But in retrospect, it was narrower than we thought. We perceived ourselves in the ‘50s as a white society, and the breakthrough was mostly limited to people who were descendents of Italian-Americans, Eastern European Americans, children of Jewish immigrants.”}}</ref> Perhaps respresenting this social change best, the [[US Census Bureau]] found that the Eastern European  born in this time period (between 1956 and 1965) were indistinguishable, in education results, with [[British Americans]].  Eastern European Americans were found to have also outperformed US citizens of solely British heritage in the completion of [[bachelor's degrees]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dominic J.

However, the percentages had virtually converged for two groups in this cohort: men of solely [[British ancestry]] (66.3% and 31.8%, respectively) and Southern and Eastern European men (66.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too. While the [[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans began to prosper in America, [[African Americans]] continued to suffer from discrimination and diminished life chances}}</ref>

====Late 20th-century====
During the 1970s, the majority of Eastern Europeans resident in Canada lived in the country's main urban centers. The exception being those of Ukrainian heritage, who still mostly lived rurally.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peggy Tyrchniewicz|title=Ethnic folk costumes in Canada|date=1979|publisher=[[Hyperion Press]]|isbn=978-0920534106|chapter=|page=111|quote=By 1971, the greatest percentage of all eastern European Canadians lived in the largest urban centers. The exception is the Ukrainians who live mainnly on the prairies.}}</ref> During this time, the [[Helsinki Accords]] were the cause of various political strife between the [[Ford administration]] and Eastern European people in the US.<ref>{{cite article|title=Through the Looking Glass: The Helsinki Final Act and the 1976 Election for President|author1=Sarah B. Snyder |date=2010|pages=86-106|publisher=Diplomacy & Statecraft|quote=[[Helsinki Final Act]] became a point of contention between the [[White House]] and Eastern European Americans during Ford's election campaign}}</ref> Whereas, writing in 1980, Dr Roy Norton suggested that the group were appreciative of the role Canada played in the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]], as well as the country's consistent criticizm of abuses to human rights in their ancestral lands.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nelson Michaud|editor2=Kim Richard Nossal|author1=Roy Norton|title=Diplomatic Departures: The Conservative Era in Canadian Foreign Policy, 1984-93 (Canada and International Relations)|date=2002|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|isbn=978-0774808651|chapter=Ethnic Groups and Conservative Foreign Policy|page=247|quote=Most eastern European-Canadians appeared to be pleased with Canada's leadership at the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] and on individual human rights cases; one community leader claimed he \"always felt [[Joe Clark]] was totally in tune with the position [he] was advocating\".}}</ref>

====Academic studies====
Academic reesearch has been utilized in the study of Eastern European diaspora in North American.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Wilhelm Kohler|title=European Economic Integration, WTO Membership, Immigration and Offshoring|date=2014|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-9814440189|chapter=Restrictive Immigration Policy in Germany: Pains and Gains Foregone?|page=409|quote=(iii) A “high education” scenario which assumes that the composition of the inflow equals the one observed for Eastern Europeans in Canada between 1995 and 2000.}}</ref> Professor Cezara O.

In 2008, a genetic research investigation consecutively tested over five hundred Eastern European US citizens, in order to identify [[human leukocyte antigen]] alleles. The research, which was based at the [[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]], contributed towards the creation of a [[hematopoietic stem cell]] register.<ref>{{cite study|title=HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allele and haplotype frequencies distinguish Eastern European Americans from the general European American population.|date=2008|publisher=[[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]]|author=S.

[[Category:Eastern Europeans in the United States]]
[[Category:Ethnic groups in Europe]]","'''Eastern European people''' are a pan-ethnic group, or multi-ethnic regional grouping, and the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]]. '''East''' or '''Eastern Europeans''' can usually trace back full or partial heritage to [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[European Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other nations bordering with or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the region.

Mainly comprised of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicities, in its strictest geographical terms [[Moldova]] is the sole majority-Romance ethnic nation in the region; with significant numbers of [[Moldovans in Ukraine|Moldovans]] and [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanians]] also native to other areas of Eastern Europe, such as in the [[Western Ukrainian]] borderland province [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and parts of Russia.

There are also many descriptions of Eastern Europeans which include ancestry from nations in [[Central Europe]], and countries of the [[South Slavs]], particularly in diasporic identification. There is a large Eastern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in North America ([[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians|Canadians]]), as well as Oceania ([[Eastern European Australians]]).

In 1989, historian [[Thaddeus Gromada]] claimed that non-Russian Eastern European people generally had more affinity with Western European culture than Russian culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thaddeus Gromada|authorlink1=Thaddeus V.

During the economic reforms of the 1990s, as the region partially fell away from the economic sphere of Russia, Eastern Europeans suffered financially with, at first, growing costs and less disposable income.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Counts|title=Effects of Eastern European Reforms on World Trade in Forest Products|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|quote=The Eastern European people were faced with the dual problem of having less money to spend while at the same time facing increasingly high prices on virtually all goods and services.}}</ref> In the 21st-century, the process of [[EU enlargement]] has occasionally exposed cultural differences in between Western and Eastern Europeans, with the Soviet history of the region influencing the latter's political worldviews.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dieter Gosewinkel|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|date=2014|page=157|isbn=978-1782384250|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|quote=However, the [[EU enlargement|European enlargement]] process since the end of the [[Cold War]] has brought to the surface significant differences in opinions concerning the future of the union between so-called Old and New Europe.

==Academic research==
A 2013 study at [[Bucharest University]] proposed how a culture where Eastern European people seem under interrogation, for all political and cultural decisions taken by them, has developed due to the cultural conflict caused by public transition from communism to democracy.<ref>{{cite study|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Bojan Todosijevic|author3=Guido Boella|title=Political Attitudes and Mentalities.

==Diaspora==
Large numbers of Eastern Europeans have emigrated from the region between the 18th and 21st centuries, driven by many factors, including wars, discrimination and opportunity. Significant proportions of such people, and their descendents, constitute the modern populations of [[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians]] in the North American continent, and [[Eastern European Australians]] in Oceania.

===Europe===
Since the opening up of [[EU accession]] in the early 21st-century, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to other parts of Europe, especially to Central, Western, and Northern Europe; gaining access to the job markets of large economies in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in particular.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\" />

====World War II====
After the outbreak of [[World War II]], Eastern European citizens of Canada received training at [[Camp X]], many going on to serve their adoptive country in the [[Special Operations Executive]].<ref name=\"saturdaynight1982\">{{cite news|title=Saturday Night, Volume 97|date=1982|work=[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]|quote=Similarly out of the mainstream were those central and eastern European Canadians, now condescendingly called \"ethnics.\" Of those who served with SOE , most were Yugoslavs who had immigrated to Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.}}</ref> In the US, however, Americans of Eastern European heritage faced government-enforced restrictions. Speaking to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], [[Russ Feingold]] acknowledged how \"Eastern European Americans were unfairly arrested, detained, interned, or relocated\" in a 2003 address.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/feingold_statement_10_16_03.pdf|title=Statement of The Honorable Russ Feingold|publisher=[[Senate Judiciary Committee]]|date=October 16, 2003|quote=Thousands of [[German Americans]], Italian Americans, and Eastern European Americans were unfairly arrested, detained, interned, or relocated. Our government confiscated the personal property of many [[European Americans]] and restricted their travel rights.}}</ref>

In both Canada and the United States, in the post-WWII period, politically active Eastern European people were forced to tread a careful line of diplomacy in both North American nations; demonstrating loyalty to their countries, while advocating for interventional policy which might aid people in their ancestral homelands.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H. L'Homedieu |title=Baltic Exiles and the U.S. Congress: Investigations and Legacies of the House Select Committee, 1953-1955|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois Press|edition=Volume 31|chapter=Journal of American Ethnic History|page=41|quote=Politically motivated Eastern European Americans rejected the postwar political settlement in their former homelands.

====Social breakthrough====
Eastern Europeans in Canada were shown to be underrepresented in professional occupations (and overrepresented in the [[personal service sector]]) by a 1961 census.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irwin Taylor Sanders|author2=Ewa T. Morawska|title=Polish American Community Life: A Survey of Research|date=1975|publisher=[[Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America]]|isbn=978-0940962309|chapter=|page=35|quote=Porter has shown that in 1961 Canadian Eastern European ethnics were underrepresented in professions and overrepresented in personal service. In the unskilled occupations Eastern Europeans reached the national mean in 1961.}}</ref> Cultural assimilation of Eastern Europeans was increasingly common in mid-20th-century North America. Professor [[Marc Shell]] has written regarding the Canadian government's enforcement of the [[anglicisation of names]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marc Shell|authorlink=Marc Shell|title=Polio and Its Aftermath: The Paralysis of Culture|date=2005|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0674013155|chapter=One Polio Story|page=55|quote=I became [[de jure]] Mark Shell in 1967 by means of an official [[Order of Council]]. (Such name changes were not untypical among assimilating Eastern Europeans in Canada.)}}</ref>

In the US, Eastern Europeans were also gradually being accepted into mainstream American culture. Historian [[David Halberstam]], speaking in a [[New England Board of Higher Education]] interview, discussed how access to [[white society]] became plausible for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nebhe.org/fall-2005-connection-50-years-of-new-england-higher-education-and-economic-development/|title=Fall 2005 Connection: 50 Years of New England Higher Education and Economic Development|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[New England Board of Higher Education]]|quote= But in retrospect, it was narrower than we thought. We perceived ourselves in the ‘50s as a white society, and the breakthrough was mostly limited to people who were descendents of Italian-Americans, Eastern European Americans, children of Jewish immigrants.”}}</ref> Perhaps respresenting this social change best, the [[US Census Bureau]] found that the Eastern European  born in this time period (between 1956 and 1965) were indistinguishable, in education results, with [[British Americans]].  Eastern European Americans were found to have also outperformed US citizens of solely British heritage in the completion of [[bachelor's degrees]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dominic J. Pulera|title=Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America|date=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0826418296|chapter=A Nation of 100 Million|page=30|quote=The Census Bureau found that 55.9% of white men born between 1956 and 1965 had attended college and 25.5% of them had completed bachelor's degrees. However, the percentages had virtually converged for two groups in this cohort: men of solely [[British ancestry]] (66.3% and 31.8%, respectively) and Southern and Eastern European men (66.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too. While the [[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans began to prosper in America, [[African Americans]] continued to suffer from discrimination and diminished life chances}}</ref>

====Late 20th-century====
During the 1970s, the majority of Eastern Europeans resident in Canada lived in the country's main urban centers. The exception being those of Ukrainian heritage, who still mostly lived rurally.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peggy Tyrchniewicz|title=Ethnic folk costumes in Canada|date=1979|publisher=[[Hyperion Press]]|isbn=978-0920534106|chapter=|page=111|quote=By 1971, the greatest percentage of all eastern European Canadians lived in the largest urban centers. The exception is the Ukrainians who live mainnly on the prairies.}}</ref> During this time, the [[Helsinki Accords]] were the cause of various political strife between the [[Ford administration]] and Eastern European people in the US.<ref>{{cite article|title=Through the Looking Glass: The Helsinki Final Act and the 1976 Election for President|author1=Sarah B. Snyder |date=2010|pages=86-106|publisher=Diplomacy & Statecraft|quote=[[Helsinki Final Act]] became a point of contention between the [[White House]] and Eastern European Americans during Ford's election campaign}}</ref> Whereas, writing in 1980, Dr Roy Norton suggested that the group were appreciative of the role Canada played in the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]], as well as the country's consistent criticizm of abuses to human rights in their ancestral lands.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nelson Michaud|editor2=Kim Richard Nossal|author1=Roy Norton|title=Diplomatic Departures: The Conservative Era in Canadian Foreign Policy, 1984-93 (Canada and International Relations)|date=2002|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|isbn=978-0774808651|chapter=Ethnic Groups and Conservative Foreign Policy|page=247|quote=Most eastern European-Canadians appeared to be pleased with Canada's leadership at the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] and on individual human rights cases; one community leader claimed he \"always felt [[Joe Clark]] was totally in tune with the position [he] was advocating\".}}</ref>

====Academic studies====
Academic reesearch has been utilized in the study of Eastern European diaspora in North American.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Wilhelm Kohler|title=European Economic Integration, WTO Membership, Immigration and Offshoring|date=2014|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-9814440189|chapter=Restrictive Immigration Policy in Germany: Pains and Gains Foregone?|page=409|quote=(iii) A “high education” scenario which assumes that the composition of the inflow equals the one observed for Eastern Europeans in Canada between 1995 and 2000.}}</ref> Professor Cezara O. Crisan has suggested, based on 2019 research at [[Purdue University Northwest]], that Eastern European Canadians are particularly likely to be politically and economically vested with the Eastern European nation that their heritage descends from.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cezara O.

In 2008, a genetic research investigation consecutively tested over five hundred Eastern European US citizens, in order to identify [[human leukocyte antigen]] alleles. The research, which was based at the [[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]], contributed towards the creation of a [[hematopoietic stem cell]] register.<ref>{{cite study|title=HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allele and haplotype frequencies distinguish Eastern European Americans from the general European American population.|date=2008|publisher=[[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]]|author=S.

'''Backlash (2008)''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|event]] produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). It took place on April 27, 2008, at the [[1st Mariner Arena]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. Following WrestleMania, all pay-per-views became tri-branded. It was the tenth annual event under the [[WWE Backlash|Backlash]] name and starred [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees|wrestler]] talents from [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], and [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brands]].

Eight [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] were scheduled on the event's [[Card (sports)|card]], which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]]. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal 4-Way elimination]] for the [[WWE Championship]] match featuring wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which all four men fought in the ring at the same time, with competitors being eliminated by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. [[Triple H]] defeated WWE Champion [[Randy Orton]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] to win the championship. The other main event featured wrestlers from the SmackDown brand, in which defending [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Undertaker]] defeated challenger [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]], also known as a singles match. The main event from the ECW brand was a standard match in which defending [[ECW Championship|ECW Champion]] [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defeated challenger [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]. In addition, a featured bout was scheduled on the undercard, in which [[Shawn Michaels]] defeated [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] in a standard match.

Backlash (2008) had an attendance of approximately 11,277 and received 200,000 buys, more than the [[Backlash (2007)|previous year's event]].<ref name=\"Revenue\">{{cite journal|title=World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

==Storylines==
[[File:Cena-2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Cena]] competed in the [[WWE Championship]] match.]]
This event featured seven [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|characters]] in planned storylines that took place before, during and after the event. All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's brands&nbsp;– [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], or [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]&nbsp;– the three [[WWE Brand Extension|storyline divisions]] in which WWE assigned its employees.

Wrestlers from Raw were featured in the [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] at Backlash: a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|fatal 4-way elimination]] match, in which four men wrestled each other and can be eliminated only by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. The match was contested for the [[WWE Championship]], featuring the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defending against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The buildup to the match began at [[WrestleMania XXIV]], where Randy Orton defended his title against Triple H and John Cena in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], in which the three men competed against each other, and the first man to score a pinfall or submission would win. Orton won the match, retaining the title after pinning Cena.<ref name=\"WM24-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml|title=WWE WrestleMania XXIV PPV Results – 3/30/08|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-03-30|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-01-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110091532/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml| archivedate= 10 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"WM24-2\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania24/2008/03/31/5148416.html|title=Mayweather, Orton survive Mania; Edge, Flair don't|last=Plummer|first=Dave|publisher=Canoe: Slam Wrestling|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> On the following night's episode of ''Raw'', with the WWE Championship shining on his shoulder, Randy Orton crowed about defeating both Triple H and John Cena at WrestleMania, declaring his reign as champion the \"Age of Orton\". But John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield had other ideas, telling Orton that he deserved a title match as a reward for proving that he was the toughest Superstar on Raw in his [[Hardcore wrestling|Belfast Brawl]] victory over [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] also at WrestleMania. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', WWE Champion Randy Orton began the night believing he would go one-on-one with JBL at Backlash, but the tide quickly turned on him. Due to Triple H's complaint about himself being [[Professional wrestling attacks#Football kick|kicked]] in the head by Orton when he was about to pin Cena to win the WWE title at Wrestlemania, [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] placed Triple H into a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap match]] against Orton & JBL, and when Triple H won, Regal made the [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] for the title. Not to be outdone, John Cena also pleaded his case to Regal, who gave him the same Handicap Match ultimatum. After Orton's intended interference failed, Cena pulled out the win, thus, the championship match at Backlash became a Fatal Four Way starring three former WWE Champions challenging Orton. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', after his victory over William Regal, Orton felt compelled to meddle in the bout between Triple H and JBL. In an attempt at eliminating Triple H from Backlash, Orton ran in and nearly took off Triple H's head. He administered an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] before then teaming with JBL against him. As Orton was set to punt Triple H's noggin again, however, JBL turned on him and laid him out with a vicious [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|Clothesline From Hell]].

The main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into Backlash on the SmackDown brand was between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In February, at [[No Way Out (2008)|No Way Out]], Undertaker won an [[Elimination Chamber]] match to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania XXIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2008/matches/6323422/results/|title=World Title's telltale hour|accessdate=2008-02-17|last=Tello|first=Craig|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=2008-02-17}}</ref> At WrestleMania, Undertaker defeated Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship and extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 16–0.<ref>{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Tello|date=2008-03-30|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/2008/matches/6208634/results/|title=Sweet Sixteen|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> On the April 4, 2008 episode of ''SmackDown'', [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|SmackDown General Manager]] [[Vickie Guerrero]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] a WrestleMania rematch between Undertaker and Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash.<ref name=\"4/04 SmackDown\">{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Borchardt|date=2008-04-04|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/72495/|title=411's WWE SmackDown Report 04.04.08|publisher=411mania.com|accessdate=2008-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080408064011/http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/72495/| archivedate= 8 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

The secondary feud for [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] heading into Backlash was between [[Matt Hardy]] and [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]]. On the November 16th, 2007 edition of [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] after failing to regain the [[WWE Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Championship]] from John Morrison and The Miz, MVP attacked Matt Hardy targeting and injuring his knee. The feud would start again at [[WrestleMania XXIV]] where Matt Hardy cost MVP the Money in the Bank Ladder Match by performing a Twist of Fate at the top of the ladder. Hardy would then face MVP on the April 4th, 2008 edition of SmackDown in a non-title match, which he won. It was confirmed on the next SmackDown that Matt Hardy would face MVP for the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]] at Backlash.

[[File:Adam Copeland.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], who faced [[The Undertaker]] for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]].]]
The primary feud on the ECW brand was between [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]], with the two battling over the [[ECW Championship]]. Before WrestleMania XXIV aired live on pay-per-view, Kane won a 24-Man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]] to earn an ECW Championship match against Chavo Guerrero later that night.<ref name=\"'Mania XXIV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania24.html|title=WrestleMania XXIV results|date=2008-03-30|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080404183551/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania24.html| archivedate= 4 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Kane would go on to defeat Guerrero and become the new ECW Champion.<ref name=\"'Mania XXIV\"/> On the April 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'', SmackDown! General Manager Vickie Guerrero booked Kane to defend the ECW Championship against Chavo Guerrero at Backlash.<ref name=\"4/04 SmackDown\"/> The feud intensified on the April 8 episode of ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'', where during a contract signing for Backlash, Guerrero, with assistance from [[Justin LaRouche|Bam Neeley]], [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder]], delivered a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Frog splash]] on Kane through a [[Table (furniture)|table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw-wwe/080408.html|accessdate=2008-04-28|title=ECW on Sci-Fi (April 8, 2008) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080425031806/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw-wwe/080408.html| archivedate= 25 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Two weeks later on April 22, 2008, the feud again intensified during an episode of the ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown#Recurring segments|Cutting Edge]]'', in which [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], Hawkins, Ryder, and Neeley ganged up against Kane. The gang-up allowed Guerrero to attack Kane with a [[Folding chair|steel chair]].<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw-wwe/080422.html|accessdate=2008-04-28|title=ECW on Sci-Fi (April 22, 2008) Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501232253/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw-wwe/080422.html| archivedate= 1 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Another feud leading up to Backlash was between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Dave Bautista|Batista]]. Upset over the retirement of [[Ric Flair]] at the hands of Michaels at WrestleMania XXIV, Batista interrupted Michaels' address on the April 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'' and called him a \"selfish\" person for what he did at WrestleMania. Batista blamed Michaels for not lying down for Flair and thus protecting his career instead of retiring him. Michaels defended his actions by saying Flair had called upon him to bring his best to WrestleMania, which he did. The conflict continued on an episode of [[Chris Jericho]]'s \"[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Highlight Reel]]\" interview segment that featured both men on the April 7 episode of ''Raw''. Following another tense verbal standoff, Batista left the ring saying he had something in store for Michaels. Moments later, Raw General Manager William Regal said he had confirmed a match with SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero between Michaels and Batista at Backlash. In addition, the following week Jericho had a confrontation with Shawn Michaels who ended up kicking Jericho in the face. Frustrated, Jericho went to Regal in an effort to possibly add himself to the match. Regal did indeed add Jericho to the match, but not as a competitor. Instead he announced Jericho as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] for the match.

Before the event began and aired [[Live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] was featured in which [[WWE Tag Team Championship (2002–2010)|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[John Morrison and The Miz]] defeated [[James Yun|Jimmy Wang Yang]] and [[Shannon Moore]].<ref name=\"Facts\"/>

===Preliminary matches===
Following the dark match, the pay-per-view event began with a standard match for the [[WWE United States Championship]], in which the champion, [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP) defended his title against [[Matt Hardy]]. Throughout the match, both Hardy and MVP performed a number of offensive maneuvers on each other, but Hardy eventually gained the advantage when MVP charged Hardy and Hardy dodged him, followed by Hardy performing a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Twist of Fate|Twist of Fate]], on MVP. He followed this with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Cover|cover]] for a successful pinfall, giving Hardy the victory and the championship.<ref name=\"WrestleView\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1209351283.shtml|title=WWE Backlash PPV Results – 4/27/08|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-04-27|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222020111/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1209351283.shtml| archivedate= 22 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"Slam\">{{cite web|last=Hillhouse|first=Dave|accessdate=2009-01-03|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2008/04/28/5407546.html|title=HHH reigns again after Backlash|publisher=Canoe: Slam Wrestling}}</ref>

The second bout was a standard match for the [[ECW Championship]], in which the champion, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defended his title against [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]], who was accompanied by [[Justin LaRouche|Bam Neely]]. Guerrero spent much of the match attacking Kane's leg, and toward the end of the match he performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Frog Splash]], on Kane. Before he could cover Kane for a pinfall, however, Kane [[chokeslam]]ed him. Kane then covered Guerrero for a pinfall, thus retaining his championship.<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_25416.shtml|title=Keller's WWE Backlash PPV Report 4/27: Ongoing \"virtual time\" coverage of live PPV event|date=2008-04-27|last=Keller|first=Wade|publisher=PW Torch|accessdate=2009-01-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090207115507/http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_25416.shtml| archivedate= 7 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

[[File:BigShow-Khali-Staredown.jpg|left|thumb|[[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] and [[The Great Khali]] staring at each other before their match]]
The following contest featured [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] against [[The Great Khali]] in a standard match. Both men wrestled inconclusively until The Big Show performed a [[body slam]] onto Khali, after which Khali attempted to perform a [[Chokeslam#Two handed chokeslam|two handed chokeslam]] on The Big Show. The Big Show countered, however, and delivered a chokeslam to Khali. He then covered him for a successful pinfall, winning the match.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

The fourth match was a standard match between [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[Shawn Michaels]], with [[Chris Jericho]] as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special guest referee]]. The men performed a number of offensive moves on one another throughout the match, including Shawn Michaels performing a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|crossface]] on Batista. The match also briefly went to the ringside area, where the ringpost was used as a weapon by Michaels. The end of the match came when Batista lifted Michaels for a [[powerbomb]], the Batista Bomb. Michaels, however, escaped from the hold in the air, and when he fell, suffered a [[kayfabe|storyline]] knee injury, which caused Jericho to check on Michaels and stop Batista from acting. Michaels eventually got to his feet, and used [[superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Batista. Michaels then covered Batista for a successful pinfall, winning the match. Afterward, Michaels returned to the backstage area [[Sell (professional wrestling)|while limping heavily]].<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

[[File:HBK-crossface-Batista.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shawn Michaels]] with a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|Crossface]] applied to [[Dave Batista|Batista]]]]
The next contest was a twelve-[[WWE Diva|Diva]] [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]] featuring the team of [[Beth Phoenix]], [[Melina Perez|Melina]], [[Natalya (wrestler)|Natayla]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]], [[Layla El|Layla]], and [[Jillian Hall]] against the team of [[Mickie James]], [[Ashley Massaro|Ashley]], [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]], [[Michelle McCool]], [[Kelly Kelly]], and [[Cherry (wrestler)|Cherry]]. The match began with Michelle McCool against Beth Phoenix, and over the course of the match, all of the women participated in the contest. The end of the match came when Beth Phoenix performed a [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] on Ashley, and then covered her for a successful pin, giving her team the victory.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

===Main event matches===
[[File:Undertaker-Gogoplata-Edge.jpg|thumb|left|Undertaker applying ''[[Gogoplata|Hell's Gate]]'' on [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], which ended the match.]]
The sixth match of the event was a standard match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], in which the champion, [[The Undertaker]], defended his title against [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. The match was contested back and forth between the two men, with the early portions of the match featuring The Undertaker controlling much of the action. Edge eventually took an advantage when he exposed the turnbuckle in the corner, and The Undertaker ran head first into it. [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|Curt Hawkins]] then struck The Undertaker with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, which was followed by an unsuccessful cover by Edge.  Edge then attempted to hit Undertaker with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]], but The Undertaker countered the maneuver hitting Edge with a  [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]]. [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|Zack Ryder]] then attempted to interfere on behalf of Edge, but The Undertaker threw Edge into Ryder and then caught Edge in an attempted [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]], in which The Undertaker would have held Edge upside down and knelt, driving Edge's head into the mat. Edge countered the move, however, into a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]]. While Edge was pinning The Undertaker, however, The Undertaker performed a [[gogoplata]] submission hold, which caused Edge to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]], giving The Undertaker the victory. The Undertaker continued to apply the hold after the match ended, injuring (in storyline) Edge. Edge was removed from the ring on a stretcher by medics, making his injury appear realistic.<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

[[File:RandyOrtonAfterLoss.jpg|thumb|right|[[Randy Orton]] who lost the [[WWE Championship]] to [[Triple H]]]]
The main event was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|four-way elimination]] match for the [[WWE Championship]], in which the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defended his title against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The match began with Orton attempting to attack JBL, but JBL countered and threw Orton out of the ring.  JBL then attacked Cena, before being attacked by Triple H.  Cena then attempted to [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|swing Triple H by the arm]] into the corner, but Triple H reversed the move and sent Cena outside of the ring. Triple H and JBL then fought in the ring, while Cena and Orton fought outside. Cena was later sent off the ring apron into the ''Raw'' announcer's table, and Orton and JBL teamed up to attack Triple H in the ring. Triple H eventually hit both of them with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]], and JBL went to the outside of the ring while Triple H and Orton fought inside. Triple H later went outside of the ring and fought with JBL, while Cena returned to the ring and fought with Orton. After the men fought each other for several minutes, Cena put JBL in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|STFU]]. This caused JBL to submit, eliminating him from the match. Immediately following JBL's submission, Orton [[Professional wrestling attacks#Punt|kicked Cena in the head]], which he followed with a cover for a pinfall, eliminating Cena from the match. Triple H and Orton then began to fight on the outside of the ring, with Orton taking control and sending Triple H back into the ring, where he dominated Triple H with a series of maneuvers for several minutes before Triple H struck Orton with his knee. The men fought outside the ring again, and when they returned, they fought for several more minutes until Orton performed a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|jumping cutter]], or RKO, on Triple H. Orton would then try to pin Triple H, only to get a two count. Orton then attempted to kick Triple H in the head, but Triple H dodged the maneuver and both men would counter their finishers until Triple H performed a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] on Orton followed by a successful pin-fall, thus earning him his twelfth world championship.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

==Aftermath==
The feud between [[Triple H]] and [[Randy Orton]] continued. On the April 28 episode of ''Raw'', Orton challenged Triple H for the [[WWE Championship]] later on in the night.<ref name=\"WWEPreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/matches/6990680/preview/ |title=Match Preview |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430135350/http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/matches/6990680/preview/ |archivedate=2008-04-30 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Raw28\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/|title=Hear ye, hear ye|accessdate=2008-05-01|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514184356/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/| archivedate= 14 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] stopped the match midway through, however, and later [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] the two in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage match]] for the title at [[Judgment Day (2008)|Judgment Day]].<ref name=\"WWEPreview\"/><ref name=\"Raw28\"/>

On the May 2 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'', [[Vickie Guerrero]] cancelled a scheduled World Title match between Undertaker and [[The Great Khali]] and stripped [[The Undertaker]] of the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], and [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder]] stole the physical belt and handed it to Guerrero. The next week on ''SmackDown'', Guerrero booked a \"Championship Chase\" where the winner would face the Undertaker for the vacant World Championship at Judgment Day. Batista originally won, but his victory was cut short after Guerrero came out and announced that Edge had been medically cleared and would be able to compete. Thus, the match continued, and Edge defeated Batista, gaining the championship match at Judgment Day.

The following night on ''Raw'', Mickie James' team defeated Beth Phoenix's team in a 12-Diva rematch from Backlash. The following week, James retained the Women's Championship against Phoenix in a lumberjill match, with the win coming after the evil Melina attempted to strike James with her boot, but accidentally struck Phoenix. The alliance between Phoenix and Melina ended a week later, and the two Divas would face James at Judgment Day for the title.

'''Backlash (2008)''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|event]] produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). It took place on April 27, 2008, at the [[1st Mariner Arena]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. Following WrestleMania, all pay-per-views became tri-branded. It was the tenth annual event under the [[WWE Backlash|Backlash]] name and starred [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees|wrestler]] talents from [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], and [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brands]].

Eight [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] were scheduled on the event's [[Card (sports)|card]], which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]]. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal 4-Way elimination]] for the [[WWE Championship]] match featuring wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which all four men fought in the ring at the same time, with competitors being eliminated by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. [[Triple H]] defeated WWE Champion [[Randy Orton]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] to win the championship. The other main event featured wrestlers from the SmackDown brand, in which defending [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Undertaker]] defeated challenger [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]], also known as a singles match. The main event from the ECW brand was a standard match in which defending [[ECW Championship|ECW Champion]] [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defeated challenger [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]. In addition, a featured bout was scheduled on the undercard, in which [[Shawn Michaels]] defeated [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] in a standard match.

Backlash (2008) had an attendance of approximately 11,277 and received 200,000 buys, more than the [[Backlash (2007)|previous year's event]].<ref name=\"Revenue\">{{cite journal|title=World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

==Storylines==
[[File:Cena-2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Cena]] competed in the [[WWE Championship]] match.]]
This event featured seven [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|characters]] in planned storylines that took place before, during and after the event. All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's brands&nbsp;– [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], or [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]&nbsp;– the three [[WWE Brand Extension|storyline divisions]] in which WWE assigned its employees.

Wrestlers from Raw were featured in the [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] at Backlash: a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|fatal 4-way elimination]] match, in which four men wrestled each other and can be eliminated only by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. The match was contested for the [[WWE Championship]], featuring the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defending against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The buildup to the match began at [[WrestleMania XXIV]], where Randy Orton defended his title against Triple H and John Cena in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], in which the three men competed against each other, and the first man to score a pinfall or submission would win. Orton won the match, retaining the title after pinning Cena.<ref name=\"WM24-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml|title=WWE WrestleMania XXIV PPV Results – 3/30/08|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-03-30|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-01-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110091532/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml| archivedate= 10 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"WM24-2\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania24/2008/03/31/5148416.html|title=Mayweather, Orton survive Mania; Edge, Flair don't|last=Plummer|first=Dave|publisher=Canoe: Slam Wrestling|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> On the following night's episode of ''Raw'', with the WWE Championship shining on his shoulder, Randy Orton crowed about defeating both Triple H and John Cena at WrestleMania, declaring his reign as champion the \"Age of Orton\". But John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield had other ideas, telling Orton that he deserved a title match as a reward for proving that he was the toughest Superstar on Raw in his [[Hardcore wrestling|Belfast Brawl]] victory over [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] also at WrestleMania. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', WWE Champion Randy Orton began the night believing he would go one-on-one with JBL at Backlash, but the tide quickly turned on him. Due to Triple H's complaint about himself being [[Professional wrestling attacks#Football kick|kicked]] in the head by Orton when he was about to pin Cena to win the WWE title at Wrestlemania, [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] placed Triple H into a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap match]] against Orton & JBL, and when Triple H won, Regal made the [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] for the title. Not to be outdone, John Cena also pleaded his case to Regal, who gave him the same Handicap Match ultimatum. After Orton's intended interference failed, Cena pulled out the win, thus, the championship match at Backlash became a Fatal Four Way starring three former WWE Champions challenging Orton. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', after his victory over William Regal, Orton felt compelled to meddle in the bout between Triple H and JBL. In an attempt at eliminating Triple H from Backlash, Orton ran in and nearly took off Triple H's head. He administered an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] before then teaming with JBL against him.

The main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into Backlash on the SmackDown brand was between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In February, at [[No Way Out (2008)|No Way Out]], Undertaker won an [[Elimination Chamber]] match to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania XXIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2008/matches/6323422/results/|title=World Title's telltale hour|accessdate=2008-02-17|last=Tello|first=Craig|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=2008-02-17}}</ref> At WrestleMania, Undertaker defeated Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship and extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 16–0.<ref>{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Tello|date=2008-03-30|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/2008/matches/6208634/results/|title=Sweet Sixteen|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> On the April 4, 2008 episode of ''SmackDown'', [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|SmackDown General Manager]] [[Vickie Guerrero]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] a WrestleMania rematch between Undertaker and Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash.<ref name=\"4/04 SmackDown\">{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Borchardt|date=2008-04-04|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/72495/|title=411's WWE SmackDown Report 04.04.08|publisher=411mania.com|accessdate=2008-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080408064011/http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/72495/| archivedate= 8 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

The secondary feud for [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] heading into Backlash was between [[Matt Hardy]] and [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]]. On the November 16th, 2007 edition of [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] after failing to regain the [[WWE Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Championship]] from John Morrison and The Miz, MVP attacked Matt Hardy targeting and injuring his knee. The feud would start again at [[WrestleMania XXIV]] where Matt Hardy cost MVP the Money in the Bank Ladder Match by performing a Twist of Fate at the top of the ladder. Hardy would then face MVP on the April 4th, 2008 edition of SmackDown in a non-title match, which he won. It was confirmed on the next SmackDown that Matt Hardy would face MVP for the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]] at Backlash.

The primary feud on the ECW brand was between [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]], with the two battling over the [[ECW Championship]]. Before WrestleMania XXIV aired live on pay-per-view, Kane won a 24-Man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]] to earn an ECW Championship match against Chavo Guerrero later that night.<ref name=\"'Mania XXIV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania24.html|title=WrestleMania XXIV results|date=2008-03-30|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080404183551/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania24.html| archivedate= 4 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Kane would go on to defeat Guerrero and become the new ECW Champion.<ref name=\"'Mania XXIV\"/> On the April 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'', SmackDown!

Another feud leading up to Backlash was between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Dave Bautista|Batista]]. Upset over the retirement of [[Ric Flair]] at the hands of Michaels at WrestleMania XXIV, Batista interrupted Michaels' address on the April 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'' and called him a \"selfish\" person for what he did at WrestleMania. Batista blamed Michaels for not lying down for Flair and thus protecting his career instead of retiring him. Michaels defended his actions by saying Flair had called upon him to bring his best to WrestleMania, which he did. The conflict continued on an episode of [[Chris Jericho]]'s \"[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Highlight Reel]]\" interview segment that featured both men on the April 7 episode of ''Raw''. Following another tense verbal standoff, Batista left the ring saying he had something in store for Michaels. Moments later, Raw General Manager William Regal said he had confirmed a match with SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero between Michaels and Batista at Backlash. In addition, the following week Jericho had a confrontation with Shawn Michaels who ended up kicking Jericho in the face. Frustrated, Jericho went to Regal in an effort to possibly add himself to the match. Regal did indeed add Jericho to the match, but not as a competitor. Instead he announced Jericho as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] for the match.

Before the event began and aired [[Live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] was featured in which [[WWE Tag Team Championship (2002–2010)|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[John Morrison and The Miz]] defeated [[James Yun|Jimmy Wang Yang]] and [[Shannon Moore]].<ref name=\"Facts\"/>

===Preliminary matches===
Following the dark match, the pay-per-view event began with a standard match for the [[WWE United States Championship]], in which the champion, [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP) defended his title against [[Matt Hardy]]. Throughout the match, both Hardy and MVP performed a number of offensive maneuvers on each other, but Hardy eventually gained the advantage when MVP charged Hardy and Hardy dodged him, followed by Hardy performing a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Twist of Fate|Twist of Fate]], on MVP. He followed this with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Cover|cover]] for a successful pinfall, giving Hardy the victory and the championship.<ref name=\"WrestleView\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1209351283.shtml|title=WWE Backlash PPV Results – 4/27/08|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-04-27|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222020111/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1209351283.shtml| archivedate= 22 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"Slam\">{{cite web|last=Hillhouse|first=Dave|accessdate=2009-01-03|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2008/04/28/5407546.html|title=HHH reigns again after Backlash|publisher=Canoe: Slam Wrestling}}</ref>

The second bout was a standard match for the [[ECW Championship]], in which the champion, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defended his title against [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]], who was accompanied by [[Justin LaRouche|Bam Neely]]. Guerrero spent much of the match attacking Kane's leg, and toward the end of the match he performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Frog Splash]], on Kane. Before he could cover Kane for a pinfall, however, Kane [[chokeslam]]ed him. Kane then covered Guerrero for a pinfall, thus retaining his championship.<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_25416.shtml|title=Keller's WWE Backlash PPV Report 4/27: Ongoing \"virtual time\" coverage of live PPV event|date=2008-04-27|last=Keller|first=Wade|publisher=PW Torch|accessdate=2009-01-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090207115507/http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_25416.shtml| archivedate= 7 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

[[File:BigShow-Khali-Staredown.jpg|left|thumb|[[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] and [[The Great Khali]] staring at each other before their match]]
The following contest featured [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] against [[The Great Khali]] in a standard match. Both men wrestled inconclusively until The Big Show performed a [[body slam]] onto Khali, after which Khali attempted to perform a [[Chokeslam#Two handed chokeslam|two handed chokeslam]] on The Big Show. The Big Show countered, however, and delivered a chokeslam to Khali. He then covered him for a successful pinfall, winning the match.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

The fourth match was a standard match between [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[Shawn Michaels]], with [[Chris Jericho]] as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special guest referee]]. The men performed a number of offensive moves on one another throughout the match, including Shawn Michaels performing a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|crossface]] on Batista. The match also briefly went to the ringside area, where the ringpost was used as a weapon by Michaels. The end of the match came when Batista lifted Michaels for a [[powerbomb]], the Batista Bomb. Michaels, however, escaped from the hold in the air, and when he fell, suffered a [[kayfabe|storyline]] knee injury, which caused Jericho to check on Michaels and stop Batista from acting. Michaels eventually got to his feet, and used [[superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Batista. Michaels then covered Batista for a successful pinfall, winning the match. Afterward, Michaels returned to the backstage area [[Sell (professional wrestling)|while limping heavily]].<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

[[File:HBK-crossface-Batista.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shawn Michaels]] with a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|Crossface]] applied to [[Dave Batista|Batista]]]]
The next contest was a twelve-[[WWE Diva|Diva]] [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]] featuring the team of [[Beth Phoenix]], [[Melina Perez|Melina]], [[Natalya (wrestler)|Natayla]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]], [[Layla El|Layla]], and [[Jillian Hall]] against the team of [[Mickie James]], [[Ashley Massaro|Ashley]], [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]], [[Michelle McCool]], [[Kelly Kelly]], and [[Cherry (wrestler)|Cherry]]. The match began with Michelle McCool against Beth Phoenix, and over the course of the match, all of the women participated in the contest. The end of the match came when Beth Phoenix performed a [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] on Ashley, and then covered her for a successful pin, giving her team the victory.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

===Main event matches===
[[File:Undertaker-Gogoplata-Edge.jpg|thumb|left|Undertaker applying ''[[Gogoplata|Hell's Gate]]'' on [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], which ended the match.]]
The sixth match of the event was a standard match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], in which the champion, [[The Undertaker]], defended his title against [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. The match was contested back and forth between the two men, with the early portions of the match featuring The Undertaker controlling much of the action. Edge eventually took an advantage when he exposed the turnbuckle in the corner, and The Undertaker ran head first into it. [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|Curt Hawkins]] then struck The Undertaker with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, which was followed by an unsuccessful cover by Edge.  Edge then attempted to hit Undertaker with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]], but The Undertaker countered the maneuver hitting Edge with a  [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]]. [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|Zack Ryder]] then attempted to interfere on behalf of Edge, but The Undertaker threw Edge into Ryder and then caught Edge in an attempted [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]], in which The Undertaker would have held Edge upside down and knelt, driving Edge's head into the mat. Edge countered the move, however, into a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]]. While Edge was pinning The Undertaker, however, The Undertaker performed a [[gogoplata]] submission hold, which caused Edge to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]], giving The Undertaker the victory. The Undertaker continued to apply the hold after the match ended, injuring (in storyline) Edge. Edge was removed from the ring on a stretcher by medics, making his injury appear realistic.<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

[[File:RandyOrtonAfterLoss.jpg|thumb|right|[[Randy Orton]] who lost the [[WWE Championship]] to [[Triple H]]]]
The main event was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|four-way elimination]] match for the [[WWE Championship]], in which the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defended his title against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The match began with Orton attempting to attack JBL, but JBL countered and threw Orton out of the ring.  JBL then attacked Cena, before being attacked by Triple H.  Cena then attempted to [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|swing Triple H by the arm]] into the corner, but Triple H reversed the move and sent Cena outside of the ring. Triple H and JBL then fought in the ring, while Cena and Orton fought outside. Cena was later sent off the ring apron into the ''Raw'' announcer's table, and Orton and JBL teamed up to attack Triple H in the ring. Triple H eventually hit both of them with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]], and JBL went to the outside of the ring while Triple H and Orton fought inside. Triple H later went outside of the ring and fought with JBL, while Cena returned to the ring and fought with Orton. After the men fought each other for several minutes, Cena put JBL in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|STFU]]. This caused JBL to submit, eliminating him from the match. Immediately following JBL's submission, Orton [[Professional wrestling attacks#Punt|kicked Cena in the head]], which he followed with a cover for a pinfall, eliminating Cena from the match. Triple H and Orton then began to fight on the outside of the ring, with Orton taking control and sending Triple H back into the ring, where he dominated Triple H with a series of maneuvers for several minutes before Triple H struck Orton with his knee. The men fought outside the ring again, and when they returned, they fought for several more minutes until Orton performed a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|jumping cutter]], or RKO, on Triple H. Orton would then try to pin Triple H, only to get a two count. Orton then attempted to kick Triple H in the head, but Triple H dodged the maneuver and both men would counter their finishers until Triple H performed a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] on Orton followed by a successful pin-fall, thus earning him his twelfth world championship.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>

==Aftermath==
The feud between [[Triple H]] and [[Randy Orton]] continued. On the April 28 episode of ''Raw'', Orton challenged Triple H for the [[WWE Championship]] later on in the night.<ref name=\"WWEPreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/matches/6990680/preview/ |title=Match Preview |accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430135350/http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/matches/6990680/preview/ |archivedate=2008-04-30 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Raw28\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/|title=Hear ye, hear ye|accessdate=2008-05-01|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514184356/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/| archivedate= 14 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] stopped the match midway through, however, and later [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] the two in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage match]] for the title at [[Judgment Day (2008)|Judgment Day]].<ref name=\"WWEPreview\"/><ref name=\"Raw28\"/>

On the May 2 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'', [[Vickie Guerrero]] cancelled a scheduled World Title match between Undertaker and [[The Great Khali]] and stripped [[The Undertaker]] of the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], and [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder]] stole the physical belt and handed it to Guerrero. The next week on ''SmackDown'', Guerrero booked a \"Championship Chase\" where the winner would face the Undertaker for the vacant World Championship at Judgment Day. Batista originally won, but his victory was cut short after Guerrero came out and announced that Edge had been medically cleared and would be able to compete. Thus, the match continued, and Edge defeated Batista, gaining the championship match at Judgment Day.

The following night on ''Raw'', Mickie James' team defeated Beth Phoenix's team in a 12-Diva rematch from Backlash. The following week, James retained the Women's Championship against Phoenix in a lumberjill match, with the win coming after the evil Melina attempted to strike James with her boot, but accidentally struck Phoenix. The alliance between Phoenix and Melina ended a week later, and the two Divas would face James at Judgment Day for the title.

{{technical|date=December 2016}}

'''RNA splicing''', in [[molecular biology]], is a form of RNA processing in which a newly made [[precursor messenger RNA]] (pre-[[mRNA]]) [[transcription (biology)|transcript]] is transformed into a [[mature messenger RNA]] ([[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]). During splicing, [[intron]]s (Non-coding regions) are removed and [[exon]]s (Coding Regions) are joined together. For [[nuclear genes|nuclear-encoded genes]], splicing takes place within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] either during or immediately after [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]]. For those [[eukaryotic transcription|eukaryotic genes]] that contain introns, splicing is usually required in order to create an mRNA molecule that can be [[translation (biology)|translated into protein]].  For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a complex of small nuclear ribonucleo proteins ([[snRNP]]s). [[Self-splicing intron]]s, or [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own excision from their parent RNA molecule, also exist.
[[File:Splicesome.svg|thumb|Process of RNA splicing]]

==Splicing pathways==
Several methods of RNA splicing occur in nature; the type of splicing depends on the structure of the spliced intron and the [[catalyst]]s required for splicing to occur.

Within introns, a donor site (5' end of the intron), a branch site (near the 3' end of the intron) and an acceptor site (3' end of the intron) are required for splicing.  The splice donor site includes an almost invariant sequence GU at the 5' end of the intron, within a larger, less highly conserved region. The splice acceptor site at the 3' end of the intron terminates the intron with an almost invariant AG sequence.  Upstream (5'-ward) from the AG there is a region high in [[pyrimidine]]s (C and U), or [[polypyrimidine tract]].  Further upstream from the polypyrimidine tract is the branchpoint, which includes an adenine nucleotide involved in lariat formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Clancy | first = Suzanne | name-list-format = vanc | title = RNA Splicing: Introns, Exons and Spliceosome | journal = Nature Education | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 31 | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/rna-splicing-introns-exons-and-spliceosome-12375 | access-date = 31 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110315060903/http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/RNA-Splicing-Introns-Exons-and-Spliceosome-12375 | archive-date = 15 March 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=Black>{{cite journal | vauthors = Black DL | title = Mechanisms of alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 291–336 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12626338 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161720 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2hg605wm }}</ref> The consensus sequence for an intron (in IUPAC [[nucleic acid notation]]) is: G-G-[cut]-G-U-R-A-G-U (donor site) ... intron sequence ...

====Formation and activity====
Splicing is catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a large RNA-protein complex composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ([[snRNP]]s).  Assembly and activity of the spliceosome occurs during transcription of the pre-mRNA.  The RNA components of snRNPs interact with the intron and are involved in catalysis.  Two types of spliceosomes have been identified (major and minor) which contain different [[snRNP]]s.

*The '''major spliceosome''' splices introns containing GU at the 5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site.  It is composed of the [[U1 spliceosomal RNA|U1]], [[U2 spliceosomal RNA|U2]], [[U4 spliceosomal RNA|U4]], [[U5 spliceosomal RNA|U5]], and [[U6 spliceosomal RNA|U6]] [[snRNP]]s and is active in the nucleus. In addition, a number of proteins including [[U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1]] (U2AF35), [[U2AF2]] (U2AF65)<ref name=graveley2001>{{cite journal | vauthors = Graveley BR, Hertel KJ, Maniatis T | title = The role of U2AF35 and U2AF65 in enhancer-dependent splicing | journal = RNA | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 806–18 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11421359 | pmc = 1370132 | doi = 10.1017/s1355838201010317 | url = http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/7/6/806.abstract | access-date = 2014-12-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181120053109/https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/7/6/806.abstract | archive-date = 2018-11-20 | url-status = live }}</ref> and [[SF1 (gene)|SF1]] are required for the assembly of the spliceosome.<ref name=\"Black\"/><ref name=Matlin>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matlin AJ, Clark F, Smith CW | title = Understanding alternative splicing: towards a cellular code | journal = Nature Reviews.

:This type of splicing is termed ''canonical splicing'' or termed the ''lariat pathway'', which accounts for more than 99% of splicing.

==== Recursive splicing ====
In most cases, splicing removes introns as single units from precursor [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcripts. However, in some cases, especially in mRNAs with very long introns, splicing happens in steps, with part of an intron removed and then the remaining intron is spliced out in a following step. This has been found first in the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' (''Ubx'') gene of the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', and a few other ''Drosophila'' genes, but cases in humans have been reported as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sibley CR, Emmett W, Blazquez L, Faro A, Haberman N, Briese M, Trabzuni D, Ryten M, Weale ME, Hardy J, Modic M, Curk T, Wilson SW, Plagnol V, Ule J | title = Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7552 | pages = 371–75 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25970246 | pmc = 4471124 | doi = 10.1038/nature14466 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..371S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Duff MO, Olson S, Wei X, Garrett SC, Osman A, Bolisetty M, Plocik A, Celniker SE, Graveley BR | title = Genome-wide identification of zero nucleotide recursive splicing in Drosophila | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7552 | pages = 376–79 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25970244 | pmc = 4529404 | doi = 10.1038/nature14475 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..376D }}</ref>

==== Trans-splicing ====
[[Trans-splicing]] is a form of splicing that removes introns or [[outron]]s, and joins two exons that are not within the same RNA transcript.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Segni G, Gastaldi S, Tocchini-Valentini GP | title = Cis- and trans-splicing of mRNAs mediated by tRNA sequences in eukaryotic cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 19 | pages = 6864–69 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18458335 | pmc = 2383978 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800420105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.6864D | jstor = 25461891 }}</ref>

=== Self-splicing ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Intron]] -->
'''Self-splicing''' occurs for rare introns that form a [[ribozyme]], performing the functions of the spliceosome by RNA alone.  There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, ''[[Group I catalytic intron|Group I]]'', ''[[Group II intron|Group II]]'' and ''[[Group III intron|Group III]]''.  Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein.  This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome.  Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an [[RNA world]] present before protein.

Two transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:
# 3'OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site.
# 3'OH of the 5' exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.

The mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:
# The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the ''lariat''
# The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site, thereby joining the exons together.

===tRNA splicing===
[[tRNA]] (also tRNA-like) splicing is another rare form of splicing that usually occurs in tRNA.  The splicing reaction involves a different biochemistry than the spliceosomal and self-splicing pathways.

In the [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', a yeast tRNA splicing [[endonuclease]] heterotetramer, composed of [[TSEN54]], [[TSEN2]], [[TSEN34]], and [[TSEN15]], cleaves pre-tRNA at two sites in the acceptor loop to form a 5'-half tRNA, terminating at a 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester group, and a 3'-half tRNA, terminating at a 5'-hydroxyl group, along with a discarded intron.<ref name=trotta1997>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trotta CR, Miao F, Arn EA, Stevens SW, Ho CK, Rauhut R, Abelson JN | title = The yeast tRNA splicing endonuclease: a tetrameric enzyme with two active site subunits homologous to the archaeal tRNA endonucleases | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 849–58 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9200603 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80270-6 }}</ref>  Yeast tRNA kinase then phosphorylates the 5'-hydroxyl group using [[adenosine triphosphate]].

==Evolution==
Splicing occurs in all the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s or [[domain (biology)|domain]]s of life, however, the extent and types of splicing can be very different between the major divisions.  [[Eukaryote]]s splice many protein-coding [[mRNA|messenger RNA]]s and some [[non-coding RNA]]s. [[Prokaryote]]s, on the other hand, splice rarely and mostly non-coding RNAs. Another important difference between these two groups of organisms is that prokaryotes completely lack the spliceosomal pathway.

Because spliceosomal introns are not conserved in all species, there is debate concerning when spliceosomal splicing evolved.  Two models have been proposed: the intron late and intron early models (see [[Intron#Biological functions and evolution|intron evolution]]).

==Biochemical mechanism==
[[File:RNA splicing reaction.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating the two-step biochemistry of splicing]]
Spliceosomal splicing and self-splicing involve a two-step biochemical process.  Both steps involve [[transesterification]] reactions that occur between RNA nucleotides.  tRNA splicing, however, is an exception and does not occur by transesterification.<ref name=abelson1998>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abelson J, Trotta CR, Li H | title = tRNA splicing | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 21 | pages = 12685–88 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9582290 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.21.12685 }}</ref>

Spliceosomal and self-splicing transesterification reactions occur via two sequential transesterification reactions.  First, the 2'OH of a specific ''branchpoint'' nucleotide within the intron, defined during spliceosome assembly, performs a [[nucleophilic attack]] on the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5' splice site, forming the ''lariat intermediate''.  Second, the 3'OH of the released 5' exon then performs an electrophilic attack at the first nucleotide following the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3' splice site, thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat.<ref name=fica2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fica SM, Tuttle N, Novak T, Li NS, Lu J, Koodathingal P, Dai Q, Staley JP, Piccirilli JA | title = RNA catalyses nuclear pre-mRNA splicing | journal = Nature | volume = 503 | issue = 7475 | pages = 229–34 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24196718 | pmc = 4666680 | doi = 10.1038/nature12734 | bibcode = 2013Natur.503..229F }}</ref>

==Alternative splicing==
{{main|Alternative splicing}}

In many cases, the splicing process can create a range of unique proteins by varying the exon composition of the same mRNA. This phenomenon is then called [[alternative splicing]]. Alternative splicing can occur in many ways. Exons can be extended or skipped, or introns can be retained. It is estimated that 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, some instances of which occur in a tissue-specific manner and/or under specific cellular conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan Q, Shai O, Lee LJ, Frey BJ, Blencowe BJ | title = Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high-throughput sequencing | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 1413–15 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18978789 | doi = 10.1038/ng.259 }}</ref> Development of high throughput mRNA sequencing technology can help quantify the expression levels of alternatively spliced isoforms.

Given this complexity, alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is regulated by a system of trans-acting proteins (activators and repressors) that bind to cis-acting sites or \"elements\" (enhancers and silencers) on the pre-mRNA transcript itself. These proteins and their respective binding elements promote or reduce the usage of a particular splice site. The binding specificity comes from the sequence and structure of the cis-elements, e.g. in HIV-1 there are many donor and acceptor splice sites. Among the various splice sites, ssA7, which is 3' acceptor site, folds into three stem loop structures, i.e. Intronic splicing silencer (ISS), Exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), and Exonic splicing silencer (ESSE3). Solution structure of Intronic splicing silencer and its interaction to host protein hnRNPA1 give insight into specific recognition.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jain N, Morgan CE, Rife BD, Salemi M, Tolbert BS | title = Solution Structure of the HIV-1 Intron Splicing Silencer and Its Interactions with the UP1 Domain of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 291 | issue = 5 | pages = 2331–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26607354 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M115.674564 | pmc = 4732216 }}</ref> However, adding to the complexity of alternative splicing, it is noted that the effects of regulatory factors are many times position-dependent.

==Splicing errors and variation==
It has been suggested that one third of all disease-causing mutations impact on [[Split gene theory|splicing]].<ref name=Lim/> Common errors include:
*Mutation of a splice site resulting in loss of function of that site. Results in exposure of a premature [[stop codon]], loss of an exon, or inclusion of an intron.
*Mutation of a splice site reducing specificity. May result in variation in the splice location, causing insertion or deletion of amino acids, or most likely, a disruption of the [[reading frame]].
*Displacement of a splice site, leading to inclusion or exclusion of more RNA than expected, resulting in longer or shorter exons.
Although many splicing errors are safeguarded by a cellular quality control mechanism termed [[nonsense-mediated mRNA decay]] (NMD),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Danckwardt S, Neu-Yilik G, Thermann R, Frede U, Hentze MW, Kulozik AE | title = Abnormally spliced beta-globin mRNAs: a single point mutation generates transcripts sensitive and insensitive to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay | journal = Blood | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 1811–16 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11861299 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V99.5.1811 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9269f793ca028f65cc5e8c1dc595c4c3c838306c }}</ref> a number of splicing-related diseases also exist, as suggested above.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ward AJ, Cooper TA | title = The pathobiology of splicing | journal = The Journal of Pathology | volume = 220 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–63 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19918805 | pmc = 2855871 | doi = 10.1002/path.2649 }}</ref>

Allelic differences in mRNA splicing are likely to be a common and important source of phenotypic diversity at the molecular level, in addition to their contribution to genetic disease susceptibility. Indeed, genome-wide studies in humans have identified a range of genes that are subject to allele-specific splicing.

In plants, variation for flooding stress tolerance correlated with stress-induced alternative splicing of transcripts associated with gluconeogenesis and other processes. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Veen |first1=H |last2=Vashisht |first2=D |last3=Akman |first3=M |last4=Girke |first4=T |last5=Mustroph |first5=A |last6=Reinen |first6=E |last7=Hartman |first7=S |last8=Kooiker |first8=M |last9=van Tienderen |first9=P |last10=Schranz |first10=ME |last11=Bailey-Serres |first11=J |last12=Voesenek |first12=LA |last13=Sasidharan |first13=R |title=Transcriptomes of Eight Arabidopsis thaliana Accessions Reveal Core Conserved, Genotype- and Organ-Specific Responses to Flooding Stress |journal=Plant Physiology |date=October 2016 |volume=172 |issue=2 |pages=668–89 |doi=10.1104/pp.16.00472 |pmid=27208254|pmc=5047075 }}</ref>

==Protein splicing==
{{Main|Protein splicing}}
In addition to RNA, proteins can undergo splicing. Although the biomolecular mechanisms are different, the principle is the same: parts of the protein, called [[intein]]s instead of introns, are removed. The remaining parts, called [[extein]]s instead of exons, are fused together.
Protein splicing has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, [[archaea]], plants, yeast and humans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanada K, Yang JC | title = Novel biochemistry: post-translational protein splicing and other lessons from the school of antigen processing | journal = Journal of Molecular Medicine | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 420–28 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15759099 | doi = 10.1007/s00109-005-0652-6 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1232581 }}</ref>

{{technical|date=December 2016}}

'''RNA splicing''', in [[molecular biology]], is a form of RNA processing in which a newly made [[precursor messenger RNA]] (pre-[[mRNA]]) [[transcription (biology)|transcript]] is transformed into a [[mature messenger RNA]] ([[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]). During splicing, [[intron]]s (Non-coding regions) are removed and [[exon]]s (Coding Regions) are joined together. For [[nuclear genes|nuclear-encoded genes]], splicing takes place within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] either during or immediately after [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]]. For those [[eukaryotic transcription|eukaryotic genes]] that contain introns, splicing is usually required in order to create an mRNA molecule that can be [[translation (biology)|translated into protein]].  For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a complex of small nuclear ribonucleo proteins ([[snRNP]]s). [[Self-splicing intron]]s, or [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own excision from their parent RNA molecule, also exist.

==Splicing pathways==
Several methods of RNA splicing occur in nature; the type of splicing depends on the structure of the spliced intron and the [[catalyst]]s required for splicing to occur.

===Spliceosomal complex===

====Introns====
The word ''intron'' is derived from the terms ''intragenic region'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert W | title = Why genes in pieces? | journal = Nature | volume = 271 | issue = 5645 | pages = 501 | date = February 1978 | pmid = 622185 | doi = 10.1038/271501a0 | bibcode = 1978Natur.271..501G }}</ref> and ''intracistron'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonegawa S, Maxam AM, Tizard R, Bernard O, Gilbert W | title = Sequence of a mouse germ-line gene for a variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 1485–89 | date = March 1978 | pmid = 418414 | pmc = 411497 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.75.3.1485 | bibcode = 1978PNAS...75.1485T }}</ref> that is, a segment of DNA that is located between two exons of a [[gene]]. The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in the unprocessed RNA transcript. As part of the RNA processing pathway, introns are removed by RNA splicing either shortly after or concurrent with [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tilgner H, Knowles DG, Johnson R, Davis CA, Chakrabortty S, Djebali S, Curado J, Snyder M, Gingeras TR, Guigó R | title = Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional in the human genome but inefficient for lncRNAs | journal = Genome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 1616–25 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22955974 | pmc = 3431479 | doi = 10.1101/gr.134445.111 }}</ref> Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses.

Within introns, a donor site (5' end of the intron), a branch site (near the 3' end of the intron) and an acceptor site (3' end of the intron) are required for splicing.  The splice donor site includes an almost invariant sequence GU at the 5' end of the intron, within a larger, less highly conserved region. The splice acceptor site at the 3' end of the intron terminates the intron with an almost invariant AG sequence.  Upstream (5'-ward) from the AG there is a region high in [[pyrimidine]]s (C and U), or [[polypyrimidine tract]].  Further upstream from the polypyrimidine tract is the branchpoint, which includes an adenine nucleotide involved in lariat formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Clancy | first = Suzanne | name-list-format = vanc | title = RNA Splicing: Introns, Exons and Spliceosome | journal = Nature Education | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 31 | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/rna-splicing-introns-exons-and-spliceosome-12375 | access-date = 31 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110315060903/http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/RNA-Splicing-Introns-Exons-and-Spliceosome-12375 | archive-date = 15 March 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=Black>{{cite journal | vauthors = Black DL | title = Mechanisms of alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 291–336 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12626338 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161720 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2hg605wm }}</ref> The consensus sequence for an intron (in IUPAC [[nucleic acid notation]]) is: G-G-[cut]-G-U-R-A-G-U (donor site) ... intron sequence ...

This results in a [[mature messenger RNA]] with a missing section of an exon. In this way, a [[point mutation]], which might otherwise affect only a single amino acid, can manifest as a [[Indel|deletion]] or truncation in the final protein.

====Formation and activity====
Splicing is catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a large RNA-protein complex composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ([[snRNP]]s).  Assembly and activity of the spliceosome occurs during transcription of the pre-mRNA.  The RNA components of snRNPs interact with the intron and are involved in catalysis.  Two types of spliceosomes have been identified (major and minor) which contain different [[snRNP]]s.

*The '''major spliceosome''' splices introns containing GU at the 5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site.  It is composed of the [[U1 spliceosomal RNA|U1]], [[U2 spliceosomal RNA|U2]], [[U4 spliceosomal RNA|U4]], [[U5 spliceosomal RNA|U5]], and [[U6 spliceosomal RNA|U6]] [[snRNP]]s and is active in the nucleus. In addition, a number of proteins including [[U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1]] (U2AF35), [[U2AF2]] (U2AF65)<ref name=graveley2001>{{cite journal | vauthors = Graveley BR, Hertel KJ, Maniatis T | title = The role of U2AF35 and U2AF65 in enhancer-dependent splicing | journal = RNA | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 806–18 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11421359 | pmc = 1370132 | doi = 10.1017/s1355838201010317 | url = http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/7/6/806.abstract | access-date = 2014-12-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181120053109/https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/7/6/806.abstract | archive-date = 2018-11-20 | url-status = live }}</ref> and [[SF1 (gene)|SF1]] are required for the assembly of the spliceosome.<ref name=\"Black\"/><ref name=Matlin>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matlin AJ, Clark F, Smith CW | title = Understanding alternative splicing: towards a cellular code | journal = Nature Reviews.

:This type of splicing is termed ''canonical splicing'' or termed the ''lariat pathway'', which accounts for more than 99% of splicing.

==== Recursive splicing ====
In most cases, splicing removes introns as single units from precursor [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcripts. However, in some cases, especially in mRNAs with very long introns, splicing happens in steps, with part of an intron removed and then the remaining intron is spliced out in a following step. This has been found first in the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' (''Ubx'') gene of the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', and a few other ''Drosophila'' genes, but cases in humans have been reported as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sibley CR, Emmett W, Blazquez L, Faro A, Haberman N, Briese M, Trabzuni D, Ryten M, Weale ME, Hardy J, Modic M, Curk T, Wilson SW, Plagnol V, Ule J | title = Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7552 | pages = 371–75 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25970246 | pmc = 4471124 | doi = 10.1038/nature14466 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..371S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Duff MO, Olson S, Wei X, Garrett SC, Osman A, Bolisetty M, Plocik A, Celniker SE, Graveley BR | title = Genome-wide identification of zero nucleotide recursive splicing in Drosophila | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7552 | pages = 376–79 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25970244 | pmc = 4529404 | doi = 10.1038/nature14475 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..376D }}</ref>

==== Trans-splicing ====
[[Trans-splicing]] is a form of splicing that removes introns or [[outron]]s, and joins two exons that are not within the same RNA transcript.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Segni G, Gastaldi S, Tocchini-Valentini GP | title = Cis- and trans-splicing of mRNAs mediated by tRNA sequences in eukaryotic cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 19 | pages = 6864–69 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18458335 | pmc = 2383978 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800420105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.6864D | jstor = 25461891 }}</ref>

=== Self-splicing ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Intron]] -->
'''Self-splicing''' occurs for rare introns that form a [[ribozyme]], performing the functions of the spliceosome by RNA alone.  There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, ''[[Group I catalytic intron|Group I]]'', ''[[Group II intron|Group II]]'' and ''[[Group III intron|Group III]]''.  Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein.  This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome.  Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an [[RNA world]] present before protein.

Two transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:
# 3'OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site.
# 3'OH of the 5' exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.

The mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:
# The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the ''lariat''
# The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site, thereby joining the exons together.

===tRNA splicing===
[[tRNA]] (also tRNA-like) splicing is another rare form of splicing that usually occurs in tRNA.  The splicing reaction involves a different biochemistry than the spliceosomal and self-splicing pathways.

In the [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', a yeast tRNA splicing [[endonuclease]] heterotetramer, composed of [[TSEN54]], [[TSEN2]], [[TSEN34]], and [[TSEN15]], cleaves pre-tRNA at two sites in the acceptor loop to form a 5'-half tRNA, terminating at a 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester group, and a 3'-half tRNA, terminating at a 5'-hydroxyl group, along with a discarded intron.<ref name=trotta1997>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trotta CR, Miao F, Arn EA, Stevens SW, Ho CK, Rauhut R, Abelson JN | title = The yeast tRNA splicing endonuclease: a tetrameric enzyme with two active site subunits homologous to the archaeal tRNA endonucleases | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 849–58 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9200603 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80270-6 }}</ref>  Yeast tRNA kinase then phosphorylates the 5'-hydroxyl group using [[adenosine triphosphate]].

==Evolution==
Splicing occurs in all the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s or [[domain (biology)|domain]]s of life, however, the extent and types of splicing can be very different between the major divisions.  [[Eukaryote]]s splice many protein-coding [[mRNA|messenger RNA]]s and some [[non-coding RNA]]s. [[Prokaryote]]s, on the other hand, splice rarely and mostly non-coding RNAs. Another important difference between these two groups of organisms is that prokaryotes completely lack the spliceosomal pathway.

Because spliceosomal introns are not conserved in all species, there is debate concerning when spliceosomal splicing evolved.  Two models have been proposed: the intron late and intron early models (see [[Intron#Biological functions and evolution|intron evolution]]).

==Biochemical mechanism==
[[File:RNA splicing reaction.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating the two-step biochemistry of splicing]]
Spliceosomal splicing and self-splicing involve a two-step biochemical process.  Both steps involve [[transesterification]] reactions that occur between RNA nucleotides.  tRNA splicing, however, is an exception and does not occur by transesterification.<ref name=abelson1998>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abelson J, Trotta CR, Li H | title = tRNA splicing | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 21 | pages = 12685–88 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9582290 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.21.12685 }}</ref>

Spliceosomal and self-splicing transesterification reactions occur via two sequential transesterification reactions.  First, the 2'OH of a specific ''branchpoint'' nucleotide within the intron, defined during spliceosome assembly, performs a [[nucleophilic attack]] on the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5' splice site, forming the ''lariat intermediate''.  Second, the 3'OH of the released 5' exon then performs an electrophilic attack at the first nucleotide following the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3' splice site, thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat.<ref name=fica2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fica SM, Tuttle N, Novak T, Li NS, Lu J, Koodathingal P, Dai Q, Staley JP, Piccirilli JA | title = RNA catalyses nuclear pre-mRNA splicing | journal = Nature | volume = 503 | issue = 7475 | pages = 229–34 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24196718 | pmc = 4666680 | doi = 10.1038/nature12734 | bibcode = 2013Natur.503..229F }}</ref>

==Alternative splicing==
{{main|Alternative splicing}}

In many cases, the splicing process can create a range of unique proteins by varying the exon composition of the same mRNA. This phenomenon is then called [[alternative splicing]]. Alternative splicing can occur in many ways. Exons can be extended or skipped, or introns can be retained. It is estimated that 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, some instances of which occur in a tissue-specific manner and/or under specific cellular conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan Q, Shai O, Lee LJ, Frey BJ, Blencowe BJ | title = Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high-throughput sequencing | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 1413–15 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18978789 | doi = 10.1038/ng.259 }}</ref> Development of high throughput mRNA sequencing technology can help quantify the expression levels of alternatively spliced isoforms.

Given this complexity, alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is regulated by a system of trans-acting proteins (activators and repressors) that bind to cis-acting sites or \"elements\" (enhancers and silencers) on the pre-mRNA transcript itself. These proteins and their respective binding elements promote or reduce the usage of a particular splice site. The binding specificity comes from the sequence and structure of the cis-elements, e.g. in HIV-1 there are many donor and acceptor splice sites. Among the various splice sites, ssA7, which is 3' acceptor site, folds into three stem loop structures, i.e. Intronic splicing silencer (ISS), Exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), and Exonic splicing silencer (ESSE3). Solution structure of Intronic splicing silencer and its interaction to host protein hnRNPA1 give insight into specific recognition.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jain N, Morgan CE, Rife BD, Salemi M, Tolbert BS | title = Solution Structure of the HIV-1 Intron Splicing Silencer and Its Interactions with the UP1 Domain of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 291 | issue = 5 | pages = 2331–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26607354 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M115.674564 | pmc = 4732216 }}</ref> However, adding to the complexity of alternative splicing, it is noted that the effects of regulatory factors are many times position-dependent. For example, a splicing factor that serves as a splicing activator when bound to an intronic enhancer element may serve as a repressor when bound to its splicing element in the context of an exon, and vice versa.<ref name=\"Lim\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lim KH, Ferraris L, Filloux ME, Raphael BJ, Fairbrother WG | title = Using positional distribution to identify splicing elements and predict pre-mRNA processing defects in human genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 27 | pages = 11093–98 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21685335 | pmc = 3131313 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1101135108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10811093H }}</ref> In addition to the position-dependent effects of enhancer and silencer elements, the location of the branchpoint (i.e., distance upstream of the nearest 3’ acceptor site) also affects splicing.<ref name=Taggart/> The secondary structure of the pre-mRNA transcript also plays a role in regulating splicing, such as by bringing together splicing elements or by masking a sequence that would otherwise serve as a binding element for a splicing factor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warf MB, Berglund JA | title = Role of RNA structure in regulating pre-mRNA splicing | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–78 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19959365 | pmc = 2834840 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2009.10.004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reid DC, Chang BL, Gunderson SI, Alpert L, Thompson WA, Fairbrother WG | title = Next-generation SELEX identifies sequence and structural determinants of splicing factor binding in human pre-mRNA sequence | journal = RNA | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 2385–97 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19861426 | pmc = 2779669 | doi = 10.1261/rna.1821809 }}</ref>

==Splicing errors and variation==
It has been suggested that one third of all disease-causing mutations impact on [[Split gene theory|splicing]].<ref name=Lim/> Common errors include:
*Mutation of a splice site resulting in loss of function of that site. Results in exposure of a premature [[stop codon]], loss of an exon, or inclusion of an intron.
*Mutation of a splice site reducing specificity. May result in variation in the splice location, causing insertion or deletion of amino acids, or most likely, a disruption of the [[reading frame]].
*Displacement of a splice site, leading to inclusion or exclusion of more RNA than expected, resulting in longer or shorter exons.
Although many splicing errors are safeguarded by a cellular quality control mechanism termed [[nonsense-mediated mRNA decay]] (NMD),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Danckwardt S, Neu-Yilik G, Thermann R, Frede U, Hentze MW, Kulozik AE | title = Abnormally spliced beta-globin mRNAs: a single point mutation generates transcripts sensitive and insensitive to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay | journal = Blood | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 1811–16 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11861299 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V99.5.1811 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9269f793ca028f65cc5e8c1dc595c4c3c838306c }}</ref> a number of splicing-related diseases also exist, as suggested above.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ward AJ, Cooper TA | title = The pathobiology of splicing | journal = The Journal of Pathology | volume = 220 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–63 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19918805 | pmc = 2855871 | doi = 10.1002/path.2649 }}</ref>

Allelic differences in mRNA splicing are likely to be a common and important source of phenotypic diversity at the molecular level, in addition to their contribution to genetic disease susceptibility. Indeed, genome-wide studies in humans have identified a range of genes that are subject to allele-specific splicing.

In plants, variation for flooding stress tolerance correlated with stress-induced alternative splicing of transcripts associated with gluconeogenesis and other processes. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Veen |first1=H |last2=Vashisht |first2=D |last3=Akman |first3=M |last4=Girke |first4=T |last5=Mustroph |first5=A |last6=Reinen |first6=E |last7=Hartman |first7=S |last8=Kooiker |first8=M |last9=van Tienderen |first9=P |last10=Schranz |first10=ME |last11=Bailey-Serres |first11=J |last12=Voesenek |first12=LA |last13=Sasidharan |first13=R |title=Transcriptomes of Eight Arabidopsis thaliana Accessions Reveal Core Conserved, Genotype- and Organ-Specific Responses to Flooding Stress |journal=Plant Physiology |date=October 2016 |volume=172 |issue=2 |pages=668–89 |doi=10.1104/pp.16.00472 |pmid=27208254|pmc=5047075 }}</ref>

==Protein splicing==
{{Main|Protein splicing}}
In addition to RNA, proteins can undergo splicing. Although the biomolecular mechanisms are different, the principle is the same: parts of the protein, called [[intein]]s instead of introns, are removed. The remaining parts, called [[extein]]s instead of exons, are fused together.
Protein splicing has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, [[archaea]], plants, yeast and humans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanada K, Yang JC | title = Novel biochemistry: post-translational protein splicing and other lessons from the school of antigen processing | journal = Journal of Molecular Medicine | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 420–8 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15759099 | doi = 10.1007/s00109-005-0652-6 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1232581 }}</ref>

'''RNA splicing''', in [[molecular biology]], is a form of RNA processing in which a newly made [[precursor messenger RNA]] (pre-[[mRNA]]) [[transcription (biology)|transcript]] is transformed into a [[mature messenger RNA]] ([[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]). During splicing, [[intron]]s (Non-coding regions) are removed and [[exon]]s (Coding Regions) are joined together. For [[nuclear genes|nuclear-encoded genes]], splicing takes place within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] either during or immediately after [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]]. For those [[eukaryotic transcription|eukaryotic genes]] that contain introns, splicing is usually required in order to create an mRNA molecule that can be [[translation (biology)|translated into protein]].  For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a complex of small nuclear ribonucleo proteins ([[snRNP]]s). [[Self-splicing intron]]s, or [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own excision from their parent RNA molecule, also exist.

==Splicing pathways==
Several methods of RNA splicing occur in nature; the type of splicing depends on the structure of the spliced intron and the [[catalyst]]s required for splicing to occur.

===Spliceosomal complex===

====Introns====
The word ''intron'' is derived from the terms ''intragenic region'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert W | title = Why genes in pieces? | journal = Nature | volume = 271 | issue = 5645 | pages = 501 | date = February 1978 | pmid = 622185 | doi = 10.1038/271501a0 | bibcode = 1978Natur.271..501G }}</ref> and ''intracistron'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonegawa S, Maxam AM, Tizard R, Bernard O, Gilbert W | title = Sequence of a mouse germ-line gene for a variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 1485–89 | date = March 1978 | pmid = 418414 | pmc = 411497 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.75.3.1485 | bibcode = 1978PNAS...75.1485T }}</ref> that is, a segment of DNA that is located between two exons of a [[gene]]. The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in the unprocessed RNA transcript. As part of the RNA processing pathway, introns are removed by RNA splicing either shortly after or concurrent with [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tilgner H, Knowles DG, Johnson R, Davis CA, Chakrabortty S, Djebali S, Curado J, Snyder M, Gingeras TR, Guigó R | title = Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional in the human genome but inefficient for lncRNAs | journal = Genome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 1616–25 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22955974 | pmc = 3431479 | doi = 10.1101/gr.134445.111 }}</ref> Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses.

Within introns, a donor site (5' end of the intron), a branch site (near the 3' end of the intron) and an acceptor site (3' end of the intron) are required for splicing.  The splice donor site includes an almost invariant sequence GU at the 5' end of the intron, within a larger, less highly conserved region. The splice acceptor site at the 3' end of the intron terminates the intron with an almost invariant AG sequence.  Upstream (5'-ward) from the AG there is a region high in [[pyrimidine]]s (C and U), or [[polypyrimidine tract]].  Further upstream from the polypyrimidine tract is the branchpoint, which includes an adenine nucleotide involved in lariat formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Clancy | first = Suzanne | name-list-format = vanc | title = RNA Splicing: Introns, Exons and Spliceosome | journal = Nature Education | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 31 | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/rna-splicing-introns-exons-and-spliceosome-12375 | access-date = 31 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110315060903/http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/RNA-Splicing-Introns-Exons-and-Spliceosome-12375 | archive-date = 15 March 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=Black>{{cite journal | vauthors = Black DL | title = Mechanisms of alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 291–336 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12626338 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161720 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2hg605wm }}</ref> The consensus sequence for an intron (in IUPAC [[nucleic acid notation]]) is: G-G-[cut]-G-U-R-A-G-U (donor site) ... intron sequence ...

This results in a [[mature messenger RNA]] with a missing section of an exon. In this way, a [[point mutation]], which might otherwise affect only a single amino acid, can manifest as a [[Indel|deletion]] or truncation in the final protein.

====Formation and activity====
Splicing is catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a large RNA-protein complex composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ([[snRNP]]s).  Assembly and activity of the spliceosome occurs during transcription of the pre-mRNA.  The RNA components of snRNPs interact with the intron and are involved in catalysis.  Two types of spliceosomes have been identified (major and minor) which contain different [[snRNP]]s.

:This type of splicing is termed ''canonical splicing'' or termed the ''lariat pathway'', which accounts for more than 99% of splicing.

==== Recursive splicing ====
In most cases, splicing removes introns as single units from precursor [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcripts. However, in some cases, especially in mRNAs with very long introns, splicing happens in steps, with part of an intron removed and then the remaining intron is spliced out in a following step. This has been found first in the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' (''Ubx'') gene of the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', and a few other ''Drosophila'' genes, but cases in humans have been reported as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sibley CR, Emmett W, Blazquez L, Faro A, Haberman N, Briese M, Trabzuni D, Ryten M, Weale ME, Hardy J, Modic M, Curk T, Wilson SW, Plagnol V, Ule J | title = Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7552 | pages = 371–75 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25970246 | pmc = 4471124 | doi = 10.1038/nature14466 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..371S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Duff MO, Olson S, Wei X, Garrett SC, Osman A, Bolisetty M, Plocik A, Celniker SE, Graveley BR | title = Genome-wide identification of zero nucleotide recursive splicing in Drosophila | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7552 | pages = 376–79 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25970244 | pmc = 4529404 | doi = 10.1038/nature14475 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..376D }}</ref>

==== Trans-splicing ====
[[Trans-splicing]] is a form of splicing that removes introns or [[outron]]s, and joins two exons that are not within the same RNA transcript.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Segni G, Gastaldi S, Tocchini-Valentini GP | title = Cis- and trans-splicing of mRNAs mediated by tRNA sequences in eukaryotic cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 19 | pages = 6864–69 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18458335 | pmc = 2383978 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800420105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.6864D | jstor = 25461891 }}</ref>

=== Self-splicing ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Intron]] -->
'''Self-splicing''' occurs for rare introns that form a [[ribozyme]], performing the functions of the spliceosome by RNA alone.  There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, ''[[Group I catalytic intron|Group I]]'', ''[[Group II intron|Group II]]'' and ''[[Group III intron|Group III]]''.  Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein.  This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome.  Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an [[RNA world]] present before protein.

Two transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:
# 3'OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site.
# 3'OH of the 5' exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.

The mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:
# The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the ''lariat''
# The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site, thereby joining the exons together.

===tRNA splicing===
[[tRNA]] (also tRNA-like) splicing is another rare form of splicing that usually occurs in tRNA.  The splicing reaction involves a different biochemistry than the spliceosomal and self-splicing pathways.

In the [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', a yeast tRNA splicing [[endonuclease]] heterotetramer, composed of [[TSEN54]], [[TSEN2]], [[TSEN34]], and [[TSEN15]], cleaves pre-tRNA at two sites in the acceptor loop to form a 5'-half tRNA, terminating at a 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester group, and a 3'-half tRNA, terminating at a 5'-hydroxyl group, along with a discarded intron.<ref name=trotta1997>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trotta CR, Miao F, Arn EA, Stevens SW, Ho CK, Rauhut R, Abelson JN | title = The yeast tRNA splicing endonuclease: a tetrameric enzyme with two active site subunits homologous to the archaeal tRNA endonucleases | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 849–58 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9200603 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80270-6 }}</ref>  Yeast tRNA kinase then phosphorylates the 5'-hydroxyl group using [[adenosine triphosphate]].

==Evolution==
Splicing occurs in all the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s or [[domain (biology)|domain]]s of life, however, the extent and types of splicing can be very different between the major divisions.  [[Eukaryote]]s splice many protein-coding [[mRNA|messenger RNA]]s and some [[non-coding RNA]]s. [[Prokaryote]]s, on the other hand, splice rarely and mostly non-coding RNAs. Another important difference between these two groups of organisms is that prokaryotes completely lack the spliceosomal pathway.

Because spliceosomal introns are not conserved in all species, there is debate concerning when spliceosomal splicing evolved.  Two models have been proposed: the intron late and intron early models (see [[Intron#Biological functions and evolution|intron evolution]]).

==Biochemical mechanism==
[[File:RNA splicing reaction.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating the two-step biochemistry of splicing]]
Spliceosomal splicing and self-splicing involve a two-step biochemical process.  Both steps involve [[transesterification]] reactions that occur between RNA nucleotides.  tRNA splicing, however, is an exception and does not occur by transesterification.<ref name=abelson1998>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abelson J, Trotta CR, Li H | title = tRNA splicing | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 21 | pages = 12685–88 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9582290 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.21.12685 }}</ref>

Spliceosomal and self-splicing transesterification reactions occur via two sequential transesterification reactions.  First, the 2'OH of a specific ''branchpoint'' nucleotide within the intron, defined during spliceosome assembly, performs a [[nucleophilic attack]] on the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5' splice site, forming the ''lariat intermediate''.  Second, the 3'OH of the released 5' exon then performs an electrophilic attack at the first nucleotide following the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3' splice site, thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat.<ref name=fica2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fica SM, Tuttle N, Novak T, Li NS, Lu J, Koodathingal P, Dai Q, Staley JP, Piccirilli JA | title = RNA catalyses nuclear pre-mRNA splicing | journal = Nature | volume = 503 | issue = 7475 | pages = 229–34 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24196718 | pmc = 4666680 | doi = 10.1038/nature12734 | bibcode = 2013Natur.503..229F }}</ref>

==Alternative splicing==
{{main|Alternative splicing}}

In many cases, the splicing process can create a range of unique proteins by varying the exon composition of the same mRNA. This phenomenon is then called [[alternative splicing]]. Alternative splicing can occur in many ways. Exons can be extended or skipped, or introns can be retained. It is estimated that 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, some instances of which occur in a tissue-specific manner and/or under specific cellular conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan Q, Shai O, Lee LJ, Frey BJ, Blencowe BJ | title = Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high-throughput sequencing | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 1413–15 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18978789 | doi = 10.1038/ng.259 }}</ref> Development of high throughput mRNA sequencing technology can help quantify the expression levels of alternatively spliced isoforms.

Given this complexity, alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is regulated by a system of trans-acting proteins (activators and repressors) that bind to cis-acting sites or \"elements\" (enhancers and silencers) on the pre-mRNA transcript itself. These proteins and their respective binding elements promote or reduce the usage of a particular splice site. The binding specificity comes from the sequence and structure of the cis-elements, e.g. in HIV-1 there are many donor and acceptor splice sites. Among the various splice sites, ssA7, which is 3' acceptor site, folds into three stem loop structures, i.e. Intronic splicing silencer (ISS), Exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), and Exonic splicing silencer (ESSE3). Solution structure of Intronic splicing silencer and its interaction to host protein hnRNPA1 give insight into specific recognition.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jain N, Morgan CE, Rife BD, Salemi M, Tolbert BS | title = Solution Structure of the HIV-1 Intron Splicing Silencer and Its Interactions with the UP1 Domain of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 291 | issue = 5 | pages = 2331–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26607354 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M115.674564 | pmc = 4732216 }}</ref> However, adding to the complexity of alternative splicing, it is noted that the effects of regulatory factors are many times position-dependent. For example, a splicing factor that serves as a splicing activator when bound to an intronic enhancer element may serve as a repressor when bound to its splicing element in the context of an exon, and vice versa.<ref name=\"Lim\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lim KH, Ferraris L, Filloux ME, Raphael BJ, Fairbrother WG | title = Using positional distribution to identify splicing elements and predict pre-mRNA processing defects in human genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 27 | pages = 11093–98 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21685335 | pmc = 3131313 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1101135108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10811093H }}</ref> In addition to the position-dependent effects of enhancer and silencer elements, the location of the branchpoint (i.e., distance upstream of the nearest 3’ acceptor site) also affects splicing.<ref name=Taggart/> The secondary structure of the pre-mRNA transcript also plays a role in regulating splicing, such as by bringing together splicing elements or by masking a sequence that would otherwise serve as a binding element for a splicing factor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warf MB, Berglund JA | title = Role of RNA structure in regulating pre-mRNA splicing | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–78 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19959365 | pmc = 2834840 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2009.10.004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reid DC, Chang BL, Gunderson SI, Alpert L, Thompson WA, Fairbrother WG | title = Next-generation SELEX identifies sequence and structural determinants of splicing factor binding in human pre-mRNA sequence | journal = RNA | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 2385–97 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19861426 | pmc = 2779669 | doi = 10.1261/rna.1821809 }}</ref>

==Splicing errors and variation==
It has been suggested that one third of all disease-causing mutations impact on [[Split gene theory|splicing]].<ref name=Lim/> Common errors include:
*Mutation of a splice site resulting in loss of function of that site. Results in exposure of a premature [[stop codon]], loss of an exon, or inclusion of an intron.
*Mutation of a splice site reducing specificity. May result in variation in the splice location, causing insertion or deletion of amino acids, or most likely, a disruption of the [[reading frame]].
*Displacement of a splice site, leading to inclusion or exclusion of more RNA than expected, resulting in longer or shorter exons.
Although many splicing errors are safeguarded by a cellular quality control mechanism termed [[nonsense-mediated mRNA decay]] (NMD),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Danckwardt S, Neu-Yilik G, Thermann R, Frede U, Hentze MW, Kulozik AE | title = Abnormally spliced beta-globin mRNAs: a single point mutation generates transcripts sensitive and insensitive to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay | journal = Blood | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 1811–6 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11861299 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V99.5.1811 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9269f793ca028f65cc5e8c1dc595c4c3c838306c }}</ref> a number of splicing-related diseases also exist, as suggested above.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ward AJ, Cooper TA | title = The pathobiology of splicing | journal = The Journal of Pathology | volume = 220 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–63 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19918805 | pmc = 2855871 | doi = 10.1002/path.2649 }}</ref>

Allelic differences in mRNA splicing are likely to be a common and important source of phenotypic diversity at the molecular level, in addition to their contribution to genetic disease susceptibility. Indeed, genome-wide studies in humans have identified a range of genes that are subject to allele-specific splicing.

In plants, variation for flooding stress tolerance correlated with stress-induced alternative splicing of transcripts associated with gluconeogenesis and other processes. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Veen |first1=H |last2=Vashisht |first2=D |last3=Akman |first3=M |last4=Girke |first4=T |last5=Mustroph |first5=A |last6=Reinen |first6=E |last7=Hartman |first7=S |last8=Kooiker |first8=M |last9=van Tienderen |first9=P |last10=Schranz |first10=ME |last11=Bailey-Serres |first11=J |last12=Voesenek |first12=LA |last13=Sasidharan |first13=R |title=Transcriptomes of Eight Arabidopsis thaliana Accessions Reveal Core Conserved, Genotype- and Organ-Specific Responses to Flooding Stress |journal=Plant Physiology |date=October 2016 |volume=172 |issue=2 |pages=668–689 |doi=10.1104/pp.16.00472 |pmid=27208254|pmc=5047075 }}</ref>

==Protein splicing==
{{Main|Protein splicing}}
In addition to RNA, proteins can undergo splicing. Although the biomolecular mechanisms are different, the principle is the same: parts of the protein, called [[intein]]s instead of introns, are removed. The remaining parts, called [[extein]]s instead of exons, are fused together.
Protein splicing has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, [[archaea]], plants, yeast and humans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanada K, Yang JC | title = Novel biochemistry: post-translational protein splicing and other lessons from the school of antigen processing | journal = Journal of Molecular Medicine | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 420–8 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15759099 | doi = 10.1007/s00109-005-0652-6 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1232581 }}</ref>

{{technical|date=December 2016}}

'''RNA splicing''', in [[molecular biology]], is a form of RNA processing in which a newly made [[precursor messenger RNA]] (pre-[[mRNA]]) [[transcription (biology)|transcript]] is transformed into a [[mature messenger RNA]] ([[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]). During splicing, [[intron]]s (Non-coding regions) are removed and [[exon]]s (Coding Regions) are joined together. For [[nuclear genes|nuclear-encoded genes]], splicing takes place within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] either during or immediately after [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]]. For those [[eukaryotic transcription|eukaryotic genes]] that contain introns, splicing is usually required in order to create an mRNA molecule that can be [[translation (biology)|translated into protein]].  For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a complex of small nuclear ribonucleo proteins ([[snRNP]]s). [[Self-splicing intron]]s, or [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own excision from their parent RNA molecule, also exist.

==Splicing pathways==
Several methods of RNA splicing occur in nature; the type of splicing depends on the structure of the spliced intron and the [[catalyst]]s required for splicing to occur.

===Spliceosomal complex===

====Introns====
The word ''intron'' is derived from the terms ''intragenic region'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert W | title = Why genes in pieces? | journal = Nature | volume = 271 | issue = 5645 | pages = 501 | date = February 1978 | pmid = 622185 | doi = 10.1038/271501a0 | bibcode = 1978Natur.271..501G }}</ref> and ''intracistron'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonegawa S, Maxam AM, Tizard R, Bernard O, Gilbert W | title = Sequence of a mouse germ-line gene for a variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 1485–89 | date = March 1978 | pmid = 418414 | pmc = 411497 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.75.3.1485 | bibcode = 1978PNAS...75.1485T }}</ref> that is, a segment of DNA that is located between two exons of a [[gene]]. The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in the unprocessed RNA transcript. As part of the RNA processing pathway, introns are removed by RNA splicing either shortly after or concurrent with [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tilgner H, Knowles DG, Johnson R, Davis CA, Chakrabortty S, Djebali S, Curado J, Snyder M, Gingeras TR, Guigó R | title = Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional in the human genome but inefficient for lncRNAs | journal = Genome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 1616–25 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22955974 | pmc = 3431479 | doi = 10.1101/gr.134445.111 }}</ref> Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses.

Within introns, a donor site (5' end of the intron), a branch site (near the 3' end of the intron) and an acceptor site (3' end of the intron) are required for splicing.  The splice donor site includes an almost invariant sequence GU at the 5' end of the intron, within a larger, less highly conserved region. The splice acceptor site at the 3' end of the intron terminates the intron with an almost invariant AG sequence.  Upstream (5'-ward) from the AG there is a region high in [[pyrimidine]]s (C and U), or [[polypyrimidine tract]].  Further upstream from the polypyrimidine tract is the branchpoint, which includes an adenine nucleotide involved in lariat formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Clancy | first = Suzanne | name-list-format = vanc | title = RNA Splicing: Introns, Exons and Spliceosome | journal = Nature Education | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 31 | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/rna-splicing-introns-exons-and-spliceosome-12375 | access-date = 31 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110315060903/http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/RNA-Splicing-Introns-Exons-and-Spliceosome-12375 | archive-date = 15 March 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=Black>{{cite journal | vauthors = Black DL | title = Mechanisms of alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 291–336 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12626338 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161720 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2hg605wm }}</ref> The consensus sequence for an intron (in IUPAC [[nucleic acid notation]]) is: G-G-[cut]-G-U-R-A-G-U (donor site) ... intron sequence ...

This results in a [[mature messenger RNA]] with a missing section of an exon. In this way, a [[point mutation]], which might otherwise affect only a single amino acid, can manifest as a [[Indel|deletion]] or truncation in the final protein.

====Formation and activity====
Splicing is catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a large RNA-protein complex composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ([[snRNP]]s).  Assembly and activity of the spliceosome occurs during transcription of the pre-mRNA.  The RNA components of snRNPs interact with the intron and are involved in catalysis.  Two types of spliceosomes have been identified (major and minor) which contain different [[snRNP]]s.

*The '''major spliceosome''' splices introns containing GU at the 5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site.  It is composed of the [[U1 spliceosomal RNA|U1]], [[U2 spliceosomal RNA|U2]], [[U4 spliceosomal RNA|U4]], [[U5 spliceosomal RNA|U5]], and [[U6 spliceosomal RNA|U6]] [[snRNP]]s and is active in the nucleus. In addition, a number of proteins including [[U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1]] (U2AF35), [[U2AF2]] (U2AF65)<ref name=graveley2001>{{cite journal | vauthors = Graveley BR, Hertel KJ, Maniatis T | title = The role of U2AF35 and U2AF65 in enhancer-dependent splicing | journal = RNA | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 806–18 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11421359 | pmc = 1370132 | doi = 10.1017/s1355838201010317 | url = http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/7/6/806.abstract | access-date = 2014-12-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181120053109/https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/7/6/806.abstract | archive-date = 2018-11-20 | url-status = live }}</ref> and [[SF1 (gene)|SF1]] are required for the assembly of the spliceosome.<ref name=\"Black\"/><ref name=Matlin>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matlin AJ, Clark F, Smith CW | title = Understanding alternative splicing: towards a cellular code | journal = Nature Reviews.

:This type of splicing is termed ''canonical splicing'' or termed the ''lariat pathway'', which accounts for more than 99% of splicing.

*The '''[[minor spliceosome]]''' is very similar to the major spliceosome, but instead it splices out rare introns with different splice site sequences. While the minor and major spliceosomes contain the same U5 [[snRNP]], the minor spliceosome has different but functionally analogous snRNPs for U1, U2, U4, and U6, which are respectively called [[U11 spliceosomal RNA|U11]], [[U12 minor spliceosomal RNA|U12]], [[U4atac minor spliceosomal RNA|U4atac]], and [[U6atac minor spliceosomal RNA|U6atac]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel AA, Steitz JA | title = Splicing double: insights from the second spliceosome | journal = Nature Reviews.

==== Recursive splicing ====
In most cases, splicing removes introns as single units from precursor [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcripts. However, in some cases, especially in mRNAs with very long introns, splicing happens in steps, with part of an intron removed and then the remaining intron is spliced out in a following step. This has been found first in the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' (''Ubx'') gene of the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', and a few other ''Drosophila'' genes, but cases in humans have been reported as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sibley CR, Emmett W, Blazquez L, Faro A, Haberman N, Briese M, Trabzuni D, Ryten M, Weale ME, Hardy J, Modic M, Curk T, Wilson SW, Plagnol V, Ule J | title = Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7552 | pages = 371–75 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25970246 | pmc = 4471124 | doi = 10.1038/nature14466 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..371S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Duff MO, Olson S, Wei X, Garrett SC, Osman A, Bolisetty M, Plocik A, Celniker SE, Graveley BR | title = Genome-wide identification of zero nucleotide recursive splicing in Drosophila | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7552 | pages = 376–79 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25970244 | pmc = 4529404 | doi = 10.1038/nature14475 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..376D }}</ref>

==== Trans-splicing ====
[[Trans-splicing]] is a form of splicing that removes introns or [[outron]]s, and joins two exons that are not within the same RNA transcript.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Segni G, Gastaldi S, Tocchini-Valentini GP | title = Cis- and trans-splicing of mRNAs mediated by tRNA sequences in eukaryotic cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 19 | pages = 6864–69 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18458335 | pmc = 2383978 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800420105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.6864D | jstor = 25461891 }}</ref>

=== Self-splicing ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Intron]] -->
'''Self-splicing''' occurs for rare introns that form a [[ribozyme]], performing the functions of the spliceosome by RNA alone.  There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, ''[[Group I catalytic intron|Group I]]'', ''[[Group II intron|Group II]]'' and ''[[Group III intron|Group III]]''.  Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein.  This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome.  Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an [[RNA world]] present before protein.

Two transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:
# 3'OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site.
# 3'OH of the 5' exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.

The mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:
# The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the ''lariat''
# The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site, thereby joining the exons together.

===tRNA splicing===
[[tRNA]] (also tRNA-like) splicing is another rare form of splicing that usually occurs in tRNA.  The splicing reaction involves a different biochemistry than the spliceosomal and self-splicing pathways.

In the [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', a yeast tRNA splicing [[endonuclease]] heterotetramer, composed of [[TSEN54]], [[TSEN2]], [[TSEN34]], and [[TSEN15]], cleaves pre-tRNA at two sites in the acceptor loop to form a 5'-half tRNA, terminating at a 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester group, and a 3'-half tRNA, terminating at a 5'-hydroxyl group, along with a discarded intron.<ref name=trotta1997>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trotta CR, Miao F, Arn EA, Stevens SW, Ho CK, Rauhut R, Abelson JN | title = The yeast tRNA splicing endonuclease: a tetrameric enzyme with two active site subunits homologous to the archaeal tRNA endonucleases | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 849–58 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9200603 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80270-6 }}</ref>  Yeast tRNA kinase then phosphorylates the 5'-hydroxyl group using [[adenosine triphosphate]].

==Evolution==
Splicing occurs in all the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s or [[domain (biology)|domain]]s of life, however, the extent and types of splicing can be very different between the major divisions.  [[Eukaryote]]s splice many protein-coding [[mRNA|messenger RNA]]s and some [[non-coding RNA]]s. [[Prokaryote]]s, on the other hand, splice rarely and mostly non-coding RNAs. Another important difference between these two groups of organisms is that prokaryotes completely lack the spliceosomal pathway.

Because spliceosomal introns are not conserved in all species, there is debate concerning when spliceosomal splicing evolved.  Two models have been proposed: the intron late and intron early models (see [[Intron#Biological functions and evolution|intron evolution]]).

==Biochemical mechanism==
[[File:RNA splicing reaction.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating the two-step biochemistry of splicing]]
Spliceosomal splicing and self-splicing involve a two-step biochemical process.  Both steps involve [[transesterification]] reactions that occur between RNA nucleotides.  tRNA splicing, however, is an exception and does not occur by transesterification.<ref name=abelson1998>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abelson J, Trotta CR, Li H | title = tRNA splicing | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 21 | pages = 12685–88 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9582290 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.21.12685 }}</ref>

Spliceosomal and self-splicing transesterification reactions occur via two sequential transesterification reactions.  First, the 2'OH of a specific ''branchpoint'' nucleotide within the intron, defined during spliceosome assembly, performs a [[nucleophilic attack]] on the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5' splice site, forming the ''lariat intermediate''.  Second, the 3'OH of the released 5' exon then performs an electrophilic attack at the first nucleotide following the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3' splice site, thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat.<ref name=fica2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fica SM, Tuttle N, Novak T, Li NS, Lu J, Koodathingal P, Dai Q, Staley JP, Piccirilli JA | title = RNA catalyses nuclear pre-mRNA splicing | journal = Nature | volume = 503 | issue = 7475 | pages = 229–34 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24196718 | pmc = 4666680 | doi = 10.1038/nature12734 | bibcode = 2013Natur.503..229F }}</ref>

==Alternative splicing==
{{main|Alternative splicing}}

In many cases, the splicing process can create a range of unique proteins by varying the exon composition of the same mRNA. This phenomenon is then called [[alternative splicing]]. Alternative splicing can occur in many ways. Exons can be extended or skipped, or introns can be retained. It is estimated that 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, some instances of which occur in a tissue-specific manner and/or under specific cellular conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan Q, Shai O, Lee LJ, Frey BJ, Blencowe BJ | title = Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high-throughput sequencing | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 1413–5 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18978789 | doi = 10.1038/ng.259 }}</ref> Development of high throughput mRNA sequencing technology can help quantify the expression levels of alternatively spliced isoforms.

Given this complexity, alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is regulated by a system of trans-acting proteins (activators and repressors) that bind to cis-acting sites or \"elements\" (enhancers and silencers) on the pre-mRNA transcript itself. These proteins and their respective binding elements promote or reduce the usage of a particular splice site. The binding specificity comes from the sequence and structure of the cis-elements, e.g. in HIV-1 there are many donor and acceptor splice sites. Among the various splice sites, ssA7, which is 3' acceptor site, folds into three stem loop structures, i.e. Intronic splicing silencer (ISS), Exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), and Exonic splicing silencer (ESSE3).

==Splicing errors and variation==
It has been suggested that one third of all disease-causing mutations impact on [[Split gene theory|splicing]].<ref name=Lim/> Common errors include:
*Mutation of a splice site resulting in loss of function of that site. Results in exposure of a premature [[stop codon]], loss of an exon, or inclusion of an intron.
*Mutation of a splice site reducing specificity. May result in variation in the splice location, causing insertion or deletion of amino acids, or most likely, a disruption of the [[reading frame]].
*Displacement of a splice site, leading to inclusion or exclusion of more RNA than expected, resulting in longer or shorter exons.
Although many splicing errors are safeguarded by a cellular quality control mechanism termed [[nonsense-mediated mRNA decay]] (NMD),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Danckwardt S, Neu-Yilik G, Thermann R, Frede U, Hentze MW, Kulozik AE | title = Abnormally spliced beta-globin mRNAs: a single point mutation generates transcripts sensitive and insensitive to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay | journal = Blood | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 1811–6 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11861299 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V99.5.1811 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9269f793ca028f65cc5e8c1dc595c4c3c838306c }}</ref> a number of splicing-related diseases also exist, as suggested above.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ward AJ, Cooper TA | title = The pathobiology of splicing | journal = The Journal of Pathology | volume = 220 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–63 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19918805 | pmc = 2855871 | doi = 10.1002/path.2649 }}</ref>

Allelic differences in mRNA splicing are likely to be a common and important source of phenotypic diversity at the molecular level, in addition to their contribution to genetic disease susceptibility. Indeed, genome-wide studies in humans have identified a range of genes that are subject to allele-specific splicing.

In plants, variation for flooding stress tolerance correlated with stress-induced alternative splicing of transcripts associated with gluconeogenesis and other processes. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Veen |first1=H |last2=Vashisht |first2=D |last3=Akman |first3=M |last4=Girke |first4=T |last5=Mustroph |first5=A |last6=Reinen |first6=E |last7=Hartman |first7=S |last8=Kooiker |first8=M |last9=van Tienderen |first9=P |last10=Schranz |first10=ME |last11=Bailey-Serres |first11=J |last12=Voesenek |first12=LA |last13=Sasidharan |first13=R |title=Transcriptomes of Eight Arabidopsis thaliana Accessions Reveal Core Conserved, Genotype- and Organ-Specific Responses to Flooding Stress |journal=Plant Physiology |date=October 2016 |volume=172 |issue=2 |pages=668–689 |doi=10.1104/pp.16.00472 |pmid=27208254|pmc=5047075 }}</ref>

==Protein splicing==
{{Main|Protein splicing}}
In addition to RNA, proteins can undergo splicing. Although the biomolecular mechanisms are different, the principle is the same: parts of the protein, called [[intein]]s instead of introns, are removed. The remaining parts, called [[extein]]s instead of exons, are fused together.
Protein splicing has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, [[archaea]], plants, yeast and humans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanada K, Yang JC | title = Novel biochemistry: post-translational protein splicing and other lessons from the school of antigen processing | journal = Journal of Molecular Medicine | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 420–8 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15759099 | doi = 10.1007/s00109-005-0652-6 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1232581 }}</ref>

A [[pseudoscientific]] belief exists in Japan and South Korea, that a person's [[ABO blood group system|ABO '''blood type''']] is predictive of a person's '''[[personality]]''', temperament, and compatibility with others.<ref name=AP>{{cite web|last=Yamaguchi|first=Mari|title=Myth about Japan blood types under attack|url=http://aol.mediresource.com/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=6661&news_channel_id=11&channel_id=11|publisher=MediResource Inc.|accessdate=29 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228182320/http://aol.mediresource.com/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=6661&news_channel_id=11&channel_id=11|archivedate=28 December 2009|date=6 May 2005}}</ref> This superstition is similar to how [[astrological sign]]s are perceived as influencing factors in a person's life in other countries.

One of the reasons [[Japan]] developed the blood type personality indicator theory was in reaction against ethnic stereotypes coming from Europe.<ref>Takeji Furukawa (1927), 血液型と気質 Blood Type and Temperament - in Europe, type A is more common than type B, while in Asia type B is more prevalent, so Europeans insisted A races are superior to B races. A Japanese scholar, Takeji Furukawa opposed that idea and asserted that B persons were active while A persons were passive.</ref> The popular belief originates with publications by [[Masahiko Nomi]] in the 1970s.

The scientific community generally dismisses blood type personality theories as a [[superstition]] or [[pseudoscience]] because of lack of evidence or testable criteria.<ref name=\"AP\" /><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8646236.stm Dating by blood type in Japan]</ref><ref name=\"Nuwer\">{{cite web|last=Nuwer|first=Rachel|title=You are what you bleed: In Japan and other east Asian countries some believe blood type dictates personality|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=you-are-what-you-bleed-in-japan-and-2011-02-15&WT.mc_id=SA_DD_20110215|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=16 Feb 2011}}</ref> Although research into the causal link between blood type and personality is limited, research does not demonstrate any statistically significant association between the two.<ref name=\"cramer\">Cramer, K.

==History==
The idea that personality traits were inherited through the blood dates as far back as Aristotle.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |author=Jon Geir Høyersten |title=From Homer to Pinel: The concept of personality from antiquity until 1800 AD |journal=[[Nordic Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=51 |issue=5 |year=1997 |pages=385–394 |doi=10.3109/08039489709090734}}, cited in {{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Mary|last2=Glendon|first2=A.

In 1926, Rin Hirano and Tomita Yashima published the article \"Blood Type Biological Related\" in the ''Army Medical Journal''. It was seen to be a non-statistical and unscientific report [[Scientific racism|motivated by racism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Takeji Furukawa===
In 1927, Takeji Furukawa, a professor at Tokyo Women's Teacher's School, published his paper \"The Study of Temperament Through Blood Type\" in the scholarly journal ''Psychological Research''. The idea quickly took off with the Japanese public despite Furukawa's lack of credentials, and the militarist government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding ideal soldiers.<ref name=\"AP\" /> The study used ten to twenty people for the investigation, thereby failing to meet the statistical requirements for generalizing the results to the wider population.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

On the other hand, in 1934, Fisher announced the [[chi-squared test]], which is very popular at present, for the first time. Several scholars said that they found statistically significant differences analyzing Japanese work conducted at that time.<ref>e.g. Masao Omura (Nihon University) in \"血液型と性格 Blood Type and Personality\", Terumitsu Maekawa (Asia University) in \"血液型人間学 Blood Type Humanics\" and so on.</ref>

In another study, Furukawa compared the distribution of blood types among two ethnic groups: the [[Taiwanese aborigines|Formosan]]s in Taiwan and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Hokkaidō]]. His motivation for the study appears to have come from a political incident:<ref name=\"Nakatani\" /> After the Japanese occupation of Taiwan following [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan's invasion of China in 1895]], the inhabitants tenaciously resisted their occupiers. Insurgencies in 1930 and in 1931 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese settlers.<ref name=\"Nakatani\" />

The purpose of Furukawa's studies was to \"penetrate the essence of the racial traits of the Taiwanese, who recently revolted and behaved so cruelly.\" Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% had type O. In conclusion, Furukawa suggested that the Japanese should increase intermarriage with the Taiwanese to reduce the number of Taiwanese with type O blood.<ref name = Nakatani>{{cite book | title = Criminals and their Scientists: The History of Criminology in International Perspective (Publications of the German Historical Institute) | first = Peter (Ed.) | last = Becker | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-81012-8 | year = 2006 |author2=Yoji Nakatani | chapter = The Birth of Criminology in Modern Japan | page = 294}}</ref>

===Masahiko Nomi===
{{Main|Masahiko Nomi}}
Interest in the theory faded in the 1930s. It was revived in the 1970s with a book by [[Masahiko Nomi]], a journalist with no medical background (he graduated from the engineering department of University of Tokyo). Few Japanese psychologists criticized him at that time,<ref>Toshinori Shirasa & Takuji Iguchi (1993), 血液型性格研究入門 血液型と性格は関係ないと言えるのか An introduction to Blood Type Personality Research - Can we say there is no relationship with blood type and personality?, pp.209-212 & 242-243. -- virtually no papers nor books about blood type and personality was published from the Japanese psychological community ''before'' Masahiko Nomi's death in 1981.</ref> so he continued to demonstrate statistically significant data in various fields and published several books with these results.<ref>[[Masahiko Nomi]] analyzed various data by using statistical methods and found meaningful traits; the following are some of his works.

* Blood Type Politics Study 6/1978 - 2,000 politicians analyzed (all representatives of the national Diet, all governors, and all mayors)</ref> Quite some time after his death in 1981, Masahiko Nomi's work was said to be largely uncontrolled and anecdotal, and the methodology of his conclusions was unclear.<ref name=\"Adamo\">{{cite book | title = The Eat Right for Your Type: Complete Blood Type Encyclopedia | first = Peter J. | last = D'Adamo | publisher = Riverhead Trade | isbn = 978-1-57322-920-3 | year = 2002 | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781573229203/page/28 28] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781573229203 }}</ref> Because of this, he was heavily criticized by the Japanese psychological community, although his books remain popular.<ref name=\"Adamo\"/> His son, Toshitaka Nomi, continued to promote the theory with a series of books and by running the Institute of Blood Type Humanics.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Evans | first = Ruth | title = Japan and blood types: Does it determine personality? | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20170787 | publisher = BBC News | date = 4 November 2012 | accessdate = 5 November 2012 }}</ref> He later established the [http://www.human-abo.org/ Human Science ABO Center] for further research and publication in 2004.

==Background and criticism==

===Criticism===
Kengo Nawata, a Japanese social psychologist, statistically analyzed three data sets of over 10,000 Japanese and American people in total.<ref name=\"nawata\" /> However, 65 of the 68 items yielded non-significant differences between blood types and the other three items showed relatively slight relationships. Therefore, the blood type explained only 0.3% of the whole differences of these data sets. This result suggests that blood type explained very little of people's personalities. Nawata came to the conclusion that there is actually no relevance of blood type for personality.

===Controversial statistically significant data===
However, some academic researchers have shown several statistically significant data in Japan and Korea. Akira Sakamoto and Kenji Yamazaki, Japanese social psychologists, analyzed 32,347 samples of annual opinion polls from 1978 through 1988.<ref name=\"sakamoto2004\" /><ref name=\"sakamoto1992\" /> These results indicated that Japanese blood-typical stereotypes actually influenced their self-reported personalities—as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Cosy Muto and Masahiro Nagashima et al. (Nagasaki University) conducted a supplementary survey of Yamazaki and Sakamoto in 2011.<ref name=\"nagashima\" /> They demonstrated that significant and the same difference on personalities between blood-types by using the same database as Samamoto and Yamazaki used. In the 1990s, difference due to blood types was stabilized and variances became smaller. Then in the 2000s, difference was definitely statistically significant, too. However, the [[effect size|effect magnitude]] was extremely small, despite 'significance' in the statistical sense.

Another Japanese social psychologist, Shigeyuki Yamaoka (Shotoku University), announced results of his questionnaires, which were conducted in 1999 (1,300 subjects)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (1999), 血液型ステレオタイプが生み出す血液型差別の研究 A Study on Blood Harassment Caused by Blood-typical Stereotypes, Paper presented at the 40th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology.

Tokyo.</ref> In both cases, the subjects were university students, and only subjects with enough knowledge of and belief in the \"blood-type diagnosis\" showed meaningful differences. He concluded that these differences must be the [[influence of mass media]], especially TV programs. Yamaoka later examined 6,660 samples from 1999 through 2009 in total and found the same result.<ref name=\"yamaoka2009\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (2009), [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/els/110007674296.pdf?id=ART0009487281&type=pdf&lang=jp&host=cinii&order_no=&ppv_type=0&lang_sw=&no=1444739076&cp= 血液型性格判断の差別性と虚妄性(自主企画(2)) Segregation and falsehood of blood-type personality analysis]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, self planning session (2) at the 18th annual convention of the Japanese society of personality psychology.</ref>

On the other hand, there are opinions that the statistically meaningful differences according to the blood types are not explained only by beliefs, nor are they a self-fulfilling prophecy. In Japan, penetration rate of blood-typical personality traits were investigated. Yoriko Watanabe, a Japanese psychologist (then Hokkaido University), chose \"well-known\" traits and found most traits were known to no more than half of Japanese (subjects were university students).<ref name=\"watanabey\">Watanabe, Y. (1994). [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002785240 血液型ステレオタイプ形成におけるプロトタイプとイグゼンブラの役割 The roles of prototype and exemplar in the formation of the \"blood type stereotype\"]. Japanese Journal of Social Psychology, 10-2, 77-86. - She extracted 7 traits for each 4 blood types, 28 in total, which were common to three or more \"blood type diagnosis\" books. 20 items of all 28 showed less than 50% penetration (the average is 46.1%).</ref> A Japanese writer, Masayuki Kanazawa, analyzed these blood-typical traits in combination with data from Yamaoka (1999)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\" /> that used the same items of Watanabe's penetration survey.<ref name =\"watanabey\" /> If blood-typical differences are caused by penetration (or their self-recognition), the rate of difference of a trait is proportional to the rate of its penetration. However, Kanazawa was not able to discover any association with blood-type differences and penetration rates.<ref>Masayuki Kanazawa (2014), 統計でわかる血液型人間学入門 An Introduction to Blood Type Humanics - Understanding by Statistics, Gentosha Runaissance {{ISBN|4779011094}}/9784779011092 pp.16-36</ref> This result raises doubt about the role of beliefs and self-fulfilling prophecy.

Most reports that demonstrated statistical correlation attribute differences to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. However, there is no study that directly proved the existence of \"self fulfillment\". Therefore, opinions of researchers are varied at present:
# Whether there is statistical correlation or not;
# Whether any statistical correlations are superficial, being caused by subjects' self-fulfilling prophecy, or if they are truly caused by the blood type.

=== Blood Type Personality and Five Factor Model ===
The [[Five factor model|Five Factor Model]] tests were carried out in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, after the year 2000. These tests were intended to digitize self-ratings of the [[Big Five personality traits|\"big five\" personality traits]]. It was expected that differences in self-reported personalities (a self-fulfilling prophecy) would be detected from the subject who believed blood-typical stereotypes. As a result, researchers found no meaningful statistical difference.<ref name=\"cramer\" /><ref name=\"rogers\" /><ref name=\"wu\" /><ref name=\"sohyuncho\">So Hyun Cho, Eun Kook M. Suh, Yoen Jung Ro (2005), [http://kiss.kstudy.com/journal/thesis_name.asp?tname=kiss2002&key=2498184 ''Beliefs about Blood Types and Traits and Their Reflections in Self-reported Personality''], Korean Journal of Social and Personality Psychology, 19(4), 37-47.</ref><ref>Yoshio Kubo, Yukiko Miyake (2011), [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110008427667 血液型と性格の関連についての調査的研究 Correlation between blood types and personalities] Bulletin of Kibi International University (Department of Social Welfare), 21, 93－100.</ref>

So Ho Cho, a Korean psychologist (Yonsei University), and the others carried out a questionnaire about blood-typical items to subjects and discovered statistical differences as expected.<ref name=\"sohyuncho\" /> However, the difference was not found when the Five Factor Model for big five personality traits was administered to the same subjects. Another Korean researcher Sohn (Yonsei University) re-analyzed Cho's data.<ref name=\"sohn\">Sung Il Ryu, Young Woo Sohn (2007), ''A Review of Sociocultural, Behavioral, Biochemical Analyses on ABO Blood-Groups Typology'', The Korean Journal of Social and Personality Psychology</ref> He found that several independent items of the big five personality test detected differences according to each blood-typical stereotype. However, these differences became extinct in the process of plural items being gathered to five factors (big five).

If these results are correct, the Five Factor Model test cannot detect differences between the blood types, if such a causal link did indeed exist.<ref name=\"sakamoto2004\" /><ref name=\"sakamoto1992\" /><ref name=\"yamaoka1999\" /><ref name=\"yamaoka2006\" /><ref name=\"yamaoka2009\" /><ref>Masayuki Kanazawa (2018), Blood Type and Personality 3.0 - Reality Proved by 300,000 People and AI, CreateSpace {{ISBN|1986623815}}/9781986623810 pp.119-122.

===Brain waves and light topography===
Kim and Yi (Seoul University of Venture & Information) measured brain waves of 4,636 adults. They reported that type O people were most stress-resistant.<ref>Choong-Shik Kim, Seon-Gyu Yi (2011), [http://kiss.kstudy.com/journal/thesis_name.asp?tname=kisskw&key=50117192 ''A Study on the effects of one's blood type on emotional character and antistress of adults''], Journal of the Korea Academia-Industrial cooperation Society, 12(6), 2554-2560. - According to this article \"meaningful difference had been revealed between the blood type and stress resistancy; type O rated higher scores in awareness and stress resistancy then other types...\"</ref> In addition, an experiment using light topography instruments by Munetaka Haida (Tokai University School of Medicine) suggests the possibility that activated parts of human brain are different according to blood types. i.e. type A's left brain is superior to the right, while type B's right brain is superior.<ref>Human Science ABO Center held the symposium \"血液型を考える～ヒトＡＢＯ式血液型遺伝子を理解する為に～ Think about Blood Type -- Toward Understanding Human ABO Genes\" in February, 2010 (Tokyo). -- the report (Japanese) including Haida's presentation is [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=aHVtYW4tYWJvLm9yZ3xhYm93b3JsZHxneDozMGNiY2NlYzkzY2Y3NDU4 here].</ref>

==Popularity==
In Japan, discussion of blood types is widely popular in women's magazines as a way of gauging relationship compatibility with a potential or current partner. Morning television shows feature blood type [[horoscope]]s, and similar horoscopes are published daily in newspapers. The blood types of celebrities are listed in their [[help:infobox|infobox]]es on Japanese Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/99865|title=Type Cast: The Japanese Fascination with Blood Types|accessdate=21 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619031050/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/99865|archive-date=2012-06-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> A series of four books that describe people's character by blood type ranked third, fourth, fifth and ninth on a list of best-selling books in Japan in 2008 compiled by Tohan Corporation.<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/12/31/news/blood-types-do-they-shape-a-personality-or-mere-stereotypes/ Blood Types -- Do They Shape a Personality or Mere Stereotypes], Natsuko Fukue, ''The Japan Times'', December 31, 2008</ref>

No less than two-thirds of people in several East Asian countries and areas, such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan, believe in the association between blood types and personality.{{#tag:ref|Many people of the East Asia believe the association with blood types and personality; Japan: 75% (NHK - Japan Broadcasting Corporation - opinion polls, 1986), Korea: 75% (Wow Korea, July 21, 2014), Taiwan: 66% (Wu et. al<ref name=\"wu\" />)|}}

In addition, according to one Japanese survey, more than half of Japanese people are fond of talking about blood type and personality.<ref name=\"yamashita\">Reiko Yamashita (2008), [http://db1.wdc-jp.com/cgi-bin/jssp/wbpnew/master/detail00.php?submission_id=2008-E-0208 血液型性格判断はなぜすたれないのか why doesn't blood type in Japanense culture detariorate?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120840/http://db1.wdc-jp.com/cgi-bin/jssp/wbpnew/master/detail00.php?submission_id=2008-E-0208 |date=August 26, 2014 }}, Paper presented at the 48th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology.</ref> The research also says that people in Japan like blood-typical personality diagnosis and 1. talk about it with proper knowledge, 2. believe some relationships exist between blood type and personality, 3. feel its traits are applicable to themselves to a certain degree. Results of two other surveys are the same.<ref name=\"yahoor\">The following are results of two Japanese surveys:
* Yahoo! Research (December 25, 2008)『「血液型本」に関する調査』 A survey about \"blood type books\" -- \"My personality is  appropriately expressed so that sympathized, convinced\" (66%), \"Can grasp my personality objectively with new discovery\" (59%), \"One of the means and the methods to express my personality\" (50%), \"Useful in acquaintances\" (48%) and \"Useful in love-affiliated things\" (47%).
* Yumiko Kamise, Yutaka Matsui (1996), 血液型ステレオタイプ変容の形 ―ステレオタイプ変容モデルの検証― Changing processes of stereotype on blood-groups, Japanese Journal of Social Psychology, 11-3, 170-179. -- \"blood-typical personality diagnosis is a fun\" (83.6%), \"I like blood-typical personality diagnosis\" (61.5%).</ref>

Although there is no proven correlation between blood type and personality, it remains popular with the many [[matchmaking]] services that cater to blood type. In this way, it is similar to the use of astrological signs, which is also popular in Japan. Asking one's blood type is common in Japan, and people are often surprised when a non-Japanese does not know their own blood type.<ref name=\"japantoday\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133206/http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/in-japan-you-are-what-your-blood-type-is In Japan, you are what your blood type is], ''Japan Today''</ref>

It is common among [[anime]] and [[manga]] authors to mention their character's blood types and to give their characters blood types to match their personalities.<ref name=\"Brenner2007\">{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Robin E.|title=Understanding manga and anime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uY8700WJy_gC&pg=PA41|year=2007|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=978-1-59158-332-5|page=41}}</ref> Some video game characters have known blood types. In addition, it is common for video game series to allow for blood type as an option in their creation modes.<ref name=\"Brenner2007\" />

[[Facebook]] in many Asian countries allows users to include their blood type in their profile.<ref>[http://psychologia.co/blood-type-personality/ Blood Type Personality ], Psychologia, Retrieved 17 May 2014.</ref>

Blood types are important in South Korea as well. The Korean webcomic ''[[A Simple Thinking About Blood Type]]'' depicts the stereotypes of each blood type, and has been adapted as a short anime series in Japan as ''Ketsuekigata-kun!'' in 2013 and 2015.

== Discrimination ==
Blood type harassment, called \"bura-hara\" ([[wasei-eigo]]: a [[portmanteau]] of \"blood\" and \"harassment\"), has been blamed for bullying of children in playgrounds, loss of job opportunities, and ending of happy relationships.<ref name=\"McCurry2008\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/04/japan-world-news|title=Typecast - Japan's obsession with blood groups|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=4 December 2008|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>

Many people in Asia have been discriminated against because of their blood type. Employers ask blood types during interviews despite the warnings they have been given. Children at schools have been split up according to their blood type. The national softball team has customized training to fit each player's blood type. Companies have given work assignments according to their employee's blood type.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/01/in-japan-your-blood-type-_n_162917.html|title=In Japan, Your Blood Type Says It All|last=Yamaguchi|first=Mari|date=2009-02-01|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2014-04-12}}</ref>

However, these episodes are thought to be more or less exaggerated—as well as horoscope addiction in Europe or the US, which is sometimes reported in Japan. No blood-type harassment trials have been reported, so far. In reality, most Japanese people don't think blood types ''determine'' their personalities, but affect it in ''some'' degree.<ref name=\"yamashita\" /><ref name=\"yahoor\" />

A [[pseudoscientific]] belief exists in Japan and South Korea, that a person's [[ABO blood group system|ABO '''blood type''']] is predictive of a person's '''[[personality]]''', temperament, and compatibility with others.<ref name=AP>{{cite web|last=Yamaguchi|first=Mari|title=Myth about Japan blood types under attack|url=http://aol.mediresource.com/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=6661&news_channel_id=11&channel_id=11|publisher=MediResource Inc.|accessdate=29 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228182320/http://aol.mediresource.com/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=6661&news_channel_id=11&channel_id=11|archivedate=28 December 2009|date=6 May 2005}}</ref> This superstition is similar to how [[astrological sign]]s are perceived as influencing factors in a person's life in other countries.

One of the reasons [[Japan]] developed the blood type personality indicator theory was in reaction against ethnic stereotypes coming from Europe.<ref>Takeji Furukawa (1927), 血液型と気質 Blood Type and Temperament - in Europe, type A is more common than type B, while in Asia type B is more prevalent, so Europeans insisted A races are superior to B races. A Japanese scholar, Takeji Furukawa opposed that idea and asserted that B persons were active while A persons were passive.</ref> The popular belief originates with publications by [[Masahiko Nomi]] in the 1970s.

The scientific community generally dismisses blood type personality theories as a [[superstition]] or [[pseudoscience]] because of lack of evidence or testable criteria.<ref name=\"AP\" /><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8646236.stm Dating by blood type in Japan]</ref><ref name=\"Nuwer\">{{cite web|last=Nuwer|first=Rachel|title=You are what you bleed: In Japan and other east Asian countries some believe blood type dictates personality|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=you-are-what-you-bleed-in-japan-and-2011-02-15&WT.mc_id=SA_DD_20110215|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=16 Feb 2011}}</ref> Although research into the causal link between blood type and personality is limited, research does not demonstrate any statistically significant association between the two.<ref name=\"cramer\">Cramer, K.

==History==
The idea that personality traits were inherited through the blood dates as far back as Aristotle.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |author=Jon Geir Høyersten |title=From Homer to Pinel: The concept of personality from antiquity until 1800 AD |journal=[[Nordic Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=51 |issue=5 |year=1997 |pages=385–394 |doi=10.3109/08039489709090734}}, cited in {{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Mary|last2=Glendon|first2=A.

In 1926, Rin Hirano and Tomita Yashima published the article \"Blood Type Biological Related\" in the ''Army Medical Journal''. It was seen to be a non-statistical and unscientific report [[Scientific racism|motivated by racism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Takeji Furukawa===
In 1927, Takeji Furukawa, a professor at Tokyo Women's Teacher's School, published his paper \"The Study of Temperament Through Blood Type\" in the scholarly journal ''Psychological Research''. The idea quickly took off with the Japanese public despite Furukawa's lack of credentials, and the militarist government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding ideal soldiers.<ref name=\"AP\" /> The study used ten to twenty people for the investigation, thereby failing to meet the statistical requirements for generalizing the results to the wider population.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

On the other hand, in 1934, Fisher announced the [[chi-squared test]], which is very popular at present, for the first time. Several scholars said that they found statistically significant differences analyzing Japanese work conducted at that time.<ref>e.g. Masao Omura (Nihon University) in \"血液型と性格 Blood Type and Personality\", Terumitsu Maekawa (Asia University) in \"血液型人間学 Blood Type Humanics\" and so on.</ref>

In another study, Furukawa compared the distribution of blood types among two ethnic groups: the [[Taiwanese aborigines|Formosan]]s in Taiwan and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Hokkaidō]]. His motivation for the study appears to have come from a political incident:<ref name=\"Nakatani\" /> After the Japanese occupation of Taiwan following [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan's invasion of China in 1895]], the inhabitants tenaciously resisted their occupiers. Insurgencies in 1930 and in 1931 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese settlers.<ref name=\"Nakatani\" />

The purpose of Furukawa's studies was to \"penetrate the essence of the racial traits of the Taiwanese, who recently revolted and behaved so cruelly.\" Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% had type O. In conclusion, Furukawa suggested that the Japanese should increase intermarriage with the Taiwanese to reduce the number of Taiwanese with type O blood.<ref name = Nakatani>{{cite book | title = Criminals and their Scientists: The History of Criminology in International Perspective (Publications of the German Historical Institute) | first = Peter (Ed.) | last = Becker | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-81012-8 | year = 2006 |author2=Yoji Nakatani | chapter = The Birth of Criminology in Modern Japan | page = 294}}</ref>

===Masahiko Nomi===
{{Main|Masahiko Nomi}}
Interest in the theory faded in the 1930s. It was revived in the 1970s with a book by [[Masahiko Nomi]], a journalist with no medical background (he graduated from the engineering department of University of Tokyo). Few Japanese psychologists criticized him at that time,<ref>Toshinori Shirasa & Takuji Iguchi (1993), 血液型性格研究入門 血液型と性格は関係ないと言えるのか An introduction to Blood Type Personality Research - Can we say there is no relationship with blood type and personality?, pp.209-212 & 242-243. -- virtually no papers nor books about blood type and personality was published from the Japanese psychological community ''before'' Masahiko Nomi's death in 1981.</ref> so he continued to demonstrate statistically significant data in various fields and published several books with these results.<ref>[[Masahiko Nomi]] analyzed various data by using statistical methods and found meaningful traits; the following are some of his works. 
* Blood Type Affinity Study 5/1974 - 20,000 samples analyzed in total

==Background and criticism==

===Criticism===
Kengo Nawata, a Japanese social psychologist, statistically analyzed three data sets of over 10,000 Japanese and American people in total.<ref name=\"nawata\" /> However, 65 of the 68 items yielded non-significant differences between blood types and the other three items showed relatively slight relationships. Therefore, the blood type explained only 0.3% of the whole differences of these data sets. This result suggests that blood type explained very little of people's personalities. Nawata came to the conclusion that there is actually no relevance of blood type for personality.

===Controversial statistically significant data===
However, some academic researchers have shown several statistically significant data in Japan and Korea. Akira Sakamoto and Kenji Yamazaki, Japanese social psychologists, analyzed 32,347 samples of annual opinion polls from 1978 through 1988.<ref name=\"sakamoto2004\" /><ref name=\"sakamoto1992\" /> These results indicated that Japanese blood-typical stereotypes actually influenced their self-reported personalities—as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Cosy Muto and Masahiro Nagashima et al. (Nagasaki University) conducted a supplementary survey of Yamazaki and Sakamoto in 2011.<ref name=\"nagashima\" /> They demonstrated that significant and the same difference on personalities between blood-types by using the same database as Samamoto and Yamazaki used. In the 1990s, difference due to blood types was stabilized and variances became smaller. Then in the 2000s, difference was definitely statistically significant, too. However, the [[effect size|effect magnitude]] was extremely small, despite 'significance' in the statistical sense.

Another Japanese social psychologist, Shigeyuki Yamaoka (Shotoku University), announced results of his questionnaires, which were conducted in 1999 (1,300 subjects)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (1999), 血液型ステレオタイプが生み出す血液型差別の研究 A Study on Blood Harassment Caused by Blood-typical Stereotypes, Paper presented at the 40th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology. Tokyo. - for further information of this paper, confer to Shigeyuki Yamaoka (2001), ダメな大人にならないための心理学 A Psychology Book for not to Become a Useless Adult, pp.35-73 {{ISBN|4892426652}}</ref> and 2006 (1,362 subjects),<ref name=\"yamaoka2006\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (2006), [http://www.wdc-jp.biz/cgi-bin/jssp/wbpnew/master/download.php?submission_id=2006-E-0375&type=1 血液型性格項目の自己認知に及ぼすＴＶ番組視聴の影響 Influence of Watching TV programs to One's Self-recognition of the Blood-type personality Items] Paper presented at the 47th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology. Tokyo.</ref> In both cases, the subjects were university students, and only subjects with enough knowledge of and belief in the \"blood-type diagnosis\" showed meaningful differences. He concluded that these differences must be the [[influence of mass media]], especially TV programs. Yamaoka later examined 6,660 samples from 1999 through 2009 in total and found the same result.<ref name=\"yamaoka2009\">Shigeyuki Yamaoka (2009), [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/els/110007674296.pdf?id=ART0009487281&type=pdf&lang=jp&host=cinii&order_no=&ppv_type=0&lang_sw=&no=1444739076&cp= 血液型性格判断の差別性と虚妄性(自主企画(2)) Segregation and falsehood of blood-type personality analysis]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, self planning session (2) at the 18th annual convention of the Japanese society of personality psychology.</ref>

On the other hand, there are opinions that the statistically meaningful differences according to the blood types are not explained only by beliefs, nor are they a self-fulfilling prophecy. In Japan, penetration rate of blood-typical personality traits were investigated. Yoriko Watanabe, a Japanese psychologist (then Hokkaido University), chose \"well-known\" traits and found most traits were known to no more than half of Japanese (subjects were university students).<ref name=\"watanabey\">Watanabe, Y. (1994). [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002785240 血液型ステレオタイプ形成におけるプロトタイプとイグゼンブラの役割 The roles of prototype and exemplar in the formation of the \"blood type stereotype\"]. Japanese Journal of Social Psychology, 10-2, 77-86. - She extracted 7 traits for each 4 blood types, 28 in total, which were common to three or more \"blood type diagnosis\" books. 20 items of all 28 showed less than 50% penetration (the average is 46.1%).</ref> A Japanese writer, Masayuki Kanazawa, analyzed these blood-typical traits in combination with data from Yamaoka (1999)<ref name=\"yamaoka1999\" /> that used the same items of Watanabe's penetration survey.<ref name =\"watanabey\" /> If blood-typical differences are caused by penetration (or their self-recognition), the rate of difference of a trait is proportional to the rate of its penetration. However, Kanazawa was not able to discover any association with blood-type differences and penetration rates.<ref>Masayuki Kanazawa (2014), 統計でわかる血液型人間学入門 An Introduction to Blood Type Humanics - Understanding by Statistics, Gentosha Runaissance {{ISBN|4779011094}}/9784779011092 pp.16-36</ref> This result raises doubt about the role of beliefs and self-fulfilling prophecy.

Most reports that demonstrated statistical correlation attribute differences to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. However, there is no study that directly proved the existence of \"self fulfillment\". Therefore, opinions of researchers are varied at present:
# Whether there is statistical correlation or not;
# Whether any statistical correlations are superficial, being caused by subjects' self-fulfilling prophecy, or if they are truly caused by the blood type.

=== Blood Type Personality and Five Factor Model ===
The [[Five factor model|Five Factor Model]] tests were carried out in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, after the year 2000. These tests were intended to digitize self-ratings of the [[Big Five personality traits|\"big five\" personality traits]]. It was expected that differences in self-reported personalities (a self-fulfilling prophecy) would be detected from the subject who believed blood-typical stereotypes. As a result, researchers found no meaningful statistical difference.<ref name=\"cramer\" /><ref name=\"rogers\" /><ref name=\"wu\" /><ref name=\"sohyuncho\">So Hyun Cho, Eun Kook M. Suh, Yoen Jung Ro (2005), [http://kiss.kstudy.com/journal/thesis_name.asp?tname=kiss2002&key=2498184 ''Beliefs about Blood Types and Traits and Their Reflections in Self-reported Personality''], Korean Journal of Social and Personality Psychology, 19(4), 37-47.</ref><ref>Yoshio Kubo, Yukiko Miyake (2011), [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110008427667 血液型と性格の関連についての調査的研究 Correlation between blood types and personalities] Bulletin of Kibi International University (Department of Social Welfare), 21, 93－100.</ref>

So Ho Cho, a Korean psychologist (Yonsei University), and the others carried out a questionnaire about blood-typical items to subjects and discovered statistical differences as expected.<ref name=\"sohyuncho\" /> However, the difference was not found when the Five Factor Model for big five personality traits was administered to the same subjects. Another Korean researcher Sohn (Yonsei University) re-analyzed Cho's data.<ref name=\"sohn\">Sung Il Ryu, Young Woo Sohn (2007), ''A Review of Sociocultural, Behavioral, Biochemical Analyses on ABO Blood-Groups Typology'', The Korean Journal of Social and Personality Psychology</ref> He found that several independent items of the big five personality test detected differences according to each blood-typical stereotype. However, these differences became extinct in the process of plural items being gathered to five factors (big five).

If these results are correct, the Five Factor Model test cannot detect differences between the blood types, if such a causal link did indeed exist.<ref name=\"sakamoto2004\" /><ref name=\"sakamoto1992\" /><ref name=\"yamaoka1999\" /><ref name=\"yamaoka2006\" /><ref name=\"yamaoka2009\" /><ref>Masayuki Kanazawa (2018), Blood Type and Personality 3.0 - Reality Proved by 300,000 People and AI, CreateSpace {{ISBN|1986623815}}/9781986623810 pp.119-122. This book analyzed 14 reports of the \"Big Five\" test and obtained no consistent result.</ref> The phenomenon is not reported when using the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator|MBTI personality index]].

===Brain waves and light topography===
Kim and Yi (Seoul University of Venture & Information) measured brain waves of 4,636 adults. They reported that type O people were most stress-resistant.<ref>Choong-Shik Kim, Seon-Gyu Yi (2011), [http://kiss.kstudy.com/journal/thesis_name.asp?tname=kisskw&key=50117192 ''A Study on the effects of one's blood type on emotional character and antistress of adults''], Journal of the Korea Academia-Industrial cooperation Society, 12(6), 2554-2560. - According to this article \"meaningful difference had been revealed between the blood type and stress resistancy; type O rated higher scores in awareness and stress resistancy then other types...\"</ref> In addition, an experiment using light topography instruments by Munetaka Haida (Tokai University School of Medicine) suggests the possibility that activated parts of human brain are different according to blood types. i.e. type A's left brain is superior to the right, while type B's right brain is superior.<ref>Human Science ABO Center held the symposium \"血液型を考える～ヒトＡＢＯ式血液型遺伝子を理解する為に～ Think about Blood Type -- Toward Understanding Human ABO Genes\" in February, 2010 (Tokyo). -- the report (Japanese) including Haida's presentation is [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=aHVtYW4tYWJvLm9yZ3xhYm93b3JsZHxneDozMGNiY2NlYzkzY2Y3NDU4 here].</ref>

==Popularity==
In Japan, discussion of blood types is widely popular in women's magazines as a way of gauging relationship compatibility with a potential or current partner. Morning television shows feature blood type [[horoscope]]s, and similar horoscopes are published daily in newspapers. The blood types of celebrities are listed in their [[help:infobox|infobox]]es on Japanese Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/99865|title=Type Cast: The Japanese Fascination with Blood Types|accessdate=21 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619031050/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/99865|archive-date=2012-06-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> A series of four books that describe people's character by blood type ranked third, fourth, fifth and ninth on a list of best-selling books in Japan in 2008 compiled by Tohan Corporation.<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/12/31/news/blood-types-do-they-shape-a-personality-or-mere-stereotypes/ Blood Types -- Do They Shape a Personality or Mere Stereotypes], Natsuko Fukue, ''The Japan Times'', December 31, 2008</ref>

No less than two-thirds of people in several East Asian countries and areas, such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan, believe in the association between blood types and personality.{{#tag:ref|Many people of the East Asia believe the association with blood types and personality; Japan: 75% (NHK - Japan Broadcasting Corporation - opinion polls, 1986), Korea: 75% (Wow Korea, July 21, 2014), Taiwan: 66% (Wu et. al<ref name=\"wu\" />)|}}

In addition, according to one Japanese survey, more than half of Japanese people are fond of talking about blood type and personality.<ref name=\"yamashita\">Reiko Yamashita (2008), [http://db1.wdc-jp.com/cgi-bin/jssp/wbpnew/master/detail00.php?submission_id=2008-E-0208 血液型性格判断はなぜすたれないのか why doesn't blood type in Japanense culture detariorate?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120840/http://db1.wdc-jp.com/cgi-bin/jssp/wbpnew/master/detail00.php?submission_id=2008-E-0208 |date=August 26, 2014 }}, Paper presented at the 48th annual convention of the Japanese society of social psychology.</ref> The research also says that people in Japan like blood-typical personality diagnosis and 1. talk about it with proper knowledge, 2. believe some relationships exist between blood type and personality, 3. feel its traits are applicable to themselves to a certain degree. Results of two other surveys are the same.<ref name=\"yahoor\">The following are results of two Japanese surveys:
* Yahoo! Research (December 25, 2008)『「血液型本」に関する調査』 A survey about \"blood type books\" -- \"My personality is  appropriately expressed so that sympathized, convinced\" (66%), \"Can grasp my personality objectively with new discovery\" (59%), \"One of the means and the methods to express my personality\" (50%), \"Useful in acquaintances\" (48%) and \"Useful in love-affiliated things\" (47%).
* Yumiko Kamise, Yutaka Matsui (1996), 血液型ステレオタイプ変容の形 ―ステレオタイプ変容モデルの検証― Changing processes of stereotype on blood-groups, Japanese Journal of Social Psychology, 11-3, 170-179. -- \"blood-typical personality diagnosis is a fun\" (83.6%), \"I like blood-typical personality diagnosis\" (61.5%).</ref>

Although there is no proven correlation between blood type and personality, it remains popular with the many [[matchmaking]] services that cater to blood type. In this way, it is similar to the use of astrological signs, which is also popular in Japan. Asking one's blood type is common in Japan, and people are often surprised when a non-Japanese does not know their own blood type.<ref name=\"japantoday\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133206/http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/in-japan-you-are-what-your-blood-type-is In Japan, you are what your blood type is], ''Japan Today''</ref>

It is common among [[anime]] and [[manga]] authors to mention their character's blood types and to give their characters blood types to match their personalities.<ref name=\"Brenner2007\">{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Robin E.|title=Understanding manga and anime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uY8700WJy_gC&pg=PA41|year=2007|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=978-1-59158-332-5|page=41}}</ref> Some video game characters have known blood types. In addition, it is common for video game series to allow for blood type as an option in their creation modes.<ref name=\"Brenner2007\" />

[[Facebook]] in many Asian countries allows users to include their blood type in their profile.<ref>[http://psychologia.co/blood-type-personality/ Blood Type Personality ], Psychologia, Retrieved 17 May 2014.</ref>

After then-Reconstruction Minister [[Ryu Matsumoto]]'s abrasive comments towards the governors of Iwate and Miyagi<ref>{{cite news|last=Fukue |first=Natsuko |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110705a2.html |title=Matsumoto rips Tohoku governors |publisher=The Japan Times |date=2011-07-05 |accessdate=2014-04-12}}</ref> forced him to step down from his post, he partially blamed his behavior on his blood type, saying \"My blood is type B, which means I can be irritable and impetuous, and my intentions don't always come across.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/06/us-politics-blood-idUSTRE7653PC20110706 | work=Reuters | first=Elaine | last=Lies | title=Blame it on my blood, disgraced Japan politician says | date=2011-07-06}}</ref>

Blood types are important in South Korea as well. The Korean webcomic ''[[A Simple Thinking About Blood Type]]'' depicts the stereotypes of each blood type, and has been adapted as a short anime series in Japan as ''Ketsuekigata-kun!'' in 2013 and 2015.

== Discrimination ==
Blood type harassment, called \"bura-hara\" ([[wasei-eigo]]: a [[portmanteau]] of \"blood\" and \"harassment\"), has been blamed for bullying of children in playgrounds, loss of job opportunities, and ending of happy relationships.<ref name=\"McCurry2008\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/04/japan-world-news|title=Typecast - Japan's obsession with blood groups|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=4 December 2008|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>

Many people in Asia have been discriminated against because of their blood type. Employers ask blood types during interviews despite the warnings they have been given. Children at schools have been split up according to their blood type. The national softball team has customized training to fit each player's blood type. Companies have given work assignments according to their employee's blood type.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/01/in-japan-your-blood-type-_n_162917.html|title=In Japan, Your Blood Type Says It All|last=Yamaguchi|first=Mari|date=2009-02-01|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2014-04-12}}</ref>

However, these episodes are thought to be more or less exaggerated—as well as horoscope addiction in Europe or the US, which is sometimes reported in Japan. No blood-type harassment trials have been reported, so far. In reality, most Japanese people don't think blood types ''determine'' their personalities, but affect it in ''some'' degree.<ref name=\"yamashita\" /><ref name=\"yahoor\" />

'''''Robotech''''' is an American-Japanese 85-episode adaptation of [[Robotech|three unrelated]] [[anime]] [[television series]] (from three different [[fictional universe]]s) made between 1982–1984 in [[Japan]]; the adaptation was aired in 1985. Within the combined and edited story, ''Robotechnology'' refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship that crashed on a South Pacific island.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|title= The Past, Present and Future of Macross|accessdate= 2010-04-20|work= [[IGN]]|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725224848/http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|archivedate= 2010-07-25}}</ref> With this technology, Earth developed giant robotic machines or [[mecha]] (many of which were capable of transforming into vehicles) to fight three successive [[wikt:extraterrestrial|extraterrestrial]] invasions.<ref>{{cite news|title=An Introduction to Robotech|work=Robotech.com|url=http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/intro/|accessdate=2008-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914105444/http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/intro/|archivedate=2008-09-14}}</ref>

==Background==
''Robotech'' was one of the first [[anime]] televised in the United States that attempted to include most of the complexity and drama of its original [[Japan]]ese source material.<ref name=\"Macek Training\">{{cite web
|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2010-01-14
|title=Macek Training|accessdate=2010-01-25 |work= Anime News Network |publisher= |date= }}</ref> Produced by [[Harmony Gold USA]], Inc. in association with [[Tatsunoko]] Productions Co. Ltd., ''Robotech'' is a story adapted with edited content and revised dialogue from the animation of three different [[mecha]] anime series: ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' from 1982, ''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' from 1984, and ''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA|Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' from 1983. Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for US-American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required since they originally aired in Japan as a weekly series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why were the names from the original shows changed?|work=Robotech.com|url=http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=11|accessdate=2008-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421173202/http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=11|archivedate=2008-04-21}}</ref>

Harmony Gold hired American writers to adapt the scripts of the three Japanese series.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|title= The Past, Present and Future of Macross|accessdate= 2010-04-20|work= [[IGN]]|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725224848/http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|archivedate= 2010-07-25}}</ref> This complicated process was supervised by producer [[Carl Macek]], a pioneer of the anime industry in the United States.<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite news|title= The 'Robotech' master|work= San Francisco Chronicle|date=2010-05-06|url= http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-06/entertainment/20888023_1_carl-macek-animation-stop-motion|accessdate=2010-10-25|first=Jeff|last=Yang}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=What is Robotech?|work=Robotech.com|url=http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=8|accessdate=2008-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421173332/http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=8|archivedate=2008-04-21}}</ref>

This combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations as mankind must fight three destructive Robotech Wars in succession over a powerful energy source called \"Protoculture\":
* The First Robotech War (''The Macross Saga'') concerns humanity's discovery of a crashed alien ship and subsequent battle against a race of giant warriors called the Zentraedi, who have been sent to retrieve the ship for reasons unknown.  In the course of this chapter, Earth is nearly annihilated, the Zentraedi are defeated, and humans gain knowledge of the energy source called protoculture.  Humanity also learns of the Robotech Masters whose galactic empire the Zentraedi protected and patrolled.
* The Second Robotech War (''The Masters'') focuses on the arrival in Earth orbit of the Robotech Masters, who have come seeking what turns out to be the sole means in the universe of producing protoculture.  Through a combination of mistrust and arrogance, their attempts at retrieving this meet with opposition from the humans and unleash a war that leaves the Masters defeated and Earth awash in the spores of a plant called the Flower of Life—the source of protoculture and a beacon to the mysterious Invid who scour the galaxy for its presence.
* The Third Robotech War (''The New Generation'') begins with the arrival on Earth of the Invid, who are lured by the Flower of Life and rapidly conquer the planet.  References in the previous two chapters explain to viewers that many of the heroes of the First Robotech War had left Earth to seek out the Robotech Masters on a preemptive mission, and it is this Robotech Expeditionary Force that sends missions back from across the galaxy to attempt a liberation of their homeworld.  The storyline follows one group of freedom fighters as they work their way towards the final battle with the Invid.

===''Codename: Robotech''===
''Codename: Robotech'' is a 73-minute animated [[television pilot|pilot]] that preceded the series. It is set within the events of the First Robotech War. It was a greatly extended version of ''Gloval's Report'', the fourteenth television episode that summarizes the beginning of the series. It was aired on some television stations before the broadcast of the series in 1985. It was included on [[DVD]] as an extra with the first volume of the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'' and the complete ''Protoculture Collection'', from [[ADV Films]].<ref name=\"EX\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ex.org/articles/2001/2001.07.22-rev_anime-us-robotech.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011119205153/http://www.ex.org/articles/2001/2001.07.22-rev_anime-us-robotech.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2001-11-19 | title=Robotech: The Macross Saga Legacy Collection 1 | author=Darius Washington | publisher=EX: The Online World of Anime & Manga | date=2001-07-22 }}</ref> The disc includes the option of [[audio commentary]] by producer [[Carl Macek]] and was also released in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]].

==Television broadcast==
* '''North American television debut:''' ''Robotech'' originally aired in [[1985 in television|1985]] in first-run syndication, meaning it was sold directly to local television stations without having been run on a network first—this was part of a trend in animation in the 1980s. Previously, local stations would rerun theatrical cartoons like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' or shows that had previously aired on network TV on Saturday mornings. This changed after ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' introduced a new economic model: shows sold directly for first-run to stations, driving and funded by sales of related toys.<ref name=\"Macek Training\"/> Though the original ''Robotech'' series did well in ratings, the attempt to cash in on toys may have doomed ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' as the original series attracted older viewers, not necessarily the children targeted by the toy line. The failure of the Matchbox toy line is cited as a primary reason for the cancellation of the ''Sentinels'' series.
* '''International broadcast:''' In Australia, ''Robotech'' was aired from 1986 to and throughout 1988 and in the late 1990s by both the Seven and Ten networks and various regional stations in different states. Ten cut the series at episode 52, while Seven broadcast all 85 episodes. In 2018, also in Australia, Network Ten multichannel [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]] started airing the Macross Saga. In France, ''Robotech'' was originally broadcast by [[La Cinq]] during the summer of 1987; the show moved to [[TF1]] in 1991. The Philippine network [[GMA-7]] aired the Masters and New Generation episodes in the late 1980s (as [[RPN-9]] aired Macross in the early 1980s), as part of the late-afternoon weekday animation block (together with [[Captain Harlock]]). The Hong Kong cable television channel Star Plus (now [[Star World]]) aired all 85 episodes, from May 1994 to January 1995, with changes in time-slots (May-early October 1994, 11:00&nbsp;a.m. Sundays; October 1994-January 1995, 5:30&nbsp;p.m. Weekdays). The series was broadcast in a number of European countries by the then [[NBC Europe|Super Channel]] during the 1980s. In the UK, Robotech aired on [[The Children's Channel]] in the mid to late 1980s, and it was transmitted on [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716201338/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/otherchannels/premiere.html Prem1ere], the satellite movie channel, in the same period. In Spain, all Robotech episodes were aired using the Latin American Dubbing, from August 1990 to April 1991, with changes in time slots, in [[Telecinco]] channel. The series was aired again in the same channel from October 1993 to May 1994. At that time only The Macross Saga and The Robotech Masters Saga were aired, leaving the third part of the show unaired. In Russia, the entire series was shown in the beginning of 1990's on [[2×2 (TV channel)|2x2]] - the first commercial Russian channel. The Dubai-based channel [[MBC 3 (Middle East)|MBC 3]] began broadcasting an [[Arabic|Arabic-language]] dubbed version in early 2010.
* '''Subsequent airings:''' ''Robotech'' appeared on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 1993, and on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] in 1998. Toonami aired only episodes 1 through 60, finishing the run at the end of the ''Robotech Masters'' story-line.  [[Toonami]] reran 3 selected episodes of ''Robotech'' as part of the [[Giant Robot Week]] in 2003. [[KQEH|Superstation KTEH]], a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] public television station in [[San Jose, California]], as part of its Sunday Late-Prime (9pm-after 12) Sci-Fi programming line-up aired the \"Macross\" and \"New Generation\" storylines, as well as the ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' feature. ''Robotech'' formerly aired daily on [[The Anime Network]]. As of January 7, 2007, the show also airs in Canada on [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] and [[Retro (TV channel)|Retro]]. As of 2017, all three storyline sagas of Robotech are currently available for streaming on [[Netflix]].  Internet based Pluto TV, a Viacom subsidiary, began showing all three Robotech stories Summer of 2019 on the Anime All Day channel.  They appeared in their original Japanese format as Macross, Southern Cross and Genesis Climber Mospeada.

==Critical reception==

The series has attained a significant cult-following over the years along with critical appraisal; in 2009, ''[[IGN]]'' ranked ''Robotech'' as the 34th greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.<ref name=\"ign100\">{{cite web |title=34, Robotech |url=http://www.ign.com/top/animated-tv-series/34.html|publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-01-24 |date=2009-01-23}}</ref>

==Home media==<!-- This section is linked from [[Robotech]] -->
* '''[[Family Home Entertainment]]''' (FHE) first attempted to release one episode per [[VHS]] tape, but only got through a handful of early episodes before abandoning this approach.  In 1987, the company then heavily edited the 36-episode ''Macross Saga'' portion into six feature-length tapes, cutting out episode introductions and slower scenes, and ignoring the ''Southern Cross'' and ''New Generation'' series entirely.  A third VHS run finally succeeded at releasing the entire series with two uncut episodes per tape, over a total of 42 volumes. ''The Macross Saga'' and ''The Masters'' were also released on [[Laserdisc]] in 1993 and 1994, respectively.  Each Laserdisc contained four uncut episodes.
* '''[[Palladium Books]]''', past and current publishers of the ''Robotech'' [[role-playing game]], was the first company to release ''Southern Cross'', ''New Generation'', and ''[[Robotech#Sequels and Spinoffs|Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' on VHS home video.  These VHS videos were available via mail-order, as well as some direct-market game and hobby shops.
* '''[[Streamline Pictures]]''', founded by Macek after the end of ''Robotech'', released ''[[Robotech#Sequels and Spinoffs|Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' on VHS and [[Laserdisc]] after the Palladium Books releases went out of print.  In 1994, Streamline Pictures also released an incomplete series of \"Perfect Collection\" VHS videos. Each volume included two episodes of ''Robotech'' after their corresponding episodes of ''Macross'', ''Southern Cross'', or ''Mospeada'', completely uncut but  [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.anime/browse_frm/thread/5c51a7bdff5bb20b/18c60182f4fd52ed?lnk=st&rnum=4#18c60182f4fd52ed inaccurately subtitled]. This series allowed English-speaking viewers to see many of the changes made.
* '''GameTek Cinema''' released the first episode of ''Robotech'' on [[CD-ROM]] in 1994.  This uncut episode was encoded in [[QuickTime]] 2.0 format at a video resolution of 320x226.  The episode contained a marginally different arrangement of background music.
* '''[[AnimEigo]]''', a specialty anime company, released the original Japanese ''[[Macross|Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' TV series on DVD in 2001 with subtitles and unedited in its pre-''Robotech'' form. The footage was extensively restored from the original film stock by Shin Kurokawa, making this the most pristine release of ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' outside Japan. The final DVD of the series also contains commentary by chief director Noburo Ishiguro.
* '''[[ADV Films]]''', an American distributor of anime, began releasing the entire series on [[DVD]] in 2001, typically with six episodes per disc. The first box sets of the series (dubbed the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'') included extra discs with special features ranging from ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' to pre-''Robotech'' dubs of the first ''Macross'' and ''Mospeada'' episodes. Complete collection box-sets were also released, containing all the episodes of each of the three ''Robotech'' sagas, minus the extras discs.
** The restoration of the original ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' TV series led to speculation among fans that the remastered footage could also be used to create a similarly-remastered version of ''Robotech''. However, [http://robotech.com/news/viewarticle.php?id=191 Carl Macek stated that a remaster would be impossible] at the time because they lacked the necessary source materials, including edit-decision lists, unmixed audio elements, and restored video elements for ''Southern Cross'' and ''Mospeada'', as well as for ''Macross''. Some of this (the audio elements and edit-lists) had been destroyed in a flood in the early 1990s; some of it (remastered footage for the other two series) had never been available to begin with. But in 2002, a set of off-site audio backup tapes was discovered to include the missing audio elements, and in 2003 ADV delayed its release of the subtitled ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross|Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' series by several months in order to remaster them, as well. With the remastered footage and audio elements available, ADV were able to forego needing the edit-decision lists by commissioning the same video production company that had originally edited ''Robotech'' to [http://robotech.com/news/viewarticle.php?id=192 create a new edit of the show]. ''Robotech: Remastered'' included the restoration of some scenes previously cut from the original ''Robotech'' release to conform to broadcast standards and broadcast length requirements, new opening/ending sequences, 5.1 Dolby surround sound with rerecorded sound effects, and new eyecatch sequences.
** ''Robotech: Remastered'' is not without its share of controversy. Some fans were upset by the reversal of ADV's position on a remastered ''Robotech'', feeling betrayed because they purchased the expensive ''Legacy Collection'' during the time ADV was insisting that there would be no remaster, and that this would be the best way ''Robotech'' would ever be seen on DVD. Other fans feel that the new 5.1 mix is overly loud and lacks subtlety; they prefer the unremastered version of the series, because it represents the ''Robotech'' that they love and remember as it first aired on television without the distraction of new sound effects. Also, the extent of the new footage is limited to sequences that did not require newly recorded dialogue (though other cut scenes are included, in the original Japanese, on one of the ''Legacy Collection'' extras discs). The video quality suffers slightly by comparison to AnimEigo's ''Macross'' DVDs: ADV includes six episodes per ''Robotech'' disc to AnimEigo's four per disc of ''Macross'', meaning that more compression is necessary, and therefore more compression artifacts appear. However, there is little question that the audio and video quality are substantially improved over the prior ''Robotech'' DVD release, and ''Robotech'' fans would likely prefer having had two different DVD versions released than none at all.
** In 2003, the original ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross|Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' series were released subtitled on DVD in their original Japanese language by ADV Films.
** Finally, in 2005, ADV released yet another box set, ''Robotech: The Protoculture Collection'', containing all the ''Robotech: Remastered'' DVDs plus the seven extras discs from the ''Legacy Collection'' in one thin-pack box. Detractors criticize these DVD re-releases as part of an industry trend to entice buyers to \"double-dip\", or buy more than one edition of the same DVD.
** Nevertheless, ADV Films announced at [[Anime Expo]] 2005 that they would be creating an uncut dub for ''Macross'', with the original Japanese voice actress [[Mari Iijima]] reprising her role as Minmei. This six-volume release has been completed, with the first volume being released on January 10, 2006, and the final volume being released on December 19, 2006. However, this dub did not utilize the same voice actors used in ''[[Robotech]]''.
* '''[[Manga Entertainment]]''' started to release ''Robotech'' on DVD as two-disc sets in the UK in late 2005. These sets are essentially the same as the ''Robotech: Remastered'' release from the US, but in different packaging.
* '''[[Madman Entertainment]]''' released an Australian Region 4 version of the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'' boxed sets starting in November 2002 with Volume One, and ending with Volume Seven in May 2003; the Australian version almost identical to the original US release, except for not repeating the \"gold box\" mistake.
** Claiming for a long time there wasn't enough demand for subtitled-only DVD releases, Madman eventually chose to test the waters with the release of the Japanese ''Macross'' series in March 2004. It was successful enough to secure the release of ''Southern Cross'' in July and ''Genesis Climber Mospeada'' in October of the same year. All three series are released in their own Madman-designed box, and bear little resemblance to the US releases; many fans preferring the Madman ''Macross'' box design over the various US versions.
** When initially asked about the possibility of an Australian release of ''Robotech: Remastered'', Madman claimed that it would not be cost-effective or profitable with the ''Legacy Collection'' already in the market, only to change their tune and release the ''Robotech 20th Anniversary Remastered Extended Edition'', a single box with all 14 discs, in June 2005. The recommended retail price for this box was only a little more than that of two of Madman ''Legacy Collection'' boxes.
** Continuing to follow the ADV Films trend, Madman announced the release of an Australian version of ''Robotech: The Protoculture Collection'' in November 2007, again with an RRP only a little more than the preceding 20th Anniversary set.
* '''[[A&E Television Networks|A&E Networks Home Entertainment]]''' picked up the video distribution rights to ''Robotech'' following ADV's closure in 2009 and re-released the series on DVD in 2011, based on ADV's remastered version of the series. Their release includes many of the special features of ADV's Legacy and Protoculture collections as well as new features, including a documentary, ''Carl Macek's Robotech Universe'', an edited version of ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' (which omits the ''Macross'' flashback scenes) and a 29-minute version of ''Robotech: The Movie'' (which does not include the ''[[Megazone 23]]'' footage, as Harmony Gold USA no longer has the rights to that series). This release was duplicated by '''Go Entertainment''' for a Region 2 release in the UK and '''[[Beyond Home Entertainment]]''' for a Region 4 release in Australia, after Manga Entertainment and Madman Entertainment respectively lost the distribution rights. An advantage that the Beyond Home version presents over A&E and Go Entertainment's versions is that it also includes ''[[Robotech: Love Live Alive|Love Live Alive]]''.
* '''[[Funimation]]''' announced in October 2019 that they have licensed the ''Robotech'' series, ''Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles'' and ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'', with a home video release planned later on.

Since ''Robotech'' was a non-union project, many of the voice actors involved worked under pseudonyms to avoid trouble with their union.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The voice-actor list printed in ''Robotech Art One'' lists the pseudonyms rather than the real names of most of the actors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Continuing after the original series==
* Harmony Gold attempted to produce several follow ups (see [[Robotech#Animated sequels and spinoffs|Robotech: Animated sequels and spinoffs]]) to the original series, most notably ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. The project fell through due to problems with  toy licensing and changes in the Japanese yen-US Dollar [[exchange rate]], among other reasons. The ''Sentinels'' saga continued to be chronicled in the [[Robotech (novels)|novelizations]] by [[Jack McKinney (writer)|Jack McKinney]] and [[Robotech (comics)|comic book adaptations]] by the [[Waltrip brothers]].
* A poor screen-test at the ''[[Robotech: The Movie]]'' screening in Texas led to [[Cannon Films]] pulling the feature from release in 1986, getting a very limited home video release in Europe.
* A disastrous reception by the fans to the ''[[Robotech 3000]]'' trailer in 2000 prompted Harmony Gold to cancel the project before any more footage was completed. In addition, [[Netter Digital]], the animation producers of the trailer, went bankrupt shortly afterward.
* ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' was first announced at [[Anime Expo]] 2004 as the latest incarnation of the ''Robotech'' saga. Unlike previous attempts, the movie was a direct continuation of the original series' last episode. The first teaser trailer debuted one year later at Anime Expo 2005 for the 20th anniversary of ''Robotech''. The 88-minute movie premiered at various film festivals in [[2006 in film|2006]] and a limited theatrical run in January [[2007 in film|2007]], but [http://www.robotech.com/community/forum/read.php?id=1656430&forumid=31 the DVD release was delayed] until February 6, 2007, the film's reception was very mixed.
* ''[[Robotech: Shadow Rising]]'' was a proposed sequel to the ''Shadow Chronicles'' that was originally intended to be released in 2009. Pre-production ceased after Harmony Gold could not reach an agreement with [[FUNimation Entertainment]]. The Shadow Rising trademark has been abandoned since 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.trademarkia.com/shadow-rising-77258278.html | title = Abandoned Shadow Rising Trademark | work = Trademarkia}}</ref>
* [[Warner Bros.]] and Material Pictures licensed the film rights to ''Robotech'' and were reportedly considering the production of a live-action adaptation. [[Tobey Maguire]] ([[Spider-Man (2002 film)|''Spider-Man'']] and [[Seabiscuit (film)|''Seabiscuit'']]) \"is eyeing the lead role\"<ref>Borys Kits.

* ''Robotech: Academy'' was a planned [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funded]] TV [[Television pilot|pilot]] based on an idea by the late series' creator [[Carl Macek]]. The [[Kickstarter]] project ran from July to August 2014, but was prematurely cancelled after funding fell significantly short of its goal.

'''''Robotech''''' is an American-Japanese 85-episode adaptation of [[Robotech|three unrelated]] [[anime]] [[television series]] (from three different [[fictional universe]]s) made between 1982–1984 in [[Japan]]; the adaptation was aired in 1985. Within the combined and edited story, ''Robotechnology'' refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship that crashed on a South Pacific island.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|title= The Past, Present and Future of Macross|accessdate= 2010-04-20|work= [[IGN]]|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725224848/http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|archivedate= 2010-07-25}}</ref> With this technology, Earth developed giant robotic machines or [[mecha]] (many of which were capable of transforming into vehicles) to fight three successive [[wikt:extraterrestrial|extraterrestrial]] invasions.<ref>{{cite news|title=An Introduction to Robotech|work=Robotech.com|url=http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/intro/|accessdate=2008-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914105444/http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/intro/|archivedate=2008-09-14}}</ref>

==Background==
''Robotech'' was one of the first [[anime]] televised in the United States that attempted to include most of the complexity and drama of its original [[Japan]]ese source material.<ref name=\"Macek Training\">{{cite web
|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2010-01-14
|title=Macek Training|accessdate=2010-01-25 |work= Anime News Network |publisher= |date= }}</ref> Produced by [[Harmony Gold USA]], Inc. in association with [[Tatsunoko]] Productions Co. Ltd., ''Robotech'' is a story adapted with edited content and revised dialogue from the animation of three different [[mecha]] anime series: ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' from 1982, ''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' from 1984, and ''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA|Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' from 1983. Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for US-American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required since they originally aired in Japan as a weekly series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why were the names from the original shows changed?|work=Robotech.com|url=http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=11|accessdate=2008-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421173202/http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=11|archivedate=2008-04-21}}</ref>

==Production history==
Harmony Gold hired American writers to adapt the scripts of the three Japanese series.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|title= The Past, Present and Future of Macross|accessdate= 2010-04-20|work= [[IGN]]|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725224848/http://uk.anime.ign.com/articles/847/847799p1.html|archivedate= 2010-07-25}}</ref> This complicated process was supervised by producer [[Carl Macek]], a pioneer of the anime industry in the United States.<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite news|title= The 'Robotech' master|work= San Francisco Chronicle|date=2010-05-06|url= http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-06/entertainment/20888023_1_carl-macek-animation-stop-motion|accessdate=2010-10-25|first=Jeff|last=Yang}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=What is Robotech?|work=Robotech.com|url=http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=8|accessdate=2008-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421173332/http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/faq/viewquestion.php?id=8|archivedate=2008-04-21}}</ref>

This combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations as mankind must fight three destructive Robotech Wars in succession over a powerful energy source called \"Protoculture\":
* The First Robotech War (''The Macross Saga'') concerns humanity's discovery of a crashed alien ship and subsequent battle against a race of giant warriors called the Zentraedi, who have been sent to retrieve the ship for reasons unknown.  In the course of this chapter, Earth is nearly annihilated, the Zentraedi are defeated, and humans gain knowledge of the energy source called protoculture.  Humanity also learns of the Robotech Masters whose galactic empire the Zentraedi protected and patrolled.
* The Second Robotech War (''The Masters'') focuses on the arrival in Earth orbit of the Robotech Masters, who have come seeking what turns out to be the sole means in the universe of producing protoculture.  Through a combination of mistrust and arrogance, their attempts at retrieving this meet with opposition from the humans and unleash a war that leaves the Masters defeated and Earth awash in the spores of a plant called the Flower of Life—the source of protoculture and a beacon to the mysterious Invid who scour the galaxy for its presence.
* The Third Robotech War (''The New Generation'') begins with the arrival on Earth of the Invid, who are lured by the Flower of Life and rapidly conquer the planet.  References in the previous two chapters explain to viewers that many of the heroes of the First Robotech War had left Earth to seek out the Robotech Masters on a preemptive mission, and it is this Robotech Expeditionary Force that sends missions back from across the galaxy to attempt a liberation of their homeworld.  The storyline follows one group of freedom fighters as they work their way towards the final battle with the Invid.

===''Codename: Robotech''===
''Codename: Robotech'' is a 73-minute animated [[television pilot|pilot]] that preceded the series. It is set within the events of the First Robotech War. It was a greatly extended version of ''Gloval's Report'', the fourteenth television episode that summarizes the beginning of the series. It was aired on some television stations before the broadcast of the series in 1985. It was included on [[DVD]] as an extra with the first volume of the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'' and the complete ''Protoculture Collection'', from [[ADV Films]].<ref name=\"EX\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ex.org/articles/2001/2001.07.22-rev_anime-us-robotech.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011119205153/http://www.ex.org/articles/2001/2001.07.22-rev_anime-us-robotech.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2001-11-19 | title=Robotech: The Macross Saga Legacy Collection 1 | author=Darius Washington | publisher=EX: The Online World of Anime & Manga | date=2001-07-22 }}</ref> The disc includes the option of [[audio commentary]] by producer [[Carl Macek]] and was also released in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]].

==Television broadcast==
* '''North American television debut:''' ''Robotech'' originally aired in [[1985 in television|1985]] in first-run syndication, meaning it was sold directly to local television stations without having been run on a network first—this was part of a trend in animation in the 1980s. Previously, local stations would rerun theatrical cartoons like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' or shows that had previously aired on network TV on Saturday mornings. This changed after ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' introduced a new economic model: shows sold directly for first-run to stations, driving and funded by sales of related toys.<ref name=\"Macek Training\"/> Though the original ''Robotech'' series did well in ratings, the attempt to cash in on toys may have doomed ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' as the original series attracted older viewers, not necessarily the children targeted by the toy line. The failure of the Matchbox toy line is cited as a primary reason for the cancellation of the ''Sentinels'' series.
* '''International broadcast:''' In Australia, ''Robotech'' was aired from 1986 to and throughout 1988 and in the late 1990s by both the Seven and Ten networks and various regional stations in different states. Ten cut the series at episode 52, while Seven broadcast all 85 episodes. In 2018, also in Australia, Network Ten multichannel [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]] started airing the Macross Saga. In France, ''Robotech'' was originally broadcast by [[La Cinq]] during the summer of 1987; the show moved to [[TF1]] in 1991. The Philippine network [[GMA-7]] aired the Masters and New Generation episodes in the late 1980s (as [[RPN-9]] aired Macross in the early 1980s), as part of the late-afternoon weekday animation block (together with [[Captain Harlock]]). The Hong Kong cable television channel Star Plus (now [[Star World]]) aired all 85 episodes, from May 1994 to January 1995, with changes in time-slots (May-early October 1994, 11:00&nbsp;a.m. Sundays; October 1994-January 1995, 5:30&nbsp;p.m. Weekdays). The series was broadcast in a number of European countries by the then [[NBC Europe|Super Channel]] during the 1980s. In the UK, Robotech aired on [[The Children's Channel]] in the mid to late 1980s, and it was transmitted on [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716201338/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/otherchannels/premiere.html Prem1ere], the satellite movie channel, in the same period. In Spain, all Robotech episodes were aired using the Latin American Dubbing, from August 1990 to April 1991, with changes in time slots, in [[Telecinco]] channel. The series was aired again in the same channel from October 1993 to May 1994. At that time only The Macross Saga and The Robotech Masters Saga were aired, leaving the third part of the show unaired. In Russia, the entire series was shown in the beginning of 1990's on [[2×2 (TV channel)|2x2]] - the first commercial Russian channel. The Dubai-based channel [[MBC 3 (Middle East)|MBC 3]] began broadcasting an [[Arabic|Arabic-language]] dubbed version in early 2010.
* '''Subsequent airings:''' ''Robotech'' appeared on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 1993, and on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] in 1998. Toonami aired only episodes 1 through 60, finishing the run at the end of the ''Robotech Masters'' story-line.  [[Toonami]] reran 3 selected episodes of ''Robotech'' as part of the [[Giant Robot Week]] in 2003. [[KQEH|Superstation KTEH]], a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] public television station in [[San Jose, California]], as part of its Sunday Late-Prime (9pm-after 12) Sci-Fi programming line-up aired the \"Macross\" and \"New Generation\" storylines, as well as the ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' feature. ''Robotech'' formerly aired daily on [[The Anime Network]]. As of January 7, 2007, the show also airs in Canada on [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] and [[Retro (TV channel)|Retro]]. As of 2017, all three storyline sagas of Robotech are currently available for streaming on [[Netflix]].  Internet based Pluto TV, a Viacom subsidiary, began showing all three Robotech stories Summer of 2019 on the Anime All Day channel.  They appeared in their original Japanese format as Macross, Southern Cross and Genesis Climber Mospeada.

==Critical reception==

The series has attained a significant cult-following over the years along with critical appraisal; in 2009, ''[[IGN]]'' ranked ''Robotech'' as the 34th greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.<ref name=\"ign100\">{{cite web |title=34, Robotech |url=http://www.ign.com/top/animated-tv-series/34.html|publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-01-24 |date=2009-01-23}}</ref>

==Home media==<!-- This section is linked from [[Robotech]] -->
* '''[[Family Home Entertainment]]''' (FHE) first attempted to release one episode per [[VHS]] tape, but only got through a handful of early episodes before abandoning this approach.  In 1987, the company then heavily edited the 36-episode ''Macross Saga'' portion into six feature-length tapes, cutting out episode introductions and slower scenes, and ignoring the ''Southern Cross'' and ''New Generation'' series entirely.  A third VHS run finally succeeded at releasing the entire series with two uncut episodes per tape, over a total of 42 volumes. ''The Macross Saga'' and ''The Masters'' were also released on [[Laserdisc]] in 1993 and 1994, respectively.  Each Laserdisc contained four uncut episodes.
* '''[[Palladium Books]]''', past and current publishers of the ''Robotech'' [[role-playing game]], was the first company to release ''Southern Cross'', ''New Generation'', and ''[[Robotech#Sequels and Spinoffs|Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' on VHS home video.  These VHS videos were available via mail-order, as well as some direct-market game and hobby shops.
* '''[[Streamline Pictures]]''', founded by Macek after the end of ''Robotech'', released ''[[Robotech#Sequels and Spinoffs|Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'' on VHS and [[Laserdisc]] after the Palladium Books releases went out of print.  In 1994, Streamline Pictures also released an incomplete series of \"Perfect Collection\" VHS videos. Each volume included two episodes of ''Robotech'' after their corresponding episodes of ''Macross'', ''Southern Cross'', or ''Mospeada'', completely uncut but  [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.anime/browse_frm/thread/5c51a7bdff5bb20b/18c60182f4fd52ed?lnk=st&rnum=4#18c60182f4fd52ed inaccurately subtitled]. This series allowed English-speaking viewers to see many of the changes made.
* '''GameTek Cinema''' released the first episode of ''Robotech'' on [[CD-ROM]] in 1994.  This uncut episode was encoded in [[QuickTime]] 2.0 format at a video resolution of 320x226.  The episode contained a marginally different arrangement of background music.
* '''[[AnimEigo]]''', a specialty anime company, released the original Japanese ''[[Macross|Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' TV series on DVD in 2001 with subtitles and unedited in its pre-''Robotech'' form. The footage was extensively restored from the original film stock by Shin Kurokawa, making this the most pristine release of ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' outside Japan. The final DVD of the series also contains commentary by chief director Noburo Ishiguro.
* '''[[ADV Films]]''', an American distributor of anime, began releasing the entire series on [[DVD]] in 2001, typically with six episodes per disc. The first box sets of the series (dubbed the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'') included extra discs with special features ranging from ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' to pre-''Robotech'' dubs of the first ''Macross'' and ''Mospeada'' episodes. Complete collection box-sets were also released, containing all the episodes of each of the three ''Robotech'' sagas, minus the extras discs.
** The restoration of the original ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' TV series led to speculation among fans that the remastered footage could also be used to create a similarly-remastered version of ''Robotech''. However, [http://robotech.com/news/viewarticle.php?id=191 Carl Macek stated that a remaster would be impossible] at the time because they lacked the necessary source materials, including edit-decision lists, unmixed audio elements, and restored video elements for ''Southern Cross'' and ''Mospeada'', as well as for ''Macross''. Some of this (the audio elements and edit-lists) had been destroyed in a flood in the early 1990s; some of it (remastered footage for the other two series) had never been available to begin with. But in 2002, a set of off-site audio backup tapes was discovered to include the missing audio elements, and in 2003 ADV delayed its release of the subtitled ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross|Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' series by several months in order to remaster them, as well. With the remastered footage and audio elements available, ADV were able to forego needing the edit-decision lists by commissioning the same video production company that had originally edited ''Robotech'' to [http://robotech.com/news/viewarticle.php?id=192 create a new edit of the show]. ''Robotech: Remastered'' included the restoration of some scenes previously cut from the original ''Robotech'' release to conform to broadcast standards and broadcast length requirements, new opening/ending sequences, 5.1 Dolby surround sound with rerecorded sound effects, and new eyecatch sequences.
** ''Robotech: Remastered'' is not without its share of controversy. Some fans were upset by the reversal of ADV's position on a remastered ''Robotech'', feeling betrayed because they purchased the expensive ''Legacy Collection'' during the time ADV was insisting that there would be no remaster, and that this would be the best way ''Robotech'' would ever be seen on DVD. Other fans feel that the new 5.1 mix is overly loud and lacks subtlety; they prefer the unremastered version of the series, because it represents the ''Robotech'' that they love and remember as it first aired on television without the distraction of new sound effects. Also, the extent of the new footage is limited to sequences that did not require newly recorded dialogue (though other cut scenes are included, in the original Japanese, on one of the ''Legacy Collection'' extras discs). The video quality suffers slightly by comparison to AnimEigo's ''Macross'' DVDs: ADV includes six episodes per ''Robotech'' disc to AnimEigo's four per disc of ''Macross'', meaning that more compression is necessary, and therefore more compression artifacts appear. However, there is little question that the audio and video quality are substantially improved over the prior ''Robotech'' DVD release, and ''Robotech'' fans would likely prefer having had two different DVD versions released than none at all.
** In 2003, the original ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross|Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'' and ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' series were released subtitled on DVD in their original Japanese language by ADV Films.
** Finally, in 2005, ADV released yet another box set, ''Robotech: The Protoculture Collection'', containing all the ''Robotech: Remastered'' DVDs plus the seven extras discs from the ''Legacy Collection'' in one thin-pack box. Detractors criticize these DVD re-releases as part of an industry trend to entice buyers to \"double-dip\", or buy more than one edition of the same DVD.
** Nevertheless, ADV Films announced at [[Anime Expo]] 2005 that they would be creating an uncut dub for ''Macross'', with the original Japanese voice actress [[Mari Iijima]] reprising her role as Minmei. This six-volume release has been completed, with the first volume being released on January 10, 2006, and the final volume being released on December 19, 2006. However, this dub did not utilize the same voice actors used in ''[[Robotech]]''.
* '''[[Manga Entertainment]]''' started to release ''Robotech'' on DVD as two-disc sets in the UK in late 2005. These sets are essentially the same as the ''Robotech: Remastered'' release from the US, but in different packaging.
* '''[[Madman Entertainment]]''' released an Australian Region 4 version of the ''Robotech Legacy Collection'' boxed sets starting in November 2002 with Volume One, and ending with Volume Seven in May 2003; the Australian version almost identical to the original US release, except for not repeating the \"gold box\" mistake.
** Claiming for a long time there wasn't enough demand for subtitled-only DVD releases, Madman eventually chose to test the waters with the release of the Japanese ''Macross'' series in March 2004. It was successful enough to secure the release of ''Southern Cross'' in July and ''Genesis Climber Mospeada'' in October of the same year. All three series are released in their own Madman-designed box, and bear little resemblance to the US releases; many fans preferring the Madman ''Macross'' box design over the various US versions.
** When initially asked about the possibility of an Australian release of ''Robotech: Remastered'', Madman claimed that it would not be cost-effective or profitable with the ''Legacy Collection'' already in the market, only to change their tune and release the ''Robotech 20th Anniversary Remastered Extended Edition'', a single box with all 14 discs, in June 2005. The recommended retail price for this box was only a little more than that of two of Madman ''Legacy Collection'' boxes.
** Continuing to follow the ADV Films trend, Madman announced the release of an Australian version of ''Robotech: The Protoculture Collection'' in November 2007, again with an RRP only a little more than the preceding 20th Anniversary set.
* '''[[A&E Television Networks|A&E Networks Home Entertainment]]''' picked up the video distribution rights to ''Robotech'' following ADV's closure in 2009 and re-released the series on DVD in 2011, based on ADV's remastered version of the series. Their release includes many of the special features of ADV's Legacy and Protoculture collections as well as new features, including a documentary, ''Carl Macek's Robotech Universe'', an edited version of ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'' (which omits the ''Macross'' flashback scenes) and a 29-minute version of ''Robotech: The Movie'' (which does not include the ''[[Megazone 23]]'' footage, as Harmony Gold USA no longer has the rights to that series). This release was duplicated by '''Go Entertainment''' for a Region 2 release in the UK and '''[[Beyond Home Entertainment]]''' for a Region 4 release in Australia, after Manga Entertainment and Madman Entertainment respectively lost the distribution rights. An advantage that the Beyond Home version presents over A&E and Go Entertainment's versions is that it also includes ''[[Robotech: Love Live Alive|Love Live Alive]]''.
* '''[[Funimation]]''' announced in October 2019 that they have licensed the ''Robotech'' series, ''Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles'' and ''Robotech II: The Sentinels'', with a home video release planned later on.

==Continuing after the original series==

The riding of [[wind waves|waves]] has likely existed since humans began swimming in the [[ocean]]. In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]]. The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].

[[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]

== Polynesian origins ==
The art of surfing, known as ''heʻe ʻana'' (''heʻe'' means ''to surf'', and ''ʻana'' is the [[Nominalization|nominalizing]] particle) in the [[Hawaiian language]], was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.

In Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied
surfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.

The sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.

== Pre-Incan Perú origins and debate ==

The practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called
\"[[Caballitos de Totora]]\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave in the world, 'Chicama,' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.

It is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.

==Ancient Hawaii==
The [[ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.

Hawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|to|18|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=10}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>

== Post-Contact Hawaii ==
After [[History of Hawaii#Contact|contact]] with the [[Western world|Western World]] Hawaiian culture was [[History of Hawaii|forced to change]]. While Europeans obsessed over exploring and later colonizing the Paciﬁc, they deﬁned the islands as specks of land in a faraway sea.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Isaiah|date=2008|title=\"Hui Nalu, Beachboys, and the Surfing Boarder-lands of Hawai'i\"|url=http://libproxy.unm.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&bquery=%26quot%3bHui+Nalu%2c+Beachboys%2c+and+the+Surfing+Boarder-lands+of+Hawai%e2%80%98I%26quot%3b%3f&type=1&searchMode=And&site=ehost-live&scope=site|journal=Contemporary Pacific|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}</ref> Western diseases spread and [[colonization]] began, plantations were built, and immigration started. Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population [[Christianity and colonialism|from their traditional beliefs into Christians]]. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.

It was not until [[Waikiki]] became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. [[Mark Twain]] attempted it but failed in 1866. [[Jack London]] tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, [[George Freeth]] and [[Duke Kahanamoku]], became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.

As the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose groups of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy [[haole]] tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories.<ref name=\":0\" /> A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there.This was  the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, and South Africa, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.<ref name=\":0\" />

In July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawananakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtweekly.com/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/936-riders-of-the-sea-spray.html|title=Riders of the Sea Spray - Santa Cruz Good Times|author=GTWebmaster|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>

}}</ref> Author [[Jack London]] wrote about the sport after having attempted surfing on his visit to the islands. Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.

Surfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.

[[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]
The anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"</blockquote>

Regardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the \"[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>

[[Surf film|Surfing documentaries]] have been one of the main ways in which [[surf culture|surfing culture]] grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.

==Professional surfing==

Defining the scope of professional surfing is difficult, because like in many [[extreme sport]]s, there is more than one model for what constitutes a professional. There are three main contemporary modes of making money purely as an active surfer: [[sponsorship]], [[World Surf League|surf contests]], and [[internet celebrity|social media influence]]. Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.

If a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching) than the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).

In 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from basic action: simply riding a good wave, to a more style oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, and artistry began to become important. Becoming even more important than catching the best wave and staying on it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.

Through numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary [[Bustin' Down the Door]] much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 year tensions arose between not only the Americans and international surfers, but between the local Hawaiians and the [[haoles]] generally.

Into the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from [[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as [[Town & Country Surf Designs]] and [[Body Glove]]. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.

==Technological innovations in surfing==

Surfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.

Much of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the [[wetsuit]]. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-[[polystyrene]] and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-[[Surfboard fin|fin]] and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until [[Tom Blake (surfer)|Tom Blake]] added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.

Much of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a [[Developed World|developed-world]] sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced [[fiberglass]] boards, quality [[wetsuit]]s, [[Off-road vehicle|offroad vehicles]], and inexpensive international [[Jet Age|travel]], surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century much of the worldwide coast line has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.
[[File:Surfboard_technology.jpg|thumb|A quiver of surfboards]]

===The Short Board Revolution===

The ancient Hawaiians had mainly three type of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 15 to 20 feet long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 6 or 7 feet long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern body board. None of these had a fin.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboads were longboards, generally 9 feet or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and shifted to lighter materials like balsa wood and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.

Throughout the decades shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surboard production boom of the 1960s the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). But often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and increasingly mid-wave turns were growing in popularity. One basic reason for longer and thicker boards generally is they paddle faster. But faster waves were also becoming more popular; waves with narrower take off zones. By the early 1970s, shortboards began rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelty but fulltime craft. So design innovation was not far behind. By the 1980s the styles have become very refined and the second large burst of surf-culture popularity in the mainstream occurred as the 3-fin, 6-foot-tall \"thruster\" shortboard began to take over. A generally narrow board with small variance in design, it almost always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and is approximately the height of the rider. This basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing it has slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.

==Style versus performance==

\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to [[skiing]] or [[skateboarding]], which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.

The variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particually \"surfing the web\" is a particular common example. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.

There are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.

==Surfing's Impact on Popular Culture==

Comparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.

In America and Australia the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early 1960s TV show, [[Gidget]]. The attention that surfing gets in the popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.

Fashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of [[boardshorts]] as swim gear for men.

==Alternatives to wind-generated waves==

Since their invention, surfers have sometimes used [[wave pools]] to attempt surfing, but generally the waves were too small and not well formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie [[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]] started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to construct wave pools specifically designed for surfing. As of 2020 there are only few around the world open to the public, but with many more currently in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: ''Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch''.

[[Wakeboarding]] is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be [[River surfing|surfable]]. At certain times of year on large rivers, [[River surfing#Tidal bores|tidal bores are surfable]]. People have also surfed alongside large [[cargo ships]] as their wakes roll into shallower water, and a few people have even surfed the waves caused by calving glaciers.
The Wave Bristol opened in The UK as an inland artificial surf site.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thewave.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8Wmho9IiozSDyOcdz-YTIiGTQMLqpaYKiWdehYiAkBxR89gaETJxykaAiKSEALw_wcB|title=The Wave|website=www.thewave.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>

The riding of [[wind waves|waves]] has likely existed since humans began swimming in the [[ocean]]. In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]]. The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].

[[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]

== Polynesian origins ==
The art of surfing, known as ''heʻe ʻana'' (''heʻe'' means ''to surf'', and ''ʻana'' is the [[Nominalization|nominalizing]] particle) in the [[Hawaiian language]], was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.

In Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied
surfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.

The sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.

== Pre-Incan Perú origins and debate ==

The practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called
\"[[Caballitos de Totora]]\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave in the world, 'Chicama,' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.

It is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.

==Ancient Hawaii==
The [[ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.

Hawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|to|18|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=10}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>

== Post-Contact Hawaii ==
After [[History of Hawaii#Contact|contact]] with the [[Western world|Western World]] Hawaiian culture was [[History of Hawaii|forced to change]]. While Europeans obsessed over exploring and later colonizing the Paciﬁc, they deﬁned the islands as specks of land in a faraway sea.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Isaiah|date=2008|title=\"Hui Nalu, Beachboys, and the Surfing Boarder-lands of Hawai'i\"|url=http://libproxy.unm.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&bquery=%26quot%3bHui+Nalu%2c+Beachboys%2c+and+the+Surfing+Boarder-lands+of+Hawai%e2%80%98I%26quot%3b%3f&type=1&searchMode=And&site=ehost-live&scope=site|journal=Contemporary Pacific|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}</ref> Western diseases spread and [[colonization]] began, plantations were built, and immigration started. Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population [[Christianity and colonialism|from their traditional beliefs into Christians]]. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.

It was not until [[Waikiki]] became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. [[Mark Twain]] attempted it but failed in 1866. [[Jack London]] tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, [[George Freeth]] and [[Duke Kahanamoku]], became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.

As the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose groups of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy [[haole]] tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories.<ref name=\":0\" /> A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there.This was  the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, and South Africa, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.<ref name=\":0\" />

In July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawananakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtweekly.com/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/936-riders-of-the-sea-spray.html|title=Riders of the Sea Spray - Santa Cruz Good Times|author=GTWebmaster|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>
In 1907 [[George Freeth]] was brought to California from Hawaii, to demonstrate surfboard riding as a publicity stunt to promote the opening of the Los Angeles-Redondo-Huntington railroad owned by [[Henry E.

Around the start of the 20th century, Hawaiians living close to [[Waikiki]] began to revive surfing, and soon re-established surfing as a sport.

}}</ref> Author [[Jack London]] wrote about the sport after having attempted surfing on his visit to the islands. Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.

Surfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.

[[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]
The anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"</blockquote>

Regardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the \"[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>

[[Surf film|Surfing documentaries]] have been one of the main ways in which [[surf culture|surfing culture]] grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.

==Professional surfing==

Defining the scope of professional surfing is difficult, because like in many [[extreme sport]]s, there is more than one model for what constitutes a professional. There are three main contemporary modes of making money purely as an active surfer: [[sponsorship]], [[World Surf League|surf contests]], and [[internet celebrity|social media influence]]. Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.

If a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching) than the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).

In 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from basic action: simply riding a good wave, to a more style oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, and artistry began to become important. Becoming even more important than catching the best wave and staying on it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.

Through numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary [[Bustin' Down the Door]] much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 year tensions arose between not only the Americans and international surfers, but between the local Hawaiians and the [[haoles]] generally.

Into the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from [[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as [[Town & Country Surf Designs]] and [[Body Glove]]. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.

==Technological innovations in surfing==

Surfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.

Much of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the [[wetsuit]]. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-[[polystyrene]] and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-[[Surfboard fin|fin]] and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until [[Tom Blake (surfer)|Tom Blake]] added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.

Much of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a [[Developed World|developed-world]] sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced [[fiberglass]] boards, quality [[wetsuit]]s, [[Off-road vehicle|offroad vehicles]], and inexpensive international [[Jet Age|travel]], surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century much of the worldwide coast line has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.
[[File:Surfboard_technology.jpg|thumb|A quiver of surfboards]]

===The Short Board Revolution===

The ancient Hawaiians had mainly three type of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 15 to 20 feet long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 6 or 7 feet long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern body board. None of these had a fin.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboads were longboards, generally 9 feet or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and shifted to lighter materials like balsa wood and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.

Throughout the decades shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surboard production boom of the 1960s the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). But often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and increasingly mid-wave turns were growing in popularity. One basic reason for longer and thicker boards generally is they paddle faster. But faster waves were also becoming more popular; waves with narrower take off zones. By the early 1970s, shortboards began rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelty but fulltime craft. So design innovation was not far behind. By the 1980s the styles have become very refined and the second large burst of surf-culture popularity in the mainstream occurred as the 3-fin, 6-foot-tall \"thruster\" shortboard began to take over. A generally narrow board with small variance in design, it almost always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and is approximately the height of the rider. This basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing it has slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.

==Style versus performance==

\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to [[skiing]] or [[skateboarding]], which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.

The variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particually \"surfing the web\" is a particular common example. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.

There are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.

==Surfing's Impact on Popular Culture==

Comparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.

In America and Australia the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early 1960s TV show, [[Gidget]]. The attention that surfing gets in the popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.

Fashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of [[boardshorts]] as swim gear for men.

==Alternatives to wind-generated waves==

Since their invention, surfers have sometimes used [[wave pools]] to attempt surfing, but generally the waves were too small and not well formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie [[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]] started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to construct wave pools specifically designed for surfing. As of 2020 there are only few around the world open to the public, but with many more currently in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: ''Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch''.

[[Wakeboarding]] is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be [[River surfing|surfable]]. At certain times of year on large rivers, [[River surfing#Tidal bores|tidal bores are surfable]]. People have also surfed alongside large [[cargo ships]] as their wakes roll into shallower water, and a few people have even surfed the waves caused by calving glaciers.
The Wave Bristol opened in The UK as an inland artificial surf site.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thewave.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8Wmho9IiozSDyOcdz-YTIiGTQMLqpaYKiWdehYiAkBxR89gaETJxykaAiKSEALw_wcB|title=The Wave|website=www.thewave.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>

The '''Nacionalista Party''' ({{lang-fil|Partido Nacionalista}}) is the oldest [[political party]] in the [[Philippines]] and in [[Southeast Asia]], responsible for leading the country throughout the majority of the 20th century since its founding in 1907, being the ruling party from 1935 to 1946 (under Presidents [[Manuel Quezon]] and [[Sergio Osmeña]]), 1953–1961 (under Presidents [[Ramon Magsaysay]] and [[Carlos P. Garcia]]) and 1965–1972 (under President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]).

==Ideology==
The Nacionalista Party was initially created as a [[Filipino nationalist]] party that supported [[Philippine independence]] until 1946 when the [[United States]] [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|granted independence to the country]].<ref name= \"Neoliberalism\"/><ref name=\"Liow\"/><ref name=\"cen\"/> Since then, many scholarly articles that dealt with the history of political parties during the [[Third Republic of the Philippines|Third Republic]] agreed that the party has been increasingly [[populist]],<ref name=\"bertrand\"/><ref name=\"berneo\"/><ref name=\"cen\">Celoza, A.

The populist ideology of the party remained to present day as described on their website.

==History==
The original Nacionalista Party that was founded on August 21, 1901 in Calle Gunao, Quiapo, Manila, was forgotten. In that Quiapo Assembly, the following officers of the true Nacionalista were elected, namely Santiago Álvarez and Pascual Poblete as presidents; Andres Villanueva, vice president; Macario Sakay, secretary general; Francisco Carreón, Alejandro Santiago, Domingo Moriones, Águedo del Rosario, Cenón Nicdao, Nicolás Rivera, Salustiano Santiago, Aurelio Tolentino, Pantaleón Torres, Valentín Diza, Briccio Pantas, Lope K. Santos, Pío H. Santos, Salustiano Cruz, Valentín Solís and José Palma.

The party began as the country's vehicle for independence, through the building of a modern nation-state and the advocacy of efficient self-rule, dominating the [[Philippine Assembly]] (1907–1916), the [[Philippine Legislature]] (1916–1935) and the pre-war years of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] (1935–1941). During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], political parties were replaced by the [[KALIBAPI]].

By the second half of the century, the party was one of the main political contenders for leadership in the country in competition with the Liberals and the Progressives during the decades between the devastation of World War II and the violent suppression of partisan politics of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship.

In 1978, in a throwback to the Japanese occupation, political parties were asked to merge into the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]], although the Nacionalistas preferred to go into hibernation. Eventually, the party was revived during the late 1980s and early 1990s by the Laurel family, which has dominated the party since the 1950s. The Nacionalista Party is now being led by party president and former Seanator [[Manuel Villar]] and had three vice presidential candidates running independently or in tandem with other political parties ([[Alan Peter Cayetano]], [[Bongbong Marcos]] and [[Antonio Trillanes]]) in the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 general elections]]. Two of the other present parties, the Liberal Party and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], are breakaways from the Nacionalista Party.<ref name=\"Neoliberalism\">Dayley, Robert (2016).

==Controversy over dominant-minority status==

In the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 general election]], the Nacionalista and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]] (NPC) formed an alliance after it was approved by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) on April 12, 2010.<ref name=\"SunStar\">{{cite web|title=NP-NPC coalition formally granted (5:15 p.m.)|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/network/np-npc-coalition-formally-granted-515-pm|work=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]|last=Alvarez|first=Kathrina|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=15 April 2010}}</ref> The Nacionalistas fielded Senator [[Manuel Villar]] and running with fellow Senator [[Loren Legarda]] who is a member of the NPC. It became the dominant minority party after a resolution passed by the COMELEC. On April 21, 2010, it was blocked by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] after a suit filed by the rival [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]].<ref name=\"SunStar\"/> On May 6, 2010, the Supreme Court nullified the merger and therefore giving the Liberal Party to be the dominant minority party. It was based on a resolution by the COMELEC giving political parties to be accredited by August 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=SC nullifies NP-NPC coalition|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20100506-268401/SC-nullifies-NP-NPC-coalition|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|last=Torres|first=Tetch|date=6 May 2010|accessdate=9 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509162019/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20100506-268401/SC-nullifies-NP-NPC-coalition|archive-date=May 9, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The coalition was made to help the Nacionalista Party to help boost the presidential campaign of Senator Villar and have a chance to be the dominant minority party by the COMELEC which give the rights to poll watchers during the canvassing of votes.<ref name=\"Maragay\">{{cite web|title=NP-NPC coalition complicates fight in the local level|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/network/np-npc-coalition-formally-granted-515-pm|work=[[Manila Standard Today]]|last=Maragay|first=Fel V.|date=1 March 2010|accessdate=15 April 2010}}</ref> However, it is being challenged by the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] calls the said alliance a bogus alliance and they are seeking the same party status by the COMELEC.<ref name=\"SunStar\"/> Several local races are also being challenged from both parties, therefore causing confusion in those races.<ref name=\"Maragay\"/>

The '''Nacionalista Party''' ({{lang-fil|Partido Nacionalista}}) is the oldest [[political party]] in the [[Philippines]] and in [[Southeast Asia]], responsible for leading the country throughout the majority of the 20th century since its founding in 1907, being the ruling party from 1935 to 1946 (under Presidents [[Manuel Quezon]] and [[Sergio Osmeña]]), 1953–1961 (under Presidents [[Ramon Magsaysay]] and [[Carlos P. Garcia]]) and 1965–1972 (under President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]).

==Ideology==
The Nacionalista Party was initially created as a [[Filipino nationalist]] party that supported [[Philippine independence]] until 1946 when the [[United States]] [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|granted independence to the country]].<ref name= \"Neoliberalism\"/><ref name=\"Liow\"/><ref name=\"cen\"/> Since then, many scholarly articles that dealt with the history of political parties during the [[Third Republic of the Philippines|Third Republic]] agreed that the party has been increasingly [[populist]],<ref name=\"bertrand\"/><ref name=\"berneo\"/><ref name=\"cen\">Celoza, A.

The populist ideology of the party remained to present day as described on their website.

==History==
The original Nacionalista Party that was founded on August 21, 1901 in Calle Gunao, Quiapo, Manila, was forgotten. In that Quiapo Assembly, the following officers of the true Nacionalista were elected, namely Santiago Álvarez and Pascual Poblete as presidents; Andres Villanueva, vice president; Macario Sakay, secretary general; Francisco Carreón, Alejandro Santiago, Domingo Moriones, Águedo del Rosario, Cenón Nicdao, Nicolás Rivera, Salustiano Santiago, Aurelio Tolentino, Pantaleón Torres, Valentín Diza, Briccio Pantas, Lope K. Santos, Pío H. Santos, Salustiano Cruz, Valentín Solís and José Palma.

The party began as the country's vehicle for independence, through the building of a modern nation-state and the advocacy of efficient self-rule, dominating the [[Philippine Assembly]] (1907–1916), the [[Philippine Legislature]] (1916–1935) and the pre-war years of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] (1935–1941). During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], political parties were replaced by the [[KALIBAPI]].

By the second half of the century, the party was one of the main political contenders for leadership in the country in competition with the Liberals and the Progressives during the decades between the devastation of World War II and the violent suppression of partisan politics of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship.

In 1978, in a throwback to the Japanese occupation, political parties were asked to merge into the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]], although the Nacionalistas preferred to go into hibernation. Eventually, the party was revived during the late 1980s and early 1990s by the Laurel family, which has dominated the party since the 1950s. The Nacionalista Party is now being led by party president and former Seanator [[Manuel Villar]] and had three vice presidential candidates running independently or in tandem with other political parties ([[Alan Peter Cayetano]], [[Bongbong Marcos]] and [[Antonio Trillanes]]) in the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 general elections]]. Two of the other present parties, the Liberal Party and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], are breakaways from the Nacionalista Party.<ref name=\"Neoliberalism\">Dayley, Robert (2016).

==Controversy over dominant-minority status==

In the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 general election]], the Nacionalista and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]] (NPC) formed an alliance after it was approved by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) on April 12, 2010.<ref name=\"SunStar\">{{cite web|title=NP-NPC coalition formally granted (5:15 p.m.)|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/network/np-npc-coalition-formally-granted-515-pm|work=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]|last=Alvarez|first=Kathrina|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=15 April 2010}}</ref> The Nacionalistas fielded Senator [[Manuel Villar]] and running with fellow Senator [[Loren Legarda]] who is a member of the NPC. It became the dominant minority party after a resolution passed by the COMELEC. On April 21, 2010, it was blocked by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] after a suit filed by the rival [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]].<ref name=\"SunStar\"/> On May 6, 2010, the Supreme Court nullified the merger and therefore giving the Liberal Party to be the dominant minority party. It was based on a resolution by the COMELEC giving political parties to be accredited by August 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=SC nullifies NP-NPC coalition|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20100506-268401/SC-nullifies-NP-NPC-coalition|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|last=Torres|first=Tetch|date=6 May 2010|accessdate=9 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509162019/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20100506-268401/SC-nullifies-NP-NPC-coalition|archive-date=May 9, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The coalition was made to help the Nacionalista Party to help boost the presidential campaign of Senator Villar and have a chance to be the dominant minority party by the COMELEC which give the rights to poll watchers during the canvassing of votes.<ref name=\"Maragay\">{{cite web|title=NP-NPC coalition complicates fight in the local level|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/network/np-npc-coalition-formally-granted-515-pm|work=[[Manila Standard Today]]|last=Maragay|first=Fel V.|date=1 March 2010|accessdate=15 April 2010}}</ref> However, it is being challenged by the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] calls the said alliance a bogus alliance and they are seeking the same party status by the COMELEC.<ref name=\"SunStar\"/> Several local races are also being challenged from both parties, therefore causing confusion in those races.<ref name=\"Maragay\"/>

== Music and lyrics ==
''The Big Day'' has been described by music journalists as a [[pop-rap]]<ref name=TheGuardian/> and [[gospel rap]] record.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heilman|first=Max|date=July 29, 2019|url=https://riffmagazine.com/album-reviews/chance-the-rapper-the-big-day/|title=REVIEW: Chance the Rapper’s ‘Big Day’ becomes a jubilant gospel-rap excursion|website=Riff Magazine|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref> ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW Magazine]]''{{'}}s Richard Trapunski says it \"presents a bigger and slicker version of [Chance the Rapper's] nostalgic gospel-rap sound\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Trapunski|first=Richard|date=July 29, 2019|url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/album-reviews/chance-the-rapper-the-big-day/|title=Review: The Big Day is Chance the Rapper's debut, but it suffers from the sophomore slump|newspaper=[[Now (newspaper)|NOW Magazine]]|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref> while Stephen Porzio from ''[[Hot Press]]'' says it not only features [[hip hop music|hip hop]] but also [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[soul music]].<ref name=\"HP\">{{cite magazine|last=Porzio|first=Stephen|date=August 21, 2019|url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/album-review-chance-rapper-big-day-22785794|title=Album Review: Chance The Rapper, The Big Day|magazine=[[Hot Press]]|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref>

Lyrically, the album follows Chance on his wedding day, inspired by his real-life marriage to Kirsten Corley in March 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/03/11/chance-rapper-marry-kirsten-corley-wedding/3128352002/|title=Chance The Rapper married longtime love Kirsten Corley over the weekend|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=11 March 2019|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> Its predominant theme of family is explored with most songs about Kirsten and Chance's family and children.

In the skits \"Photo Ops\" and \"4 Quarters in the Black\", comedians [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] and [[Keith David]] play wise uncle characters to highlight the multigenerational aspect of weddings.<ref name=\"P4k\"/>

''The Big Day'' was met with generally positive reviews, according to the aggregate website [[Metacritic]]. At the website, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, the album received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average score]] of 71, based on 21 reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> Aggregator [[AnyDecentMusic?]] gave it 6.8 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.<ref name=\"ADM\"/> The reception was described as \"lukewarm\" by journalists Shaad D'Souza of ''[[The Fader]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=D'Souza|first=Shaad|date=August 2, 2019|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/08/02/chance-the-rapper-zane-lowe-2019-transcript-watch-kanye-2019|title=5 takeaways from Chance The Rapper’s Zane Lowe interview|website=[[The Fader]]|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref> and [[Gothamist]]'s Ben Yakas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yakas|first=Ben|date=October 28, 2019|url=https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/videos-chance-rapper-carries-solid-snl-his-shoulders|title=Videos: Chance The Rapper Carries A Solid SNL On His Shoulders|website=[[Gothamist]]|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref>

Reviewing in July 2019, Al Horner of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described ''The Big Day'' as \"a candid, cutesy [[concept album]] based around his wedding\", believing it \"combines something old and something new, subtly expanding Chance’s sound without ever straying too far from the sentimental gospel-pop heart of his last release, ''[[Coloring Book (mixtape)|Coloring Book]]''.\"<ref name=TheGuardian/> Fred Thomas of [[AllMusic]] wrote that \"Bright, flawless production supports Chance's optimistic lyrics and cultivates an atmosphere overflowing with joy, wonder, and summery nostalgia.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Christopher Weingarten of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' concluded: \"A master lyricist, a musical omnivore, Chance and his family of producers and instrumentalists channel all the big emotions of the big day in a swirl of bliss, marital and otherwise.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> In a less enthusiastic review, Danny Schwartz of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' concluded that, \"Despite its length, ''The Big Day'' is self-contained, at least by Chance’s standards\", considering it \"narrower in emotional scope\" than the 2016 mixtape ''Coloring Book''.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Dhruva Balram of ''[[NME]]'' said it is \"a buoyant, cheerful project that looks back on his young, successful career through rose-tinted lenses but, ultimately, doesn't possess enough depth amidst a mishmash of production and features that make it too long-winded.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> 

The album and Chance received criticism from fans on social media, spawning many [[Internet meme]]s primarily about the album's focus on Chance's marriage. Some fans also had expected content reminiscent of his earlier releases and believed that the album did not meet up to said expectations, it being considered by most to be a major drop in quality for the artist. Music critic [[Anthony Fantano]] of ''The Needle Drop'' gave the album a rare zero rating out of ten and listed the album as the second worst album of 2019.<!-- Do NOT remove; per [[WP:NOTRSMUSIC]], \"Fantano is usable if his review was published by a third party\"--><ref name=\"TND\">{{Cite web|url=https://junkee.com/chance-rapper-memes/216547|title=The Internet Is Awash With Memes About Chance The Rapper Loving His Wife|website=[[Junkee]]|last=Earp|first=Joseph|date=August 2, 2019|accessdate=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dontboreus.thebrag.com/chance-the-rapper-loves-his-wife-memes-are-rolling-in/|title=Chance the Rapper loves his wife, and the memes are rolling in|website=[[The Brag Media#Don't Bore Us|Don't Bore Us]]|last=Di Iorio|first=Michael|date=August 3, 2019|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref> Chance responded on Twitter to the criticism that he believes that people want him to \"kill himself\".<ref name=\"Crit1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/im-getting-this-crazy-feeling-that-people-want-me-to-kill-myself-chance-the-rapper-on-the-big-day-fan-backlash-2535368|title=\"I'm getting this crazy feeling that people want me to kill myself\" – Chance The Rapper on 'The Big Day' fan backlash|work=NME|last=Lavin|first=Will|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Crit2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/chance-the-rapper-new-album-big-day-review-reaction-twitter-songs-track-list-a9040251.html|title=Chance the Rapper posts lengthy and emotional response to new album criticism|work=[[The Independent]]|last=Harrison|first=Ellie|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019}}</ref>

Lyrically, the album follows Chance on his wedding day, inspired by his real-life marriage to Kirsten Corley in March 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/03/11/chance-rapper-marry-kirsten-corley-wedding/3128352002/|title=Chance The Rapper married longtime love Kirsten Corley over the weekend|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=11 March 2019|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> Its predominant theme of family is explored with most songs about Kirsten and Chance's family and children. The album features contributions from his brother [[Taylor Bennett (rapper)|Taylor Bennett]], who raps on \"Roo\", and his father Ken Bennett, who helped co-write \"Eternal\". In the skits \"Photo Ops\" and \"4 Quarters in the Black\", comedians [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] and [[Keith David]] play wise uncle characters to highlight the multigenerational aspect of weddings.<ref name=\"P4k\"/>

== Artwork ==
The artwork for the album cover features a jewel encrusted clear disc, reminiscent of a wedding ring, referencing the album's wedding theme, and was created by artist [[Sara Shakeel]]. Chance the Rapper reached out to Shakeel via Instagram to commission a physical object in her unique Swarovski crystal-clad style to be photographed and used for the cover art. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iowastatedaily.com/limelight/chance-the-rapper-new-album-the-big-day/article_def98378-a8bf-11e9-892c-b3161d68e91d.html|title=Chance the Rapper reveals details about new album|last=Owens|first=Tanner|date=|website=Iowa State Daily|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> Shakeel also created artworks for the rapper's installation \"The Big Store\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/chance-the-rapper-big-day-store-art-exhibition-pop-up-shop-sara-shakeel|title=Chance the Rapper Relaunches \"The Big Store\" Pop-Up Exhibition|website=HYPEBEAST|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref>{{clear}}

''The Big Day'' was met with generally positive reviews, according to the aggregate website [[Metacritic]]. At the website, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, the album received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average score]] of 71, based on 21 reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> Aggregator [[AnyDecentMusic?]] gave it 6.8 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.<ref name=\"ADM\"/> The reception was described as \"lukewarm\" by journalists Shaad D'Souza of ''[[The Fader]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=D'Souza|first=Shaad|date=August 2, 2019|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/08/02/chance-the-rapper-zane-lowe-2019-transcript-watch-kanye-2019|title=5 takeaways from Chance The Rapper’s Zane Lowe interview|website=[[The Fader]]|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref> and [[Gothamist]]'s Ben Yakas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yakas|first=Ben|date=October 28, 2019|url=https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/videos-chance-rapper-carries-solid-snl-his-shoulders|title=Videos: Chance The Rapper Carries A Solid SNL On His Shoulders|website=[[Gothamist]]|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref>

Reviewing in July 2019, Al Horner of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described ''The Big Day'' as \"a candid, cutesy [[concept album]] based around his wedding\", believing it \"combines something old and something new, subtly expanding Chance’s sound without ever straying too far from the sentimental gospel-pop heart of his last release, ''[[Coloring Book (mixtape)|Coloring Book]]''.\"<ref name=TheGuardian/> Fred Thomas of [[AllMusic]] wrote that \"Bright, flawless production supports Chance's optimistic lyrics and cultivates an atmosphere overflowing with joy, wonder, and summery nostalgia.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Christopher Weingarten of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' concluded: \"A master lyricist, a musical omnivore, Chance and his family of producers and instrumentalists channel all the big emotions of the big day in a swirl of bliss, marital and otherwise.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> In a less enthusiastic review, Danny Schwartz of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' concluded that, \"Despite its length, ''The Big Day'' is self-contained, at least by Chance’s standards\", considering it \"narrower in emotional scope\" than the 2016 mixtape ''Coloring Book''.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Dhruva Balram of ''[[NME]]'' said it is \"a buoyant, cheerful project that looks back on his young, successful career through rose-tinted lenses but, ultimately, doesn't possess enough depth amidst a mishmash of production and features that make it too long-winded.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> 

The album and Chance received criticism from fans on social media, spawning many [[Internet meme]]s primarily about the album's focus on Chance's marriage. Some fans also had expected content reminiscent of his earlier releases and believed that the album did not meet up to said expectations, it being considered by most to be a major drop in quality for the artist. Music critic [[Anthony Fantano]] of ''The Needle Drop'' gave the album a rare zero rating out of ten and listed the album as the second worst album of 2019.<!-- Do NOT remove; per [[WP:NOTRSMUSIC]], \"Fantano is usable if his review was published by a third party\"--><ref name=\"TND\">{{Cite web|url=https://junkee.com/chance-rapper-memes/216547|title=The Internet Is Awash With Memes About Chance The Rapper Loving His Wife|website=[[Junkee]]|last=Earp|first=Joseph|date=August 2, 2019|accessdate=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dontboreus.thebrag.com/chance-the-rapper-loves-his-wife-memes-are-rolling-in/|title=Chance the Rapper loves his wife, and the memes are rolling in|website=[[The Brag Media#Don't Bore Us|Don't Bore Us]]|last=Di Iorio|first=Michael|date=August 3, 2019|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref> Chance responded on Twitter to the criticism that he believes that people want him to \"kill himself\".<ref name=\"Crit1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/im-getting-this-crazy-feeling-that-people-want-me-to-kill-myself-chance-the-rapper-on-the-big-day-fan-backlash-2535368|title=\"I'm getting this crazy feeling that people want me to kill myself\" – Chance The Rapper on 'The Big Day' fan backlash|work=NME|last=Lavin|first=Will|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Crit2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/chance-the-rapper-new-album-big-day-review-reaction-twitter-songs-track-list-a9040251.html|title=Chance the Rapper posts lengthy and emotional response to new album criticism|work=[[The Independent]]|last=Harrison|first=Ellie|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019}}</ref>

{{Short description|Basic taste}}
[[File:Strawberry shortcake.jpg|right|thumb|Sweet foods, such as this strawberry [[shortcake]], are often  for [[dessert]].]]

'''Sweetness''' is a [[basic taste]] most commonly [[Perception|perceived]] when [[eating]] [[food]]s rich in [[sugar]]s. Sweet tastes are generally regarded as [[pleasure|pleasurable]], except when in excess.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In addition to sugars like [[sucrose]], many other [[chemical compound]]s are sweet, including [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, and [[sugar alcohol]]s. Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric [[sugar substitute]]s. Such [[Sugar substitute|non-sugar sweeteners]] include [[saccharin]] and [[aspartame]]. Other compounds, such as [[miraculin]], may alter perception of sweetness itself.

The perceived intensity of sugars and high-potency sweeteners, such as aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, are heritable, with gene effect accounting for approximately 30% of the variation.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hwang LD, Zhu G, Breslin PA, Reed DR, Martin NG, Wright MJ | title=A common genetic influence on human intensity ratings of sugars and high-potency sweeteners  | journal=Twin Res Hum Genet | year=2015 | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=361–7 | doi=10.1017/thg.2015.42 | pmid=26181574 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

The [[chemoreceptor|chemosensory]] basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century. One theoretical model of sweetness is the [[#MPA theory of sweetness|multipoint attachment theory]], which involves multiple binding sites between a sweetness receptor and a sweet substance.

Studies indicate that responsiveness to sugars and sweetness has very ancient evolutionary beginnings, being manifest as [[chemotaxis]] even in [[Motility|motile]] bacteria such as ''E. coli''.<ref>Blass, E.M.

==Examples of sweet substances==
{{Further|Sugar substitute}}

A great diversity of [[chemical compound]]s, such as Aditya Singh Gair and Vasu Gaur, are sweet. Among common biological substances, all of the simple [[carbohydrate]]s are sweet to at least some degree. [[Sucrose]] (table sugar) is the prototypical example of a sweet substance. Sucrose in solution has a sweetness perception rating of 1, and other substances are rated relative to this.<ref name=Guyton91>{{cite book |author=Guyton, Arthur C. |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |edition=8th }}</ref> For example, another sugar, [[fructose]], is somewhat sweeter, being rated at 1.7 times the sweetness of sucrose.<ref name=Guyton91/>  Some of the [[amino acid]]s are mildly sweet: [[alanine]], [[glycine]], and [[serine]] are the sweetest. Some other amino acids are perceived as both sweet and bitter.

The sweetness of 20% solution of glycine in water compares to a solution of 10% glucose or 5% fructose.<ref>{{Citation|last=DuBois|first=Grant E.|title=Concentration—Response Relationships of Sweeteners: A Systematic Study|date=1991-12-31|work=Sweeteners|volume=450|pages=261–276|editor-last=Walters|editor-first=D.

A number of plant species produce [[glycosides]] that are sweet at concentrations much lower than common sugars. The most well-known example is [[glycyrrhizin]], the sweet component of [[licorice]] root, which is about 30 times sweeter than sucrose. Another commercially important example is [[stevioside]], from the [[South America]]n shrub ''[[Stevia]] rebaudiana''. It is roughly 250 times sweeter than sucrose. Another class of potent natural sweeteners are the sweet proteins such as [[thaumatin]], found in the [[West Africa]]n [[katemfe]] fruit. Hen egg [[lysozyme]], an [[antibiotic]] protein found in [[chicken egg]]s, is also sweet.

Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies. Such variations may arise from a range of methodological variables, from sampling to analysis and interpretation. Indeed, the taste index of 1, assigned to reference substances such as sucrose (for sweetness), hydrochloric acid (for sourness), quinine (for bitterness), and sodium chloride (for saltiness), is itself arbitrary for practical purposes.<ref name=Guyton&Hall2006/> Some values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation.

Even some [[inorganic compound]]s are sweet, including [[beryllium chloride]] and [[lead(II) acetate]]. The latter may have contributed to [[lead poisoning]] among the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] aristocracy: the Roman delicacy ''sapa'' was prepared by boiling soured [[wine]] (containing [[acetic acid]]) in lead pots.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Couper RTL. |title=The Severe Gout of Emperor Charles V |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2006 |volume=355 |issue=18 |pages=1935–36 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc062352 |pmid=17079773 |last2=Fernandez |first2=P. L. |last3=Alonso |first3=P. L. |ref=harv}}</ref>

Hundreds of synthetic organic compounds are known to be sweet, but only a few of these are legally permitted{{Fix|text=where?}} as food additives. For example, [[chloroform]], [[nitrobenzene]], and [[ethylene glycol]] are sweet, but also toxic. [[Saccharin]], [[cyclamate]], [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame potassium]], [[sucralose]], [[alitame]], and [[neotame]] are commonly used.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==Sweetness modifiers==
[[File:Boys Pilfering Molasses by George Henry Hall.jpg|thumb|left|''Boys [[Pilfer]]ing [[Molasses]] – On The Quays, [[New Orleans]]'', 1853 painting by [[George Henry Hall (artist)|George Henry Hall]]]]

A few substances alter the way sweet taste is perceived.  One class of these inhibits the perception of sweet tastes, whether from sugars or from highly potent sweeteners. Commercially, the most important of these is [[lactisole]],<ref name=\"Kinghorn-book3\">Kinghorn, A.D. and Compadre, C.M. Alternative Sweeteners: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded, Marcel Dekker ed., New York, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8247-0437-1}}</ref> a compound produced by [[Domino Sugar]].  It is used in some [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jellies]] and other fruit preserves to bring out their fruit flavors by suppressing their otherwise strong sweetness.

Two natural products have been documented to have similar sweetness-inhibiting properties: [[gymnemic acid]], extracted from the leaves of the [[India]]n vine ''[[Gymnema sylvestre]]'' and [[ziziphin]], from the leaves of the Chinese [[jujube]] (''Ziziphus jujuba'').<ref name=\"crfsn-32-231\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10408399209527598 |author=Kurihara Y |title=Characteristics of antisweet substances, sweet proteins, and sweetness-inducing proteins |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=231–52 |year=1992 |pmid=1418601 }}</ref>  Gymnemic acid has been widely promoted within [[herbal medicine]] as a treatment for sugar cravings and [[diabetes mellitus]].

On the other hand, two plant proteins, [[miraculin]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.161.3847.1241 |vauthors=Kurihara K, Beidler LM |title=Taste-Modifying Protein from Miracle Fruit |journal=Science |volume=161 |issue=3847 |pages=1241–3 |year=1968 |pmid=5673432 |df= }}</ref> and [[curculin]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/20.2.239 |vauthors=Yamashita H, Akabane T, Kurihara Y |title=Activity and stability of a new sweet protein with taste-modifying action, curculin |journal=Chem.

Once the tongue has been exposed to either of these proteins, sourness is perceived as sweetness for up to an hour afterwards.  While curculin has some innate sweet taste of its own, miraculin is by itself quite tasteless.

==The sweetness receptor==
[[File:Gray1018.png|right|thumb|Sweetness is perceived by the taste buds.]]
Despite the wide variety of chemical substances known to be sweet, and knowledge that the ability to perceive sweet taste must reside in [[taste bud]]s on the [[tongue]], the biomolecular mechanism of sweet taste was sufficiently elusive that as recently as the 1990s, there was some doubt whether any single \"sweetness receptor\" actually exists.

The breakthrough for the present understanding of sweetness occurred in 2001, when experiments with [[laboratory mice]] showed that mice possessing different versions of the [[gene]] T1R3 prefer sweet foods to different extents. Subsequent research has shown that the [[TAS1R3|T1R3 protein]] forms a complex with a related protein, called [[TAS1R2|T1R2]], to form a [[G-protein coupled receptor]] that is the sweetness receptor in mammals.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Li XD, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title=Human receptors for sweet and umami taste  | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | year=2002 | volume=99 | pages=4692–6 | doi=10.1073/pnas.072090199 | pmid=11917125 | issue=7 | pmc=123709}}</ref>

Human studies have shown that sweet taste receptors are not only found in the tongue, but also in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract as well as the nasal epithelium, pancreatic islet cells, sperm and testes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kohno|first=Daisuke|date=2017-04-04|title=Sweet taste receptor in the hypothalamus: a potential new player in glucose sensing in the hypothalamus|journal=The Journal of Physiological Sciences|volume=67|issue=4|pages=459–465|doi=10.1007/s12576-017-0535-y|pmid=28378265|issn=1880-6546}}</ref> It is proposed that the presence of sweet taste receptors in the GI tract controls the feeling of hunger and satiety.

Another research has shown that the threshold of sweet taste perception is in direct correlation with the time of day. This is believed to be the consequence of oscillating [[leptin]] levels in blood that may impact the overall sweetness of food. Scientists hypothesize that this is an evolutionary relict of diurnal animals like humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Y.|last2=Sanematsu|first2=K.|last3=Ohta|first3=R.|last4=Shirosaki|first4=S.|last5=Koyano|first5=K.|last6=Nonaka|first6=K.|last7=Shigemura|first7=N.|last8=Ninomiya|first8=Y.|date=2008-07-15|title=Diurnal Variation of Human Sweet Taste Recognition Thresholds Is Correlated With Plasma Leptin Levels|journal=Diabetes|volume=57|issue=10|pages=2661–2665|doi=10.2337/db07-1103|pmid=18633111|pmc=2551675|issn=0012-1797}}</ref>

Sweetness perception may differ between species significantly.  For example, even amongst the [[primate]]s sweetness is quite variable. [[New World monkey]]s do not find [[aspartame]] sweet, while [[Old World monkey]]s and [[ape]]s (including humans) all do.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/chemse/20.5.573 | last1 = Nofre | first1 = C. | last2 = Tinti | first2 = J.

The ability to taste sweetness often atrophies genetically in species of carnivores who do not eat sweet foods like fruits, including [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s and [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]]s.

==Sweet receptor pathway==
To depolarize the cell, and ultimately generate a response, the body uses different cells in the taste bud that each express a receptor for the perception of sweet, sour, salty, bitter or [[umami]]. Downstream of the [[taste receptor]], the taste cells for sweet, bitter and umami share the same intracellular signalling pathway.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chaudhari|first1=N|last2=Roper|first2=SD|title=The cell biology of taste.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=9 August 2010|volume=190|issue=3|pages=285–96|pmid=20696704|doi=10.1083/jcb.201003144|pmc=2922655}}</ref> Incoming sweet molecules bind to their receptors, which causes a conformational change in the molecule. This change activates the G-protein, gustducin, which in turn activates [[PLCB2|phospholipase C]] to generate inositol trisphosphate ([[Inositol trisphosphate|IP<sub>3</sub>]]), this subsequently opens the IP<sub>3</sub>-receptor and induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This increase in intracellular calcium activates the [[TRPM5]] channel and induces cellular [[depolarization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Philippaert|first1=Koenraad|last2=Pironet|first2=Andy|last3=Mesuere|first3=Margot|last4=Sones|first4=William|last5=Vermeiren|first5=Laura|last6=Kerselaers|first6=Sara|last7=Pinto|first7=Sílvia|last8=Segal|first8=Andrei|last9=Antoine|first9=Nancy|last10=Gysemans|first10=Conny|last11=Laureys|first11=Jos|last12=Lemaire|first12=Katleen|last13=Gilon|first13=Patrick|last14=Cuypers|first14=Eva|last15=Tytgat|first15=Jan|last16=Mathieu|first16=Chantal|last17=Schuit|first17=Frans|last18=Rorsman|first18=Patrik|last19=Talavera|first19=Karel|last20=Voets|first20=Thomas|last21=Vennekens|first21=Rudi|title=Steviol glycosides enhance pancreatic beta-cell function and taste sensation by potentiation of TRPM5 channel activity|journal=Nature Communications|date=31 March 2017|volume=8|pages=14733|doi=10.1038/ncomms14733|pmid=28361903|pmc=5380970}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=YA|last2=Roper|first2=SD|title=Intracellular Ca(2+) and TRPM5-mediated membrane depolarization produce ATP secretion from taste receptor cells.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=1 July 2010|volume=588|issue=Pt 13|pages=2343–50|pmid=20498227|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2010.191106|pmc=2915511}}</ref> The [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] release channel [[CALHM1]] gets activated by the depolarization and releases ATP neurotransmitter which activates the afferent [[neuron]]s innervating the taste bud.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taruno|first1=A|last2=Vingtdeux|first2=V|last3=Ohmoto|first3=M|last4=Ma|first4=Z|last5=Dvoryanchikov|first5=G|last6=Li|first6=A|last7=Adrien|first7=L|last8=Zhao|first8=H|last9=Leung|first9=S|last10=Abernethy|first10=M|last11=Koppel|first11=J|last12=Davies|first12=P|last13=Civan|first13=MM|last14=Chaudhari|first14=N|last15=Matsumoto|first15=I|last16=Hellekant|first16=G|last17=Tordoff|first17=MG|last18=Marambaud|first18=P|last19=Foskett|first19=JK|title=CALHM1 ion channel mediates purinergic neurotransmission of sweet, bitter and umami tastes.|journal=Nature|date=14 March 2013|volume=495|issue=7440|pages=223–6|pmid=23467090|doi=10.1038/nature11906|pmc=3600154}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Z|last2=Siebert|first2=AP|last3=Cheung|first3=KH|last4=Lee|first4=RJ|last5=Johnson|first5=B|last6=Cohen|first6=AS|last7=Vingtdeux|first7=V|last8=Marambaud|first8=P|last9=Foskett|first9=JK|title=Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is the pore-forming subunit of an ion channel that mediates extracellular Ca2+ regulation of neuronal excitability.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=10 July 2012|volume=109|issue=28|pages=E1963–71|pmid=22711817|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204023109|pmc=3396471}}</ref>

==Historical theories==
[[File:Lugduname.svg|left|thumb|[[Lugduname]] is the sweetest chemical known.]]
The development of [[organic chemistry]] in the 19th century introduced many new chemical compounds and the means to determine their [[molecular structure]]s.  Early organic chemists tasted many of their products, either intentionally (as a means of characterization) or accidentally (due to poor laboratory [[hygiene]]).  One of the first attempts to draw systematic correlations between molecules' structures and their tastes was made by a German chemist, Georg Cohn, in 1914.  He hypothesized that to evoke a certain taste, a molecule must contain some structural motif (called a ''sapophore'') that produces that taste. With regard to sweetness, he noted that molecules containing multiple [[hydroxyl]] groups and those containing [[chlorine]] atoms are often sweet, and that among a series of structurally similar compounds, those with smaller [[molecular weight]]s were often sweeter than the larger compounds.

In 1919, Oertly and Myers proposed a more elaborate theory based on a then-current theory of [[color]] in synthetic [[dye]]s.  They hypothesized that to be sweet, a compound must contain one each of two classes of structural motif, a ''glucophore'' and an ''auxogluc''.  Based on those compounds known to be sweet at the time, they proposed a list of six candidate glucophores and nine auxoglucs.

From these beginnings in the early 20th century, the theory of sweetness enjoyed little further academic attention until 1963, when [[Robert Shallenberger]] and [[Terry Acree]] proposed the AH-B theory of sweetness.  Simply put, they proposed that to be sweet, a compound must contain a [[hydrogen bond]] [[Electron donor|donor]] (AH) and a [[Lewis base]] (B) separated by about 0.3 [[nanometre]]s.  According to this theory, the AH-B unit of a sweetener binds with a corresponding AH-B unit on the biological sweetness receptor to produce the sensation of sweetness.

B-X theory proposed by [[Lemont Kier]] in 1972.  While previous researchers had noted that among some groups of compounds, there seemed to be a correlation between [[hydrophobicity]] and sweetness, this theory formalized these observations by proposing that to be sweet, a compound must have a third binding site (labeled X) that could interact with a hydrophobic site on the sweetness receptor via [[London dispersion force]]s.  Later researchers have statistically analyzed the distances between the presumed AH, B, and X sites in several families of sweet substances to estimate the distances between these interaction sites on the sweetness receptor.

==MPA theory==
The most elaborate theory of sweetness to date is the multipoint attachment theory (MPA) proposed by [[Jean-Marie Tinti]] and [[Claude Nofre]] in 1991.  This theory involves a total of eight interaction sites between a sweetener and the sweetness receptor, although not all sweeteners interact with all eight sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2008|title=Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Sweetness|journal=Chemosensory Perception|volume=1|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1007/s12078-007-9003-z|pmid=|author=John E. Hayes}}</ref>  This model has successfully directed efforts aimed at finding highly potent sweeteners, including the most potent family of sweeteners known to date, the [[guanidine]] sweeteners.  The most potent of these, [[lugduname]], is about 225,000 times sweeter than sucrose.

'''Sweetness''' is a [[basic taste]] most commonly [[Perception|perceived]] when [[eating]] [[food]]s rich in [[sugar]]s. Sweet tastes are generally regarded as [[pleasure|pleasurable]], except when in excess.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In addition to sugars like [[sucrose]], many other [[chemical compound]]s are sweet, including [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, and [[sugar alcohol]]s. Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric [[sugar substitute]]s. Such [[Sugar substitute|non-sugar sweeteners]] include [[saccharin]] and [[aspartame]]. Other compounds, such as [[miraculin]], may alter perception of sweetness itself.

The perceived intensity of sugars and high-potency sweeteners, such as aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, are heritable, with gene effect accounting for approximately 30% of the variation.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hwang LD, Zhu G, Breslin PA, Reed DR, Martin NG, Wright MJ | title=A common genetic influence on human intensity ratings of sugars and high-potency sweeteners  | journal=Twin Res Hum Genet | year=2015 | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=361–7 | doi=10.1017/thg.2015.42 | pmid=26181574 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

The [[chemoreceptor|chemosensory]] basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century. One theoretical model of sweetness is the [[#MPA theory of sweetness|multipoint attachment theory]], which involves multiple binding sites between a sweetness receptor and a sweet substance.

==Examples of sweet substances==
{{Further|Sugar substitute}}

A great diversity of [[chemical compound]]s, such as [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, are sweet. Among common biological substances, all of the simple [[carbohydrate]]s are sweet to at least some degree. [[Sucrose]] (table sugar) is the prototypical example of a sweet substance. Sucrose in solution has a sweetness perception rating of 1, and other substances are rated relative to this.<ref name=Guyton91>{{cite book |author=Guyton, Arthur C. |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |edition=8th }}</ref> For example, another sugar, [[fructose]], is somewhat sweeter, being rated at 1.7 times the sweetness of sucrose.<ref name=Guyton91/>  Some of the [[amino acid]]s are mildly sweet: [[alanine]], [[glycine]], and [[serine]] are the sweetest. Some other amino acids are perceived as both sweet and bitter.

The sweetness of 20% solution of glycine in water compares to a solution of 10% glucose or 5% fructose.<ref>{{Citation|last=DuBois|first=Grant E.|title=Concentration—Response Relationships of Sweeteners: A Systematic Study|date=1991-12-31|work=Sweeteners|volume=450|pages=261–276|editor-last=Walters|editor-first=D.

A number of plant species produce [[glycosides]] that are sweet at concentrations much lower than common sugars. The most well-known example is [[glycyrrhizin]], the sweet component of [[licorice]] root, which is about 30 times sweeter than sucrose. Another commercially important example is [[stevioside]], from the [[South America]]n shrub ''[[Stevia]] rebaudiana''. It is roughly 250 times sweeter than sucrose. Another class of potent natural sweeteners are the sweet proteins such as [[thaumatin]], found in the [[West Africa]]n [[katemfe]] fruit.

Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies. Such variations may arise from a range of methodological variables, from sampling to analysis and interpretation. Indeed, the taste index of 1, assigned to reference substances such as sucrose (for sweetness), hydrochloric acid (for sourness), quinine (for bitterness), and sodium chloride (for saltiness), is itself arbitrary for practical purposes.<ref name=Guyton&Hall2006/> Some values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation.

Even some [[inorganic compound]]s are sweet, including [[beryllium chloride]] and [[lead(II) acetate]]. The latter may have contributed to [[lead poisoning]] among the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] aristocracy: the Roman delicacy ''sapa'' was prepared by boiling soured [[wine]] (containing [[acetic acid]]) in lead pots.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Couper RTL. |title=The Severe Gout of Emperor Charles V |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2006 |volume=355 |issue=18 |pages=1935–36 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc062352 |pmid=17079773 |last2=Fernandez |first2=P.

Hundreds of synthetic organic compounds are known to be sweet, but only a few of these are legally permitted{{Fix|text=where?}} as food additives. For example, [[chloroform]], [[nitrobenzene]], and [[ethylene glycol]] are sweet, but also toxic. [[Saccharin]], [[cyclamate]], [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame potassium]], [[sucralose]], [[alitame]], and [[neotame]] are commonly used.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==Sweetness modifiers==

A few substances alter the way sweet taste is perceived.  One class of these inhibits the perception of sweet tastes, whether from sugars or from highly potent sweeteners. Commercially, the most important of these is [[lactisole]],<ref name=\"Kinghorn-book3\">Kinghorn, A.D. and Compadre, C.M. Alternative Sweeteners: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded, Marcel Dekker ed., New York, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8247-0437-1}}</ref> a compound produced by [[Domino Sugar]].  It is used in some [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jellies]] and other fruit preserves to bring out their fruit flavors by suppressing their otherwise strong sweetness.

Two natural products have been documented to have similar sweetness-inhibiting properties: [[gymnemic acid]], extracted from the leaves of the [[India]]n vine ''[[Gymnema sylvestre]]'' and [[ziziphin]], from the leaves of the Chinese [[jujube]] (''Ziziphus jujuba'').<ref name=\"crfsn-32-231\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10408399209527598 |author=Kurihara Y |title=Characteristics of antisweet substances, sweet proteins, and sweetness-inducing proteins |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=231–52 |year=1992 |pmid=1418601 }}</ref>  Gymnemic acid has been widely promoted within [[herbal medicine]] as a treatment for sugar cravings and [[diabetes mellitus]].

On the other hand, two plant proteins, [[miraculin]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.161.3847.1241 |vauthors=Kurihara K, Beidler LM |title=Taste-Modifying Protein from Miracle Fruit |journal=Science |volume=161 |issue=3847 |pages=1241–3 |year=1968 |pmid=5673432 |df= }}</ref> and [[curculin]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/20.2.239 |vauthors=Yamashita H, Akabane T, Kurihara Y |title=Activity and stability of a new sweet protein with taste-modifying action, curculin |journal=Chem.

Once the tongue has been exposed to either of these proteins, sourness is perceived as sweetness for up to an hour afterwards.  While curculin has some innate sweet taste of its own, miraculin is by itself quite tasteless.

==The sweetness receptor==
[[File:Gray1018.png|right|thumb|Sweetness is perceived by the taste buds.]]
Despite the wide variety of chemical substances known to be sweet, and knowledge that the ability to perceive sweet taste must reside in [[taste bud]]s on the [[tongue]], the biomolecular mechanism of sweet taste was sufficiently elusive that as recently as the 1990s, there was some doubt whether any single \"sweetness receptor\" actually exists.

The breakthrough for the present understanding of sweetness occurred in 2001, when experiments with [[laboratory mice]] showed that mice possessing different versions of the [[gene]] T1R3 prefer sweet foods to different extents. Subsequent research has shown that the [[TAS1R3|T1R3 protein]] forms a complex with a related protein, called [[TAS1R2|T1R2]], to form a [[G-protein coupled receptor]] that is the sweetness receptor in mammals.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Li XD, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title=Human receptors for sweet and umami taste  | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | year=2002 | volume=99 | pages=4692–6 | doi=10.1073/pnas.072090199 | pmid=11917125 | issue=7 | pmc=123709}}</ref>

Human studies have shown that sweet taste receptors are not only found in the tongue, but also in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract as well as the nasal epithelium, pancreatic islet cells, sperm and testes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kohno|first=Daisuke|date=2017-04-04|title=Sweet taste receptor in the hypothalamus: a potential new player in glucose sensing in the hypothalamus|journal=The Journal of Physiological Sciences|volume=67|issue=4|pages=459–465|doi=10.1007/s12576-017-0535-y|pmid=28378265|issn=1880-6546}}</ref> It is proposed that the presence of sweet taste receptors in the GI tract controls the feeling of hunger and satiety.

Another research has shown that the threshold of sweet taste perception is in direct correlation with the time of day. This is believed to be the consequence of oscillating [[leptin]] levels in blood that may impact the overall sweetness of food. Scientists hypothesize that this is an evolutionary relict of diurnal animals like humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Y.|last2=Sanematsu|first2=K.|last3=Ohta|first3=R.|last4=Shirosaki|first4=S.|last5=Koyano|first5=K.|last6=Nonaka|first6=K.|last7=Shigemura|first7=N.|last8=Ninomiya|first8=Y.|date=2008-07-15|title=Diurnal Variation of Human Sweet Taste Recognition Thresholds Is Correlated With Plasma Leptin Levels|journal=Diabetes|volume=57|issue=10|pages=2661–2665|doi=10.2337/db07-1103|pmid=18633111|pmc=2551675|issn=0012-1797}}</ref>

Sweetness perception may differ between species significantly.  For example, even amongst the [[primate]]s sweetness is quite variable. [[New World monkey]]s do not find [[aspartame]] sweet, while [[Old World monkey]]s and [[ape]]s (including humans) all do.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/chemse/20.5.573 | last1 = Nofre | first1 = C. | last2 = Tinti | first2 = J.

The ability to taste sweetness often atrophies genetically in species of carnivores who do not eat sweet foods like fruits, including [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s and [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]]s.

==Sweet receptor pathway==
To depolarize the cell, and ultimately generate a response, the body uses different cells in the taste bud that each express a receptor for the perception of sweet, sour, salty, bitter or [[umami]]. Downstream of the [[taste receptor]], the taste cells for sweet, bitter and umami share the same intracellular signalling pathway.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chaudhari|first1=N|last2=Roper|first2=SD|title=The cell biology of taste.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=9 August 2010|volume=190|issue=3|pages=285–96|pmid=20696704|doi=10.1083/jcb.201003144|pmc=2922655}}</ref> Incoming sweet molecules bind to their receptors, which causes a conformational change in the molecule. This change activates the G-protein, gustducin, which in turn activates [[PLCB2|phospholipase C]] to generate inositol trisphosphate ([[Inositol trisphosphate|IP<sub>3</sub>]]), this subsequently opens the IP<sub>3</sub>-receptor and induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum.

The [[color]] of food can affect sweetness perception. Adding more red color to a drink increases its perceived sweetness.

==Historical theories==
[[File:Lugduname.svg|left|thumb|[[Lugduname]] is the sweetest chemical known.]]
The development of [[organic chemistry]] in the 19th century introduced many new chemical compounds and the means to determine their [[molecular structure]]s.  Early organic chemists tasted many of their products, either intentionally (as a means of characterization) or accidentally (due to poor laboratory [[hygiene]]).  One of the first attempts to draw systematic correlations between molecules' structures and their tastes was made by a German chemist, Georg Cohn, in 1914.  He hypothesized that to evoke a certain taste, a molecule must contain some structural motif (called a ''sapophore'') that produces that taste. With regard to sweetness, he noted that molecules containing multiple [[hydroxyl]] groups and those containing [[chlorine]] atoms are often sweet, and that among a series of structurally similar compounds, those with smaller [[molecular weight]]s were often sweeter than the larger compounds.

In 1919, Oertly and Myers proposed a more elaborate theory based on a then-current theory of [[color]] in synthetic [[dye]]s.  They hypothesized that to be sweet, a compound must contain one each of two classes of structural motif, a ''glucophore'' and an ''auxogluc''.  Based on those compounds known to be sweet at the time, they proposed a list of six candidate glucophores and nine auxoglucs.

From these beginnings in the early 20th century, the theory of sweetness enjoyed little further academic attention until 1963, when [[Robert Shallenberger]] and [[Terry Acree]] proposed the AH-B theory of sweetness.  Simply put, they proposed that to be sweet, a compound must contain a [[hydrogen bond]] [[Electron donor|donor]] (AH) and a [[Lewis base]] (B) separated by about 0.3 [[nanometre]]s.  According to this theory, the AH-B unit of a sweetener binds with a corresponding AH-B unit on the biological sweetness receptor to produce the sensation of sweetness.

B-X theory proposed by [[Lemont Kier]] in 1972.  While previous researchers had noted that among some groups of compounds, there seemed to be a correlation between [[hydrophobicity]] and sweetness, this theory formalized these observations by proposing that to be sweet, a compound must have a third binding site (labeled X) that could interact with a hydrophobic site on the sweetness receptor via [[London dispersion force]]s.  Later researchers have statistically analyzed the distances between the presumed AH, B, and X sites in several families of sweet substances to estimate the distances between these interaction sites on the sweetness receptor.

==MPA theory==
The most elaborate theory of sweetness to date is the multipoint attachment theory (MPA) proposed by [[Jean-Marie Tinti]] and [[Claude Nofre]] in 1991.  This theory involves a total of eight interaction sites between a sweetener and the sweetness receptor, although not all sweeteners interact with all eight sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2008|title=Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Sweetness|journal=Chemosensory Perception|volume=1|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1007/s12078-007-9003-z|pmid=|author=John E. Hayes}}</ref>  This model has successfully directed efforts aimed at finding highly potent sweeteners, including the most potent family of sweeteners known to date, the [[guanidine]] sweeteners.  The most potent of these, [[lugduname]], is about 225,000 times sweeter than sucrose.

'''Steuben County''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] located in the northeast corner of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]].  The county was named after [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military officer who helped train the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The [[county seat]] is [[Angola, Indiana|Angola]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The area was developed for agriculture in the 19th century and has many natural resources. The county contains a state park and 105 lakes of various sizes.  Some of the larger lakes are [[Lake James (Indiana)|Lake James]], [[Lake George (Steuben County, Indiana)|Lake George]], Clear Lake, Jimmerson Lake, Lake Gage, and Crooked Lake.  As of 2010, the county population was 34,185.<ref name=\"census-quickfacts\">{{cite web

Steuben County comprises the Angola, IN [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
This area was historically occupied by the [[Potawatomi]] people, who were one of the three tribes in the [[Council of Three Fires]]. Typically they lived in highly decentralized bands. Treaties signed by some leaders with United States representatives ceded large areas of their territory to the US.

Steuben County was officially created by European Americans in 1837 from [[LaGrange County, Indiana|LaGrange County]], and named for [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron Frederick von Steuben]], an officer of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S. Peale & co.|year=1875|location=Indiana|title=An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana|url=https://archive.org/details/anillustratedhi02tuttgoog| pages=[https://archive.org/details/anillustratedhi02tuttgoog/page/n585 573]}}</ref> In 1840 the Potawatomi were forcibly removed from this area and neighboring territory in Michigan and Ohio to Indian Territory in Kansas.

A Potawatomi chief, [[Baw Beese]], led a band that was based at what later became known as Baw Beese Lake nearby in Michigan. His daughter Winona married Negnaska and lived in what is now Indiana. She was executed in the 1830s by her husband's people after she killed Negnaska for selling her pony.<ref name=\"Winona Story\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCDiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA582 Fuller, George Newman and Beeson, Lewis]''Michigan History Vol. 6'' Lansing: Michigan State Historical Society, 1922. p. 582</ref> Winona's husband had pledged his rifle to Aaron B. Goodwin of [[Fremont, Indiana]] for the use of a 5-gallon keg. The Indians had the keg filled with whiskey at Nichols' store in Jamestown, and he took all the money they had. Negnaska sold his wife Winona's pony in order to pawn his rifle. Winona owned the pony outright, either as a gift from her father or having bought it with her own money. She killed Negnaska in anger for selling what was hers. Winona was held by the tribe for a few hours, until her husband's nearest relative arrived to execute her. As was their custom, he stabbed her to the heart as she had her husband.<ref name=\"Winona History\"/>

John D. Barnard and Sheldon Havens were said to have encountered the Potawatomi group after the execution; they helped them move the bodies to a nearby grave that had been dug. The Indians did not bury the bodies until after the white men were out of sight. But Dr. B.F. Sheldon found out about it and exhumed the bodies for dissection a few days later, outraging the mourning Potawatomi. About two weeks later some Potawatomi returned the keg to Goodwin and tried to retrieve Negnaska's rifle, but Goodwin pretended not to know the man had been killed and refused to release the rifle to his friends.<ref name=\"Winona History\">[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsteuben00inte/historyofsteuben00inte_djvu.txt ''History of Steuben County, Indiana''], Chicago: Inter-state Publishing Company, 1885. pp. 550-551.</ref>

The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government.

'''Steuben County''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] located in the northeast corner of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]].  The county was named after [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military officer who helped train the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The [[county seat]] is [[Angola, Indiana|Angola]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The area was developed for agriculture in the 19th century and has many natural resources. The county contains a state park and 105 lakes of various sizes.  Some of the larger lakes are [[Lake James (Indiana)|Lake James]], [[Lake George (Steuben County, Indiana)|Lake George]], Clear Lake, Jimmerson Lake, Lake Gage, and Crooked Lake.  As of 2010, the county population was 34,185.<ref name=\"census-quickfacts\">{{cite web

Steuben County comprises the Angola, IN [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
This area was historically occupied by the [[Potawatomi]] people, who were one of the three tribes in the [[Council of Three Fires]]. Typically they lived in highly decentralized bands. Treaties signed by some leaders with United States representatives ceded large areas of their territory to the US.

Steuben County was officially created by European Americans in 1837 from [[LaGrange County, Indiana|LaGrange County]], and named for [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron Frederick von Steuben]], an officer of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S. Peale & co.|year=1875|location=Indiana|title=An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana|url=https://archive.org/details/anillustratedhi02tuttgoog| pages=[https://archive.org/details/anillustratedhi02tuttgoog/page/n585 573]}}</ref> In 1840 the Potawatomi were forcibly removed from this area and neighboring territory in Michigan and Ohio to Indian Territory in Kansas.

A Potawatomi chief, [[Baw Beese]], led a band that was based at what later became known as Baw Beese Lake nearby in Michigan. His daughter Winona married Negnaska and lived in what is now Indiana. She was executed in the 1830s by her husband's people after she killed Negnaska for selling her pony.<ref name=\"Winona Story\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCDiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA582 Fuller, George Newman and Beeson, Lewis]''Michigan History Vol. 6'' Lansing: Michigan State Historical Society, 1922. p. 582</ref> Winona's husband had pledged his rifle to Aaron B. Goodwin of [[Fremont, Indiana]] for the use of a 5-gallon keg. The Indians had the keg filled with whiskey at Nichols' store in Jamestown, and he took all the money they had. Negnaska sold his wife Winona's pony in order to pawn his rifle. Winona owned the pony outright, either as a gift from her father or having bought it with her own money. She killed Negnaska in anger for selling what was hers. Winona was held by the tribe for a few hours, until her husband's nearest relative arrived to execute her. As was their custom, he stabbed her to the heart as she had her husband.<ref name=\"Winona History\"/>
	
John D. Barnard and Sheldon Havens were said to have encountered the Potawatomi group after the execution; they helped them move the bodies to a nearby grave that had been dug. The Indians did not bury the bodies until after the white men were out of sight. But Dr. B.F. Sheldon found out about it and exhumed the bodies for dissection a few days later, outraging the mourning Potawatomi. About two weeks later some Potawatomi returned the keg to Goodwin and tried to retrieve Negnaska's rifle, but Goodwin pretended not to know the man had been killed and refused to release the rifle to his friends.<ref name=\"Winona History\">[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsteuben00inte/historyofsteuben00inte_djvu.txt ''History of Steuben County, Indiana''], Chicago: Inter-state Publishing Company, 1885. pp. 550-551.</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Steuben County is part of [[Indiana's 3rd congressional district]] and in 2008 was represented by [[Mark Souder]] in the [[United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://souder.house.gov/|title=US Congressman Mark Souder|publisher=US Congress|access-date=2008-10-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009142714/http://souder.house.gov/|archive-date=2008-10-09|df=}}</ref>

→‎North America,safe,Peipsi-Pihkva,"'''Eastern European people''' are a pan-ethnic group, or multi-ethnic regional grouping, and the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]]. '''East''' or '''Eastern Europeans''' can usually trace back full or partial heritage to [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[European Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other nations bordering with or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the region.

Mainly comprised of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicities, in its strictest geographical terms [[Moldova]] is the sole majority-Romance ethnic nation in the region; with significant numbers of [[Moldovans in Ukraine|Moldovans]] and [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanians]] also native to other areas of Eastern Europe, such as in the [[Western Ukrainian]] borderland province [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and parts of Russia.

There are also many descriptions of Eastern Europeans which include ancestry from nations in [[Central Europe]], and countries of the [[South Slavs]], particularly in diasporic identification. There is a large Eastern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in North America ([[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians|Canadians]]), as well as Oceania ([[Eastern European Australians]]).

==Background==
Eastern Europeans have been discussed academically, researched and reported on as a pan-ethnic group, which is most usually based on full or partial ancestry to Eastern Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cee-communism/closed-borders-no-shops-been-there-done-that-say-east-europeans-idUSKBN21E2KO |title=Closed borders, no shops?

==History==
In 1964, the [[Assembly of Captive European Nations]] published material suggesting how, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the \"Eastern European people were sealed off from the West and held down by Soviet-patterned police apparatuses\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=George Meany|authorlink1=George Meany|title=ACEN News|date=1964|publisher=[[Assembly of Captive European Nations]]}}</ref> The attitudes of Eastern Europeans and their relationship to the state, government and society underwent transformation during the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Markus Schatten|title=Recovering the Past.

Gromada|title=Report of the New Jersey Governor's Commission on Eastern European and Captive Nation History|date=1989|publisher=[[New Jersey Civil Service Commission]]|quote=There are great cultural differences between Russians and other Eastern European people. Most non-Russian East Europeans do not have any affinity with Russian culture. Rather, they feel more kinship with Western European culture}}</ref> Political scientists [[Ivan Krastev]] and [[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]] have argued that this form of Western cultural aspiration drove the [[revolutions of 1989]] and acted as a shared mission for them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/western-liberalism-failed-post-communist-eastern-europe |title=How liberalism became ‘the god that failed’ in eastern Europe |authorlink1=Ivan Krastev|authorlink2=Stephen Holmes (academic)|author1= Ivan Krastev|author2=Stephen Holmes|date=October 24, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=When the [[cold war]] ended, racing to join [[Western world|the west]] was the shared mission of central and eastern Europeans. Indeed, becoming indistinguishably western was arguably the principal aim of the [[revolutions of 1989]].}}</ref>

For his conduct during this period, politican [[Julian Knight (politician)|Julian Knight]] has written that Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] deserves credit for understanding how the [[Cold War]] was impoverishing both Russians and other Eastern Europeans, and for helping to facilitate its end.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Julian Knight|authorlink1=Julian Knight (politician)|title=British Politics For Dummies|date=2010|isbn=978-1118971505|chapter=Chapter 24: Ten Political Events that Shaped the Modern World|publisher=[[For Dummies]]|quote=Much of the credit for the peaceful transference of former eastern European communist regimes to democracies belongs to the Soviet leader of the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Although a communist, he saw that the [[Cold War]] between the West and East was impoverishing his own and other eastern European people.}}</ref> Historian [[Dan Stone (historian)|Dan Stone]] has suggested President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s self-imposed distancing from European politics during this time \"inadvertently gave the Eastern European people the space they needed to carry out their revolutions\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dan Stone|authorlink1=Dan Stone (historian)|title=Goodbye to All That?: The Story of Europe Since 1945|date=2014|isbn=978-0199697717|pages=179|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>

During the economic reforms of the 1990s, as the region partially fell away from the economic sphere of Russia, Eastern Europeans suffered financially with, at first, growing costs and less disposable income.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Counts|title=Effects of Eastern European Reforms on World Trade in Forest Products|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|quote=The Eastern European people were faced with the dual problem of having less money to spend while at the same time facing increasingly high prices on virtually all goods and services.}}</ref> In the 21st-century, the process of [[EU enlargement]] has occasionally exposed cultural differences in between Western and Eastern Europeans, with the Soviet history of the region influencing the latter's political worldviews.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dieter Gosewinkel|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|date=2014|page=157|isbn=978-1782384250|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|quote=However, the [[EU enlargement|European enlargement]] process since the end of the [[Cold War]] has brought to the surface significant differences in opinions concerning the future of the union between so-called Old and New Europe. This could be seen as an indication that the communist conception of Europe did have an impact on the Eastern European people.}}</ref>

In 2019, a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that between 58 and 65 percent of Eastern Europeans felt positively about [[living standards]], education and [[national pride]] in the post-Communist era.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=30 years after communism, eastern Europe divided on democracy's impact |authorlink=|author=Jon Henley|date=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Asked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%). They were less happy about law and order (44%) and family values (41%), and a majority (53%) said healthcare had got worse in the post-communist era.}}</ref> In the same year, it was reported that the group were living close to ten years longer on avergage, since 1990, with longevity recorded as much as 10 percent higher for some.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/26/this-is-the-golden-age-eastern-europes-extraordinary-30-year-revival |title='This is the golden age': eastern Europe's extraordinary 30-year revival  |authorlink=|author=Shaun Walker|date=October 26, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Since then, longevity has surged as much as 10% in some parts of the region, and east Europeans are now more likely to be nearer 80 than 70 when they die.}}</ref>

In 2020, it was reported how the [[European Union]]'s policy of free movement had enabled or encouraged millions of Eastern Europeans to return home from Germany, and other large European economies, after job losses created by the [[coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=After coronavirus: how will Europe rebuild? |authorlink=|author=Katherine Butler|date=12 April 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=If Germany’s success in handling the pandemic is partly down to an army of migrant doctors and nurses, it should not be to the detriment of central and eastern Europe. Free movement of labour has also, paradoxically, led to the return home of millions of eastern Europeans.}}</ref>

==Academic research==
A 2013 study at [[Bucharest University]] proposed how a culture where Eastern European people seem under interrogation, for all political and cultural decisions taken by them, has developed due to the cultural conflict caused by public transition from communism to democracy.<ref>{{cite study|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Bojan Todosijevic|author3=Guido Boella|title=Political Attitudes and Mentalities. Eastern European Political Culture: Modeling Studies|date=2013|page=43|publisher=[[Bucharest University Press]]|quote=he long transition processes from the communist to democratic regimes made almost all Eastern European people and their countries experience during the past two decades the need to explain their choices, values, beliefs, norms, attitudes, symbols, grievances or prejudices, their institutions, regimes, and discourses.}}</ref>

In a 2018 [[Feminist Media Studies]] journal piece, [[University of Vienna]] Research Fellow Katharina Wiedlack criticized Western cultural perceptions, which she argued can frame Eastern Europeans as unthinking, unoriginal or possessing lower morality.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Katharina Wiedlack|title=In/visibly different: Melania Trump and the othering of Eastern European women in US culture|date=2017|page=179|isbn=978-0748624164|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|quote=The view on Eastern European people as unable to produce original thinking, and accordingly stealing from their Western peers, does not only confirm their questionable morals and character, it also confirms the superiority of Western (here US) thinking, culture, and being.}}</ref> A 2019 [[Roskilde University]] study was critical of discriminatory Danish media representations of Eastern European people, which it described as portraying them as a racially inferior working-class, prone to criminality, who's 'otherness' was to be subsumed by integration into a \"Danish '[[whiteness studies|whiteness]]'\".<ref>{{cite study|author1=Agnieszka Feliksik|author2=Valeriia Karamysheva|author3=Irina Fedorova|title=The Representation of Eastern Europeans in Danish Media|date=1989|page=43|publisher=[[Roskilde University]]|quote=They are presented as an ‘inferior race’ consisting of ‘cheap labor’ and criminals, who ‘invade’ Denmark and cause economical and security problems for Danish population. The notions ‘Us”’ (Danish people) and ‘Them’ (Eastern Europeans) are common in Eastern European discourse in Danish media. The integration of Eastern Europeans is considered as converting them to Danish ‘whiteness’}}</ref>

==Diaspora==
Large numbers of Eastern Europeans have emigrated from the region between the 18th and 21st centuries, driven by many factors, including wars, discrimination and opportunity. Significant proportions of such people, and their descendents, constitute the modern populations of [[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians]] in the North American continent, and [[Eastern European Australians]] in Oceania.

===Europe===
Since the opening up of [[EU accession]] in the early 21st-century, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to other parts of Europe, especially to Central, Western, and Northern Europe; gaining access to the job markets of large economies in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in particular.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\" />

[[Russell Deacon]] has written of the tension created in the mid-2000s, from Eastern Europeans emigrating to [[Welsh-speaking]] areas of Wales, with pressure group [[Cymuned]] lobbying the Welsh government to prioritize housing for locals, as a reactionary response.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Russell Deacon|author2=Alan Sandry|authorlink1=Russell Deacon|title=Devolution in the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland|date=2007|page=179|isbn=978-0748624164|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|quote=The problem of solely English-speaking or Eastern European people moving into predominantly Welsh-speaking areas has at times been a sensitive political issue. In 2001 a pressure group, [[Cymuned]] (Community), began to lobby the [[Welsh Assembly]] on issues relating to inward migration and the need to prioritise local housing for local people.}}</ref>

By 2014, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' society-piece by [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]], outlined multiple years of apparent social problems created by large numbers of immigrants from Eastern Europe (and its bordering regions) which included reports of mafias, intra-ethnic conflicts, murders, as well as positive elements such as the revival of town centres.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/16/fear-anger-wisbech-cambridgeshire-insecurity-immigration |title=Fear and anger in once-wealthy town divided by insecurity and immigration |authorlink=|author=John Harris|date=16 June 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> In 2015, most Eastern Europeans living in [[Suffolk]] were young working-age adults.<ref>{{Cite article|url=https://www.healthysuffolk.org.uk/uploads/Migrants_from_Eastern_Europe_.pdf |title=Health and Wellbeing Suffolk: Joint Strategic Needs Assessment - Migrants from Eastern Europe|date=1 July 2015|publisher=[[Suffolk County Council]]|quote=
The majority of Eastern European people in Suffolk are young adults of working age. There are also children and some middle-aged and older people.}}</ref>

In 2018, British media reported growing concern for East European people affected by [[Brexit]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/05/concerns-for-eastern-europeans-in-brexit-settled-status-plan |title=Concerns for eastern Europeans in Brexit ‘settled status’ plan |authorlink=|author=Lisa O'Carroll|date=5 June 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

===North America===
====19th-century====
Eastern Europeans arrived in large numbers to the United States during the 1880s and 1890s, settling in industry towns and cities, such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohiodigitalnetwork.org/historic-ethnic-groups-in-ohio/|title=Historic Ethnic Groups in Ohio|publisher=[[State Library of Ohio]]|quote=[[Cleveland, Ohio]], likewise, saw many Eastern Europeans choosing its city as their new home. While thousands of [[Germans]] often chose rural areas throughout Ohio as their new residence, they also settled in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. In fact, at the beginning of the 20th century, at least 50 percent of Cleveland residents were German. Over 75 percent of Cleveland’s population was foreign born by 1900.}}</ref> Implications of the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' in 1914, which authorized the designation of \"aliens of enemy nationality\", included Eastern European Canadians born or resident in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Martin Louis Kovacs|title=Ethnic Canadians: Culture and Education|date=1978|publisher=[[University of Regina]]|isbn=978-0889770096|chapter=Volume 8|page=132|quote=The conflict between clashing loyalties for the Ukrainian and some other Central Eastern European Canadians was exacerbated by the war measures.}}</ref> Continuing into the 1920s, Eastern European Canadians faced persecution, along with [[African Canadians]], during economic recession and post-[[World War I]] unrest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sarah-Jane Mathieu|title=North of the Color Line: Migration and Black Resistance in Canada, 1870–1955|date=2010|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|isbn=978-0807834299|chapter=Fighting the Empire|page=114|quote=Throughout the 1920s, eastern European Canadians, like [[African Canadians]], became the country's convenient scapegoats for postwar labor unrest, peacetime economic recession, and urban demise.}}</ref> In the US from 1900 (until the [[Hart–Celler Act]] of 1965 ended it), the majority of immigration into the US was comprised of people arriving from Southern Europe, and large numbers of Eastern Europeans.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irmo Marini|title=The Professional Counselor's Desk Reference|date=2009|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|isbn=978-0826171818|chapter=Counseling White Americans|page=249|quote=[[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans. After 1900, and prior to the [[1965 Immigration Act]], most immigrants to the United States came from southern and eastern European countries.}}</ref> This post-war period enabled Eastern European people to become significant percentages of US populations, in places such as the [[Pittsburg, Kansas]] mining community, nicknamed as the \"Little [[Balkans]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/amazon-army/16702|title=Amazon Army|publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]]|date=February 1, 2011|quote=These local families were immigrants from many [[European nations]] who had brought their mining skills to southeast Kansas. Called \"Little Balkans,\" this region was home to [[French Americans|French]], Italian, Swedish, Austrian, German, British, and Eastern European Americans who spoke many different languages.}}</ref>

====World War II====
After the outbreak of [[World War II]], Eastern European citizens of Canada received training at [[Camp X]], many going on to serve their adoptive country in the [[Special Operations Executive]].<ref name=\"saturdaynight1982\">{{cite news|title=Saturday Night, Volume 97|date=1982|work=[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]|quote=Similarly out of the mainstream were those central and eastern European Canadians, now condescendingly called \"ethnics.\" Of those who served with SOE , most were Yugoslavs who had immigrated to Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.}}</ref> In the US, however, Americans of Eastern European heritage faced government-enforced restrictions. Speaking to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], [[Russ Feingold]] acknowledged how \"Eastern European Americans were unfairly arrested, detained, interned, or relocated\" in a 2003 address.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/feingold_statement_10_16_03.pdf|title=Statement of The Honorable Russ Feingold|publisher=[[Senate Judiciary Committee]]|date=October 16, 2003|quote=Thousands of [[German Americans]], Italian Americans, and Eastern European Americans were unfairly arrested, detained, interned, or relocated. Our government confiscated the personal property of many [[European Americans]] and restricted their travel rights.}}</ref>

In both Canada and the United States, in the post-WWII period, politically active Eastern European people were forced to tread a careful line of diplomacy in both North American nations; demonstrating loyalty to their countries, while advocating for interventional policy which might aid people in their ancestral homelands.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H. L'Homedieu |title=Baltic Exiles and the U.S. Congress: Investigations and Legacies of the House Select Committee, 1953-1955|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois Press|edition=Volume 31|chapter=Journal of American Ethnic History|page=41|quote=Politically motivated Eastern European Americans rejected the postwar political settlement in their former homelands.

====Social breakthrough====
Eastern Europeans in Canada were shown to be underrepresented in professional occupations (and overrepresented in the [[personal service sector]]) by a 1961 census.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irwin Taylor Sanders|author2=Ewa T. Morawska|title=Polish American Community Life: A Survey of Research|date=1975|publisher=[[Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America]]|isbn=978-0940962309|chapter=|page=35|quote=Porter has shown that in 1961 Canadian Eastern European ethnics were underrepresented in professions and overrepresented in personal service. In the unskilled occupations Eastern Europeans reached the national mean in 1961.}}</ref> Cultural assimilation of Eastern Europeans was increasingly common in mid-20th-century North America. Professor [[Marc Shell]] has written regarding the Canadian government's enforcement of the [[anglicisation of names]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marc Shell|authorlink=Marc Shell|title=Polio and Its Aftermath: The Paralysis of Culture|date=2005|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0674013155|chapter=One Polio Story|page=55|quote=I became [[de jure]] Mark Shell in 1967 by means of an official [[Order of Council]]. (Such name changes were not untypical among assimilating Eastern Europeans in Canada.)}}</ref>

In the US, Eastern Europeans were also gradually being accepted into mainstream American culture. Historian [[David Halberstam]], speaking in a [[New England Board of Higher Education]] interview, discussed how access to [[white society]] became plausible for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nebhe.org/fall-2005-connection-50-years-of-new-england-higher-education-and-economic-development/|title=Fall 2005 Connection: 50 Years of New England Higher Education and Economic Development|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[New England Board of Higher Education]]|quote= But in retrospect, it was narrower than we thought. We perceived ourselves in the ‘50s as a white society, and the breakthrough was mostly limited to people who were descendents of Italian-Americans, Eastern European Americans, children of Jewish immigrants.”}}</ref> Perhaps respresenting this social change best, the [[US Census Bureau]] found that the Eastern European  born in this time period (between 1956 and 1965) were indistinguishable, in education results, with [[British Americans]].  Eastern European Americans were found to have also outperformed US citizens of solely British heritage in the completion of [[bachelor's degrees]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dominic J. Pulera|title=Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America|date=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0826418296|chapter=A Nation of 100 Million|page=30|quote=The Census Bureau found that 55.9% of white men born between 1956 and 1965 had attended college and 25.5% of them had completed bachelor's degrees. However, the percentages had virtually converged for two groups in this cohort: men of solely [[British ancestry]] (66.3% and 31.8%, respectively) and Southern and Eastern European men (66.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too. While the [[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans began to prosper in America, [[African Americans]] continued to suffer from discrimination and diminished life chances}}</ref>

====Late 20th-century====
During the 1970s, the majority of Eastern Europeans resident in Canada lived in the country's main urban centers. The exception being those of Ukrainian heritage, who still mostly lived rurally.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peggy Tyrchniewicz|title=Ethnic folk costumes in Canada|date=1979|publisher=[[Hyperion Press]]|isbn=978-0920534106|chapter=|page=111|quote=By 1971, the greatest percentage of all eastern European Canadians lived in the largest urban centers. The exception is the Ukrainians who live mainnly on the prairies.}}</ref> During this time, the [[Helsinki Accords]] were the cause of various political strife between the [[Ford administration]] and Eastern European people in the US.<ref>{{cite article|title=Through the Looking Glass: The Helsinki Final Act and the 1976 Election for President|author1=Sarah B. Snyder |date=2010|pages=86-106|publisher=Diplomacy & Statecraft|quote=[[Helsinki Final Act]] became a point of contention between the [[White House]] and Eastern European Americans during Ford's election campaign}}</ref> Whereas, writing in 1980, Dr Roy Norton suggested that the group were appreciative of the role Canada played in the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]], as well as the country's consistent criticizm of abuses to human rights in their ancestral lands.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nelson Michaud|editor2=Kim Richard Nossal|author1=Roy Norton|title=Diplomatic Departures: The Conservative Era in Canadian Foreign Policy, 1984-93 (Canada and International Relations)|date=2002|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|isbn=978-0774808651|chapter=Ethnic Groups and Conservative Foreign Policy|page=247|quote=Most eastern European-Canadians appeared to be pleased with Canada's leadership at the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] and on individual human rights cases; one community leader claimed he \"always felt [[Joe Clark]] was totally in tune with the position [he] was advocating\".}}</ref>

====Academic studies====
Academic reesearch has been utilized in the study of Eastern European diaspora in North American.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Wilhelm Kohler|title=European Economic Integration, WTO Membership, Immigration and Offshoring|date=2014|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-9814440189|chapter=Restrictive Immigration Policy in Germany: Pains and Gains Foregone?|page=409|quote=(iii) A “high education” scenario which assumes that the composition of the inflow equals the one observed for Eastern Europeans in Canada between 1995 and 2000.}}</ref> Professor Cezara O. Crisan has suggested, based on 2019 research at [[Purdue University Northwest]], that Eastern European Canadians are particularly likely to be politically and economically vested with the Eastern European nation that their heritage descends from.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cezara O.

There, while they reside physically in one place, they are involved economically, socially, and politcally in both the host and home country..}}</ref>

In 2008, a genetic research investigation consecutively tested over five hundred Eastern European US citizens, in order to identify [[human leukocyte antigen]] alleles. The research, which was based at the [[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]], contributed towards the creation of a [[hematopoietic stem cell]] register.<ref>{{cite study|title=HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allele and haplotype frequencies distinguish Eastern European Americans from the general European American population.|date=2008|publisher=[[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]]|author=S.

[[Category:Eastern Europeans in the United States]]
[[Category:Ethnic groups in Europe]]","'''Eastern European people''' are a pan-ethnic group, or multi-ethnic regional grouping, and the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]]. '''East''' or '''Eastern Europeans''' can usually trace back full or partial heritage to [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[European Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other nations bordering with or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the region.

Mainly comprised of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicities, in its strictest geographical terms [[Moldova]] is the sole majority-Romance ethnic nation in the region; with significant numbers of [[Moldovans in Ukraine|Moldovans]] and [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanians]] also native to other areas of Eastern Europe, such as in the [[Western Ukrainian]] borderland province [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and parts of Russia.

There are also many descriptions of Eastern Europeans which include ancestry from nations in [[Central Europe]], and countries of the [[South Slavs]], particularly in diasporic identification. There is a large Eastern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in North America ([[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians|Canadians]]), as well as Oceania ([[Eastern European Australians]]).

In 1964, the [[Assembly of Captive European Nations]] published material suggesting how, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the \"Eastern European people were sealed off from the West and held down by Soviet-patterned police apparatuses\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=George Meany|authorlink1=George Meany|title=ACEN News|date=1964|publisher=[[Assembly of Captive European Nations]]}}</ref> The attitudes of Eastern Europeans and their relationship to the state, government and society underwent transformation during the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Markus Schatten|title=Recovering the Past.

In 2019, a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that between 58 and 65 percent of Eastern Europeans felt positively about [[living standards]], education and [[national pride]] in the post-Communist era.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=30 years after communism, eastern Europe divided on democracy's impact |authorlink=|author=Jon Henley|date=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Asked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%).

==Academic research==
A 2013 study at [[Bucharest University]] proposed how a culture where Eastern European people seem under interrogation, for all political and cultural decisions taken by them, has developed due to the cultural conflict caused by public transition from communism to democracy.<ref>{{cite study|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Bojan Todosijevic|author3=Guido Boella|title=Political Attitudes and Mentalities.

==Diaspora==
Large numbers of Eastern Europeans have emigrated from the region between the 18th and 21st centuries, driven by many factors, including wars, discrimination and opportunity. Significant proportions of such people, and their descendents, constitute the modern populations of [[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians]] in the North American continent, and [[Eastern European Australians]] in Oceania.

===Europe===
Since the opening up of [[EU accession]] in the early 21st-century, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to other parts of Europe, especially to Central, Western, and Northern Europe; gaining access to the job markets of large economies in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in particular.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\" />

[[Russell Deacon]] has written of the tension created in the mid-2000s, from Eastern Europeans emigrating to [[Welsh-speaking]] areas of Wales, with pressure group [[Cymuned]] lobbying the Welsh government to prioritize housing for locals, as a reactionary response.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Russell Deacon|author2=Alan Sandry|authorlink1=Russell Deacon|title=Devolution in the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland|date=2007|page=179|isbn=978-0748624164|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|quote=The problem of solely English-speaking or Eastern European people moving into predominantly Welsh-speaking areas has at times been a sensitive political issue. In 2001 a pressure group, [[Cymuned]] (Community), began to lobby the [[Welsh Assembly]] on issues relating to inward migration and the need to prioritise local housing for local people.}}</ref>

By 2014, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' society-piece by [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]], outlined multiple years of apparent social problems created by large numbers of immigrants from Eastern Europe (and its bordering regions) which included reports of mafias, intra-ethnic conflicts, murders, as well as positive elements such as the revival of town centres.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/16/fear-anger-wisbech-cambridgeshire-insecurity-immigration |title=Fear and anger in once-wealthy town divided by insecurity and immigration |authorlink=|author=John Harris|date=16 June 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> In 2015, most Eastern Europeans living in [[Suffolk]] were young working-age adults.<ref>{{Cite article|url=https://www.healthysuffolk.org.uk/uploads/Migrants_from_Eastern_Europe_.pdf |title=Health and Wellbeing Suffolk: Joint Strategic Needs Assessment - Migrants from Eastern Europe|date=1 July 2015|publisher=[[Suffolk County Council]]|quote=
The majority of Eastern European people in Suffolk are young adults of working age. There are also children and some middle-aged and older people.}}</ref>

In 2018, British media reported growing concern for East European people affected by [[Brexit]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/05/concerns-for-eastern-europeans-in-brexit-settled-status-plan |title=Concerns for eastern Europeans in Brexit ‘settled status’ plan |authorlink=|author=Lisa O'Carroll|date=5 June 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

===North America===
====19th-century====
Eastern Europeans arrived in large numbers to the United States during the 1880s and 1890s, settling in industry towns and cities, such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohiodigitalnetwork.org/historic-ethnic-groups-in-ohio/|title=Historic Ethnic Groups in Ohio|publisher=[[State Library of Ohio]]|quote=[[Cleveland, Ohio]], likewise, saw many Eastern Europeans choosing its city as their new home. While thousands of [[Germans]] often chose rural areas throughout Ohio as their new residence, they also settled in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. In fact, at the beginning of the 20th century, at least 50 percent of Cleveland residents were German. Over 75 percent of Cleveland’s population was foreign born by 1900.}}</ref> Implications of the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' in 1914, which authorized the designation of \"aliens of enemy nationality\", included Eastern European Canadians born or resident in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Martin Louis Kovacs|title=Ethnic Canadians: Culture and Education|date=1978|publisher=[[University of Regina]]|isbn=978-0889770096|chapter=Volume 8|page=132|quote=The conflict between clashing loyalties for the Ukrainian and some other Central Eastern European Canadians was exacerbated by the war measures.}}</ref> Continuing into the 1920s, Eastern European Canadians faced persecution, along with [[African Canadians]], during economic recession and post-[[World War I]] unrest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sarah-Jane Mathieu|title=North of the Color Line: Migration and Black Resistance in Canada, 1870–1955|date=2010|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|isbn=978-0807834299|chapter=Fighting the Empire|page=114|quote=Throughout the 1920s, eastern European Canadians, like [[African Canadians]], became the country's convenient scapegoats for postwar labor unrest, peacetime economic recession, and urban demise.}}</ref> In the US from 1900 (until the [[Hart–Celler Act]] of 1965 ended it), the majority of immigration into the US was comprised of people arriving from Southern Europe, and large numbers of Eastern Europeans.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irmo Marini|title=The Professional Counselor's Desk Reference|date=2009|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|isbn=978-0826171818|chapter=Counseling White Americans|page=249|quote=[[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans. After 1900, and prior to the [[1965 Immigration Act]], most immigrants to the United States came from southern and eastern European countries.}}</ref> This post-war period enabled Eastern European people to become significant percentages of US populations, in places such as the [[Pittsburg, Kansas]] mining community, nicknamed as the \"Little [[Balkans]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/amazon-army/16702|title=Amazon Army|publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]]|date=February 1, 2011|quote=These local families were immigrants from many [[European nations]] who had brought their mining skills to southeast Kansas. Called \"Little Balkans,\" this region was home to [[French Americans|French]], Italian, Swedish, Austrian, German, British, and Eastern European Americans who spoke many different languages.}}</ref>

====World War II====
After the outbreak of [[World War II]], Eastern European citizens of Canada received training at [[Camp X]], many going on to serve their adoptive country in the [[Special Operations Executive]].<ref name=\"saturdaynight1982\">{{cite news|title=Saturday Night, Volume 97|date=1982|work=[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]|quote=Similarly out of the mainstream were those central and eastern European Canadians, now condescendingly called \"ethnics.\" Of those who served with SOE , most were Yugoslavs who had immigrated to Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.}}</ref> In the US, however, Americans of Eastern European heritage faced government-enforced restrictions. Speaking to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], [[Russ Feingold]] acknowledged how \"Eastern European Americans were unfairly arrested, detained, interned, or relocated\" in a 2003 address.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/feingold_statement_10_16_03.pdf|title=Statement of The Honorable Russ Feingold|publisher=[[Senate Judiciary Committee]]|date=October 16, 2003|quote=Thousands of [[German Americans]], Italian Americans, and Eastern European Americans were unfairly arrested, detained, interned, or relocated. Our government confiscated the personal property of many [[European Americans]] and restricted their travel rights.}}</ref>

In both Canada and the United States, in the post-WWII period, politically active Eastern European people were forced to tread a careful line of diplomacy in both North American nations; demonstrating loyalty to their countries, while advocating for interventional policy which might aid people in their ancestral homelands.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H. L'Homedieu |title=Baltic Exiles and the U.S. Congress: Investigations and Legacies of the House Select Committee, 1953-1955|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois Press|edition=Volume 31|chapter=Journal of American Ethnic History|page=41|quote=Politically motivated Eastern European Americans rejected the postwar political settlement in their former homelands. They were caught between promoting unrealistic foreign policy prescriptions in the American political spectrum, such as advocating the use of military force to roll back [[Communism]] in Eastern Europe, and having to demonstrate their loyaltly to the [[United States]].}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Alan Hustak|title=Peter Lougheed: A Biography|date=1979|publisher=[[McClelland and Stewart]]|isbn=978-0771042997|chapter=|page=232|quote=Required by protocol to lay a bouquet of flowers at the \"[[Mound of Glory|mound of glory]]\" - a war monument erected to the victories of the [[Red Army]] during the Second World War - he hastily deposited the flowers and quickly moved on, aware of the fact that his visit to the Soviet Union might antagonize the large number of eastern European Canadians living in Alberta.}}</ref>

====Social breakthrough====
Eastern Europeans in Canada were shown to be underrepresented in professional occupations (and overrepresented in the [[personal service sector]]) by a 1961 census.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irwin Taylor Sanders|author2=Ewa T. Morawska|title=Polish American Community Life: A Survey of Research|date=1975|publisher=[[Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America]]|isbn=978-0940962309|chapter=|page=35|quote=Porter has shown that in 1961 Canadian Eastern European ethnics were underrepresented in professions and overrepresented in personal service. In the unskilled occupations Eastern Europeans reached the national mean in 1961.}}</ref> Cultural assimilation of Eastern Europeans was increasingly common in mid-20th-century North America. Professor [[Marc Shell]] has written regarding the Canadian government's enforcement of the [[anglicisation of names]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marc Shell|authorlink=Marc Shell|title=Polio and Its Aftermath: The Paralysis of Culture|date=2005|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0674013155|chapter=One Polio Story|page=55|quote=I became [[de jure]] Mark Shell in 1967 by means of an official [[Order of Council]]. (Such name changes were not untypical among assimilating Eastern Europeans in Canada.)}}</ref>

In the US, Eastern Europeans were also gradually being accepted into mainstream American culture. Historian [[David Halberstam]], speaking in a [[New England Board of Higher Education]] interview, discussed how access to [[white society]] became plausible for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nebhe.org/fall-2005-connection-50-years-of-new-england-higher-education-and-economic-development/|title=Fall 2005 Connection: 50 Years of New England Higher Education and Economic Development|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[New England Board of Higher Education]]|quote= But in retrospect, it was narrower than we thought. We perceived ourselves in the ‘50s as a white society, and the breakthrough was mostly limited to people who were descendents of Italian-Americans, Eastern European Americans, children of Jewish immigrants.”}}</ref> Perhaps respresenting this social change best, the [[US Census Bureau]] found that the Eastern European  born in this time period (between 1956 and 1965) were indistinguishable, in education results, with [[British Americans]].  Eastern European Americans were found to have also outperformed US citizens of solely British heritage in the completion of [[bachelor's degrees]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dominic J. Pulera|title=Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America|date=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0826418296|chapter=A Nation of 100 Million|page=30|quote=The Census Bureau found that 55.9% of white men born between 1956 and 1965 had attended college and 25.5% of them had completed bachelor's degrees. However, the percentages had virtually converged for two groups in this cohort: men of solely [[British ancestry]] (66.3% and 31.8%, respectively) and Southern and Eastern European men (66.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too. While the [[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans began to prosper in America, [[African Americans]] continued to suffer from discrimination and diminished life chances}}</ref>

====Late 20th-century====
During the 1970s, the majority of Eastern Europeans resident in Canada lived in the country's main urban centers. The exception being those of Ukrainian heritage, who still mostly lived rurally.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peggy Tyrchniewicz|title=Ethnic folk costumes in Canada|date=1979|publisher=[[Hyperion Press]]|isbn=978-0920534106|chapter=|page=111|quote=By 1971, the greatest percentage of all eastern European Canadians lived in the largest urban centers. The exception is the Ukrainians who live mainnly on the prairies.}}</ref> During this time, the [[Helsinki Accords]] were the cause of various political strife between the [[Ford administration]] and Eastern European people in the US.<ref>{{cite article|title=Through the Looking Glass: The Helsinki Final Act and the 1976 Election for President|author1=Sarah B. Snyder |date=2010|pages=86-106|publisher=Diplomacy & Statecraft|quote=[[Helsinki Final Act]] became a point of contention between the [[White House]] and Eastern European Americans during Ford's election campaign}}</ref> Whereas, writing in 1980, Dr Roy Norton suggested that the group were appreciative of the role Canada played in the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]], as well as the country's consistent criticizm of abuses to human rights in their ancestral lands.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nelson Michaud|editor2=Kim Richard Nossal|author1=Roy Norton|title=Diplomatic Departures: The Conservative Era in Canadian Foreign Policy, 1984-93 (Canada and International Relations)|date=2002|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|isbn=978-0774808651|chapter=Ethnic Groups and Conservative Foreign Policy|page=247|quote=Most eastern European-Canadians appeared to be pleased with Canada's leadership at the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] and on individual human rights cases; one community leader claimed he \"always felt [[Joe Clark]] was totally in tune with the position [he] was advocating\".}}</ref>

====Academic research====
Academic reesearch has been utilized in the study of Eastern European diaspora in North American.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Wilhelm Kohler|title=European Economic Integration, WTO Membership, Immigration and Offshoring|date=2014|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-9814440189|chapter=Restrictive Immigration Policy in Germany: Pains and Gains Foregone?|page=409|quote=(iii) A “high education” scenario which assumes that the composition of the inflow equals the one observed for Eastern Europeans in Canada between 1995 and 2000.}}</ref> Professor Cezara O. Crisan has suggested, based on 2019 research at [[Purdue University Northwest]], that Eastern European Canadians are particularly likely to be politically and economically vested with the Eastern European nation that their heritage descends from.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cezara O. Crisan|title=The Legitimation Crisis of the Orthodox Church in the United States: From Assimilation to Incorporation|date=2019|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|isbn=978-1-4985-6293-5|chapter=Ethnic Groups and Conservative Foreign Policy|page=247|quote=The individuals and families that resemble more the transnational features of immigration are mostly permanent residents of the host country, in this case, the United States (although a study of Eastern Europeans in Canada might reach similar findings.) There, while they reside physically in one place, they are involved economically, socially, and politcally in both the host and home country..}}</ref>

In 2008, a genetic research investigation consecutively tested over five hundred Eastern European US citizens, in order to identify [[human leukocyte antigen]] alleles. The research, which was based at the [[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]], contributed towards the creation of a [[hematopoietic stem cell]] register.<ref>{{cite study|title=HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allele and haplotype frequencies distinguish Eastern European Americans from the general European American population.|date=2008|publisher=[[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]]|author=S.

==History==

As early as 1802, a man named Frederick Royce lived among the Ox Indians at a place known as the Lick, two miles east of Salem and is probably the first white man to inhabit this county. He was a hunter-trader and salt manufacturer. In 1803, Thomas Hopper was the first to settle in this county near [[Hardinsburg, Indiana|Hardinsburg]].

Washington County was formed in 1814. It was named for [[U.S. President]] [[George Washington]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S.

Beginning in 1903, and for an undetermined number of years afterward, Washington County had a [[sundown town]] policy forbidding African Americans from living in the county.<ref>{{cite news|title=Singular Isolation|work=[[Palladium-Item|The Evening Item]]|location=Richmond, Indiana|date=October 24, 1903|page=6|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29072301/|via=Newspapers.com|quote=She had seen many Indians in the pioneer days, but until she reached this city had never seen any person of African descent, as negroes are not allowed to live in Washington county.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Pigeon Roost Massacre' Historical Event Told About Family of Mrs. Lewis, DAR Regent|work=[[The Victoria Advocate]]|location=Victoria, Texas|date= November 3, 1957|page=46|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29073942/|via=Newspapers.com|quote=No Negroes were allowed to live in Washington County, but Beezon Baynes brought in a family and established them in a small house on the farm.

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' There are two judges in Washington County. The Judge of the Circuit Court is the Hon. Robert L. Bennett (D). The Judge of the Superior Court is the Hon. Frank E. Newkirk, Jr. (R). Case distribution is determined by local court rules. Each judge serves a six-year term.

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[surveying|surveyor]], and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Washington County is part of [[Indiana's 9th congressional district]] and is represented in [[United States Congress|Congress]] by Republican [[Trey Hollingsworth]].

==History==

As early as 1802, a man named Frederick Royce lived among the Ox Indians at a place known as the Lick, two miles east of Salem and is probably the first white man to inhabit this county. He was a hunter-trader and salt manufacturer. In 1803, Thomas Hopper was the first to settle in this county near [[Hardinsburg, Indiana|Hardinsburg]].

Washington County was formed in 1814. It was named for [[U.S. President]] [[George Washington]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S.

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' There are two judges in Washington County. The Judge of the Circuit Court is the Hon. Robert L. Bennett (D). The Judge of the Superior Court is the Hon. Frank E. Newkirk, Jr. (R). Case distribution is determined by local court rules. Each judge serves a six-year term.

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[surveying|surveyor]], and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Washington County is part of [[Indiana's 9th congressional district]] and is represented in [[United States Congress|Congress]] by Republican [[Trey Hollingsworth]].

'''Lindley Armstrong Jones''' (December 14, 1911&nbsp;– May 1, 1965), known as '''Spike Jones''', was an American  musician and bandleader specializing in satirical arrangements of popular songs and classical music. Ballads receiving the Jones treatment were punctuated with gunshots, whistles, cowbells and outlandish and comedic vocals. Jones and his band recorded under the title '''Spike Jones and his City Slickers''' from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s, and toured the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as ''The Musical Depreciation Revue''.

==Biography==
[[File:Spike Jones HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|Jones as a senior in high school, 1929]]
Jones' father was a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad agent. Young Lindley Jones got his nickname by being so thin that he was compared to a [[rail spike|railroad spike]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005066/bio |title=Spike Jones |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414202654/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005066/bio|archivedate=14 April 2016}}</ref> At the age of 11 he got his first set of [[Drum kit|drums]]. As a teenager he played in bands that he formed himself; Jones' first band was called Spike Jones and his Five Tacks. A railroad restaurant chef taught him how to use pots and pans, forks, knives and spoons as musical instruments.<ref name=Jones>{{cite news |url=http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTAw/z/WXoAAOSwstxU252N/$_57.JPG?rt=nc |title=Spike to the Guns! |author=Okon, May |date=October 3, 1954 |publisher=New York Sunday News |accessdate=May 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516161147/http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTAw/z/WXoAAOSwstxU252N/%24_57.JPG?rt=nc |archivedate=May 16, 2015}}</ref> Jones frequently played in theater [[pit orchestra]]s. In the 1930s he joined the [[Victor Young]] orchestra and got many offers to appear on radio shows, including [[Al Jolson]]'s ''Lifebuoy Program'', ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', and [[Bing Crosby]]'s ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]''.<ref name=Jones/>

Jones became bored playing the same music each night with the orchestras. He found other like-minded musicians and they began playing parodies of standard songs for their own entertainment. The musicians wanted their wives to share their enjoyment, so they recorded their weekly performances. One of the recordings made its way into the hands of an [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] executive, who offered the musicians a recording contract. One of the City Slickers' early recordings for the label was a [[Del Porter]] arrangement of  \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\".<ref name=Jones/> The record's success inspired Jones to become the band's leader. He initially thought the popularity the record brought them would fade. However, audiences kept asking for more, so Jones started working on more comic arrangements.<ref name=Jones/>

From 1937 to 1942, Jones was the percussionist for [[the John Scott Trotter Orchestra]], which played on Bing Crosby's first recording of \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724001618/http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 July 2006 |title=Error 404 – Page Not Found |website=Community.mcckc.edu |accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> He was part of a backing band for songwriter [[Cindy Walker]] during her early recording career with [[Decca Records]] and Standard Transcriptions.

The City Slickers developed from the Feather Merchants, a band led by vocalist-clarinetist [[Del Porter]], who took a back seat to Jones during the group's embryonic years.<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/del-porter-mn0001287398 retrieved 4/7/20</ref>They made experimental records for the Cinematone Corporation and performed publicly in Los Angeles, gaining a small following. Original members included vocalist-violinist Carl Grayson, banjoist Perry Botkin, trombonist King Jackson and pianist [[Stan Wrightsman]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The band's early records were issued on RCA Victor's budget-priced [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label, but were soon moved to the more-prestigious Victor label. They recorded extensively for the company until 1955. They also starred in various radio programs (1945–1949) and in their own [[NBC]] and [[CBS]] [[The Spike Jones Show (series)|television shows]] from 1954 to 1961.

During the 1940s, prominent band members included:

[[File:Spike Dyke Dick Tracy.jpg|right|thumb|300px|September 14, 1949 appearance of Spike Dyke, modeled on Spike Jones, in [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]'']]
*[[George Rock]] (trumpet, and vocals from 1944 to 1960)

*Mousie Garner (vocals)
*Bernie Jones (sax, vocals)
*Phil Gray (trombone)
*[[Jad Paul]] (banjo)
*Peter James (vocals)
*Marilyn Olsen Oliveri (vocals, harp)

The liner notes for at least two RCA compilation albums claimed that the two Morgans were brothers (the 1949 radio shows actually billed them as \"Dick and Freddy Morgan\"), but this was not true; Freddy's real name was Morgenstern.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604662/bio |title=Freddy Morgan – Biography |website=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |accessdate=2015-03-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017044620/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604662/bio |archivedate=2015-10-17}}</ref> Peter James (who was sometimes billed as Bobby Pinkus) and Paul \"Mousie\" Garner were former members of [[Ted Healy]]'s stage act on Broadway. James joined Healy for a two-year run in the Shubert revue ''A Night in Spain'' (1927–1928) where he worked alongside [[Shemp Howard]] and [[Larry Fine]]. Mousie joined with Healy from 1931 – 1932  after [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Shemp Howard]] had their first split with Ted, and with fellow Healy \"stooges\" Dick Hakins and Jack Wolfe, appeared in the Broadway shows ''The Gang's All Here'' and ''Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt''. Mousie, with Hakins and Sammy Glasser (aka Sammy Wolfe) rejoined Healy in 1937 for radio and personal appearances, until Healy's death in December 1937.

Spike Jones's second wife, singer [[Helen Grayco]], performed in his stage and television shows. Jones had four children: Linda (by his first wife, Patricia), [[Spike Jones, Jr.|Spike Jr.]], Leslie Ann and Gina. Spike Jr. is a producer of live events and television broadcasts. [[Leslie Ann Jones|Leslie Ann]] is the Director of Music and Film Scoring at [[George Lucas]]' [[Skywalker Ranch]] in [[Marin County]].{{citation needed|date= June 2012}}

==Record hits==

===\"Der Fuehrer's Face\"===
In 1942, a strike by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] prevented Jones from making commercial recordings for over two years. He could, however, make records for radio broadcasts. These were released on the Standard Transcriptions label (1941–1946) and have been reissued on a CD compilation called ''(Not) Your Standard Spike Jones Collection''.

Recorded just days before the recording ban, Jones scored a huge broadcast hit late in 1942 with \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\", a song ridiculing [[Adolf Hitler]], which followed every use of the word \"Heil\" with a derisive [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]] sound, as in the repeated phrase \"&nbsp;Heil, (raspberry), Heil (raspberry), right in Der Fuehrer's face!\".

}}
The romantic ballad \"[[Cocktails for Two]]\", originally written to evoke an intimate romantic rendezvous, was re-recorded by Spike Jones in 1944 as a raucous, horn-honking, voice-gurgling, hiccuping hymn to the cocktail hour. The Jones version was a huge hit.

Other Jones satires followed: \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\", \"[[Chlo-e (Song of the Swamp)|Chloe]]\", \"[[Holiday for Strings (song)|Holiday for Strings]]\", \"[[You Always Hurt the One You Love]]\",<ref name=pc1b>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|B}}</ref> \"My Old Flame\", referring to [[Peter Lorre]]'s voice (impersonated on the recording by [[Paul Frees]]) and eerie scenes in contemporary movies, and many more.

===\"Ghost Riders\"===
Spike's parody of [[Vaughn Monroe]]'s rendition of \"[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]\" was performed as if sung by a drunkard and ridiculed Monroe by name in its final stanza:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222124210/http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/spike3.htm |title=Spike Jones Can't Stop Murdering |date=February 22, 2016 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>''Cocktails For Two'', Pro-Arte PCD 516,1990, Side 2, Track 5.</ref> <blockquote>
CHORUS: 'Cause all we hear is \"Ghost Riders\" sung by Vaughn Monroe.<br />
I.W. HARPER: I can do without his singing.<br />
SIR FREDERICK GAS: But I wish I had his dough!<br /></blockquote>
The official American release edited out the dig at Monroe, because Monroe, a popular RCA Victor recording artist and also a major RCA stockholder, demanded it.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r82395|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic: ''The Best of Spike Jones, Volume 2''].</ref> The original version was released on the European market in 1949. (A few pressings containing the first ending were mistakenly released on the West Coast and are a prized rarity today.)

===\"All I Want for Christmas\"===
Jones' recording, \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]\", with a piping vocal by [[George Rock]], was a number-one hit in 1948. ([[Dora Bryan]] recorded a 1963 variation, \"All I Want For Christmas is a [[The Beatles|Beatle]]\".)

===Murdering the Classics===
[[File:Spike Jones 1948.jpg|thumb|Jones with some of his musical instruments – empty tin cans – in the background]]
Among the series of recordings in the 1940s were humorous takes on the classics such as the adaptation of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Liebesträume|Liebestraum No. 3]]'', played at a breakneck pace on unusual instruments. Others followed: [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''William Tell Overture'' was rendered on kitchen implements using a [[horse race]] as a backdrop, with one of the \"horses\" in the \"race\" likely to have inspired the nickname of the lone [[chrome yellow]]-painted [[AT-6 Texan|SNJ]] aircraft flown by the U.S. Navy's [[Blue Angels#1940s|Blue Angels]] aerobatic team's shows in the late 1940s, \"Beetle Bomb\". In live shows Spike would acknowledge the applause with complete solemnity, saying \"Thank you, music lovers.\" An [[LP record|LP]] collection of twelve of these \"homicides\" was released by RCA (on its prestigious [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] label) in 1971 as ''Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics.'' They include such ''tours de force'' as Pal-Yat-Chee (''[[Pagliacci]]''), sung by the Hillbilly humorists [[Homer and Jethro]], Ponchielli's ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'', Tchaikovsky's ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'', and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]''.

In 1944 RCA Victor released his \"Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies\" version of Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker Suite'', in three 10 inch 78 rpm records, P-143, arrangement credited to Joe \"Country\" Washburne with lyrics by Foster Carling. It was released as a three 7 inch 45 rpm vinyl set in 1949 as WP-143 and as a one 45rpm extended play EPA-143 in 1952. An abridged and re-sequenced version is also included in the aforementioned 'classics' album, with the complete original version available on the CD collection ''Spiked: The Music of Spike Jones''.

==Radio==
After appearing as the house band on ''[[The Bob Burns Show]],'' Spike got his own radio show on [[NBC]], ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour|The Chase and Sanborn Program]]'', as [[Edgar Bergen]]'s summer replacement in 1945. [[Frances Langford]] was co-host and [[Groucho Marx]] was among the guests. The guest list for Jones's 1947–49 CBS program for [[Coca-Cola]] (originally ''The Spotlight Revue'', retitled ''The Spike Jones Show'' for its final season) included [[Frankie Laine]], [[Mel Torme]], Peter Lorre, [[Don Ameche]] and [[Burl Ives]]. [[Frank Sinatra]] appeared on the show in October 1948, and [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]] in May 1949. Jones's resident \"girlsinger\" during this period was [[Dorothy Shay]], \"The Park Avenue Hillbillie.\" One of the announcers on Jones's CBS show was the young [[Mike Wallace]]. Writers included Eddie Maxwell, Eddie Brandt and [[Jay Sommers]]. The final program in the series was broadcast in June 1949.

==Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra==
While Jones enjoyed the fame and prosperity, he was annoyed that nobody seemed to see beyond the craziness. Determined to show the world that he was capable of producing legitimate \"pretty\" music, he formed a second group in 1946. Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra played lush arrangements of dance hits. This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band's expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of \"serious,\" accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.

The one outstanding recording by the Other Orchestra is \"Laura\", which features a serious first half (played exquisitely by the Other Orchestra) and a manic second half (played hilariously by the City Slickers).

Jones' son, Spike Jones Jr., called attention to the precision of his father's most outlandish musical arrangements: \"One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-05-08-bk-55045-story.html |title=Brevity's Raincheck |date=May 8, 1994 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>

==Movies==
In 1940, Jones had an uncredited bandleading part in the [[Dead End Kids]] film ''Give Us Wings'', appearing on camera for about four seconds.

As the band's fame grew, Hollywood producers hired the Slickers as a specialty act for feature films, including ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), ''[[Meet the People]]'' (1944), ''[[Bring on the Girls (film)|Bring on the Girls]]'' (1945), ''[[Breakfast in Hollywood]]'' (1946) and ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947). Jones was set to team with [[Abbott and Costello]] for a [[1954 in film|1954]] [[Universal Pictures]] comedy, but when Lou Costello withdrew for medical reasons, Universal replaced the comedy team with look-alikes [[Hugh O'Brian]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], and promoted Jones to the leading role. The finished film, ''[[Fireman Save My Child (1954 film)|Fireman Save My Child]]'', turned out to be Spike Jones's only top-billed theatrical movie.

==Soundies==
In 1942, the Jones gang worked on numerous [[Soundies]], musical shorts similar to later [[music video]]s which were shown on coin-operated projectors in arcades, malt shops, and taverns. The band appeared on camera under their own name in four of the Soundies (\"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\", \"Pass the Biscuits, Mirandy\", \"The Sheik of Araby\", and \"Blacksmith Song\"), and, according to musicologist Mark Cantor, provided background music for at least thirteen others. [[Mel Blanc]], the voice of [[Bugs Bunny]] and other [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon characters, performed a drunken, hiccuping verse for 1942's \"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\" (reissued in 1949 as \"The Clink! Clink! Polka\").

==Television==

Jones saw the potential of television and filmed two half-hour pilot films, ''Foreign Legion'' and ''Wild Bill Hiccup'', in the summer of 1950. Veteran comedy director [[Edward F. Cline|Eddie Cline]] worked on both, but neither was successful. The band fared much better on live television, where their spontaneous antics and crazy visual gags guaranteed the viewers a good time. Spike usually dressed in a suit with an enormous check pattern and was seen leaping around playing a washboard, cowbells, a suite of klaxons and foghorns, then xylophone, then shooting a pistol. The band starred in variety shows, such as ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' (1951, 1955)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009220817/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications. ''The Colgate Comedy Hour''|archivedate=October 9, 2009}}</ref> and their ''[[All Star Revue]]'' (1952) before being given his own slot by [[NBC]], ''[[The Spike Jones Show (series)|The Spike Jones Show]]'', which aired early in 1954, and ''[[Club Oasis]]'' on NBC, in the summer of 1958; and by CBS, as ''The Spike Jones Show,'' in the summers of 1957, 1960, and 1961. Jones and his City Slickers also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'' in the episode which aired on November 15, 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |title=The Ford Show Guest Guide |publisher=ernieford.com |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128190749/http://ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |archivedate=November 28, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1990, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] screened six compilation shows from these broadcasts; they were subsequently aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations.

==Later years==
The decline of big bands and the rise of [[rock and roll]] in the early 1950s hurt Spike Jones' repertoire. Early rock songs were ''already'' novelties, and Jones could not satirise them the same way he had lampooned \"Cocktails for Two\", \"Chloe\" or \"Laura\". He played rock music for laughs when he presented \"for the first time on television, the bottom half of [[Elvis Presley]]!\" This was the cue for a pair of pants—inhabited by dwarf actor [[Billy Barty]]—to scamper across the stage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Jordan R. |year=2005 |title=Spike Jones Off the Record: The Man Who Murdered Music |edition=3rd |location=Albany |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=1-59393-012-7}}</ref>

Jones was always prepared to adapt to changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically looking back at the 1920s, Jones recorded a straight album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953, he responded to the growing market for children's records, with tunes aimed directly at kids (like \"Socko, the Smallest Snowball\"). Jones had become increasingly unhappy at RCA Victor due to management interfering with his choice of repertoire and other matters, and he left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by [[Verve Records|Verve]], [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] In 1956, Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of [[Lawrence Welk]] and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun. The last City Slickers record was the LP ''[[Dinner Music for People Who Aren't Very Hungry]]''. The whole field of comedy records changed from musical satires to spoken-word comedy ([[Bob Newhart]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Stan Freberg]]). Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup ''[[Spike Jones in Stereo]]'' (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in ''Omnibust'' (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones's New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including \"Washington Square\" and \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\"). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of \"[[Dominique]]\", a hit by [[The Singing Nun]], in which he not only plays part of the melody on a [[banjo]] but melds the melody successfully with \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]!\"

Jones was a lifelong heavy smoker, reportedly 4-5 packs a day, and eventually he developed [[emphysema]]. Never a very healthy person, his health would deteriorate to the point where he had to use an oxygen tank both offstage and onstage, and he was confined to a seat behind his drum set. In spite of his illness, he continued smoking for the rest of his life and he died in May 1965 at the age of 53. He is buried in [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]].

==Influence==
There is a clear line of influence from [[Harry Reser]]'s 1920s hot-comic \"Six Jumping Jacks\" band (whose drummer and vocalist was the distinctive [[Tom Stacks]], \"The Voice With a Smile\"), the [[Hoosier Hot Shots]], [[Freddie Fisher (musician)|Freddie Fisher]] and his [[Schnickelfritz Band|Schnickelfritzers]], and the [[Marx Brothers]] to Spike Jones&nbsp;— and to [[Stan Freberg]], [[Gerard Hoffnung]], [[Peter Schickele]]'s [[P.D.Q. Bach]], [[The Goons]], [[Joe Raposo]], [[Mr. Bungle]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], [[Oingo Boingo|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]], and [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]. [[Billy Barty]] appeared in Yankovic's film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and a video based on the movie. According to David Wild's review in Rolling Stone Magazine, [[Elvis Costello]]'s 1989 Album \"[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]\" was named partly in tribute to Jones.

Syndicated radio personality [[Dr. Demento]] regularly features Jones' music on his program of comedy and novelty tracks. Jones is mentioned in [[The Band]]'s song, \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\". (The song's protagonist's paramour states of Jones: \"I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.\") Novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]] is an admirer and wrote the liner notes for a 1994 reissue, ''Spiked!'' (BMG Catalyst). A scene in the romantic comedy ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'' shows a man demonstrating the sound of his new stereo to [[Meg Ryan]]'s character by playing a record of Jones' music.

In 1974, Tony Levin (future bass player for King Crimson), recording under the name, The Clams, released a Spike Jones tribute of him giving the songs, \"Close To You\", by The Carpenters, and, \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\", by Roberta Flack, the Jones treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/thb404f|title=The Clams - Close To You|website=45cat.com|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 1986, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[synthpop]] group [[Telex (band)|Telex]] paid homage to Spike Jones in their album ''Looney Tunes'', with a song named after him. The intro of that song is a part of the intro from ''Camptown Races''.

In 1997, singers [[Artie Schroeck]] and [[Linda November]] directed a production in [[Atlantic City]] entitled \"The New City Slickers Present a Tribute to Spike Jones\", with a band that attempted to re-create the style and humor of Jones' music.<ref name=musician>{{cite news|title=He's a serious musician in search of funny sounds|url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-09-26/entertainment/25552440_1_spike-jones-music-big-bands|date=September 26, 1997|author=Lloyd, Jack|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527140520/http://articles.philly.com/1997-09-26/entertainment/25552440_1_spike-jones-music-big-bands |archivedate=May 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrating Spike Jones at Harrah's|date=September 21, 1997|author=Alexander, Randy|work=[[The Times (New Jersey)|The Times]]}}</ref>

'''Lindley Armstrong Jones''' (December 14, 1911&nbsp;– May 1, 1965), known as '''Spike Jones''', was an American  musician and bandleader specializing in satirical arrangements of popular songs and classical music. Ballads receiving the Jones treatment were punctuated with gunshots, whistles, cowbells and outlandish and comedic vocals. Jones and his band recorded under the title '''Spike Jones and his City Slickers''' from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s, and toured the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as ''The Musical Depreciation Revue''.

==Biography==
[[File:Spike Jones HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|Jones as a senior in high school, 1929]]
Jones' father was a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad agent. Young Lindley Jones got his nickname by being so thin that he was compared to a [[rail spike|railroad spike]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005066/bio |title=Spike Jones |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414202654/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005066/bio|archivedate=14 April 2016}}</ref> At the age of 11 he got his first set of [[Drum kit|drums]]. As a teenager he played in bands that he formed himself; Jones' first band was called Spike Jones and his Five Tacks. A railroad restaurant chef taught him how to use pots and pans, forks, knives and spoons as musical instruments.<ref name=Jones>{{cite news |url=http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTAw/z/WXoAAOSwstxU252N/$_57.JPG?rt=nc |title=Spike to the Guns! |author=Okon, May |date=October 3, 1954 |publisher=New York Sunday News |accessdate=May 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516161147/http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTAw/z/WXoAAOSwstxU252N/%24_57.JPG?rt=nc |archivedate=May 16, 2015}}</ref> Jones frequently played in theater [[pit orchestra]]s. In the 1930s he joined the [[Victor Young]] orchestra and got many offers to appear on radio shows, including [[Al Jolson]]'s ''Lifebuoy Program'', ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', and [[Bing Crosby]]'s ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]''.<ref name=Jones/>

Jones became bored playing the same music each night with the orchestras. He found other like-minded musicians and they began playing parodies of standard songs for their own entertainment. The musicians wanted their wives to share their enjoyment, so they recorded their weekly performances. One of the recordings made its way into the hands of an [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] executive, who offered the musicians a recording contract. One of the City Slickers' early recordings for the label was a [[Del Porter]] arrangement of  \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\".<ref name=Jones/> The record's success inspired Jones to become the band's leader. He initially thought the popularity the record brought them would fade. However, audiences kept asking for more, so Jones started working on more comic arrangements.<ref name=Jones/>

From 1937 to 1942, Jones was the percussionist for [[the John Scott Trotter Orchestra]], which played on Bing Crosby's first recording of \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724001618/http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 July 2006 |title=Error 404 – Page Not Found |website=Community.mcckc.edu |accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> He was part of a backing band for songwriter [[Cindy Walker]] during her early recording career with [[Decca Records]] and Standard Transcriptions. Her song \"We're Gonna Stomp Them City Slickers Down\" provided the inspiration for the name of Jones's future band.<ref name=wadey>{{cite news |last=Wadey |first=Paul |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cindy-walker-471652.html |title=Cindy Walker – Country songwriter |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=2015-03-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095808/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cindy-walker-471652.html |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref>

The City Slickers developed from the Feather Merchants, a band led by vocalist-clarinetist [[Del Porter]], who took a back seat to Jones during the group's embryonic years.ref>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/del-porter-mn0001287398 retrieved 4/7/20</ref><They made experimental records for the Cinematone Corporation and performed publicly in Los Angeles, gaining a small following. Original members included vocalist-violinist Carl Grayson, banjoist Perry Botkin, trombonist King Jackson and pianist [[Stan Wrightsman]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The band's early records were issued on RCA Victor's budget-priced [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label, but were soon moved to the more-prestigious Victor label. They recorded extensively for the company until 1955. They also starred in various radio programs (1945–1949) and in their own [[NBC]] and [[CBS]] [[The Spike Jones Show (series)|television shows]] from 1954 to 1961.

During the 1940s, prominent band members included:

*Mousie Garner (vocals)
*Bernie Jones (sax, vocals)
*Phil Gray (trombone)
*[[Jad Paul]] (banjo)
*Peter James (vocals)
*Marilyn Olsen Oliveri (vocals, harp)

The liner notes for at least two RCA compilation albums claimed that the two Morgans were brothers (the 1949 radio shows actually billed them as \"Dick and Freddy Morgan\"), but this was not true; Freddy's real name was Morgenstern.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604662/bio |title=Freddy Morgan – Biography |website=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |accessdate=2015-03-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017044620/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604662/bio |archivedate=2015-10-17}}</ref> Peter James (who was sometimes billed as Bobby Pinkus) and Paul \"Mousie\" Garner were former members of [[Ted Healy]]'s stage act on Broadway. James joined Healy for a two-year run in the Shubert revue ''A Night in Spain'' (1927–1928) where he worked alongside [[Shemp Howard]] and [[Larry Fine]]. Mousie joined with Healy from 1931 – 1932  after [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Shemp Howard]] had their first split with Ted, and with fellow Healy \"stooges\" Dick Hakins and Jack Wolfe, appeared in the Broadway shows ''The Gang's All Here'' and ''Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt''. Mousie, with Hakins and Sammy Glasser (aka Sammy Wolfe) rejoined Healy in 1937 for radio and personal appearances, until Healy's death in December 1937.

Spike Jones's second wife, singer [[Helen Grayco]], performed in his stage and television shows. Jones had four children: Linda (by his first wife, Patricia), [[Spike Jones, Jr.|Spike Jr.]], Leslie Ann and Gina. Spike Jr. is a producer of live events and television broadcasts. [[Leslie Ann Jones|Leslie Ann]] is the Director of Music and Film Scoring at [[George Lucas]]' [[Skywalker Ranch]] in [[Marin County]].{{citation needed|date= June 2012}}

==Record hits==

===\"Der Fuehrer's Face\"===
In 1942, a strike by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] prevented Jones from making commercial recordings for over two years. He could, however, make records for radio broadcasts. These were released on the Standard Transcriptions label (1941–1946) and have been reissued on a CD compilation called ''(Not) Your Standard Spike Jones Collection''.

Recorded just days before the recording ban, Jones scored a huge broadcast hit late in 1942 with \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\", a song ridiculing [[Adolf Hitler]], which followed every use of the word \"Heil\" with a derisive [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]] sound, as in the repeated phrase \"&nbsp;Heil, (raspberry), Heil (raspberry), right in Der Fuehrer's face!\".

===More satirical songs===

}}
The romantic ballad \"[[Cocktails for Two]]\", originally written to evoke an intimate romantic rendezvous, was re-recorded by Spike Jones in 1944 as a raucous, horn-honking, voice-gurgling, hiccuping hymn to the cocktail hour. The Jones version was a huge hit.

Other Jones satires followed: \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\", \"[[Chlo-e (Song of the Swamp)|Chloe]]\", \"[[Holiday for Strings (song)|Holiday for Strings]]\", \"[[You Always Hurt the One You Love]]\",<ref name=pc1b>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|B}}</ref> \"My Old Flame\", referring to [[Peter Lorre]]'s voice (impersonated on the recording by [[Paul Frees]]) and eerie scenes in contemporary movies, and many more.

===\"Ghost Riders\"===
Spike's parody of [[Vaughn Monroe]]'s rendition of \"[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]\" was performed as if sung by a drunkard and ridiculed Monroe by name in its final stanza:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222124210/http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/spike3.htm |title=Spike Jones Can't Stop Murdering |date=February 22, 2016 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>''Cocktails For Two'', Pro-Arte PCD 516,1990, Side 2, Track 5.</ref> <blockquote>
CHORUS: 'Cause all we hear is \"Ghost Riders\" sung by Vaughn Monroe.<br />
I.W. HARPER: I can do without his singing.<br />
SIR FREDERICK GAS: But I wish I had his dough!<br /></blockquote>
The official American release edited out the dig at Monroe, because Monroe, a popular RCA Victor recording artist and also a major RCA stockholder, demanded it.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r82395|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic: ''The Best of Spike Jones, Volume 2''].</ref> The original version was released on the European market in 1949. (A few pressings containing the first ending were mistakenly released on the West Coast and are a prized rarity today.)

===\"All I Want for Christmas\"===
Jones' recording, \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]\", with a piping vocal by [[George Rock]], was a number-one hit in 1948. ([[Dora Bryan]] recorded a 1963 variation, \"All I Want For Christmas is a [[The Beatles|Beatle]]\".)

===Murdering the Classics===
[[File:Spike Jones 1948.jpg|thumb|Jones with some of his musical instruments – empty tin cans – in the background]]
Among the series of recordings in the 1940s were humorous takes on the classics such as the adaptation of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Liebesträume|Liebestraum No. 3]]'', played at a breakneck pace on unusual instruments. Others followed: [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''William Tell Overture'' was rendered on kitchen implements using a [[horse race]] as a backdrop, with one of the \"horses\" in the \"race\" likely to have inspired the nickname of the lone [[chrome yellow]]-painted [[AT-6 Texan|SNJ]] aircraft flown by the U.S. Navy's [[Blue Angels#1940s|Blue Angels]] aerobatic team's shows in the late 1940s, \"Beetle Bomb\". In live shows Spike would acknowledge the applause with complete solemnity, saying \"Thank you, music lovers.\" An [[LP record|LP]] collection of twelve of these \"homicides\" was released by RCA (on its prestigious [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] label) in 1971 as ''Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics.'' They include such ''tours de force'' as Pal-Yat-Chee (''[[Pagliacci]]''), sung by the Hillbilly humorists [[Homer and Jethro]], Ponchielli's ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'', Tchaikovsky's ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'', and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]''.

In 1944 RCA Victor released his \"Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies\" version of Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker Suite'', in three 10 inch 78 rpm records, P-143, arrangement credited to Joe \"Country\" Washburne with lyrics by Foster Carling. It was released as a three 7 inch 45 rpm vinyl set in 1949 as WP-143 and as a one 45rpm extended play EPA-143 in 1952. An abridged and re-sequenced version is also included in the aforementioned 'classics' album, with the complete original version available on the CD collection ''Spiked: The Music of Spike Jones''.

==Radio==
After appearing as the house band on ''[[The Bob Burns Show]],'' Spike got his own radio show on [[NBC]], ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour|The Chase and Sanborn Program]]'', as [[Edgar Bergen]]'s summer replacement in 1945. [[Frances Langford]] was co-host and [[Groucho Marx]] was among the guests. The guest list for Jones's 1947–49 CBS program for [[Coca-Cola]] (originally ''The Spotlight Revue'', retitled ''The Spike Jones Show'' for its final season) included [[Frankie Laine]], [[Mel Torme]], Peter Lorre, [[Don Ameche]] and [[Burl Ives]]. [[Frank Sinatra]] appeared on the show in October 1948, and [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]] in May 1949. Jones's resident \"girlsinger\" during this period was [[Dorothy Shay]], \"The Park Avenue Hillbillie.\" One of the announcers on Jones's CBS show was the young [[Mike Wallace]]. Writers included Eddie Maxwell, Eddie Brandt and [[Jay Sommers]]. The final program in the series was broadcast in June 1949.

==Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra==
While Jones enjoyed the fame and prosperity, he was annoyed that nobody seemed to see beyond the craziness. Determined to show the world that he was capable of producing legitimate \"pretty\" music, he formed a second group in 1946. Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra played lush arrangements of dance hits. This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band's expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of \"serious,\" accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.

The one outstanding recording by the Other Orchestra is \"Laura\", which features a serious first half (played exquisitely by the Other Orchestra) and a manic second half (played hilariously by the City Slickers).

Jones' son, Spike Jones Jr., called attention to the precision of his father's most outlandish musical arrangements: \"One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-05-08-bk-55045-story.html |title=Brevity's Raincheck |date=May 8, 1994 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>

==Movies==
In 1940, Jones had an uncredited bandleading part in the [[Dead End Kids]] film ''Give Us Wings'', appearing on camera for about four seconds.

As the band's fame grew, Hollywood producers hired the Slickers as a specialty act for feature films, including ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), ''[[Meet the People]]'' (1944), ''[[Bring on the Girls (film)|Bring on the Girls]]'' (1945), ''[[Breakfast in Hollywood]]'' (1946) and ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947). Jones was set to team with [[Abbott and Costello]] for a [[1954 in film|1954]] [[Universal Pictures]] comedy, but when Lou Costello withdrew for medical reasons, Universal replaced the comedy team with look-alikes [[Hugh O'Brian]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], and promoted Jones to the leading role. The finished film, ''[[Fireman Save My Child (1954 film)|Fireman Save My Child]]'', turned out to be Spike Jones's only top-billed theatrical movie.

==Soundies==
In 1942, the Jones gang worked on numerous [[Soundies]], musical shorts similar to later [[music video]]s which were shown on coin-operated projectors in arcades, malt shops, and taverns. The band appeared on camera under their own name in four of the Soundies (\"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\", \"Pass the Biscuits, Mirandy\", \"The Sheik of Araby\", and \"Blacksmith Song\"), and, according to musicologist Mark Cantor, provided background music for at least thirteen others. [[Mel Blanc]], the voice of [[Bugs Bunny]] and other [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon characters, performed a drunken, hiccuping verse for 1942's \"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\" (reissued in 1949 as \"The Clink! Clink! Polka\").

==Television==

Jones saw the potential of television and filmed two half-hour pilot films, ''Foreign Legion'' and ''Wild Bill Hiccup'', in the summer of 1950. Veteran comedy director [[Edward F. Cline|Eddie Cline]] worked on both, but neither was successful. The band fared much better on live television, where their spontaneous antics and crazy visual gags guaranteed the viewers a good time. Spike usually dressed in a suit with an enormous check pattern and was seen leaping around playing a washboard, cowbells, a suite of klaxons and foghorns, then xylophone, then shooting a pistol. The band starred in variety shows, such as ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' (1951, 1955)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009220817/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications. ''The Colgate Comedy Hour''|archivedate=October 9, 2009}}</ref> and their ''[[All Star Revue]]'' (1952) before being given his own slot by [[NBC]], ''[[The Spike Jones Show (series)|The Spike Jones Show]]'', which aired early in 1954, and ''[[Club Oasis]]'' on NBC, in the summer of 1958; and by CBS, as ''The Spike Jones Show,'' in the summers of 1957, 1960, and 1961. Jones and his City Slickers also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'' in the episode which aired on November 15, 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |title=The Ford Show Guest Guide |publisher=ernieford.com |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128190749/http://ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |archivedate=November 28, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1990, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] screened six compilation shows from these broadcasts; they were subsequently aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations.

==Later years==
The decline of big bands and the rise of [[rock and roll]] in the early 1950s hurt Spike Jones' repertoire. Early rock songs were ''already'' novelties, and Jones could not satirise them the same way he had lampooned \"Cocktails for Two\", \"Chloe\" or \"Laura\". He played rock music for laughs when he presented \"for the first time on television, the bottom half of [[Elvis Presley]]!\" This was the cue for a pair of pants—inhabited by dwarf actor [[Billy Barty]]—to scamper across the stage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Jordan R. |year=2005 |title=Spike Jones Off the Record: The Man Who Murdered Music |edition=3rd |location=Albany |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=1-59393-012-7}}</ref>

Jones was always prepared to adapt to changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically looking back at the 1920s, Jones recorded a straight album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953, he responded to the growing market for children's records, with tunes aimed directly at kids (like \"Socko, the Smallest Snowball\"). Jones had become increasingly unhappy at RCA Victor due to management interfering with his choice of repertoire and other matters, and he left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by [[Verve Records|Verve]], [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] In 1956, Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of [[Lawrence Welk]] and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun. The last City Slickers record was the LP ''[[Dinner Music for People Who Aren't Very Hungry]]''. The whole field of comedy records changed from musical satires to spoken-word comedy ([[Bob Newhart]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Stan Freberg]]). Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup ''[[Spike Jones in Stereo]]'' (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in ''Omnibust'' (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones's New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including \"Washington Square\" and \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\"). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of \"[[Dominique]]\", a hit by [[The Singing Nun]], in which he not only plays part of the melody on a [[banjo]] but melds the melody successfully with \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]!\"

Jones was a lifelong heavy smoker, reportedly 4-5 packs a day, and eventually he developed [[emphysema]]. Never a very healthy person, his health would deteriorate to the point where he had to use an oxygen tank both offstage and onstage, and he was confined to a seat behind his drum set. In spite of his illness, he continued smoking for the rest of his life and he died in May 1965 at the age of 53. He is buried in [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]].

==Influence==
There is a clear line of influence from [[Harry Reser]]'s 1920s hot-comic \"Six Jumping Jacks\" band (whose drummer and vocalist was the distinctive [[Tom Stacks]], \"The Voice With a Smile\"), the [[Hoosier Hot Shots]], [[Freddie Fisher (musician)|Freddie Fisher]] and his [[Schnickelfritz Band|Schnickelfritzers]], and the [[Marx Brothers]] to Spike Jones&nbsp;— and to [[Stan Freberg]], [[Gerard Hoffnung]], [[Peter Schickele]]'s [[P.D.Q. Bach]], [[The Goons]], [[Joe Raposo]], [[Mr. Bungle]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], [[Oingo Boingo|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]], and [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]. [[Billy Barty]] appeared in Yankovic's film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and a video based on the movie. According to David Wild's review in Rolling Stone Magazine, [[Elvis Costello]]'s 1989 Album \"[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]\" was named partly in tribute to Jones.

Syndicated radio personality [[Dr. Demento]] regularly features Jones' music on his program of comedy and novelty tracks. Jones is mentioned in [[The Band]]'s song, \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\". (The song's protagonist's paramour states of Jones: \"I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.\") Novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]] is an admirer and wrote the liner notes for a 1994 reissue, ''Spiked!'' (BMG Catalyst). A scene in the romantic comedy ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'' shows a man demonstrating the sound of his new stereo to [[Meg Ryan]]'s character by playing a record of Jones' music.

In 1974, Tony Levin (future bass player for King Crimson), recording under the name, The Clams, released a Spike Jones tribute of him giving the songs, \"Close To You\", by The Carpenters, and, \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\", by Roberta Flack, the Jones treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/thb404f|title=The Clams - Close To You|website=45cat.com|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 1986, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[synthpop]] group [[Telex (band)|Telex]] paid homage to Spike Jones in their album ''Looney Tunes'', with a song named after him. The intro of that song is a part of the intro from ''Camptown Races''.

In 1997, singers [[Artie Schroeck]] and [[Linda November]] directed a production in [[Atlantic City]] entitled \"The New City Slickers Present a Tribute to Spike Jones\", with a band that attempted to re-create the style and humor of Jones' music.<ref name=musician>{{cite news|title=He's a serious musician in search of funny sounds|url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-09-26/entertainment/25552440_1_spike-jones-music-big-bands|date=September 26, 1997|author=Lloyd, Jack|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527140520/http://articles.philly.com/1997-09-26/entertainment/25552440_1_spike-jones-music-big-bands |archivedate=May 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrating Spike Jones at Harrah's|date=September 21, 1997|author=Alexander, Randy|work=[[The Times (New Jersey)|The Times]]}}</ref>

[[Image:Thylakoid2.png|thumb|240px|Thylakoids (dark green) inside a chloroplast]]
'''Thylakoids''' are membrane-bound compartments inside [[chloroplast]]s and [[cyanobacterium|cyanobacteria]]. They are the site of the [[light-dependent reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]]. Thylakoids consist of a '''thylakoid membrane''' surrounding a '''thylakoid [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]'''. Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as '''grana''' (singular: '''granum'''). Grana are connected by intergranal/ stroma thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment.

==Structure==

Thylakoids are membrane-bound structures embedded in the chloroplast [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]]. A stack of thylakoids is called a granum and resembles a stack of coins.

===Membrane===
The '''thylakoid membrane''' is the site of the [[light-dependent reactions]] of photosynthesis with the [[photosynthetic pigment]]s embedded directly in the membrane. It is an alternating pattern of dark and light bands measuring each 1 [[nanometre]].<ref>\"Photosynthesis\" McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 10th ed. 2007. Vol. 13 p. 469</ref>  The thylakoid lipid bilayer shares characteristic features with prokaryotic membranes and the inner chloroplast membrane. For example, acidic lipids can be found in thylakoid membranes, cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria and are involved in the functional integrity of the photosystems.<ref name=\"Sato\">{{cite journal |author=Sato N |title=Roles of the acidic lipids sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol in photosynthesis: their specificity and evolution |journal=J Plant Res |volume=117 |pages=495–505 |year=2004 |pmid=15538651 |doi=10.1007/s10265-004-0183-1 |issue=6}}</ref> The thylakoid membranes of higher plants are composed primarily of [[phospholipids]]<ref>\"photosynthesis.\"Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008.

===Lumen===
The '''thylakoid lumen''' is a continuous aqueous phase enclosed by the [[thylakoid membrane]]. It plays an important role for [[photophosphorylation]] during [[photosynthesis]]. During the light-dependent reaction, protons are pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen making it acidic down to pH 4.

===Granum and stroma lamellae===

In higher plants thylakoids are organized into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A '''granum''' (plural '''grana''') is a stack of thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or '''lamellae'''. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of [[electron tomography]] imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed [[helix]] is debated.<ref name=\"Mustardy\">{{cite journal |title=The Three-Dimensional Network of the Thylakoid Membranes in Plants: Quasihelical Model of the Granum-Stroma Assembly | journal=Plant Cell |volume=20 |pages=2552–2557 |year=2008 |author=Mustárdy, L. |author2=Buttle, K. |author3=Steinbach, G. |author4=Garab, G. |doi=10.1105/tpc.108.059147 |pmid=18952780 |issue=10 |pmc=2590735}}</ref>

==Formation==
Chloroplasts develop from [[proplastid]]s when [[seedling]]s emerge from the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo and in the absence of light, proplastids develop into [[etioplast]]s that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo [[etiolation]]. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.

Thylakoid formation requires the action of ''vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1'' (VIPP1). Plants cannot survive without this protein, and reduced VIPP1 levels lead to slower growth and paler plants with reduced ability to photosynthesize. VIPP1 appears to be required for basic thylakoid membrane formation, but not for the assembly of protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vipp1 is required for basic thylakoid membrane formation but not for the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes |journal=Plant Physiol Biochem |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=119–28 |year=2007 |pmid=17346982 |doi=10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.01.005 |author1=Elena Aseeva |author2=Friederich Ossenbühl |author3=Claudia Sippel |author4=Won K.

===Integral membrane proteins===
Thylakoid membranes contain [[integral membrane protein]]s which play an important role in light harvesting and the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane:
*[[Photosystem]]s [[Photosystem I|I]] and [[Photosystem II|II]]
*[[Cytochrome b6f complex]]
*[[ATP synthase]]

Photosystem II is located mostly in the grana thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of grana. The cytochrome b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron carriers are required to shuttle electrons between them. These carriers are plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.

Together, these proteins make use of light energy to drive [[electron transport chain]]s that generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] across the thylakoid membrane and [[NADPH]], a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction. The [[ATP synthase]] uses the chemiosmotic potential to make [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] during [[photophosphorylation]].

====Photosystems====
{{main|Photosystem}}

These photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each consisting of an [[antenna complex]] that uses [[chlorophyll]]s and accessory [[photosynthetic pigment]]s such as [[carotenoids]] and [[phycobiliprotein]]s to harvest light at a variety of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll ''a'' at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. '''Photosystem I''' contains a pair of chlorophyll ''a'' molecules, designated [[P700]], at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700&nbsp;nm light. '''Photosystem II''' contains [[P680]] chlorophyll that absorbs 680&nbsp;nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red – see the [[visible spectrum]]). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.

====Cytochrome b6f complex====
{{main|Cytochrome b6f complex}}
The cytochrome b6f complex is part of the thylakoid electron transport chain and couples electron transfer to the pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen. Energetically, it is situated between the two photosystems and transfers electrons from photosystem II-plastoquinone to plastocyanin-photosystem I.

====ATP synthase====
{{main|ATP synthase}}
The thylakoid ATP synthase is a CF1FO-ATP synthase similar to the mitochondrial ATPase. It is integrated into the thylakoid membrane with the CF1-part sticking into stroma. Thus, ATP synthesis occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoids where the ATP is needed for the [[light-independent reaction]]s of photosynthesis.

===Lumen proteins===
The electron transport protein [[plastocyanin]] is present in the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I. While plastoquinones are lipid-soluble and therefore move within the thylakoid membrane, plastocyanin moves through the thylakoid lumen.

The lumen of the thylakoids is also the site of water oxidation by the [[oxygen evolving complex]] associated with the lumenal side of photosystem II.

Lumenal proteins can be predicted computationally based on their targeting signals. In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted lumenal proteins possessing the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat]] signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (proteolysis and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.<ref name=\"Peltier2002\"/>

===Protein expression===
Chloroplasts have their own [[genome]], which encodes a number of thylakoid proteins. However, during the course of plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the [[cell nucleus]] took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper [[stoichiometry]] and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by [[light]]. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by [[phosphorylation]] via redox-sensitive [[kinase]]s in the thylakoid membranes.<ref name=\"Vener\">{{cite journal |title=Protein phosphorylation and redox sensing in chloroplast thylakoids |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=217–23 |year=1998 |pmid=10066592 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(98)80107-6 |author1=Vener AV |author2=Ohad I |author3=Andersson B |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> The [[translation (biology)|translation]] rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by the presence or absence of assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis).<ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite journal |title=Assembly-controlled regulation of chloroplast gene translation |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=29 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=421–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11498001 |doi=10.1042/BST0290421 |author1=Choquet Y |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Rimbault B |author4=Zito F |author5=Girard-Bascou J |author6=Drapier D |author7=Wollman F |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This mechanism involves [[negative feedback]] through binding of excess protein to the 5' untranslated region of the chloroplast [[mRNA]].<ref name=\"Minai\">{{cite journal |title=Chloroplast Biogenesis of Photosystem II Cores Involves a Series of Assembly-Controlled Steps That Regulate Translation |journal=Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=159–75 |year=2006 |pmid=16339851 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.037705 |author1=Minai L |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Wollman F |author4=Choquet Y |name-list-format=vanc |pmc=1323491}}</ref> Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain.

===Protein targeting to the thylakoids===
[[Image:Thylakoid targeting.png|thumb|left|250px|Schematic representation of thylakoid protein targeting pathways.<ref name=\"Gutensohn\" />]]
Thylakoid proteins are targeted to their destination via [[signal peptide]]s and prokaryotic-type [[secretory pathway]]s inside the chloroplast. Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), followed by a thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane ([[TIC/TOC complex|Toc and Tic]]) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat-dependent pathway]] (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin [[arginine]] motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP ([[signal recognition particle]]) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins as well as those that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.<ref name=\"Gutensohn\">{{cite journal |title=Toc, Tic, Tat et al.: structure and function of protein transport machineries in chloroplasts |journal=J.

==Function==
[[Image:Thylakoid membrane 3.svg|thumb|300px|Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane]]
The thylakoids are the site of the [[light-dependent reactions]] of photosynthesis. These include light-driven water oxidation and [[oxygen evolution]], the pumping of protons across the thylakoid membranes coupled with the electron transport chain of the photosystems and cytochrome complex, and ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase utilizing the generated proton gradient.

===Water photolysis===
{{main|photolysis}}
The first step in photosynthesis is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons for the establishment of a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems. This oxidation of water conveniently produces the waste product O<sub>2</sub> that is vital for [[cellular respiration]]. The molecular oxygen formed by the reaction is released into the atmosphere.

===Electron transport chains===
{{main|electron transport chain}}
Two different variations of electron transport are used during photosynthesis:
* '''Noncyclic electron transport''' or '''Non-cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> and ATP.
* '''Cyclic electron transport''' or '''Cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces only ATP.

The noncyclic variety involves the participation of both photosystems, while the cyclic electron flow is dependent on only photosystem I.

* '''Photosystem I''' uses light energy to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH + H<sup>+</sup>, and is active in both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport. In cyclic mode, the energized electron is passed down a chain that ultimately returns it (in its base state) to the chlorophyll that energized it.
* '''Photosystem II''' uses light energy to oxidize water molecules, producing electrons (e<sup>−</sup>), protons (H<sup>+</sup>), and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and is only active in noncyclic transport. Electrons in this system are not conserved, but are rather continually entering from oxidized 2H<sub>2</sub>O (O<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 4 e<sup>−</sup>) and exiting with NADP<sup>+</sup> when it is finally reduced to NADPH.

===Chemiosmosis===
{{main|chemiosmosis}}
A major function of the thylakoid membrane and its integral photosystems is the establishment of chemiosmotic potential. The carriers in the electron transport chain use some of the electron's energy to actively transport protons from the [[stromal cell|stroma]] to the [[thylakoid lumen|lumen]]. During photosynthesis, the lumen becomes [[acidic]], as low as pH 4, compared to pH 8 in the stroma.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jagendorf A. T. and E. Uribe|title=ATP formation caused by acid-base transition of spinach chloroplasts.|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|date=1966|volume=55|issue=1|pages=170–177|doi=10.1073/pnas.55.1.170|pmid=5220864|pmc=285771}}</ref> This represents a 10,000 fold concentration gradient for [[proton]]s across the thylakoid membrane.

====Source of proton gradient====
The protons in the lumen come from three primary sources.
*[[Photolysis]] by [[photosystem II]] oxidises water to [[oxygen]], protons and [[electron]]s in the lumen.
*The transfer of electrons from photosystem II to [[plastoquinone]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|non-cyclic electron transport]] consumes two protons from the stroma. These are released in the lumen when the reduced plastoquinol is oxidized by the cytochrome b6f protein complex on the lumen side of the thylakoid membrane. From the plastoquinone pool, electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f complex. This integral membrane assembly resembles cytochrome bc1.
* The reduction of [[plastoquinone]] by [[ferredoxin]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|cyclic electron transport]] also transfers two protons from the stroma to the lumen.
The proton gradient is also caused by the consumptions of protons in the stroma to make NADPH from NADP+ at the NADP reductase.

====ATP generation====
The molecular mechanism of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts is similar to that in [[mitochondria]] and takes the required energy from the [[proton motive force]] (PMF).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, chloroplasts rely more on the [[chemical potential]] of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane [[electrical potential]] (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher [[membrane potential]] due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting [[chemiosmotic potential]] between the lumen and [[stromal cell|stroma]] is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the [[ATP synthase]]. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in [[ATP synthase]], ADP + P<sub>i</sub> are combined into ATP. In this manner, the [[light-dependent reactions]] are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria==
[[File:Synechocystis.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoids (green) inside a cyanobacterium (''Synechocystis'')]]
[[Cyanobacteria]] are photosynthetic prokaryotes with highly differentiated membrane systems.  Cyanobacteria have an internal system of thylakoid membranes where the fully functional electron transfer chains of [[photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reside.  The presence of different membrane systems lends these cells a unique complexity among [[bacteria]].  Cyanobacteria must be able to reorganize the membranes, synthesize new membrane lipids, and properly target proteins to the correct membrane system.  The [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]], [[plasma membrane]], and thylakoid membranes each have specialized roles in the cyanobacterial cell.  Understanding the organization, functionality, protein composition and dynamics of the membrane systems remains a great challenge in cyanobacterial cell biology.<ref name=Herrero>{{cite book | author = Herrero A and Flores E (editor). | title = The Cyanobacteria: Molecular Biology, Genomics and Evolution | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/cyan | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/cyan ] | isbn = 978-1-904455-15-8}}</ref>

[[Image:Thylakoid2.png|thumb|240px|Thylakoids (dark green) inside a chloroplast]]
'''Thylakoids''' are membrane-bound compartments inside [[chloroplast]]s and [[cyanobacterium|cyanobacteria]]. They are the site of the [[light-dependent reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]]. Thylakoids consist of a '''thylakoid membrane''' surrounding a '''thylakoid [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]'''. Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as '''grana''' (singular: '''granum'''). Grana are connected by intergranal/ stroma thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment.

==Etymology==
The word ''Thylakoid'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''thylakos'' meaning \"sac\" or \"pouch\".<ref name=LSJ>{{LSJ|qu/lakos|θύλακος|ref}}</ref> Thus, ''thylakoid'' means \"sac-like\" or \"pouch-like\".

==Structure==
[[Image:Granum.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoid structures]]
[[Image:chloroplast in leaf of Anemone sp TEM 85000x.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] image of grana]]

Thylakoids are membrane-bound structures embedded in the chloroplast [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]]. A stack of thylakoids is called a granum and resembles a stack of coins.

===Membrane===
The '''thylakoid membrane''' is the site of the [[light-dependent reactions]] of photosynthesis with the [[photosynthetic pigment]]s embedded directly in the membrane. It is an alternating pattern of dark and light bands measuring each 1 [[nanometre]].<ref>\"Photosynthesis\" McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 10th ed. 2007. Vol. 13 p. 469</ref>  The thylakoid lipid bilayer shares characteristic features with prokaryotic membranes and the inner chloroplast membrane.

===Lumen===
The '''thylakoid lumen''' is a continuous aqueous phase enclosed by the [[thylakoid membrane]]. It plays an important role for [[photophosphorylation]] during [[photosynthesis]]. During the light-dependent reaction, protons are pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen making it acidic down to pH 4.

===Granum and stroma lamellae===

In higher plants thylakoids are organized into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A '''granum''' (plural '''grana''') is a stack of thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or '''lamellae'''. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of [[electron tomography]] imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed [[helix]] is debated.<ref name=\"Mustardy\">{{cite journal |title=The Three-Dimensional Network of the Thylakoid Membranes in Plants: Quasihelical Model of the Granum-Stroma Assembly | journal=Plant Cell |volume=20 |pages=2552–2557 |year=2008 |author=Mustárdy, L. |author2=Buttle, K. |author3=Steinbach, G. |author4=Garab, G. |doi=10.1105/tpc.108.059147 |pmid=18952780 |issue=10 |pmc=2590735}}</ref>

==Formation==
Chloroplasts develop from [[proplastid]]s when [[seedling]]s emerge from the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo and in the absence of light, proplastids develop into [[etioplast]]s that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo [[etiolation]]. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.

Thylakoid formation requires the action of ''vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1'' (VIPP1). Plants cannot survive without this protein, and reduced VIPP1 levels lead to slower growth and paler plants with reduced ability to photosynthesize. VIPP1 appears to be required for basic thylakoid membrane formation, but not for the assembly of protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vipp1 is required for basic thylakoid membrane formation but not for the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes |journal=Plant Physiol Biochem |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=119–28 |year=2007 |pmid=17346982 |doi=10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.01.005 |author1=Elena Aseeva |author2=Friederich Ossenbühl |author3=Claudia Sippel |author4=Won K.

Additional low-abundance lumenal proteins can be predicted through computational methods.<ref name=\"Peltier2002\"/><ref name=\"Peltier2000\">{{cite journal |title=Proteomics of the Chloroplast: Systematic Identification and Targeting Analysis of Lumenal and Peripheral Thylakoid Proteins |journal=Plant Cell |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=319–41 |year=2000 |pmid=10715320 |doi=10.1105/tpc.12.3.319 |author1=Peltier J |author2=Friso G |author3=Kalume D |author4=Roepstorff P |author5=Nilsson F |author6=Adamska I |author7=van Wijk K |name-list-format=vanc |pmc=139834}}</ref> Of the thylakoid proteins with known functions, 42% are involved in photosynthesis.

===Integral membrane proteins===
Thylakoid membranes contain [[integral membrane protein]]s which play an important role in light harvesting and the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane:
*[[Photosystem]]s [[Photosystem I|I]] and [[Photosystem II|II]]
*[[Cytochrome b6f complex]]
*[[ATP synthase]]

Photosystem II is located mostly in the grana thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of grana. The cytochrome b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron carriers are required to shuttle electrons between them. These carriers are plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.

Together, these proteins make use of light energy to drive [[electron transport chain]]s that generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] across the thylakoid membrane and [[NADPH]], a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction. The [[ATP synthase]] uses the chemiosmotic potential to make [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] during [[photophosphorylation]].

====Photosystems====
{{main|Photosystem}}

These photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each consisting of an [[antenna complex]] that uses [[chlorophyll]]s and accessory [[photosynthetic pigment]]s such as [[carotenoids]] and [[phycobiliprotein]]s to harvest light at a variety of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll ''a'' at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. '''Photosystem I''' contains a pair of chlorophyll ''a'' molecules, designated [[P700]], at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700&nbsp;nm light. '''Photosystem II''' contains [[P680]] chlorophyll that absorbs 680&nbsp;nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red – see the [[visible spectrum]]). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.

====Cytochrome b6f complex====
{{main|Cytochrome b6f complex}}
The cytochrome b6f complex is part of the thylakoid electron transport chain and couples electron transfer to the pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen. Energetically, it is situated between the two photosystems and transfers electrons from photosystem II-plastoquinone to plastocyanin-photosystem I.

====ATP synthase====
{{main|ATP synthase}}
The thylakoid ATP synthase is a CF1FO-ATP synthase similar to the mitochondrial ATPase. It is integrated into the thylakoid membrane with the CF1-part sticking into stroma. Thus, ATP synthesis occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoids where the ATP is needed for the [[light-independent reaction]]s of photosynthesis.

===Lumen proteins===
The electron transport protein [[plastocyanin]] is present in the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I. While plastoquinones are lipid-soluble and therefore move within the thylakoid membrane, plastocyanin moves through the thylakoid lumen.

The lumen of the thylakoids is also the site of water oxidation by the [[oxygen evolving complex]] associated with the lumenal side of photosystem II.

Lumenal proteins can be predicted computationally based on their targeting signals. In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted lumenal proteins possessing the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat]] signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (proteolysis and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.<ref name=\"Peltier2002\"/>

===Protein expression===
Chloroplasts have their own [[genome]], which encodes a number of thylakoid proteins. However, during the course of plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the [[cell nucleus]] took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper [[stoichiometry]] and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by [[light]]. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by [[phosphorylation]] via redox-sensitive [[kinase]]s in the thylakoid membranes.<ref name=\"Vener\">{{cite journal |title=Protein phosphorylation and redox sensing in chloroplast thylakoids |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=217–23 |year=1998 |pmid=10066592 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(98)80107-6 |author1=Vener AV |author2=Ohad I |author3=Andersson B |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> The [[translation (biology)|translation]] rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by the presence or absence of assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis).<ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite journal |title=Assembly-controlled regulation of chloroplast gene translation |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=29 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=421–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11498001 |doi=10.1042/BST0290421 |author1=Choquet Y |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Rimbault B |author4=Zito F |author5=Girard-Bascou J |author6=Drapier D |author7=Wollman F |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This mechanism involves [[negative feedback]] through binding of excess protein to the 5' untranslated region of the chloroplast [[mRNA]].<ref name=\"Minai\">{{cite journal |title=Chloroplast Biogenesis of Photosystem II Cores Involves a Series of Assembly-Controlled Steps That Regulate Translation |journal=Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=159–75 |year=2006 |pmid=16339851 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.037705 |author1=Minai L |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Wollman F |author4=Choquet Y |name-list-format=vanc |pmc=1323491}}</ref> Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain.

===Protein targeting to the thylakoids===
[[Image:Thylakoid targeting.png|thumb|left|250px|Schematic representation of thylakoid protein targeting pathways.<ref name=\"Gutensohn\" />]]
Thylakoid proteins are targeted to their destination via [[signal peptide]]s and prokaryotic-type [[secretory pathway]]s inside the chloroplast. Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), followed by a thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane ([[TIC/TOC complex|Toc and Tic]]) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat-dependent pathway]] (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin [[arginine]] motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP ([[signal recognition particle]]) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins as well as those that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.<ref name=\"Gutensohn\">{{cite journal |title=Toc, Tic, Tat et al.: structure and function of protein transport machineries in chloroplasts |journal=J.

==Function==
[[Image:Thylakoid membrane 3.svg|thumb|300px|Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane]]
The thylakoids are the site of the [[light-dependent reactions]] of photosynthesis. These include light-driven water oxidation and [[oxygen evolution]], the pumping of protons across the thylakoid membranes coupled with the electron transport chain of the photosystems and cytochrome complex, and ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase utilizing the generated proton gradient.

===Water photolysis===
{{main|photolysis}}
The first step in photosynthesis is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons for the establishment of a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems. This oxidation of water conveniently produces the waste product O<sub>2</sub> that is vital for [[cellular respiration]]. The molecular oxygen formed by the reaction is released into the atmosphere.

===Electron transport chains===
{{main|electron transport chain}}
Two different variations of electron transport are used during photosynthesis:
* '''Noncyclic electron transport''' or '''Non-cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> and ATP.
* '''Cyclic electron transport''' or '''Cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces only ATP.

The noncyclic variety involves the participation of both photosystems, while the cyclic electron flow is dependent on only photosystem I.

* '''Photosystem I''' uses light energy to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH + H<sup>+</sup>, and is active in both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport. In cyclic mode, the energized electron is passed down a chain that ultimately returns it (in its base state) to the chlorophyll that energized it.
* '''Photosystem II''' uses light energy to oxidize water molecules, producing electrons (e<sup>−</sup>), protons (H<sup>+</sup>), and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and is only active in noncyclic transport. Electrons in this system are not conserved, but are rather continually entering from oxidized 2H<sub>2</sub>O (O<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 4 e<sup>−</sup>) and exiting with NADP<sup>+</sup> when it is finally reduced to NADPH.

===Chemiosmosis===
{{main|chemiosmosis}}
A major function of the thylakoid membrane and its integral photosystems is the establishment of chemiosmotic potential. The carriers in the electron transport chain use some of the electron's energy to actively transport protons from the [[stromal cell|stroma]] to the [[thylakoid lumen|lumen]]. During photosynthesis, the lumen becomes [[acidic]], as low as pH 4, compared to pH 8 in the stroma.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jagendorf A. T. and E. Uribe|title=ATP formation caused by acid-base transition of spinach chloroplasts.|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|date=1966|volume=55|issue=1|pages=170–177|doi=10.1073/pnas.55.1.170|pmid=5220864|pmc=285771}}</ref> This represents a 10,000 fold concentration gradient for [[proton]]s across the thylakoid membrane.

====Source of proton gradient====
The protons in the lumen come from three primary sources.
*[[Photolysis]] by [[photosystem II]] oxidises water to [[oxygen]], protons and [[electron]]s in the lumen.
*The transfer of electrons from photosystem II to [[plastoquinone]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|non-cyclic electron transport]] consumes two protons from the stroma. These are released in the lumen when the reduced plastoquinol is oxidized by the cytochrome b6f protein complex on the lumen side of the thylakoid membrane. From the plastoquinone pool, electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f complex. This integral membrane assembly resembles cytochrome bc1.
* The reduction of [[plastoquinone]] by [[ferredoxin]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|cyclic electron transport]] also transfers two protons from the stroma to the lumen.
The proton gradient is also caused by the consumptions of protons in the stroma to make NADPH from NADP+ at the NADP reductase.

====ATP generation====
The molecular mechanism of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts is similar to that in [[mitochondria]] and takes the required energy from the [[proton motive force]] (PMF).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, chloroplasts rely more on the [[chemical potential]] of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane [[electrical potential]] (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher [[membrane potential]] due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting [[chemiosmotic potential]] between the lumen and [[stromal cell|stroma]] is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the [[ATP synthase]]. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in [[ATP synthase]], ADP + P<sub>i</sub> are combined into ATP. In this manner, the [[light-dependent reactions]] are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria==
[[File:Synechocystis.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoids (green) inside a cyanobacterium (''Synechocystis'')]]
[[Cyanobacteria]] are photosynthetic prokaryotes with highly differentiated membrane systems.  Cyanobacteria have an internal system of thylakoid membranes where the fully functional electron transfer chains of [[photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reside.  The presence of different membrane systems lends these cells a unique complexity among [[bacteria]].  Cyanobacteria must be able to reorganize the membranes, synthesize new membrane lipids, and properly target proteins to the correct membrane system.  The [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]], [[plasma membrane]], and thylakoid membranes each have specialized roles in the cyanobacterial cell.  Understanding the organization, functionality, protein composition and dynamics of the membrane systems remains a great challenge in cyanobacterial cell biology.<ref name=Herrero>{{cite book | author = Herrero A and Flores E (editor). | title = The Cyanobacteria: Molecular Biology, Genomics and Evolution | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/cyan | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/cyan ] | isbn = 978-1-904455-15-8}}</ref>

Warrick County is the eastern part of the [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]], [[Indiana|IN]]–[[Kentucky|KY]] [[Evansville, IN-KY Metropolitan Statistical Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Warrick County was formed by statute, March 9, 1813, effective April 30, 1813. Knox County was affected by this formation and Warrick and [[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson]] Counties were both created out of this area of Knox County between the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] and the [[Ohio River]]. The boundaries of this area began at the mouth of the Wabash River; then up the Wabash River with the meanders thereof to the mouth of the White River; then up the White River with the meanders thereof to the Forks of the White River; then up  White River East Fork to where the line between Sections 20 and 29, Township 1 North, Range 4 West, strikes the same; then with that line to the then Gibson County line; then with that line dividing Gibson and Knox Counties to the Ohio River; then down the Ohio River, to the place of beginning.
The same was divided into two separate and distinct counties, by a line beginning on the Wabash River, known as Rector's Base Line (was surveyed by William Rector on the line between Townships 4 South and 5 South, from New Harmony, Posey County, and Alton, Crawford County, Indiana), and with that line east until it intersects the then Gibson County line and that tract of land falling within the southern division thereof was Warrick County. However, because Gibson County organized a month earlier on April 1, this entire territory fell under Gibson County's jurisdiction. Within Warrick County's original jurisdiction included large portions but not entire portions of Crawford, Perry, Posey, Vanderburgh, and roughly 2/3s of Warrick County's current jurisdiction. Evansville was the original county seat, followed by Yankeetown, Newburgh, and finally Boonville, the current seat.<ref>Indiana Atlas of Historical County Boundaries.

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts, and three are elected as \"at-large\" members. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[surveying|surveyor]], assessor, and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

== Education ==

The county's school corporation is [[Warrick County School Corporation]] which consists of 16 schools (two high schools, one senior/junior high, three middle schools, ten elementary schools, and one alternative school).  In the Fall of 2009, the corporation transitioned its stand-alone Junior High schools in the Boonville and Castle High School Districts from the Junior High system to the Middle School system, with the addition of one middle school (Castle South Middle School) in the Castle District.  Castle Junior High was renamed Castle North Middle School.  Warrick County's three middle schools are composed of grades six through eight.

Warrick County is the eastern part of the [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]], [[Indiana|IN]]&ndash;[[Kentucky|KY]] [[Evansville, IN-KY Metropolitan Statistical Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Warrick County was formed by statute, March 9, 1813, effective April 30, 1813. Knox County was affected by this formation and Warrick and [[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson]] Counties were both created out of this area of Knox County between the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] and the [[Ohio River]]. The boundaries of this area began at the mouth of the Wabash River; then up the Wabash River with the meanders thereof to the mouth of the White River; then up the White River with the meanders thereof to the Forks of the White River; then up  White River East Fork to where the line between Sections 20 and 29, Township 1 North, Range 4 West, strikes the same; then with that line to the then Gibson County line; then with that line dividing Gibson and Knox Counties to the Ohio River; then down the Ohio River, to the place of beginning.
The same was divided into two separate and distinct counties, by a line beginning on the Wabash River, known as Rector's Base Line (was surveyed by William Rector on the line between Townships 4 South and 5 South, from New Harmony, Posey County, and Alton, Crawford County, Indiana), and with that line east until it intersects the then Gibson County line and that tract of land falling within the southern division thereof was Warrick County. However, because Gibson County organized a month earlier on April 1, this entire territory fell under Gibson County's jurisdiction. Within Warrick County's original jurisdiction included large portions but not entire portions of Crawford, Perry, Posey, Vanderburgh, and roughly 2/3s of Warrick County's current jurisdiction. Evansville was the original county seat, followed by Yankeetown, Newburgh, and finally Boonville, the current seat.<ref>Indiana Atlas of Historical County Boundaries.  New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1996.  pp. 209-216.</ref>

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts, and three are elected as \"at-large\" members. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[surveying|surveyor]], assessor, and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

== Education ==

The county's school corporation is [[Warrick County School Corporation]] which consists of 16 schools (two high schools, one senior/junior high, three middle schools, ten elementary schools, and one alternative school).  In the Fall of 2009, the corporation transitioned its stand-alone Junior High schools in the Boonville and Castle High School Districts from the Junior High system to the Middle School system, with the addition of one middle school (Castle South Middle School) in the Castle District.  Castle Junior High was renamed Castle North Middle School.  Warrick County's three middle schools are composed of grades six through eight.

'''''El Cuatrero''''' (born 1996) is a Mexican ''[[Lucha libre|luchador]] enmascarado'', or [[wrestling mask|masked]] [[professional wrestler]] currently working for ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (CMLL) based in Mexico City. He is the son of ''lucha libre'' legend [[Cien Caras]] and the nephew of [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Universo 2000]]. Cuatrero, his brother [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] and their cousin [[Forastero]] form a trio known as ''Nueva Generación Dinamitas'' (\"New Generation Dynamites\"), the successor to ''[[Los Capos|Los Hermanos Dinamita]]'' (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000). His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.<ref name=Mondo>{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29–40|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> His [[ring name]] is Spanish for \"The Horse thief\" or  \"The [[Cattle rustler|Rustler]]\", reflected in the cowboy-inspired ring gear and mask he wears during shows.

El Cuatrero is the current [[CMLL World Middleweight Champion]] and at one point held four championships simultaneously, which included the [[CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship]] (with Sansón), the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] (with Sansón and Forastero) and the Occidente Trios Championship (with Sansón and Forastero). He won the mask of [[Ángel de Oro]] in the main event of CMLL's 2018 ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' show on March&nbsp;16, 2018.

==Personal life==
El Cuatrero was born in 1996, a son of [[professional wrestler]] Carmelo Reyes González, better known under the [[ring name]] [[Cien Caras]] (\"100 Faces\"). His older brother, known under the name [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] (\"[[Samson]]\") was born in 1994. His uncles Jesús (known as [[Máscara Año 2000]]) and Andrés ([[Universo 2000]]) were also professional wrestlers.<ref name=MondoFamily/> Several of their sons followed their fathers into professional wrestling, including [[Forastero]], [[Universo 2000 Jr.]] and [[Máscara Año 2000 Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/08/05/wagner-destapo-a-mascara-2000-jr | title= Wagner destapó a Máscara 2000 Jr. | last=Rodríguez | first=Alejandro | date=August 5, 2012 | accessdate=February 19, 2013 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish | trans-title=Wagner unmasks Máscara 2000 Jr.}}</ref> Initially, Carmelo Reyes did not want his sons to become professional wrestlers, wanting them to get an education instead. He reluctantly agreed that they could train for ''Lucha Libre'' with their uncle Andrés, but only as a hobby. During their training, Carmelo noticed how serious they took it and reluctantly agreed with their choice to become professional wrestlers.<ref name=DivinasLuchas>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz7nTR_jZSE | title=Divinas de la lucha Cuatrero y Sansón | date=March 5, 2017 | accessdate=February 16, 2017 | first=Elisa | last=Tudón | work=Divinas de la Luchas | language=Spanish | trans-title=Divine fighters Cuatrero and Sanson}}</ref>

There is a long tradition of wrestlers paying for the right to use a ring name in Mexican wrestling, including being allowed to portray a second or third-generation wrestler without being related to the originator.<ref name=MondoFamily>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=[[HarperColins]] Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages = 128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> It has been confirmed that wrestlers [[Cien Caras Jr.]] and [[El Hijo de Cien Caras]] are unrelated to the Reyes family, while it is unclear if [[Hijo de Máscara Año 2000]] is a blood relative or a purely fictional relative.<ref name=Adios>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.com.mx/blog/el-hijo-del-santo/2010-12-02/el-adios-del-hijo-de-cien-caras |title=El adiós del Hijo de Cien Caras |authorlink=El Hijo del Santo | first=El | last=Hijo del Santo |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2013 |publisher=Récord.com |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204113931/http://www.record.com.mx/blog/el-hijo-del-santo/2010-12-02/el-adios-del-hijo-de-cien-caras |archivedate=December 4, 2010 |trans-title=Goodbye to El Hijo de Cien Caras}}</ref> Reyes later stated that he allowed the \"Cien Caras\" name to be rented by other wrestlers as his sons were very young and might not want to become professional wrestlers.<ref name=MedioIntro/>

'''''El Cuatrero''''' (born 1996) is a Mexican ''[[Lucha libre|luchador]] enmascarado'', or [[wrestling mask|masked]] [[professional wrestler]] currently working for ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (CMLL) based in Mexico City. He is the son of ''lucha libre'' legend [[Cien Caras]] and the nephew of [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Universo 2000]]. Cuatrero, his brother [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] and their cousin [[Forastero]] form a trio known as ''Nueva Generación Dinamitas'' (\"New Generation Dynamites\"), the successor to ''[[Los Capos|Los Hermanos Dinamita]]'' (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000). His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.<ref name=Mondo>{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29–40|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> His [[ring name]] is Spanish for \"The Horse thief\" or  \"The [[Cattle rustler|Rustler]]\", reflected in the cowboy-inspired ring gear and mask he wears during shows.

El Cuatrero is the current [[CMLL World Middleweight Champion]] and at one point held four championships simultaneously, which included the [[CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship]] (with Sansón), the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] (with Sansón and Forastero) and the Occidente Trios Championship (with Sansón and Forastero). He won the mask of [[Ángel de Oro]] in the main event of CMLL's 2018 ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' show on March&nbsp;16, 2018.

==Personal life==
El Cuatrero was born in 1996, son of [[professional wrestler]] Carmelo Reyes González, better known under the [[ring name]] [[Cien Caras]] (\"100 Faces\"). His older brother, known under the name [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] (\"[[Samson]]\") was born in 1994. His uncles Jesús (known as [[Máscara Año 2000]]) and Andrés ([[Universo 2000]]) were also professional wrestlers.<ref name=MondoFamily/> Several of their sons followed their fathers into professional wrestling, including [[Forastero]], [[Universo 2000 Jr.]] and [[Máscara Año 2000 Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/08/05/wagner-destapo-a-mascara-2000-jr | title= Wagner destapó a Máscara 2000 Jr. | last=Rodríguez | first=Alejandro | date=August 5, 2012 | accessdate=February 19, 2013 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish | trans-title=Wagner unmasks Máscara 2000 Jr.}}</ref> Initially, Carmelo Reyes did not want his sons to become professional wrestlers, wanting them to get an education.

'''''El Cuatrero''''' (born 1996) is a Mexican ''[[Lucha libre|luchador]] enmascarado'', or [[wrestling mask|masked]] [[professional wrestler]] currently working for ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (CMLL) based in Mexico City. He is the son of ''lucha libre'' legend [[Cien Caras]] and the nephew of [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Universo 2000]]. Cuatrero, his brother [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] and their cousin [[Forastero]] form a trio known as ''Nueva Generación Dinamitas'' (\"New Generation Dynamites\"), the successor to ''[[Los Capos|Los Hermanos Dinamita]]'' (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000). His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.<ref name=Mondo>{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29–40|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> His [[ring name]] is Spanish for \"The Horse thief\" or  \"The [[Cattle rustler|Rustler]]\", reflected in the cowboy-inspired ring gear and mask he wears during shows.

El Cuatrero is the current [[CMLL World Middleweight Champion]] and at one point held four championships simultaneously, which included the [[CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship]] (with Sansón), the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] (with Sansón and Forastero) and the Occidente Trios Championship (with Sansón and Forastero). He won the mask of [[Ángel de Oro]] in the main event of CMLL's 2018 ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' show on March&nbsp;16, 2018.

==Personal life==
El Cuatrero was born in 1996, a son of [[professional wrestler]] Carmelo Reyes González, better known under the [[ring name]] [[Cien Caras]] (\"100 Faces\"). His older brother, known under the name [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] (\"[[Samson]]\") was born in 1994. His uncles Jesús (known as [[Máscara Año 2000]]) and Andrés ([[Universo 2000]]) were also professional wrestlers.<ref name=MondoFamily/> Several of their sons followed their fathers into professional wrestling, including [[Forastero]], [[Universo 2000 Jr.]] and [[Máscara Año 2000 Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/08/05/wagner-destapo-a-mascara-2000-jr | title= Wagner destapó a Máscara 2000 Jr. | last=Rodríguez | first=Alejandro | date=August 5, 2012 | accessdate=February 19, 2013 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish | trans-title=Wagner unmasks Máscara 2000 Jr.}}</ref> Initially, Carmelo Reyes did not want his sons to become professional wrestlers, wanting them to get an education instead. He reluctantly agreed that they could train for ''Lucha Libre'' with their uncle Andrés, but only as a hobby. During their training, Carmelo noticed how serious they took it and reluctantly agreed with their choice to become professional wrestlers.<ref name=DivinasLuchas>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz7nTR_jZSE | title=Divinas de la lucha Cuatrero y Sansón | date=March 5, 2017 | accessdate=February 16, 2017 | first=Elisa | last=Tudón | work=Divinas de la Luchas | language=Spanish | trans-title=Divine fighters Cuatrero and Sanson}}</ref>

There is a long tradition of wrestlers paying for the right to use a ring name in Mexican wrestling, including being allowed to portray a second or third-generation wrestler without being related to the originator.<ref name=MondoFamily>{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages = 128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> It has been confirmed that wrestlers [[Cien Caras Jr.]] and [[El Hijo de Cien Caras]] are unrelated to the Reyes family, while it is unclear if [[Hijo de Máscara Año 2000]] is a blood relative or a purely fictional relative.<ref name=Adios>{{cite web|url=http://www.record.com.mx/blog/el-hijo-del-santo/2010-12-02/el-adios-del-hijo-de-cien-caras |title=El adiós del Hijo de Cien Caras |authorlink=El Hijo del Santo | first=El | last=Hijo del Santo |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2013 |publisher=Récord.com |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204113931/http://www.record.com.mx/blog/el-hijo-del-santo/2010-12-02/el-adios-del-hijo-de-cien-caras |archivedate=December 4, 2010 |trans-title=Goodbye to El Hijo de Cien Caras}}</ref> Reyes later stated that he allowed the \"Cien Caras\" name to be rented by other wrestlers as his sons were very young and might not want to become professional wrestlers.<ref name=MedioIntro/>

'''''El Cuatrero''''' (born 1996) is a Mexican ''[[Lucha libre|luchador]] enmascarado'', or [[wrestling mask|masked]] [[professional wrestler]] currently working for ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (CMLL) based in Mexico City. He is the son of ''lucha libre'' legend [[Cien Caras]] and the nephew of [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Universo 2000]]. Cuatrero, his brother [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] and their cousin [[Forastero]] form a trio known as ''Nueva Generación Dinamitas'' (\"New Generation Dynamites\"), the successor to ''[[Los Capos|Los Hermanos Dinamita]]'' (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000). His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.<ref name=Mondo>{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Okay... what is Lucha Libre? | pages = 29–40|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> His [[ring name]] is Spanish for \"The Horse thief\" or  \"The [[Cattle rustler|Rustler]]\", reflected in the cowboy-inspired ring gear and mask he wears during shows.

El Cuatrero is the current [[CMLL World Middleweight Champion]] and at one point held four championships simultaneously, which included the [[CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship]] (with Sansón), the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] (with Sansón and Forastero) and the Occidente Trios Championship (with Sansón and Forastero). He won the mask of [[Ángel de Oro]] in the main event of CMLL's 2018 ''[[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]]'' show on March&nbsp;16, 2018.

==Personal life==
El Cuatrero was born in 1996, a son of [[professional wrestler]] Carmelo Reyes González, better known under the [[ring name]] [[Cien Caras]] (\"100 Faces\"). His older brother, known under the name [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] (\"[[Samson]]\") was born in 1994. His uncles Jesús (known as [[Máscara Año 2000]]) and Andrés ([[Universo 2000]]) were also professional wrestlers.<ref name=MondoFamily/> Several of their sons followed their fathers into professional wrestling, including [[Forastero]], [[Universo 2000 Jr.]] and [[Máscara Año 2000 Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/08/05/wagner-destapo-a-mascara-2000-jr | title= Wagner destapó a Máscara 2000 Jr. | last=Rodríguez | first=Alejandro | date=August 5, 2012 | accessdate=February 19, 2013 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish | trans-title=Wagner unmasks Máscara 2000 Jr.}}</ref> Initially, Carmelo Reyes did not want his sons to become professional wrestlers, wanting them to get an education instead.

An '''N95 mask''' or '''N95 respirator''' is a particulate-filtering facepiece [[respirator]] that meets the N95 standard of the U.S. [[NIOSH air filtration rating|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) air filtration rating]], meaning that it filters at least 95% of [[airborne particles]], while not resistant to [[oil]] like the P95. It is the most common particulate-filtering facepiece respirator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1-a.html|title=NIOSH-Approved N95 Particulate Filtering Facepiece Respirators - A Suppliers List|last=|first=|date=2020-03-19|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>  It is an example of a [[mechanical filter respirator]], which provides protection against [[particulates]], but not [[gas]]es or [[vapor]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource3selection.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source: Selection FAQs|last=|first=|date=2020-03-12|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>

N95 respirators are considered functionally equivalent to certain respirators regulated under non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as [[FFP mask|FFP2 respirators]] of the European Union and KN95 respirators of China.  However, slightly different criteria are used to certify their performance, such as the filter efficiency, test agent and flow rate, and permissible [[pressure drop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1791500O/comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes-tb.pdf|title=Comparison of FFP2, KN95, and N95 and Other Filtering Facepiece Respirator Classes|last=|first=|date=2020-01-01|website=3M Technical Data Bulletin|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />

[[File:Filtering out Confusion - Frequently Asked Questions about Respiratory Protection.pdf|thumb|Guidance for performing a user seal check, which is required every time a respirator is put on – click to enlarge]]

[[Respirator fit test|Fit testing]] is a critical component to a respiratory protection program whenever workers use tight-fitting respirators. OSHA requires an initial respirator fit test to identify the right model, style, and size respirator for each worker, as well as annual fit tests. Additionally, tight-fitting respirators, including the N95, require a user seal check each time one is put on.<ref name=\":0\" />

=== In industry ===
N95 respirators were originally designed for industrial use in sectors such as [[mining]], [[construction]], and [[Paint|painting]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://thedcapage.blog/2020/03/26/from-the-industrial-to-the-medical-evolution-of-the-n95-respirator/|title=From the Industrial to the Medical – Evolution of the N95 Respirator|last=Vargas|first=June|date=2020-03-26|website=[[California Department of Consumer Affairs]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

According to the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, respirators with filters in the N, R, and P series are recommended for concentrations of hazardous particulates that are greater than the relevant [[occupational exposure limit]] but less than the [[immediately dangerous to life or health]] level and the manufacturer's maximum use concentration, subject to the respirator having a sufficient [[Respirator assigned protection factors|assigned protection factor]].<ref name=\":8\" />

N series respirators, including the N95 mask, are only effective in the absence of oil particles, such as [[Lubricant|lubricants]], [[Cutting fluid|cutting fluids]], or [[Glycerol|glycerine]].  For substances hazardous to the eyes, a respirator equipped with a full facepiece, helmet, or hood is recommended.  They should not be used during [[firefighting]], in [[oxygen-deficient atmosphere]], or in an unknown atmosphere, as a [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] is recommended instead.  They should not be used with hazardous gases or vapors, for which a [[Cartridge (respirator)|cartridge respirator]] is recommended.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-100/default.html|title=NIOSH respirator selection logic|last=Bollinger|first=Nancy|date=2004-10-01|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=5–9|language=en-us|via=|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2005100|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

=== In healthcare ===
Respirators used in healthcare are traditionally a specific variant called a surgical respirator, which is both approved by NIOSH as a respirator and cleared by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] as a medical device similar to a [[surgical mask]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ohsonline.com/articles/2014/05/01/comparison-respiratory.aspx|title=A Comparison of Surgical Masks, Surgical N95 Respirators, and Industrial N95 Respirators|last=|first=|date=2014-05-01|website=Occupational Health & Safety|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  As part of the [[Families First Coronavirus Response Act]], changes were made to liability and certification laws to allow industrial respirators to be used in healthcare settings, in response to shortages of respirators during the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/19/change-us-law-will-make-millions-more-masks-available-doctors-nurses-white-house-says/|title=Change in U.S. law will make millions more masks available to doctors and nurses, White House says|last=Whalen|first=Jeanne|date=2020-03-20|website=Washington Post|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) requires healthcare workers who are expected to perform patient activities with those suspected or confirmed to be infected with [[COVID-19]] to wear respiratory protection, such as an N95 respirator.  Unlike a respirator, a [[surgical mask]] does not have an air-tight seal and thus does not protect its wearer against airborne particles such as virus material.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2020/03/16/n95-preparedness/|title=Proper N95 Respirator Use for Respiratory Protection Preparedness|last=D’Alessandro|first=Maryann M.|last2=Cichowicz|first2=Jaclyn Krah|date=2020-03-16|website=NIOSH Science Blog|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

==== Use during shortages ====
Under serious outbreak conditions in which respirator supplies are severely limited, workers should work with their employer to choose the respirator that fits best, as, even without fit testing, a respirator will provide better protection than a surgical mask or no mask.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In this case, best practices include trying different models or sizes to get a good face seal, checking manufacturer training videos and literature on proper donning and doffing, doing a user seal check several times, and checking the fit in a mirror or asking a colleague to look to be sure the respirator is touching the face.<ref name=\":0\" />

During crisis situations where there is a shortage of N95 respirators, such as the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]], the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has recommended strategies for optimizing their use in healthcare settings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html|title=Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Crisis/Alternate Strategies|last=|first=|date=2020-03-17|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>  N95 respirators can be used beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life, although components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal, making it particularly important that the wearer perform the expected seal check.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/release-stockpiled-N95.html|title=Release of Stockpiled N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Beyond the Manufacturer-Designated Shelf Life: Considerations for the COVID-19 Response|last=|first=|date=2020-02-28|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>  Respirators can be used that are approved under standards used in other countries that are similar to NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, including FFP2 and FFP3 respirators regulated by the [[European Union]].<ref name=\":1\" />  N95 respirators can be reused a limited number of times after being removed, as long as they have not been used during aerosol-generating procedures and are not contaminated with patients' bodily fluids, although this increases the risk of surface contamination with pathogens.  The respirator manufacturer may recommend a maximum number of donnings or uses; if no manufacturer guidance is available, preliminary data suggests limiting to five uses per device to ensure an adequate safety margin.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hcwcontrols/recommendedguidanceextuse.html|title=Recommended Guidance for Extended Use and Limited Reuse of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Healthcare Settings|last=|first=|date=2020-03-27|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>

When it is no longer possible for all healthcare workers to wear N95 respirators when caring for a COVID-19 patient, respirators should be prioritized for workers performing aerosol-generating procedures on symptomatic persons and those within three feet of an unmasked symptomatic person. Under these conditions, masking of symptomatic patients with a [[surgical mask]] and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission.  When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.  If neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, such as [[Cloth facemask|cloth facemasks]], though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\" />

Given that the global supply of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) is insufficient during the pandemic, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends minimizing the need for PPE through [[telemedicine]], physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE [[supply chain]], and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf|title=Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=2020-02-27|website=World Health Organization|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>

There have been efforts to evaluate cleaning methods for respirators in emergency shortages, although there is concern that this may reduce filter performance, or affect mask fit by deforming the mask.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Viscusi|first=Dennis J.|last2=Bergman|first2=Michael S.|last3=Eimer|first3=Benjamin C.|last4=Shaffer|first4=Ronald E.|date=November 2009|title=Evaluation of Five Decontamination Methods for Filtering Facepiece Respirators|journal=Annals of Occupational Hygiene|volume=53|issue=8|pages=815–827|doi=10.1093/annhyg/mep070|issn=0003-4878|pmc=2781738|pmid=19805391}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://stanfordmedicine.app.box.com/v/covid19-PPE-1-2|title=Addressing COVID-19 Face Mask Shortages|last=|first=|date=2020-03-25|website=Stanford University School of Medicine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/sanitizing-medical-masks-for-reuse-coronavirus.html|title=Doctors scramble for best practices on reusing medical masks during shortage|last=March 2020|first=Rafi Letzter – Staff Writer |website=livescience.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>  [[Duke University]] researchers have published a method for cleaning N95 respirators without damaging them using vaporized [[hydrogen peroxide]] to allow reuse for a limited number of times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.safety.duke.edu/sites/default/files/N-95_VHP-Decon-Re-Use.pdf|title=Decontamination and Reuse of N95 Respirators with Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor to Address Worldwide Personal Protective Equipment Shortages During the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) Pandemic|authors=Antony Schwartz, Matthew Stiegel, Nicole Greeson, Andrea Vogel, Wayne Thomann, Monte Brown, Gregory D.

==== Contrast with surgical mask ====

A [[surgical mask]] is a loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment. If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle [[Respiratory droplets|droplets]], splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions to others.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks|title=N95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks)|last=|first=|date=2020-03-11|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|language=en|accessdate=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

A surgical mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures. Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the face mask and the face.<ref name=\":2\" />  Collection efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% for different manufacturers’ masks when measured using the test parameters for NIOSH certification.  However, a study found that even for surgical masks with \"good\" filters, 80–100% of subjects failed an OSHA-accepted qualitative fit test, and a quantitative test showed 12–25% leakage.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/10/14/n95/|title=N95 Respirators and Surgical Masks|last=Brosseau|first=Lisa|last2=Ann|first2=Roland Berry|date=2009-10-14|website=NIOSH Science Blog|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

== History ==

N95 facemasks have several historical predecessors.  One was a design for a [[cloth facemask]] by [[Lien-teh Wu]], who was working for the Chinese Imperial Court in the fall of 1910 during a [[Bubonic plague]] outbreak.  It was the first that protected users from bacteria in empirical testing, and inspired masks used during the [[1918 flu pandemic]].<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90479846/the-untold-origin-story-of-the-n95-mask|title=The untold origin story of the N95 mask|last=Wilson|first=Mark|date=2020-03-24|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>  Another predecessor was [[Gas mask|gas masks]] developed during [[World War I]], which were adapted for use by miners.

An '''N95 mask''' or '''N95 respirator''' is a particulate-filtering facepiece [[respirator]] that meets the N95 standard of the U.S. [[NIOSH air filtration rating|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) air filtration rating]], meaning that it filters at least 95% of [[airborne particles]], while not resistant to [[oil]] like the P95. It is the most common particulate-filtering facepiece respirator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1-a.html|title=NIOSH-Approved N95 Particulate Filtering Facepiece Respirators - A Suppliers List|last=|first=|date=2020-03-19|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>  It is an example of a [[mechanical filter respirator]], which provides protection against [[particulates]], but not [[gas]]es or [[vapor]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource3selection.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source: Selection FAQs|last=|first=|date=2020-03-12|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>

N95 respirators are considered functionally equivalent to certain respirators regulated under non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as [[FFP mask|FFP2 respirators]] of the European Union and KN95 respirators of China.  However, slightly different criteria are used to certify their performance, such as the filter efficiency, test agent and flow rate, and permissible [[pressure drop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1791500O/comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes-tb.pdf|title=Comparison of FFP2, KN95, and N95 and Other Filtering Facepiece Respirator Classes|last=|first=|date=2020-01-01|website=3M Technical Data Bulletin|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />

[[Respirator fit test|Fit testing]] is a critical component to a respiratory protection program whenever workers use tight-fitting respirators. OSHA requires an initial respirator fit test to identify the right model, style, and size respirator for each worker, as well as annual fit tests. Additionally, tight-fitting respirators, including the N95, require a user seal check each time one is put on.<ref name=\":0\" />

=== In industry ===
N95 respirators were originally designed for industrial use in sectors such as [[mining]], [[construction]], and [[Paint|painting]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://thedcapage.blog/2020/03/26/from-the-industrial-to-the-medical-evolution-of-the-n95-respirator/|title=From the Industrial to the Medical – Evolution of the N95 Respirator|last=Vargas|first=June|date=2020-03-26|website=[[California Department of Consumer Affairs]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

According to the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, respirators with filters in the N, R, and P series are recommended for concentrations of hazardous particulates that are greater than the relevant [[occupational exposure limit]] but less than the [[immediately dangerous to life or health]] level and the manufacturer's maximum use concentration, subject to the respirator having a sufficient [[Respirator assigned protection factors|assigned protection factor]].<ref name=\":8\" />

N series respirators, including the N95 mask, are only effective in the absence of oil particles, such as [[Lubricant|lubricants]], [[Cutting fluid|cutting fluids]], or [[Glycerol|glycerine]].  For substances hazardous to the eyes, a respirator equipped with a full facepiece, helmet, or hood is recommended.  They should not be used during [[firefighting]], in [[oxygen-deficient atmosphere]], or in an unknown atmosphere, as a [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] is recommended instead.  They should not be used with hazardous gases or vapors, for which a [[Cartridge (respirator)|cartridge respirator]] is recommended.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-100/default.html|title=NIOSH respirator selection logic|last=Bollinger|first=Nancy|date=2004-10-01|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=5–9|language=en-us|via=|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2005100|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

=== In healthcare ===
Respirators used in healthcare are traditionally a specific variant called a surgical respirator, which is both approved by NIOSH as a respirator and cleared by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] as a medical device similar to a [[surgical mask]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ohsonline.com/articles/2014/05/01/comparison-respiratory.aspx|title=A Comparison of Surgical Masks, Surgical N95 Respirators, and Industrial N95 Respirators|last=|first=|date=2014-05-01|website=Occupational Health & Safety|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  As part of the [[Families First Coronavirus Response Act]], changes were made to liability and certification laws to allow industrial respirators to be used in healthcare settings, in response to shortages of respirators during the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/19/change-us-law-will-make-millions-more-masks-available-doctors-nurses-white-house-says/|title=Change in U.S. law will make millions more masks available to doctors and nurses, White House says|last=Whalen|first=Jeanne|date=2020-03-20|website=Washington Post|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) requires healthcare workers who are expected to perform patient activities with those suspected or confirmed to be infected with [[COVID-19]] to wear respiratory protection, such as an N95 respirator.  Unlike a respirator, a [[surgical mask]] does not have an air-tight seal and thus does not protect its wearer against airborne particles such as virus material.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2020/03/16/n95-preparedness/|title=Proper N95 Respirator Use for Respiratory Protection Preparedness|last=D’Alessandro|first=Maryann M.|last2=Cichowicz|first2=Jaclyn Krah|date=2020-03-16|website=NIOSH Science Blog|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

==== Use during shortages ====
Under serious outbreak conditions in which respirator supplies are severely limited, workers should work with their employer to choose the respirator that fits best, as, even without fit testing, a respirator will provide better protection than a surgical mask or no mask.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In this case, best practices include trying different models or sizes to get a good face seal, checking manufacturer training videos and literature on proper donning and doffing, doing a user seal check several times, and checking the fit in a mirror or asking a colleague to look to be sure the respirator is touching the face.<ref name=\":0\" />

During crisis situations where there is a shortage of N95 respirators, such as the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic]], the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has recommended strategies for optimizing their use in healthcare settings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html|title=Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Crisis/Alternate Strategies|last=|first=|date=2020-03-17|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>  N95 respirators can be used beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life, although components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal, making it particularly important that the wearer perform the expected seal check.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/release-stockpiled-N95.html|title=Release of Stockpiled N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Beyond the Manufacturer-Designated Shelf Life: Considerations for the COVID-19 Response|last=|first=|date=2020-02-28|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>  Respirators can be used that are approved under standards used in other countries that are similar to NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, including FFP2 and FFP3 respirators regulated by the [[European Union]].<ref name=\":1\" />  N95 respirators can be reused a limited number of times after being removed, as long as they have not been used during aerosol-generating procedures and are not contaminated with patients' bodily fluids, although this increases the risk of surface contamination with pathogens.  The respirator manufacturer may recommend a maximum number of donnings or uses; if no manufacturer guidance is available, preliminary data suggests limiting to five uses per device to ensure an adequate safety margin.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hcwcontrols/recommendedguidanceextuse.html|title=Recommended Guidance for Extended Use and Limited Reuse of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Healthcare Settings|last=|first=|date=2020-03-27|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>

When it is no longer possible for all healthcare workers to wear N95 respirators when caring for a COVID-19 patient, respirators should be prioritized for workers performing aerosol-generating procedures on symptomatic persons and those within three feet of an unmasked symptomatic person. Under these conditions, masking of symptomatic patients with a [[surgical mask]] and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission.  When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.  If neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, such as [[Cloth facemask|cloth facemasks]], though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\" />

Given that the global supply of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) is insufficient during the pandemic, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends minimizing the need for PPE through [[telemedicine]], physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE [[supply chain]], and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf|title=Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=2020-02-27|website=World Health Organization|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>

==== Contrast with surgical mask ====

A [[surgical mask]] is a loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment. If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle [[Respiratory droplets|droplets]], splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions to others.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks|title=N95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks)|last=|first=|date=2020-03-11|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|language=en|accessdate=2020-03-28}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

A surgical mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures.

== History ==

N95 facemasks have several historical predecessors.  One was a design for a [[cloth facemask]] by [[Lien-teh Wu]], who was working for the Chinese Imperial Court in the fall of 1910 during a [[Bubonic plague]] outbreak.  It was the first that protected users from bacteria in empirical testing, and inspired masks used during the [[1918 flu pandemic]].<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90479846/the-untold-origin-story-of-the-n95-mask|title=The untold origin story of the N95 mask|last=Wilson|first=Mark|date=2020-03-24|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>  Another predecessor was [[Gas mask|gas masks]] developed during [[World War I]], which were adapted for use by miners.

→‎Application process:correction,safe,Myxsoma,"The '''Paycheck Protection Program''' ('''PPP''') is a $349-billion business loan program established by the [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] (CARES Act) to help small businesses keep paying their workers. The Paycheck Protection Program allows small businesses to apply for low-interest private loans to pay for their payroll and certain other costs. A PPP loan is approximately equal to 2.5 times the business' average monthly payroll costs. The loan proceeds may be used to cover the business' payroll costs, rent, interest, and utilities for eight weeks. The loan principle may partially or fully forgiven if the business keeps its employee counts and employee wages stable. The program is overseen by the [[United States Small Business Administration|U.S. Small Business Administration]].

The Small Business Administration has a standard application form, although private lenders are allowed to use their own paper forms or electronic forms if they are substantially similar to the standard form. An applicant must attach documentation to support the amount of the loan applied for, such as payroll reports, payroll tax filings, [[1099-MISC|Form 1099-MISC]], or a sole proprietor's income and expenses. If these records are unavailable, a lender may accept bank records if they sufficiently demonstrate the qualifying amount.{{refn| name= interim}} Applicants must make certain assertions, including that \"current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant\".{{refn| name= action}}

The Small Business Administration's loan programs generally consider one FTE to equal one employee who regularly works at least 30 hours per week. FTE for an employee who regularly works fewer than 30 hours per week is equal to the number of hours regularly worked per week divided by 30.

In the case of independent contractors with only one worker and self-employed individuals, the business would just need to retain that one worker for the first eight-week period of the loan in order to be eligible for loan forgiveness equal to the amount incurred and spent on payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities during the first eight weeks after receiving the PPP loan.{{refn| name= independent | {{cite news |last= Hudson |first= Subrina |date= April 10, 2020 |url= https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/independent-contractors-eligible-for-federal-loan-program-2003768/ |title= Independent Contractors Eligible for Federal Loan Program |work= [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] }} }}

==Interaction with other provisions of the CARES Act==
If a business receives loan forgiveness on a PPP loan, the business ''cannot'' take advantage of two other provisions under the CARES Act, namely the Employee Retention Tax Credit and payroll tax deferral.{{refn |name= implications | {{cite web |url= https://ssfllp.com/the-sba-eidl-and-ppp-loans-and-their-tax-implications/ |title= The SBA EIDL and PPP Loans and Their Tax Implications |work= Sensiba San Filippo Certified Public Accountants and Business Advisors |date= April 2, 2020 }} }}{{refn | {{cite web |url= https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr748enr/pdf/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf |title= Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Section 2301(j) |work= U.S. Government Printing Office |date= March 27, 2020 }} }} 

The Employee Retention Credit allows a tax credit equal to half of qualified wages, up to $10,000 per employee, if the business' operations are ordered to partially or fully suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic or if the business suffered at least a 50-percent decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic.{{refn| name= agent}}

Under the payroll tax deferral, the payment of the employer portion of [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|social security tax]] incurred between March 27, 2020, and December 31, 2020, may be delayed. Half may be paid by December 31, 2021, and the remaining half by December 31, 2022.

[[Category:United States federal legislation]]","The '''Paycheck Protection Program''' ('''PPP''') is a $349-billion business loan program established by the [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] (CARES Act) to help small businesses keep paying their workers. The Paycheck Protection Program allows small businesses to apply for low-interest private loans to pay for their payroll and certain other costs. A PPP loan is approximately equal to 2.5 times the business' average monthly payroll costs. The loan proceeds may be used to cover the business' payroll costs, rent, interest, and utilities for eight weeks. The loan principle may partially or fully forgiven if the business keeps its employee counts and employee wages stable. The program is overseen by the [[United States Small Business Administration|U.S. Small Business Administration]].

==Application process==
An applicant applies for a PPP loan directly with an eligible private lender, such as a [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|federally insured bank]], a [[Federal Credit Union Act|federally insured credit union]]{{refn| {{USCode|12|1751}} }}, [[Farm Credit System|Farm Credit System institution]], or a Small Business Administration-approved lender.{{refn| name= interim}}{{refn| name= lowdown | {{cite news |last= Patrick |first=Sheron |date= April 9, 2020 |url= https://www.anchoragepress.com/news/coronavirus/the-lowdown-on-cares-act-loans/article_f6189940-7aab-11ea-807c-77e2e61f9acb.html |title= The Lowdown on CARES Act Loans |work= Anchorage Press }} }}

The Small Business Administration has a standard application form, although private lenders are allowed to use their own paper forms or electronic forms if they are substantially similar to the standard form. An applicant must attach documentation to support the amount of the loan applied for, such as payroll reports, payroll tax filings, [[1099-MISC|Form 1099-MISC]], or a sole proprietor's income and expenses. If these records are unavailable, a lender may accept bank records if they sufficiently demonstrate the qualifying amount.{{refn| name= interim}} Applicants must make certain assertions, including that &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;.{{refn| name= action}}

The Small Business Administration's loan programs generally consider one FTE to equal one employee who regularly works at least 30 hours per week. FTE for an employee who regularly works fewer than 30 hours per week is equal to the number of hours regularly worked per week divided by 30.

In the case of independent contractors with only one worker and self-employed individuals, the business would just need to retain that one worker for the first eight-week period of the loan in order to be eligible for loan forgiveness equal to the amount incurred and spent on payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities during the first eight weeks after receiving the PPP loan.{{refn| name= independent | {{cite news |last= Hudson |first= Subrina |date= April 10, 2020 |url= https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/independent-contractors-eligible-for-federal-loan-program-2003768/ |title= Independent Contractors Eligible for Federal Loan Program |work= [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] }} }}

The amount of loan forgiveness cannot exceed the amount of the PPP loan. Any loan proceeds used for unallowable purposes is ineligible for forgiveness.{{refn| name= interim}} Knowingly using loan proceeds for unallowable purposes is [[fraud]].{{refn| name= interim}}

Ordinarily, loan forgiveness is considered taxable income, but forgiveness of a PPP loan is not considered taxable income.{{refn| {{cite web |url= https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc431 |title= Topic No. 431 Canceled Debt – Is It Taxable or Not? |work= Internal Revenue Service |date= February 14, 2020 }} }}{{refn | {{cite web |url= https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr748enr/pdf/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf |title= Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Section 1106(j) |work= U.S. Government Printing Office |date= March 27, 2020 }} }}

==Interaction with other provisions of the CARES Act==
If a business receives loan forgiveness on a PPP loan, the business ''cannot'' take advantage of two other provisions under the CARES Act, namely the Employee Retention Tax Credit and payroll tax deferral.{{refn |name= implications | {{cite web |url= https://ssfllp.com/the-sba-eidl-and-ppp-loans-and-their-tax-implications/ |title= The SBA EIDL and PPP Loans and Their Tax Implications |work= Sensiba San Filippo Certified Public Accountants and Business Advisors |date= April 2, 2020 }} }}{{refn | {{cite web |url= https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr748enr/pdf/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf |title= Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Section 2301(j) |work= U.S. Government Printing Office |date= March 27, 2020 }} }} 

The Employee Retention Credit allows a tax credit equal to half of qualified wages, up to $10,000 per employee, if the business' operations are ordered to partially or fully suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic or if the business suffered at least a 50-percent decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic.{{refn| name= agent}}

Under the payroll tax deferral, the payment of the employer portion of [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|social security tax]] incurred between March 27, 2020, and December 31, 2020, may be delayed. Half may be paid by December 31, 2021, and the remaining half by December 31, 2022.

It is a [[seaside resort]] that saw a peak of tourists in the summer months between the 1950s and 1970s.

The town's economy continues to rely significantly on entertainment and day-trip facilities and it is strong in the service sector, with a large retired population. The north-west part of the town has two business/industrial parks. In the wider district, agriculture and occupations connected to the [[Harwich|Port of Harwich]] provide further employment. It lies within the [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]] United Kingdom Parliament [[United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]].

==Geography==
It is located between [[Jaywick]] and [[Holland-on-Sea]] along the coastline and [[Great Clacton]] to the north. The relevant local authority is Tendring District Council.

It is at the south-eastern end of the [[A133 road|A133]]. The resort of [[Frinton-on-Sea]] is nearby to the north-east.

==Amenities==
[[File:Town centre fountain, Clacton.JPG|thumb|Town centre fountain]]
Clacton has a pleasure pier, arcades, a golf course, caravan parks and an airfield. The town and its beaches are still popular with tourists in the summer and there is an annual entertainment programme including the Clacton Carnival, which starts on the second Saturday in August and lasts for a week. Clacton Airshow, an aerial display, takes place on the Thursday and Friday before the August Bank Holiday, with historic and modern aircraft such as the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]], [[BAe Harrier|Harrier]], [[Sepecat Jaguar|Jaguar]], [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]], and [[helicopters]]. There are also [[wing walking|wing-walkers]] and the [[Red Arrows]].

Clacton has a shopping area with many of the usual national chains represented, and a Factory Shopping Village in the north of the town.

Clacton has two theatres, the [[West Cliff Theatre]] and the Princes Theatre. The West Cliff is one of the last theatres in the country to put on an old-style summer show.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

There is plentiful archaeological evidence of scattered settlement in the area, including [[Beaker culture|Beaker Folk]] traces at Point Clear to the south and round houses (as cropmarks) near the A133 extension from Weeley to the north. There may have been a pre-Roman (i.e. Celtic) settlement at Gt. Clacton and there were almost certainly scattered farmsteads as the important British Celtic settlement at Colchester was only about {{convert|15|mile}} away.  No traces of substantial Roman settlement have been found at Clacton though there are several Roman villa sites nearby (e.g. Alresford, Wivenhoe, Brightlingsea). After the Anglo-Saxon migration and the foundation of the kingdom of Essex, a village called ''Claccingtun'' (\"the village of Clacc's or Clacca's people\") was established. No pre-Norman buildings survive today. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 records the village as ''Clachintuna''.

Clacton was repeatedly surveyed by the Army in the Napoleonic Wars as a possible invasion beach-head for Napoleon and his Dutch allies. There was a large army and militia camp where Holland-on-Sea now stands. In 1810 five [[Martello Towers]] were built to guard the beaches between Colne Point to the south and what is now Holland-on-Sea to the north of the town.

In 1871 the Essex railway engineer and land developer [[Peter Bruff]], the steamboat owner William Jackson, and a group of businessmen built a pier and the Royal Hotel (now converted to flats) on a stretch of farmland adjoining low gravelly cliffs and a firm sand-and-shingle beach near the villages of Great and Little Clacton. The town of Clacton-on-Sea was officially incorporated in 1872 and laid out rather haphazardly over the next few years: though it has a central 'grand' avenue (originally Electric Parade, now Pier Avenue) the street plan incorporates many previously rural lanes and tracks, such as Wash Lane. Plots and streets were sold off piecemeal to developers and speculators. In 1882 the [[Great Eastern Railway]] already serving the well-established resort of [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] along the coast, built a spur to Clacton-on-Sea with a junction at Thorpe-le-Soken.

Clacton grew into the largest seaside resort between [[Southend-on-Sea]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], with some 10,000 residents by 1914 and c.20,000 by 1939. Due to its accessibility from the East End of London and the Essex suburbs, Clacton, like Southend, remained predominantly geared to catering for working-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers – though it had, and has, its more 'select' areas.

For well over a century Clacton Pier has been an [[RNLI]] lifeboat station.

Just before the Second World War the building of [[Butlin's]] Holiday Camp boosted its economy, though the Army took it over between then and 1945 for use as an internment, engineer, pioneer and light anti-aircraft artillery training camp.

Four notable incidents occurred in Clacton-on-Sea during World War II. First, very early in the war a German airman bailed out over the town. Procedures for dealing with enemy captives were not yet well-established and he was treated as a celebrity guest for some days, including by the town council, before eventually being handed over to the military {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}. Second, a [[Luftwaffe]] [[Heinkel]] 111 bomber crashed into the town on 30 April 1940, demolishing several houses in the Vista Road area as one of the magnetic mines on board exploded on impact, killing the crew and two civilians; another mine was defused by experts from the Navy. Third, the Wagstaff Corner area was bombed in May 1941, demolishing some well-known buildings. Finally, a [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rocket hit in front of the Tower Hotel, injuring dozens of troops inside though without bringing down the structure. Clacton lay beneath the route taken by many of the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and V2 bombs aimed at London.

A big role in the town during the pre- and post-war period was played by the Kingsman family, which bought and developed the pier and ran a pleasure-steamer service from London. A summer sea excursion to [[Calais]] also ran until the early 1960s. Butlin's reopened the holiday camp after the war. This, along with the expansion of the nearby chalet town of Jaywick, originally a speculative private development of inter-war years, and increasingly capacious caravan sites, all swelled by the movement of retired Londoners into the area, altered the character of the town.{{when|date=June 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In 1964 the town was in the national news when rival gangs of Mods and Rockers fought on the sea front and several arrests were made. (In mid-60s youth culture, 'Mods' favoured scooters and wore parkas, while 'rockers' rode motorcycles and wore leather and denim. The incident became known locally as 'The Battle of Pier Gap' following a headline in the local paper, the East Essex Gazette). Throughout the 1960s Clacton beach remained a popular summer excursion for residents of Essex and east London and in August was often crammed to capacity in the area around the Pier. The [[pirate radio]] ship [[MV Galaxy]], which broadcast [[Wonderful Radio London]], was anchored offshore from 1964 until its forced closure in 1967.

With the advent of cheap flights to Mediterranean resorts in the 1970s, the holiday industry began to decline. Increasingly, hotels' and guest-houses' spare capacity came to be used as 'temporary' accommodation by the local authority to house those on welfare, refugees, migrants and asylum seekers. Pier Ward, in the centre of the town, is one of the poorest in the UK; (nearby Jaywick is often cited as the poorest of all). Since around 1970 several well-known local buildings have been demolished, including the palatial [[art deco]] [[Odeon Cinema]] (a great loss to both the town and the county); the Warwick Castle Pub; the Waverley Hotel; Barker House, a large home for the learning disabled, and Groom's Crippleage, which housed orphaned handicapped girls from London. Cordy's, a well-known large seafront restaurant has been converted to other uses. The site of Butlin's Holiday Camp was redeveloped as a housing estate. The once famously crowded bus station in Jackson Road has become a car park. The Ocean Revue Theatre, where [[Max Bygraves]] made one of his first appearances, has closed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jacobs|first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Jacobs |date=1967 |title=Clacton Past and Present|publisher=WO series (War Office), ADM 1 (Naval), HO 192/3 (Civil Defence) files at the National Archives}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jacobs|first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Jacobs |date=1967 |title=The Essex Countryside|publisher=WO series (War Office), ADM 1 (Naval), HO 192/3 (Civil Defence) files at the National Archives}}</ref>

The town expanded substantially in the 1980s, 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, with new housing estates on the rural margins of town, and some brownfield developments. Many residents commute to work in [[Colchester]], [[Witham]], [[Chelmsford]] or [[London]]. Clacton was in the news when its town centre and seafront areas were struck by [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|an F1/T2 tornado]] on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi|title=European Severe Weather Database|website=www.eswd.eu}}</ref> A large wind-farm, built in the early 2000s some 3 miles offshore on [[Gunfleet Sands]], is visible from many streets and from various places in the flat hinterland of the town. However, in common with many seaside towns, unemployment has remained stubbornly high in Clacton itself compared with much of southeast England.

==Seaside resort==
[[File:Clacton-on-Sea West-Beach.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|West Beach]]
[[File:Garden of Remembrance, Clacton-on Sea2.jpg|thumb|Garden of Remembrance]]
The modern day Clacton-on-Sea was founded by [[Peter Bruff]] in 1871 as a seaside resort. Originally the main means of access was by sea; [[Steamships]] operated by the [[Woolwich Steam Packet Company]] docked from 1871 at [[Clacton Pier]] which opened the same year. The pier now offers an amusement arcade and many other forms of entertainment.

People who wanted to come by road had to go through Great Clacton. In the 1920s, London Road was built to cope with the influx of holidaymakers. Later, in the 1970s, the eastern section of the A120 was opened obviating the need for Clacton visitors to go through Colchester. Today [[PS Waverley|Paddle Steamer ''Waverley'']] operates from Clacton Pier offering pleasure boat excursions.

Clacton has a [[Blue Flag beach]] at Martello Bay (two more are locally at [[Dovercourt]] Bay & [[Brightlingsea]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Blue Flag beaches in the UK |url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/travel/blue-flag-beaches-uk-full-list-england-wales-scotland-northern-ireland-how-explained/ |website=inews |accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref> Clacton Seafront Gardens which run along the top of the seafront west of Clacton Pier has also been awarded a Green Flag and includes various sections with formal gardens, memorials and places to sit.

===Former Butlins===
{{main|Clacton (holiday camp)}}
In 1936, [[Billy Butlin]] bought and refurbished the West Clacton Estate, an amusement park to the west of the town. He opened a new amusement park on the site in 1937 and then, a year later on 11 June 1938, opened the second of his holiday camps. This location remained open until 1983 when, due to changing holiday tastes, Butlins decided to close the facility. It was then purchased by former managers of the camp who reopened it as a short-lived theme park, called Atlas Park. The land was then sold and redeveloped with housing.<ref name=\"EL0608\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|title=Morning campers|last=Adams|first=Nicky|date=June 2008|work=Essex Life|publisher=Archant|pages=18–20|accessdate=5 February 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725170452/http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}} (Registration required.)</ref>

==Sport==
Clacton has a cricket club and a football team called [[F.C. Clacton]], whose best [[F.A. Cup]] performance was the 1st round. The football team play at the Austin Arena with the bus shelter being the stand for the passionate supporters.  The name was derived after someone said it looked like a bus shelter. The club then took bus timetables and stuck them on it, to resemble a bus shelter.

The Cricket Club has many grounds around Clacton with one in Holland-on-sea and another where [[Essex County Cricket Club]] used to play. Clacton also have a rugby club with teams ranging from under 12s to a first and second team. The first and second teams play in Essex League 1 and train on a Tuesday night at 7 which is held at the rugby club in Valley Road.

== Industry ==
Prior to the foundation of Clacton-on-Sea the chief occupations in the area were farming and small-scale fishing. A steam-powered mill was built in 1867 to replace the local windmill, which was eventually demolished in 1918. Today the town's main industrial area is in the northeast of the town (Gorse Lane Industrial Estate and Oakwood Business Park) which contain a variety of businesses and light industrial units.

Clacton Urban District Council had provided the town with electricity since the early twentieth century from Clacton power station. Upon [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership passed to the [[British Electricity Authority]] and later to the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]. Electricity connections to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|national grid]] rendered the small 2.15 [[Watt|megawatt]] (MW) internal combustion engine power station redundant. It closed in 1966; in its final year of operation it delivered 796 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity to the town.<ref>''CEGB Statistical Yearbook 1966'', CEGB, London.</ref>

==Landmarks==

Clacton has comparatively few buildings of architectural interest. In addition to the surviving large seafront hotels there are:

===St John's Church, Gt Clacton===
The parish church of St John, Gt. Clacton, is the oldest surviving building in the urban district, dating from the early decades of the 12th century, though considerably altered. A local legend that smugglers used a tunnel from the coast to the Ship Inn (16th century) opposite the church is discounted by historians. The pub is more than 1.5&nbsp;km from the sea. The nearby Queens Head inn may be pre-1600.

===St James's Church===
A large (and actually unfinished) church of 1912-13 between Tower Road and Wash Lane, St James's is a rare southern building by [[Temple Moore]], an architect chiefly associated with the North of England. Somewhat grim on the outside (as [[Pevsner]] noted in ''The Buildings of Essex''), the interior is surprisingly light and spare, with different orders of arch on either side of the chancel giving an asymmetrical feel. The building is only a third of its intended size, and the original plans included a large tower at the West end. Ordered for anglo-catholic worship, it is large, without pews and boasts an impressive reredos which finishes in a canopy at the East end.

===Clacton Rail Station===
The main station building dates from 1929. A typical neo-Georgian 'late Imperial'-style building, it is notable chiefly for the decorative use of moulded '[[fasces]]' on either side of the main entrance - a rare instance of [[Fascist]] symbolism in British civic architecture.

===Clacton Town Hall===
In Station Road. Another Late Imperial, neo-Georgian building, with a tall and portentous portico of Composite columns flanked by rather feeble-looking single-story wings. It also houses the Princes Theatre. The architect was Sir A. Brumwell Thomas.

===Martello Towers===
There are three of these between the Pier and Jaywick Sands to the south. They date from 1809-12. The immensely thick brick walls look circular, but are in fact rounded triangles, designed to deflect cannon-fire. The tower nearest the Pier was, unusually, built within a moat. The name comes from similar fortifications in Mortella, Corsica.

===Moot Hall===
A real oddity: in Albany Gardens West, near the seafront to the north of the Pier, this house of the 1400s was moved from the village of [[Hawstead, Suffolk]] and reconstructed here in 1911 – though considerably modernised and altered – for a London builder named J H Gill.

===St Helena Hospice===
In Jackson Road, in the town centre. Clacton's best modern building, an elegantly curved wood and brick corner design of 2001-2 by the Purcell Miller Tritton architectural partnership.

===Jaywick Sands===
{{Main|Jaywick}}
Originally (1920s and '30s) a huddle of self-builds and kit-houses in a bleak field dangerously close to mean sea level, and in places still little more than a shanty town, Jaywick nevertheless has its admirers as 'folk-architecture'. It was badly damaged by the [[North Sea flood of 1953|floods of 1953]], when almost 50 residents died. In recent years it has begun to acquire facilities which the developed world widely regards as indispensable, such as metalled roads, and a sewage system. The Martello Tower is used as an art space.

===Clacton Pier===
{{Main|Clacton Pier}}
[[File:Clacton pier 700.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Clacton Pier viewed from the south west]]
[[Clacton Pier]] was the first building of the new resort of Clacton-on-Sea.

==Climate==
Clacton has an [[Maritime Climate|oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] \"Cfb\") but with lower precipitation than most of the UK and Western Europe. This makes for pleasantly warm and relatively dry summers (which also enhances the towns popularity as a sea-side town), but also fairly chilly winter days. For the 1961–1990 observation period, Clacton averaged 103.7 days with at least 1mm of rain annually, and just 24.3 air frosts a year- comparable to south west coastal locations.

==Demography==
Clacton's population increased substantially during the 20th century from 7,456 at the 1901 census to 25,000 in the 1960s, 45,065 in 1991 and reaching over 53,000 by 2001.
Population as 107,237 according to Dataloft Inform, Land Registry, 2011 Census

==Education==
St Osyth's Teacher Training College occupied several buildings in Clacton, mostly along Marine Parade East, until its amalgamation with the North East Essex Technical College in the late 1970s. The town is served by three secondary schools, [[Clacton Coastal Academy]], [[Clacton County High School]] and [[Tendring Enterprise Studio School]]. The [[Colchester Institute]] has a site on Church Road and Thomas Road.  Adult Community Learning, run by Essex County Council, is situated in St Osyth Road.there are also multiple junior schools like Alton Park with all most 500 kids that have in rolled which spans to year 3 to 6.

==Transport==
[[File:Weeley By-pass (Mk 2) - geograph.org.uk - 124855.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Weeley]] A133 bypass]]

Clacton-on-Sea is located at the terminus of the A133 road which runs between Clacton and Colchester.

The town is served by [[Clacton-on-Sea railway station]] (90 minutes to London Liverpool Street station) via the [[Sunshine Coast Line]] whose two branches (the other runs from [[Walton-on-the-Naze railway station|Walton-on-the-Naze]]) converge before [[Thorpe-le-Soken railway station|Thorpe-le-Soken]].

The town is served by bus routes operated by [[Hedingham Omnibuses]]. Termini include [[Colchester]], [[Manningtree]], [[Harwich]] and [[Walton-on-the-Naze]]. [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operates coach services to/from London and Liverpool. First Essex withdrew from serving Clacton in January 2020. Hedingham Omnibus are now the only operator serving Clacton from Colchester.

Clacton also has [[Clacton Airport]], which has been active since its use by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during the [[Second World War]]. In the 1990s, the airfield was featured in the BBC television series \"[[Airport (TV series)|Airport]]\".

==Conservation==
Clacton's environmental qualities draw on several things: proximity to the sea, its evolution as the resort, its attraction as a retirement area, and its business and trade. The conservation and enhancement of Clacton's various environmental qualities depends on assessment, evaluation and management.

Both Tendring District Council and Essex County Council can advise on heritage and historic buildings. The district also advises on wildlife conservation, and on obtaining grants for managing countryside for public enjoyment and appreciation. The county has an archaeological service.

'''Clacton-on-Sea''' is the largest town in the [[Tendring District|Tendring]] peninsula and district in [[Essex]], eastern England, and was founded as an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in 1871. It is a [[seaside resort]] that saw a peak of tourists in the summer months between the 1950s and 1970s.

The town's economy continues to rely significantly on entertainment and day-trip facilities and it is strong in the service sector, with a large retired population. The north-west part of the town has two business/industrial parks. In the wider district, agriculture and occupations connected to the [[Harwich|Port of Harwich]] provide further employment. It lies within the [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]] United Kingdom Parliament [[United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]].

==Geography==
It is located between [[Jaywick]] and [[Holland-on-Sea]] along the coastline and [[Great Clacton]] to the north. The relevant local authority is Tendring District Council.

It is at the south-eastern end of the [[A133 road|A133]]. The resort of [[Frinton-on-Sea]] is nearby to the north-east.

==Amenities==
[[File:Town centre fountain, Clacton.JPG|thumb|Town centre fountain]]
Clacton has a pleasure pier, arcades, a golf course, caravan parks and an airfield. The town and its beaches are still popular with tourists in the summer and there is an annual entertainment programme including the Clacton Carnival, which starts on the second Saturday in August and lasts for a week. Clacton Airshow, an aerial display, takes place on the Thursday and Friday before the August Bank Holiday, with historic and modern aircraft such as the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]], [[BAe Harrier|Harrier]], [[Sepecat Jaguar|Jaguar]], [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]], and [[helicopters]]. There are also [[wing walking|wing-walkers]] and the [[Red Arrows]].

Clacton has a shopping area with many of the usual national chains represented, and a Factory Shopping Village in the north of the town.

Clacton has two theatres, the [[West Cliff Theatre]] and the Princes Theatre. The West Cliff is one of the last theatres in the country to put on an old-style summer show.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

There is plentiful archaeological evidence of scattered settlement in the area, including [[Beaker culture|Beaker Folk]] traces at Point Clear to the south and round houses (as cropmarks) near the A133 extension from Weeley to the north. There may have been a pre-Roman (i.e. Celtic) settlement at Gt. Clacton and there were almost certainly scattered farmsteads as the important British Celtic settlement at Colchester was only about {{convert|15|mile}} away.  No traces of substantial Roman settlement have been found at Clacton though there are several Roman villa sites nearby (e.g. Alresford, Wivenhoe, Brightlingsea). After the Anglo-Saxon migration and the foundation of the kingdom of Essex, a village called ''Claccingtun'' (\"the village of Clacc's or Clacca's people\") was established. No pre-Norman buildings survive today. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 records the village as ''Clachintuna''.

Clacton was repeatedly surveyed by the Army in the Napoleonic Wars as a possible invasion beach-head for Napoleon and his Dutch allies. There was a large army and militia camp where Holland-on-Sea now stands. In 1810 five [[Martello Towers]] were built to guard the beaches between Colne Point to the south and what is now Holland-on-Sea to the north of the town.

In 1871 the Essex railway engineer and land developer [[Peter Bruff]], the steamboat owner William Jackson, and a group of businessmen built a pier and the Royal Hotel (now converted to flats) on a stretch of farmland adjoining low gravelly cliffs and a firm sand-and-shingle beach near the villages of Great and Little Clacton. The town of Clacton-on-Sea was officially incorporated in 1872 and laid out rather haphazardly over the next few years: though it has a central 'grand' avenue (originally Electric Parade, now Pier Avenue) the street plan incorporates many previously rural lanes and tracks, such as Wash Lane. Plots and streets were sold off piecemeal to developers and speculators. In 1882 the [[Great Eastern Railway]] already serving the well-established resort of [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] along the coast, built a spur to Clacton-on-Sea with a junction at Thorpe-le-Soken.

Clacton grew into the largest seaside resort between [[Southend-on-Sea]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], with some 10,000 residents by 1914 and c.20,000 by 1939. Due to its accessibility from the East End of London and the Essex suburbs, Clacton, like Southend, remained predominantly geared to catering for working-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers – though it had, and has, its more 'select' areas.

For well over a century Clacton Pier has been an [[RNLI]] lifeboat station.

Just before the Second World War the building of [[Butlin's]] Holiday Camp boosted its economy, though the Army took it over between then and 1945 for use as an internment, engineer, pioneer and light anti-aircraft artillery training camp.

Four notable incidents occurred in Clacton-on-Sea during World War II. First, very early in the war a German airman bailed out over the town. Procedures for dealing with enemy captives were not yet well-established and he was treated as a celebrity guest for some days, including by the town council, before eventually being handed over to the military {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}. Second, a [[Luftwaffe]] [[Heinkel]] 111 bomber crashed into the town on 30 April 1940, demolishing several houses in the Vista Road area as one of the magnetic mines on board exploded on impact, killing the crew and two civilians; another mine was defused by experts from the Navy. Third, the Wagstaff Corner area was bombed in May 1941, demolishing some well-known buildings. Finally, a [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rocket hit in front of the Tower Hotel, injuring dozens of troops inside though without bringing down the structure. Clacton lay beneath the route taken by many of the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and V2 bombs aimed at London.

A big role in the town during the pre- and post-war period was played by the Kingsman family, which bought and developed the pier and ran a pleasure-steamer service from London. A summer sea excursion to [[Calais]] also ran until the early 1960s. Butlin's reopened the holiday camp after the war. This, along with the expansion of the nearby chalet town of Jaywick, originally a speculative private development of inter-war years, and increasingly capacious caravan sites, all swelled by the movement of retired Londoners into the area, altered the character of the town.{{when|date=June 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In 1964 the town was in the national news when rival gangs of Mods and Rockers fought on the sea front and several arrests were made. (In mid-60s youth culture, 'Mods' favoured scooters and wore parkas, while 'rockers' rode motorcycles and wore leather and denim. The incident became known locally as 'The Battle of Pier Gap' following a headline in the local paper, the East Essex Gazette). Throughout the 1960s Clacton beach remained a popular summer excursion for residents of Essex and east London and in August was often crammed to capacity in the area around the Pier. The [[pirate radio]] ship [[MV Galaxy]], which broadcast [[Wonderful Radio London]], was anchored offshore from 1964 until its forced closure in 1967.

With the advent of cheap flights to Mediterranean resorts in the 1970s, the holiday industry began to decline. Increasingly, hotels' and guest-houses' spare capacity came to be used as 'temporary' accommodation by the local authority to house those on welfare, refugees, migrants and asylum seekers. Pier Ward, in the centre of the town, is one of the poorest in the UK; (nearby Jaywick is often cited as the poorest of all). Since around 1970 several well-known local buildings have been demolished, including the palatial [[art deco]] [[Odeon Cinema]] (a great loss to both the town and the county); the Warwick Castle Pub; the Waverley Hotel; Barker House, a large home for the learning disabled, and Groom's Crippleage, which housed orphaned handicapped girls from London. Cordy's, a well-known large seafront restaurant has been converted to other uses. The site of Butlin's Holiday Camp was redeveloped as a housing estate. The once famously crowded bus station in Jackson Road has become a car park. The Ocean Revue Theatre, where [[Max Bygraves]] made one of his first appearances, has closed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jacobs|first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Jacobs |date=1967 |title=Clacton Past and Present|publisher=WO series (War Office), ADM 1 (Naval), HO 192/3 (Civil Defence) files at the National Archives}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jacobs|first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Jacobs |date=1967 |title=The Essex Countryside|publisher=WO series (War Office), ADM 1 (Naval), HO 192/3 (Civil Defence) files at the National Archives}}</ref>

The town expanded substantially in the 1980s, 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, with new housing estates on the rural margins of town, and some brownfield developments. Many residents commute to work in [[Colchester]], [[Witham]], [[Chelmsford]] or [[London]]. Clacton was in the news when its town centre and seafront areas were struck by [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|an F1/T2 tornado]] on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi|title=European Severe Weather Database|website=www.eswd.eu}}</ref> A large wind-farm, built in the early 2000s some 3 miles offshore on [[Gunfleet Sands]], is visible from many streets and from various places in the flat hinterland of the town. However, in common with many seaside towns, unemployment has remained stubbornly high in Clacton itself compared with much of southeast England.

==Seaside resort==
[[File:Clacton-on-Sea West-Beach.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|West Beach]]
[[File:Garden of Remembrance, Clacton-on Sea2.jpg|thumb|Garden of Remembrance]]
The modern day Clacton-on-Sea was founded by [[Peter Bruff]] in 1871 as a seaside resort. Originally the main means of access was by sea; [[Steamships]] operated by the [[Woolwich Steam Packet Company]] docked from 1871 at [[Clacton Pier]] which opened the same year. The pier now offers an amusement arcade and many other forms of entertainment.

People who wanted to come by road had to go through Great Clacton. In the 1920s, London Road was built to cope with the influx of holidaymakers. Later, in the 1970s, the eastern section of the A120 was opened obviating the need for Clacton visitors to go through Colchester. Today [[PS Waverley|Paddle Steamer ''Waverley'']] operates from Clacton Pier offering pleasure boat excursions.

Clacton has a [[Blue Flag beach]] at Martello Bay (two more are locally at [[Dovercourt]] Bay & [[Brightlingsea]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Blue Flag beaches in the UK |url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/travel/blue-flag-beaches-uk-full-list-england-wales-scotland-northern-ireland-how-explained/ |website=inews |accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref> Clacton Seafront Gardens which run along the top of the seafront west of Clacton Pier has also been awarded a Green Flag and includes various sections with formal gardens, memorials and places to sit.

===Former Butlins===
{{main|Clacton (holiday camp)}}
In 1936, [[Billy Butlin]] bought and refurbished the West Clacton Estate, an amusement park to the west of the town. He opened a new amusement park on the site in 1937 and then, a year later on 11 June 1938, opened the second of his holiday camps. This location remained open until 1983 when, due to changing holiday tastes, Butlins decided to close the facility. It was then purchased by former managers of the camp who reopened it as a short-lived theme park, called Atlas Park. The land was then sold and redeveloped with housing.<ref name=\"EL0608\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|title=Morning campers|last=Adams|first=Nicky|date=June 2008|work=Essex Life|publisher=Archant|pages=18–20|accessdate=5 February 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725170452/http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}} (Registration required.)</ref>

==Sport==
Clacton has a cricket club and a football team called [[F.C. Clacton]], whose best [[F.A. Cup]] performance was the 1st round. The football team play at the Austin Arena with the bus shelter being the stand for the passionate supporters.  The name was derived after someone said it looked like a bus shelter. The club then took bus timetables and stuck them on it, to resemble a bus shelter.

The Cricket Club has many grounds around Clacton with one in Holland-on-sea and another where [[Essex County Cricket Club]] used to play. Clacton also have a rugby club with teams ranging from under 12s to a first and second team. The first and second teams play in Essex League 1 and train on a Tuesday night at 7 which is held at the rugby club in Valley Road.

== Industry ==
Prior to the foundation of Clacton-on-Sea the chief occupations in the area were farming and small-scale fishing. A steam-powered mill was built in 1867 to replace the local windmill, which was eventually demolished in 1918. Today the town's main industrial area is in the northeast of the town (Gorse Lane Industrial Estate and Oakwood Business Park) which contain a variety of businesses and light industrial units.

Clacton Urban District Council had provided the town with electricity since the early twentieth century from Clacton power station. Upon [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership passed to the [[British Electricity Authority]] and later to the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]. Electricity connections to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|national grid]] rendered the small 2.15 [[Watt|megawatt]] (MW) internal combustion engine power station redundant. It closed in 1966; in its final year of operation it delivered 796 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity to the town.<ref>''CEGB Statistical Yearbook 1966'', CEGB, London.</ref>

==Landmarks==

Clacton has comparatively few buildings of architectural interest. In addition to the surviving large seafront hotels there are:

===St John's Church, Gt Clacton===
The parish church of St John, Gt. Clacton, is the oldest surviving building in the urban district, dating from the early decades of the 12th century, though considerably altered. A local legend that smugglers used a tunnel from the coast to the Ship Inn (16th century) opposite the church is discounted by historians. The pub is more than 1.5&nbsp;km from the sea. The nearby Queens Head inn may be pre-1600.

===St James's Church===
A large (and actually unfinished) church of 1912-13 between Tower Road and Wash Lane, St James's is a rare southern building by [[Temple Moore]], an architect chiefly associated with the North of England. Somewhat grim on the outside (as [[Pevsner]] noted in ''The Buildings of Essex''), the interior is surprisingly light and spare, with different orders of arch on either side of the chancel giving an asymmetrical feel. The building is only a third of its intended size, and the original plans included a large tower at the West end. Ordered for anglo-catholic worship, it is large, without pews and boasts an impressive reredos which finishes in a canopy at the East end.

===Clacton Rail Station===
The main station building dates from 1929. A typical neo-Georgian 'late Imperial'-style building, it is notable chiefly for the decorative use of moulded '[[fasces]]' on either side of the main entrance - a rare instance of [[Fascist]] symbolism in British civic architecture.

===Clacton Town Hall===
In Station Road. Another Late Imperial, neo-Georgian building, with a tall and portentous portico of Composite columns flanked by rather feeble-looking single-story wings. It also houses the Princes Theatre. The architect was Sir A. Brumwell Thomas.

===Martello Towers===
There are three of these between the Pier and Jaywick Sands to the south. They date from 1809-12. The immensely thick brick walls look circular, but are in fact rounded triangles, designed to deflect cannon-fire. The tower nearest the Pier was, unusually, built within a moat. The name comes from similar fortifications in Mortella, Corsica.

===Moot Hall===
A real oddity: in Albany Gardens West, near the seafront to the north of the Pier, this house of the 1400s was moved from the village of [[Hawstead, Suffolk]] and reconstructed here in 1911 – though considerably modernised and altered – for a London builder named J H Gill.

===St Helena Hospice===
In Jackson Road, in the town centre. Clacton's best modern building, an elegantly curved wood and brick corner design of 2001-2 by the Purcell Miller Tritton architectural partnership.

===Jaywick Sands===
{{Main|Jaywick}}
Originally (1920s and '30s) a huddle of self-builds and kit-houses in a bleak field dangerously close to mean sea level, and in places still little more than a shanty town, Jaywick nevertheless has its admirers as 'folk-architecture'. It was badly damaged by the [[North Sea flood of 1953|floods of 1953]], when almost 50 residents died. In recent years it has begun to acquire facilities which the developed world widely regards as indispensable, such as metalled roads, and a sewage system. The Martello Tower is used as an art space.

===Clacton Pier===
{{Main|Clacton Pier}}
[[File:Clacton pier 700.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Clacton Pier viewed from the south west]]
[[Clacton Pier]] was the first building of the new resort of Clacton-on-Sea.

==Climate==
Clacton has an [[Maritime Climate|oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] \"Cfb\") but with lower precipitation than most of the UK and Western Europe. This makes for pleasantly warm and relatively dry summers (which also enhances the towns popularity as a sea-side town), but also fairly chilly winter days. For the 1961–1990 observation period, Clacton averaged 103.7 days with at least 1mm of rain annually, and just 24.3 air frosts a year- comparable to south west coastal locations.

==Demography==
Clacton's population increased substantially during the 20th century from 7,456 at the 1901 census to 25,000 in the 1960s, 45,065 in 1991 and reaching over 53,000 by 2001.
Population as 107,237 according to Dataloft Inform, Land Registry, 2011 Census

==Education==
St Osyth's Teacher Training College occupied several buildings in Clacton, mostly along Marine Parade East, until its amalgamation with the North East Essex Technical College in the late 1970s. The town is served by three secondary schools, [[Clacton Coastal Academy]], [[Clacton County High School]] and [[Tendring Enterprise Studio School]]. The [[Colchester Institute]] has a site on Church Road and Thomas Road.  Adult Community Learning, run by Essex County Council, is situated in St Osyth Road.there are also multiple junior schools like Alton Park with all most 500 kids that have in rolled which spans to year 3 to 6.

==Transport==
[[File:Weeley By-pass (Mk 2) - geograph.org.uk - 124855.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Weeley]] A133 bypass]]

Clacton-on-Sea is located at the terminus of the A133 road which runs between Clacton and Colchester.

The town is served by [[Clacton-on-Sea railway station]] (90 minutes to London Liverpool Street station) via the [[Sunshine Coast Line]] whose two branches (the other runs from [[Walton-on-the-Naze railway station|Walton-on-the-Naze]]) converge before [[Thorpe-le-Soken railway station|Thorpe-le-Soken]].

The town is served by bus routes operated by [[Hedingham Omnibuses]]. Termini include [[Colchester]], [[Manningtree]], [[Harwich]] and [[Walton-on-the-Naze]]. [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operates coach services to/from London and Liverpool. First Essex withdrew from serving Clacton in January 2020. Hedingham Omnibus are now the only operator serving Clacton from Colchester.

Clacton also has [[Clacton Airport]], which has been active since its use by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during the [[Second World War]]. In the 1990s, the airfield was featured in the BBC television series \"[[Airport (TV series)|Airport]]\".

==Conservation==
Clacton's environmental qualities draw on several things: proximity to the sea, its evolution as the resort, its attraction as a retirement area, and its business and trade. The conservation and enhancement of Clacton's various environmental qualities depends on assessment, evaluation and management.

Both Tendring District Council and Essex County Council can advise on heritage and historic buildings. The district also advises on wildlife conservation, and on obtaining grants for managing countryside for public enjoyment and appreciation. The county has an archaeological service.

'''Operation Appearance''' (16 March – 8 April 1941) was a [[British Empire|British]] landing in the [[British Somaliland Protectorate]] against troops of the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]]. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] had taken place seven months previous in August 1940. The British had withdrawn from the protectorate after a delaying action at the [[Battle of Tug Argan]]. The British withdrawal, after the disastrous conclusion of the [[Battle of France]] and the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, had repercussions among British leaders and began the loss of confidence in General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the British commander in the Middle East by the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], which culminated in his sacking on 20 June 1941.

British, Empire and Commonwealth forces from the [[United Kingdom]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]] in Aden trained for a prospective invasion of British Somaliland. The [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Far Eastern Fleet]] provided Force D, comprising two cruisers, two destroyers and a collection of adapted troop transports. To deceive the Italians in Ethiopia about British intentions in East Africa, Operation Camilla was leaked, suggesting that troop movements to Sudan were for an invasion of British Somaliland and that a diversionary operation would come from Kenya in the south. In Operation Canvas, the real invasion plan, Kenya was the base for the main invasion.

Force D and the Aden Striking Force conducted a [[amphibious warfare|beach landing]] at Berbera on 16 March 1941, taking the port by {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} The Italian garrison made a precipitate retreat back to Ethiopia and local troops deserted en masse. In a few days, Berbera was developed to receive troops and supplies for the operations against Ethiopia, reducing the supply distance to the fighting front by {{cvt|500|mi|km|0}}. A British military administration was imposed on the protectorate, the local police and the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] were re-established, civilians were disarmed and the economy was revived.

==Background==

===Strategic situation, 1940===

{{Main article|Italian conquest of British Somaliland}}

On 10 June 1940, when Italy declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], Italian military forces commanded by the viceroy and governor general of {{lang|it|[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]}} (AOI, Italian East Africa), the [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]] became a threat to the British and French holds on their colonies in East Africa. Italian forces in Eritrea endangered British sea routes along the coast of East Africa, to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[French Somaliland]], [[British Somaliland]] and [[Kenya Colony]] (British Kenya) were vulnerable to attacks from the AOI. The collapse in France and the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] drastically weakened the British strategic position in the Middle East and East Africa. The closure of the Mediterranean to British sea traffic left only the {{cvt|13000|mi|km|abbr=on}} voyage around Africa, to supply the British forces in the Middle East. On the eve of the Italian declaration of war, the Italian colonies in East Africa had {{nowrap|91,203 Italian}} members of the armed forces and police and {{nowrap|199,973 Eritrean,}} Ethiopian and Somali {{lang|it|[[Askari|ascari]]}}. In July, the British had {{nowrap|47,000 men}} in British Kenya, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and British Somaliland.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=48–70}}{{efn|Reinforcements later increased this to a peak of {{nowrap|254,000 men}} in East Africa.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=48–70}}}}

===Italian invasion===

{{wide image|File:Somaliland Italian invasion.png|600px|align-cap=center|Map showing the Italian invasion of the British Somaliland Protectorate (3–19 August 1940) and adjacent territories of [[French Somaliland]], [[Italian Ethiopia]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]}}
On 3 August 1940, British reconnaissance aircraft discovered that about {{nowrap|400 Italian}} troops had crossed the Ethiopian–British Somaliland frontier at Biyad, near [[Borama]] (Boorama). The Italian invasion force moved in three widely dispersed columns, co-ordinated by wireless and liaison aircraft. The main (central) Italian column advanced from the region of [[Harar]] in Italian Ethiopia, crossed the border south of Borama and reached [[Hargeisa]] on 5 August. The [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] skirmished with the Italians as they advanced and the central column attacked Hargeisa with infantry and light tanks covered by artillery and air attacks. A Rhodesian infantry company blocking the road retreated, after knocking out three light tanks, while the main British force slowly retired from the town. On the same day, the northern invasion column captured the port of [[Zeila]] (Saylac), not far from French Somaliland and then slowly advanced the {{cvt|150|mi|km}} down the coast road to [[Berbera]], taking [[Bulhar]] (Bulaxaar), about {{cvt|50|mi|km}} from Berbera, on 17 August.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=71–77}}

The main Italian force advanced in the centre from Hargeisa along the road to Berbera, only slightly delayed by road demolitions and improvised land mines. British troops in advanced positions were withdrawn on 10 August and the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] took place from 11 to 15 August. The Italians had achieved air superiority by 6 August and the defenders held the gap against Italian attacks for 72 hours, eventually running out of ammunition. Italian artillery superiority led to the defenders gradually being overwhelmed. By the time that the northern Italian column reached Bulhar, the defence of the Tug Argan gap had begun to collapse. Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen]] had been sent to command the forces in British Somaliland and on 14 August, judged that the situation at Tug Argan was irretrievable and was instructed by the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] Middle East [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] to withdraw from the protectorate (Wavell was in Britain). The garrison retreated to Berbera and by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} 18 August, most of the contingent had been evacuated to Aden, with the HQ sailing in {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} on the morning of 19 August; Italian forces entered Berbera that evening.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=77–94}} The British suffered {{nowrap|38 men}} killed and {{nowrap|222 men}} wounded; the Italians {{nowrap|2,052 casualties.}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}}

===Operation Camilla===
[[File:Somalia Topography en.png|thumb|{{centre|Topographical map of post-war Somalia, the former protectorate of British Somaliland to the north}}]]
After the retreat to Aden, the British established Military Mission No. 106 (Hamilton's Mission) to conduct sabotage and subversion operations in occupied British Somaliland. The former Senior Administrative Officer of the protectorate, Reginald Smith, made several secret journeys to the land to glean information. In Cairo, General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], GOC-in-C [[Middle East Command]] concocted Operation Camilla, a deception to mislead the Italians about the transfer of troops to Sudan. The operation was intended to convince the Italians that the troops movements were part of a plan to invade British Somaliland in February 1941 and then advance on Harar. Wavell wrote in a document that,

{{quote|...the loss of British Somaliland has always rankled bitterly between my government and myself. I got a rocket from the government and nearly lost my job at the time.... I have orders to recapture it as soon as resources are available and am most anxious to remove this blot on my reputation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=116}}}}

The document purported Operation Canvas, the invasion of Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia from Kenya, to be a diversion; it was sent to the local commanders in East Africa using means by which the British expected it to leak to the Italians. The main invasion from Kenya required a huge supply effort and the plan to re-capture British Somaliland was intended to create a much closer supply route from Berbera for the southern invasion force. The port was rudimentary but improvements could quickly be effected. Aosta, the Italian commander of the AOI was convinced by February that an invasion of the colony was imminent.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=116, 137–138|2a1=Rankin|2y=2009|2pp=316–317}}

==Prelude==

===Plan===
The British made use of such resources as were available to [[British Forces Aden]] (Air Vice-Marshal [[Ranald Reid]]) to re-capture Berbera and expand it into a bridgehead sufficient to supply {{nowrap|15,000 troops.}}{{sfnm|1a1=Rohwer|1a2=Hümmelchen|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Wavell|2y=1946|2p=3,529}} About {{nowrap|3,000 men}} of the Aden Striking Force, comprising the 1/[[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and 3/[[15th Punjab Regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]] (1895–1947), which had fought in the colony during the Italian invasion, a Somali commando detachment and the 1401/1402 (Aden) Companies, [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps Group]] and 150 [[motor transport]] (MT) would be transported {{conv|140|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} across the Gulf of Aden.{{sfnm|1a1=Rohwer|1a2=Hümmelchen|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Raugh|2y=1993|2p=178|3a1=Collins|3y=1964|3p=46}} The [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|East Indies Fleet]], comprising ships of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Indian Navy]] were to contribute Force D (Captain Harold Hickling), the cruisers {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} and {{HMS|Caledon|D53|2}}, the destroyers {{HMS|Kandahar|F28|6}} and {{HMS|Kipling|F91|2}}, the auxiliary cruisers ''Chakdina'' and ''Chantala'', Royal Indian Navy trawlers ''Netravati'' and ''Parvati'' (Lieutenant [[HMS Choudri]], R.I.N.), the troop transports S.S. Beaconsfield and Tuna and {{nowrap|ML 109.}}{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1992|p=55}} Force D was to conduct the voyage in two parts, the advanced part comprising ''Kandahar'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Parvati'', ''Netravati'' and the cargo ships ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'', carrying troops and towing three tugs and six lighters. The second wave of Force D comprised ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kingston'' and M.L. 109, all transporting troops.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=46–47}}

===Preparations===
Training began in January, ships were converted to carry troops, two of the lighters, designed by the Sea Transport Officer, Aden, Commander Vernon were to be used as floating piers, fitted with ramps to ease the unloading of the MT, including armoured cars. The RAF flew reconnaissance sorties to find suitable landing points, discover Italian defensive preparations and find potential landing grounds for their aircraft. With fire support from the cruisers and destroyers, the invasion force was to land on beaches between reefs to the east and west of Berbera, create a bridgehead and then re-occupy the protectorate.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139, 138}} The air photographs obtained were an incomplete set and the Navy considered that towing vessels from Aden was risky because the tows could part and delay the voyage. In poor visibility finding Berbera could not be guaranteed and approaching an unsurveyed, hostile and dark shore at night, then finding gaps in the reefs wide enough to tow through the lighters was a gamble.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=46}} The importance of Berbera to the British offensive against Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was such that the risks were accepted. On the three nights before the landings, the RAF bombed the big Italian base at [[Dire Dawa]] in Ethiopia.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139, 138}}

===Voyage===
On 14 March the first echelon departed Aden at {{nowrap|10:45 p.m.}} but only {{conv|10|nmi|mi+km}} out, tows parted, some wrapping around the ships' propellers. To keep to the schedule a quick change of plan was made; ''Kandahar'' left the tugs and lighters for ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'' to tow. The naval ships went ahead to make rendezvous {{conv|10|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north of the Berbera Light at {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.}} on 16 March according to the plan. The [[Shoreham-class sloop|sloop]] {{HMS|Shoreham|L32|6}} was sent from Aden to assist ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'' by {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} on 15 March. The second echelon sailed an hour later and rendezvoused as planned. At {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.}} on 16 March ''Glasgow'', '' Caledon'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Netravati'', ''Parvati'' and M.L. 109 were to land the 1/2 and 3/15 Punjab at Main Beach, {{conv|2|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera Light covered by a bombardment from ''Glasgow'', along with ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'', which carried the 200 Somali commandos of Force G (R) who were to make the subsidiary landing east of Berbera, covered by ''Kandahar''. The ships were to close on the coast at {{conv|12|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Shoreham'', ''Beaconsfield'', ''Tuna'' with the three tugs and six lighters in tow were about midway between Aden and Berbera moving at {{conv|6|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=46–47}}

==Invasion==

===Landings===
At {{nowrap|1:01 a.m.}} on 16 March ''Glasgow'', ''Kandahar'', ''Kingston'' and M.L. 109 moved forward at {{conv|20|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} towards Berbera Light and to find the gaps in the reefs off the landing beaches. ''Caledon'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Netravati'' and ''Parvati'' were to arrive off the west beach at {{nowrap|2:30 a.m.}} and drop anchor near ''Glasgow'' which would be showing a red light out to sea. During the approach lights were seen ashore from vehicles on the Hargeisa Road, bound for Berbera. At {{nowrap|2:03 a.m.}} on 16 March, the Berbera Light was seen on a bearing 186° at {{conv|3|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} distance. ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'' separated from the force and made for the eastern beach; ''Glasgow'' stopped and launched a motor boat and skiff for Commander Vernon to use to find the gap in the reef off the western beach. The gap was hard to find and there was a delay of 63 minutes in landing the first tows. ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'' found their gap in the reef off the eastern beach at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} although the reconnaissance photographs had shown this to be the harder of the two to find. The delay led to apprehension by Colonel Pollock and Captain Hickling (the captain of Glasgow) that the landing might occur in daylight.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=47}}

The landing at the eastern beach due at {{nowrap|3:30 a.m.}} was also delayed; at {{nowrap|3:26 a.m.}} a Somali fisherman in a canoe rowed up to ''Glasgow''. The fisherman said that Italians still occupied the town but some had left by lorry that night; there were Italians near the Berbera Light. The Somali was sent to find the gap in the reefs but Vernon found it at {{nowrap|3:58 a.m.}} At {{nowrap|4:13 a.m.}} the signal \"Land, follow Glasgow's boats\" was given and four minutes later ''Glasgow'' began to bombarded the main beach with H.E. from its 4-inch guns and [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder pom-poms]]. The fire from the 4-inch main armament was that used for E-boat attack, with half the shells bursting on impact and the other half bursting {{conv|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the target, until {{nowrap|4:20 a.m.}} when ''Kingston'' received the order to begin landing on the eastern beach. ''Kandahar'' bombarded the beach from {{nowrap|4:25–4:35 a.m.}} Tows moved through the gaps to the eastern and western beaches, success signals coming from at the western beach was made at {{nowrap|4:48 a.m.}} and at the eastern beach at {{nowrap|5:26 a.m.}} During the disembarkations shells burst among the tows and ships offshore, thought to be from four to six 4-inch guns and some ineffectual machine-gun fire; the 6-inch, 4-inch and pom-poms of the bombardment ships silenced the Italian artillery. ''Glasgow'' mainly engaged trenches near the Berbera Light and west of the aerodrome. ''Kandahar'' concentrated on the defences to the east of the town.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=47–48}}

===Berbera===
{{wide image|File:Somaliland (6936711023) (2).jpg|700px|align-cap=center|Photograph of the Berbera landscape (2012)}}
Anticipating a British landing, the Duke of Aosta, the Viceroy of the AOI, had agreed to the evacuation of the protectorate. On 14 March the Italian garrison began to evacuate the territory and the 17th Colonial Brigade retired to Dire Dawa. The 70th Colonial Brigade remained, except for its commander, Brigadier-General Arturo Bertello who passed through Dire Dawa just before it was captured.{{sfn|Del Boca|2001|p=506}} When the naval bombardment began, about {{nowrap|1,500 Somali}} troops in Italian service and their Italian officers and NCOs retreated from Berbera towards Hargeisa.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=138}} The first wave, comprising the 15th Punjab Regiment, was carried by ''Parvati'' which towed a tug and barge for the landing. ''Parvati'' was bracketed by three 4-inch shells but the landing was carried out without loss against scant opposition. The 2nd Punjab Regiment landed and advanced through the 15th Punjab towards the town, as a party of the 15th Punjab moved inland to cut the coast road. All of the troops involved got ashore before dawn. Little opposition was met with ashore and the town was captured by {{nowrap|9:20 a.m.}} on 16 March. The British and Indian troops suffered few casualties and over 100 prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=49}} Due to a mistake, the Aden Pioneers, who were unarmed, had been ordered to attack with the Punjabis and their commander, Captain S. J. H. Harrison wrote later,

{{quote|The sun was just peeping over the eastern skyline [;] we came under rifle fire...when to our utter amazement we saw the Italian enemy leaping out of their trenches and racing towards transport vehicles....The vehicles started up and the entire enemy column high-tailed in a great cloud of yellowish grey dust...southwards...to Hargeisa....{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=178}}}}

A diversion to the east of Berbera was engaged by sixty members of the garrison but the landing party suffered only one Somali soldier killed and a British officer wounded. A wireless message sent to London that \"The British flag flies again over Berbera\" but the invaders had forgotten to bring one and had to borrow it from a resident. RAF fighters provided a standing patrol on the day of the invasion and for the next four days.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=138–140}}

The second echelon ships had arrived by the time that Berbera fell and tugs checked the harbour for mines with [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|Oropesa sweeps]]. By {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} Force D was unloading; the special motor transport pier consisting of the two modified lighters was assembled at the spit and motor transport unloaded from ''Beaconsfield'' by {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} The landing force was well established ashore with adequate stores and rations, local water being available. Air reconnaissance reported the hinterland to be deserted (naval protection ended on 18 March when ''Glasgow'' departed; air cover continued until 20 March). The Shaad and customs piers had been damaged but couls be repaired with local materials; demolitions at the power station and refrigerating plant required assistance from Aden to make them operational. The water supply was about to be blown up but the occupation troops prevented it. Mining of the aerodrome had been carried out and the RAF was informed. The landing force sent 43 Italian prisoners of war to Aden in ''Parvati'' on the day of the landings, as the hospital ship Karapara which was not needed. About {{nowrap|5:33 a.m.}} on 17 March some aircraft were heard and a barrage was fired; no further Italian aircraft were seen during the day.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=50, 49}}

On 11 March the [[1st Infantry Brigade (South Africa)|1st South African Brigade Group]] and the [[22nd East African Brigade Group]] had been placed under the command of the [[1st (African) Division|11th (African) Division]], joining the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade|3rd (Nigerian) Brigade Group]]. The division advanced from [[Barawa]] (Brava), south of Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland. On 25 February the division departed Mogadishu and on 17 March, patrols of the 3rd (Nigerian) Brigade reached [[Jijiga]], cutting the road to Harar, the Italian line of retreat from the protectorate.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=416–418}} On 19 March, Brigadier Buchanan and a staff officer arrived by air at Berbera to take command of Bucforce, a temporary name for the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade, most of which had sailed from Mombasa on 16 March and was due on 22 March. On 20 March, a party of Nigerian troops reached [[Tug Wajale]], from whence two armoured cars drove to Berbera along the road from Hargeisa and joined with the Aden Striking Force.{{sfn|Orpen|1968|p=227}} The Italian 70th Colonial Brigade became one of the many units of the Italian colonial forces in the AOI that had begun to desert en masse. When Bertello was captured in Western Abyssinia, he claimed that his brigade had \"melted away\".{{sfn|Del Boca|2001|p=506}}{{efn|According to a contemporary account, on 20 March, a small motorised column of Nigerian troops occupied [[Tug Wajale]] on the border, from where two armoured cars captured Hargeisa, linking up with the forces at Berbera.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
The Italian occupation had lasted seven months; in the British [[official history]] volume I (1954), [[I. S. O. Playfair]] wrote that the port was quickly prepared, despite a shortage of lighters, no electric lights, the heat and the ''Kharif'' (autumn wind) blowing sand and increasing the [[Breaking wave|surf]]. Within the week, the 11th African Division was receiving supplies through Berbera, shortening by {{cvt|500|mi|km|0}} its supply line.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=418}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart, in \"The First Victory...\" wrote that the British ascribed the success of Appearance to the extent of the preparations and training. He speculated that the use of ships as floating piers might have influenced the use of [[Mulberry harbour]]s in the [[Normandy landings]].{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139–140}}

===Subsequent events===
After the Italian garrison fled, a prisoner of war camp was built, eventually big enough for {{nowrap|5,000 men,}} to accommodate Italian prisoners taken in the region.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=138–140|2a1=Rodd|2y=1970|2p=177}} Two battalions of the [[2nd Infantry Brigade (South Africa)|2nd South African Brigade]] arrived by sea from Kenya, the third battalion arriving two weeks later, after making a road march with the brigade transport. On 8 April, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater|Arthur Chater]], the former commander of the Somaliland Camel Corps was appointed Military Governor.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|p=177}} The Italians had abandoned Zeila on 18 March and a retired Somali police inspector uncovered a hidden British flag, raised it and began to collect abandoned Italian arms and equipment. On 23 March a Somaliland police officer landed and recalled the local police. The Somaliland Camel Corps had been disbanded after the British evacuation and by the time British returned to the headquarters in Burao on 18 April, 80 percent of the former members had made their way to Berbera. On 4 May a company of the corps began a mission to suppress a Mijjertein raiding party, the rest of the corps conducting disarmament operations with a motley of captured Italian weapons and equipment.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|pp=180–181}}

[[File:Another Dhow.JPG|thumb|left|{{centre|Dhow sailing in the Indian Ocean, 2009}}]]
Many of the buildings in Berbera had been damaged, government stations demolished andthe civilian wireless and telephone networks were out of action. Army signals units had to carry civilian administration messages until the infrastructure had been restored. The economy of the protectorate had been greatly harmed by the war, internal trade had stopped, there were no regular shipping services with Aden and only [[dhow]]s were available. There was little food in the territory but the livestock herd had increased since 1939 and had suffered little from the Italians. The fall of Addis Ababa restored confidence, internal trade resumed and by the autumn the export trade had revived. Once Berbera replaced [[Mogadishu]] as an [[entrepôt]], demand for labour increased; payment in wages and in food acted as an economic stimulus and local businessmen immediately made use of the sea traffic to and from Berbera; a return to normal conditions did not occur Zeila and Boramo, near the border with French Somaliland, due to the need to blockade the pro-[[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|pp=180–182}}

'''Operation Appearance''' (16 March – 8 April 1941) was a [[British Empire|British]] landing in the [[British Somaliland Protectorate]] against troops of the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]]. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] had taken place seven months previous in August 1940. The British had withdrawn from the protectorate after a delaying action at the [[Battle of Tug Argan]]. The British withdrawal, after the disastrous conclusion of the [[Battle of France]] and the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, had repercussions among British leaders and began the loss of confidence in General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the British commander in the Middle East by the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], which culminated in his sacking on 20 June 1941.

British, Empire and Commonwealth forces from the [[United Kingdom]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]] in Aden trained for a prospective invasion of British Somaliland. The [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Far Eastern Fleet]] provided Force D, comprising two cruisers, two destroyers and a collection of adapted troop transports. To deceive the Italians in Ethiopia about British intentions in East Africa, Operation Camilla was leaked, suggesting that troop movements to Sudan were for an invasion of British Somaliland and that a diversionary operation would come from Kenya in the south. In Operation Canvas, the real invasion plan, Kenya was the base for the main invasion.

Force D and the Aden Striking Force conducted a [[amphibious warfare|beach landing]] at Berbera on 16 March 1941, taking the port by {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} The Italian garrison made a precipitate retreat back to Ethiopia and local troops deserted en masse. In a few days, Berbera was developed to receive troops and supplies for the operations against Ethiopia, reducing the supply distance to the fighting front by {{cvt|500|mi|km|0}}. A British military administration was imposed on the protectorate, the local police and the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] were re-established, civilians were disarmed and the economy was revived.

==Background==

===Strategic situation, 1940===

{{Main article|Italian conquest of British Somaliland}}

On 10 June 1940, when Italy declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], Italian military forces commanded by the viceroy and governor general of {{lang|it|[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]}} (AOI, Italian East Africa), the [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]] became a threat to the British and French holds on their colonies in East Africa. Italian forces in Eritrea endangered British sea routes along the coast of East Africa, to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[French Somaliland]], [[British Somaliland]] and [[Kenya Colony]] (British Kenya) were vulnerable to attacks from the AOI. The collapse in France and the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] drastically weakened the British strategic position in the Middle East and East Africa. The closure of the Mediterranean to British sea traffic left only the {{cvt|13000|mi|km|abbr=on}} voyage around Africa, to supply the British forces in the Middle East. On the eve of the Italian declaration of war, the Italian colonies in East Africa had {{nowrap|91,203 Italian}} members of the armed forces and police and {{nowrap|199,973 Eritrean,}} Ethiopian and Somali {{lang|it|[[Askari|ascari]]}}. In July, the British had {{nowrap|47,000 men}} in British Kenya, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and British Somaliland.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=48–70}}{{efn|Reinforcements later increased this to a peak of {{nowrap|254,000 men}} in East Africa.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=48–70}}}}

===Italian invasion===

{{wide image|File:Somaliland Italian invasion.png|600px|align-cap=center|Map showing the Italian invasion of the British Somaliland Protectorate (3–19 August 1940) and adjacent territories of [[French Somaliland]], [[Italian Ethiopia]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]}}
On 3 August 1940, British reconnaissance aircraft discovered that about {{nowrap|400 Italian}} troops had crossed the Ethiopian–British Somaliland frontier at Biyad, near [[Borama]] (Boorama). The Italian invasion force moved in three widely dispersed columns, co-ordinated by wireless and liaison aircraft. The main (central) Italian column advanced from the region of [[Harar]] in Italian Ethiopia, crossed the border south of Borama and reached [[Hargeisa]] on 5 August. The [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] skirmished with the Italians as they advanced and the central column attacked Hargeisa with infantry and light tanks covered by artillery and air attacks. A Rhodesian infantry company blocking the road retreated, after knocking out three light tanks, while the main British force slowly retired from the town. On the same day, the northern invasion column captured the port of [[Zeila]] (Saylac), not far from French Somaliland and then slowly advanced the {{cvt|150|mi|km}} down the coast road to [[Berbera]], taking [[Bulhar]] (Bulaxaar), about {{cvt|50|mi|km}} from Berbera, on 17 August.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=71–77}}

The main Italian force advanced in the centre from Hargeisa along the road to Berbera, only slightly delayed by road demolitions and improvised land mines. British troops in advanced positions were withdrawn on 10 August and the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] took place from 11 to 15 August. The Italians had achieved air superiority by 6 August and the defenders held the gap against Italian attacks for 72 hours, eventually running out of ammunition. Italian artillery superiority led to the defenders gradually being overwhelmed. By the time that the northern Italian column reached Bulhar, the defence of the Tug Argan gap had begun to collapse. Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen]] had been sent to command the forces in British Somaliland and on 14 August, judged that the situation at Tug Argan was irretrievable and was instructed by the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] Middle East [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] to withdraw from the protectorate (Wavell was in Britain). The garrison retreated to Berbera and by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} 18 August, most of the contingent had been evacuated to Aden, with the HQ sailing in {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} on the morning of 19 August; Italian forces entered Berbera that evening.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=77–94}} The British suffered {{nowrap|38 men}} killed and {{nowrap|222 men}} wounded; the Italians {{nowrap|2,052 casualties.}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}}

===Operation Camilla===
[[File:Somalia Topography en.png|thumb|{{centre|Topographical map of post-war Somalia, the former protectorate of British Somaliland to the north}}]]
After the retreat to Aden, the British established Military Mission No. 106 (Hamilton's Mission) to conduct sabotage and subversion operations in occupied British Somaliland. The former Senior Administrative Officer of the protectorate, Reginald Smith, made several secret journeys to the land to glean information. In Cairo, General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], GOC-in-C [[Middle East Command]] concocted Operation Camilla, a deception to mislead the Italians about the transfer of troops to Sudan. The operation was intended to convince the Italians that the troops movements were part of a plan to invade British Somaliland in February 1941 and then advance on Harar. Wavell wrote in a document that,

{{quote|...the loss of British Somaliland has always rankled bitterly between my government and myself. I got a rocket from the government and nearly lost my job at the time.... I have orders to recapture it as soon as resources are available and am most anxious to remove this blot on my reputation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=116}}}}

The document purported Operation Canvas, the invasion of Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia from Kenya, to be a diversion; it was sent to the local commanders in East Africa using means by which the British expected it to leak to the Italians. The main invasion from Kenya required a huge supply effort and the plan to re-capture British Somaliland was intended to create a much closer supply route from Berbera for the southern invasion force. The port was rudimentary but improvements could quickly be effected. Aosta, the Italian commander of the AOI was convinced by February that an invasion of the colony was imminent.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=116, 137–138|2a1=Rankin|2y=2009|2pp=316–317}}

==Prelude==

===Plan===
The British made use of such resources as were available to [[British Forces Aden]] (Air Vice-Marshal [[Ranald Reid]]) to re-capture Berbera and expand it into a bridgehead sufficient to supply {{nowrap|15,000 troops.}}{{sfnm|1a1=Rohwer|1a2=Hümmelchen|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Wavell|2y=1946|2p=3,529}} About {{nowrap|3,000 men}} of the Aden Striking Force, comprising the 1/[[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and 3/[[15th Punjab Regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]] (1895–1947), which had fought in the colony during the Italian invasion, a Somali commando detachment and the 1401/1402 (Aden) Companies, [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps Group]] and 150 [[motor transport]] (MT) would be transported {{conv|140|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} across the Gulf of Aden.{{sfnm|1a1=Rohwer|1a2=Hümmelchen|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Raugh|2y=1993|2p=178|3a1=Collins|3y=1964|3p=46}} The [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|East Indies Fleet]], comprising ships of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Indian Navy]] were to contribute Force D (Captain Harold Hickling), the cruisers {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} and {{HMS|Caledon|D53|2}}, the destroyers {{HMS|Kandahar|F28|6}} and {{HMS|Kipling|F91|2}}, the auxiliary cruisers ''Chakdina'' and ''Chantala'', Royal Indian Navy trawlers ''Netravati'' and ''Parvati'' (Lieutenant [[HMS Choudri]], R.I.N.), the troop transports S.S. Beaconsfield and Tuna and {{nowrap|ML 109.}}{{sfn|Rohwer|Hümmelchen|1992|p=55}} Force D was to conduct the voyage in two parts, the advanced part comprising ''Kandahar'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Parvati'', ''Netravati'' and the cargo ships ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'', carrying troops and towing three tugs and six lighters. The second wave of Force D comprised ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kingston'' and M.L. 109, all transporting troops.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=46–47}}

===Preparations===
Training began in January, ships were converted to carry troops, two of the lighters, designed by the Sea Transport Officer, Aden, Commander Vernon were to be used as floating piers, fitted with ramps to ease the unloading of the MT, including armoured cars. The RAF flew reconnaissance sorties to find suitable landing points, discover Italian defensive preparations and find potential landing grounds for their aircraft. With fire support from the cruisers and destroyers, the invasion force was to land on beaches between reefs to the east and west of Berbera, create a bridgehead and then re-occupy the protectorate.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139, 138}} The air photographs obtained were an incomplete set and the Navy considered that towing vessels from Aden was risky because the tows could part and delay the voyage. In poor visibility finding Berbera could not be guaranteed and approaching an unsurveyed, hostile and dark shore at night, then finding gaps in the reefs wide enough to tow through the lighters was a gamble.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=46}} The importance of Berbera to the British offensive against Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was such that the risks were accepted. On the three nights before the landings, the RAF bombed the big Italian base at [[Dire Dawa]] in Ethiopia.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139, 138}}

===Voyage===
On 14 March the first echelon departed Aden at {{nowrap|10:45 p.m.}} but only {{conv|10|nmi|mi+km}} out, tows parted, some wrapping around the ships' propellers. To keep to the schedule a quick change of plan was made; ''Kandahar'' left the tugs and lighters for ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'' to tow. The naval ships went ahead to make rendezvous {{conv|10|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north of the Berbera Light at {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.}} on 16 March according to the plan. The [[Shoreham-class sloop|sloop]] {{HMS|Shoreham|L32|6}} was sent from Aden to assist ''Beaconsfield'' and ''Tuna'' by {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} on 15 March. The second echelon sailed an hour later and rendezvoused as planned. At {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.}} on 16 March ''Glasgow'', '' Caledon'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Netravati'', ''Parvati'' and M.L. 109 were to land the 1/2 and 3/15 Punjab at Main Beach, {{conv|2|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera Light covered by a bombardment from ''Glasgow'', along with ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'', which carried the 200 Somali commandos of Force G (R) who were to make the subsidiary landing east of Berbera, covered by ''Kandahar''. The ships were to close on the coast at {{conv|12|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Shoreham'', ''Beaconsfield'', ''Tuna'' with the three tugs and six lighters in tow were about midway between Aden and Berbera moving at {{conv|6|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=46–47}}

==Invasion==

===Landings===
At {{nowrap|1:01 a.m.}} on 16 March ''Glasgow'', ''Kandahar'', ''Kingston'' and M.L. 109 moved forward at {{conv|20|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} towards Berbera Light and to find the gaps in the reefs off the landing beaches. ''Caledon'', ''Chantala'', ''Chakdina'', ''Netravati'' and ''Parvati'' were to arrive off the west beach at {{nowrap|2:30 a.m.}} and drop anchor near ''Glasgow'' which would be showing a red light out to sea. During the approach lights were seen ashore from vehicles on the Hargeisa Road, bound for Berbera. At {{nowrap|2:03 a.m.}} on 16 March, the Berbera Light was seen on a bearing 186° at {{conv|3|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} distance. ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'' separated from the force and made for the eastern beach; ''Glasgow'' stopped and launched a motor boat and skiff for Commander Vernon to use to find the gap in the reef off the western beach. The gap was hard to find and there was a delay of 63 minutes in landing the first tows. ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston'' found their gap in the reef off the eastern beach at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} although the reconnaissance photographs had shown this to be the harder of the two to find. The delay led to apprehension by Colonel Pollock and Captain Hickling (the captain of Glasgow) that the landing might occur in daylight.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=47}}

The landing at the eastern beach due at {{nowrap|3:30 a.m.}} was also delayed; at {{nowrap|3:26 a.m.}} a Somali fisherman in a canoe rowed up to ''Glasgow''. The fisherman said that Italians still occupied the town but some had left by lorry that night; there were Italians near the Berbera Light. The Somali was sent to find the gap in the reefs but Vernon found it at {{nowrap|3:58 a.m.}} At {{nowrap|4:13 a.m.}} the signal \"Land, follow Glasgow's boats\" was given and four minutes later ''Glasgow'' began to bombarded the main beach with H.E. from its 4-inch guns and [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder pom-poms]]. The fire from the 4-inch main armament was that used for E-boat attack, with half the shells bursting on impact and the other half bursting {{conv|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the target, until {{nowrap|4:20 a.m.}} when ''Kingston'' received the order to begin landing on the eastern beach. ''Kandahar'' bombarded the beach from {{nowrap|4:25–4:35 a.m.}} Tows moved through the gaps to the eastern and western beaches, success signals coming from at the western beach was made at {{nowrap|4:48 a.m.}} and at the eastern beach at {{nowrap|5:26 a.m.}} During the disembarkations shells burst among the tows and ships offshore, thought to be from four to six 4-inch guns and some ineffectual machine-gun fire; the 6-inch, 4-inch and pom-poms of the bombardment ships silenced the Italian artillery. ''Glasgow'' mainly engaged trenches near the Berbera Light and west of the aerodrome. ''Kandahar'' concentrated on the defences to the east of the town.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=47–48}}

===Berbera===
{{wide image|File:Somaliland (6936711023) (2).jpg|700px|align-cap=center|Photograph of the Berbera landscape (2012)}}
Anticipating a British landing, the Duke of Aosta, the Viceroy of the AOI, had agreed to the evacuation of the protectorate. On 14 March the Italian garrison began to evacuate the territory and the 17th Colonial Brigade retired to Dire Dawa. The 70th Colonial Brigade remained, except for its commander, Brigadier-General Arturo Bertello who passed through Dire Dawa just before it was captured.{{sfn|Del Boca|2001|p=506}} When the naval bombardment began, about {{nowrap|1,500 Somali}} troops in Italian service and their Italian officers and NCOs retreated from Berbera towards Hargeisa.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=138}} The first wave, comprising the 15th Punjab Regiment, was carried by ''Parvati'' which towed a tug and barge for the landing. ''Parvati'' was bracketed by three 4-inch shells but the landing was carried out without loss against scant opposition. The 2nd Punjab Regiment landed and advanced through the 15th Punjab towards the town, as a party of the 15th Punjab moved inland to cut the coast road. All of the troops involved got ashore before dawn. Little opposition was met with ashore and the town was captured by {{nowrap|9:20 a.m.}} on 16 March. The British and Indian troops suffered few casualties and over 100 prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Collins|1964|p=49}} Due to a mistake, the Aden Pioneers, who were unarmed, had been ordered to attack with the Punjabis and their commander, Captain S. J. H. Harrison wrote later,

{{quote|The sun was just peeping over the eastern skyline [;] we came under rifle fire...when to our utter amazement we saw the Italian enemy leaping out of their trenches and racing towards transport vehicles....The vehicles started up and the entire enemy column high-tailed in a great cloud of yellowish grey dust...southwards...to Hargeisa....{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=178}}}}

A diversion to the east of Berbera was engaged by sixty members of the garrison but the landing party suffered only one Somali soldier killed and a British officer wounded. A wireless message sent to London that \"The British flag flies again over Berbera\" but the invaders had forgotten to bring one and had to borrow it from a resident. RAF fighters provided a standing patrol on the day of the invasion and for the next four days.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=138–140}}

The second echelon ships had arrived by the time that Berbera fell and tugs checked the harbour for mines with [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|Oropesa sweeps]]. By {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} Force D was unloading; the special motor transport pier consisting of the two modified lighters was assembled at the spit and motor transport unloaded from ''Beaconsfield'' by {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} The landing force was well established ashore with adequate stores and rations, local water being available. Air reconnaissance reported the hinterland to be deserted (naval protection ended on 18 March when ''Glasgow'' departed; air cover continued until 20 March). The Shaad and customs piers had been damaged but couls be repaired with local materials; demolitions at the power station and refrigerating plant required assistance from Aden to make them operational. The water supply was about to be blown up but the occupation troops prevented it. Mining of the aerodrome had been carried out and the RAF was informed. The landing force sent 43 Italian prisoners of war to Aden in ''Parvati'' on the day of the landings, as the hospital ship Karapara which was not needed. About {{nowrap|5:33 a.m.}} on 17 March some aircraft were heard and a barrage was fired; no further Italian aircraft were seen during the day.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=50, 49}}

On 11 March the [[1st Infantry Brigade (South Africa)|1st South African Brigade Group]] and the [[22nd East African Brigade Group]] had been placed under the command of the [[1st (African) Division|11th (African) Division]], joining the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade|3rd (Nigerian) Brigade Group]]. The division advanced from [[Barawa]] (Brava), south of Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland. On 25 February the division departed Mogadishu and on 17 March, patrols of the 3rd (Nigerian) Brigade reached [[Jijiga]], cutting the road to Harar, the Italian line of retreat from the protectorate.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=416–418}} On 19 March, Brigadier Buchanan and a staff officer arrived by air at Berbera to take command of Bucforce, a temporary name for the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade, most of which had sailed from Mombasa on 16 March and was due on 22 March. On 20 March, a party of Nigerian troops reached [[Tug Wajale]], from whence two armoured cars drove to Berbera along the road from Hargeisa and joined with the Aden Striking Force.{{sfn|Orpen|1968|p=227}} The Italian 70th Colonial Brigade became one of the many units of the Italian colonial forces in the AOI that had begun to desert en masse. When Bertello was captured in Western Abyssinia, he claimed that his brigade had \"melted away\".{{sfn|Del Boca|2001|p=506}}{{efn|According to a contemporary account, on 20 March, a small motorised column of Nigerian troops occupied [[Tug Wajale]] on the border, from where two armoured cars captured Hargeisa, linking up with the forces at Berbera. The combined force they moved on to occupy the colony, meeting virtually no resistance.{{sfn|Abys|1942|pp=90–91}}}} On 21 March, Lieutenant-General [[Alan Cunningham]], commander of the [[East Africa Command|East African Force]], visited to congratulate the victors, to make arrangements for the expansion of the port facilities and announce the establishment of a British military administration.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=138–140|2a1=Rodd|2y=1970|2p=177}}

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
The Italian occupation had lasted seven months; in the British [[official history]] volume I (1954), [[I. S. O. Playfair]] wrote that the port was quickly prepared, despite a shortage of lighters, no electric lights, the heat and the ''Kharif'' (autumn wind) blowing sand and increasing the [[Breaking wave|surf]]. Within the week, the 11th African Division was receiving supplies through Berbera, shortening by {{cvt|500|mi|km|0}} its supply line.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=418}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart, in \"The First Victory...\" wrote that the British ascribed the success of Appearance to the extent of the preparations and training. He speculated that the use of ships as floating piers might have influenced the use of [[Mulberry harbour]]s in the [[Normandy landings]].{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=139–140}}

===Subsequent events===
After the Italian garrison fled, a prisoner of war camp was built, eventually big enough for {{nowrap|5,000 men,}} to accommodate Italian prisoners taken in the region.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=138–140|2a1=Rodd|2y=1970|2p=177}} Two battalions of the [[2nd Infantry Brigade (South Africa)|2nd South African Brigade]] arrived by sea from Kenya, the third battalion arriving two weeks later, after making a road march with the brigade transport. On 8 April, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater|Arthur Chater]], the former commander of the Somaliland Camel Corps was appointed Military Governor.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|p=177}} The Italians had abandoned Zeila on 18 March and a retired Somali police inspector uncovered a hidden British flag, raised it and began to collect abandoned Italian arms and equipment. On 23 March a Somaliland police officer landed and recalled the local police. The Somaliland Camel Corps had been disbanded after the British evacuation and by the time British returned to the headquarters in Burao on 18 April, 80 percent of the former members had made their way to Berbera. On 4 May a company of the corps began a mission to suppress a Mijjertein raiding party, the rest of the corps conducting disarmament operations with a motley of captured Italian weapons and equipment.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|pp=180–181}}

[[File:Another Dhow.JPG|thumb|left|{{centre|Dhow sailing in the Indian Ocean, 2009}}]]
Many of the buildings in Berbera had been damaged, government stations demolished andthe civilian wireless and telephone networks were out of action. Army signals units had to carry civilian administration messages until the infrastructure had been restored. The economy of the protectorate had been greatly harmed by the war, internal trade had stopped, there were no regular shipping services with Aden and only [[dhow]]s were available. There was little food in the territory but the livestock herd had increased since 1939 and had suffered little from the Italians. The fall of Addis Ababa restored confidence, internal trade resumed and by the autumn the export trade had revived. Once Berbera replaced [[Mogadishu]] as an [[entrepôt]], demand for labour increased; payment in wages and in food acted as an economic stimulus and local businessmen immediately made use of the sea traffic to and from Berbera; a return to normal conditions did not occur Zeila and Boramo, near the border with French Somaliland, due to the need to blockade the pro-[[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime.{{sfn|Rodd|1970|pp=180–182}}

'''ABC''' and its variations are [[initialism]] [[mnemonic]]s for essential steps used by both medical professionals and lay persons (such as [[first aid]]ers) when dealing with a patient. In its original form it stands for ''[[Airway]]'', ''[[Breath]]ing,'' and <!--NOTE:Do NOT change this to Compressions' or 'CPR' - please read the article for further explanation -->''[[Circulatory system|Circulation]]''.<ref name=grauniad/> The protocol was originally developed as a memory aid for rescuers performing [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], and the most widely known use of the initialism is in the care of the [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] or unresponsive patient, although it is also used as a reminder of the priorities for assessment and treatment of patients in many acute medical and trauma situations, from first-aid to hospital medical treatment.<ref name=rsukalert/> Airway, breathing, and circulation are all vital for life, and each is required, in that order, for the next to be effective. Since its development, the mnemonic has been extended and modified to fit the different areas in which it is used, with different versions changing the meaning of letters (such as from the original 'Circulation' to 'Compressions') or adding other letters (such as an optional \"D\" step for ''Disability'' or ''[[Defibrillation]]'').

In 2010, the [[American Heart Association]] and [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] changed the recommended order of [[CPR]] interventions for most cases of cardiac arrest to chest compressions, airway, and breathing, or '''CAB'''.<ref name=CircEx10>{{cite journal |vauthors=Field JM, Hazinski MF, Sayre MR |title=Part 1: executive summary: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S640–56 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20956217 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970889 |url=|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref>{{rp|S642}}<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hazinski MF, Nolan JP, Billi JE |title=Part 1: executive summary: 2010 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=16 Suppl 2 |pages=S250–75 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20956249 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970897 |url=|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Medical use==
At all levels of care, the ABC protocol exists to remind the person delivering treatment of the importance of airway, breathing, and circulation to the maintenance of a patient's life.  These three issues are paramount in any treatment, in that the loss (or loss of control of) any one of these items will rapidly lead to the patient's death. The three objectives are so important to successful patient care that they form the foundation of training for not only first aid providers but also participants in many advanced medical training programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofdearborn.org/departments/fire/firedocs/firstaid.htm|title=First Aid (City of Dearborn MI FD website)|accessdate=2008-12-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209122010/http://www.cityofdearborn.org/departments/fire/firedocs/firstaid.htm |archivedate = December 9, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Marianne Gausche-Hill |title=Pediatric airway management |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7637-2066-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpr-pro.com/fa_primary_survey.html|title=Emergency Scene Management|accessdate=2008-12-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203042035/http://cpr-pro.com/fa_primary_survey.html|archivedate=2009-02-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=American College of Physicians |author2=American Academy of Pediatrics |title=APLS: The Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource |edition=Fourth |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2003 |pages=11 |isbn=978-0-7637-3316-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Smith, Roger K. |author2=Joseph S.

[[hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]], the result of insufficient oxygen in the blood, is a potentially deadly condition and one of the leading causes of [[cardiac arrest]]. Cardiac arrest is the ultimate cause of [[clinical death]] for all animals<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| last = Kastenbaum| first = Robert| title = Definitions of Death| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Death and Dying| year = 2006| url = http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Definitions-of-Death.html| accessdate = 2007-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070203141750/http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Definitions-of-Death.html| archivedate= 3 February 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> (although with advanced intervention, such as [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] a cardiac arrest may not necessarily lead to death), and it is linked to an absence of circulation in the body, for any one of a number of reasons.  For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.

Airway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.

===CPR===
The basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].

In this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.

In the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.

Previously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.

== Airway ==
{{main article|airway management}}

=== Unconscious patients ===
In the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  Common problems with the airway of patient with a seriously reduced level of consciousness involve blockage of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] by the [[tongue]], a [[foreign body]], or [[vomiting|vomit]].

At a basic level, opening of the airway is achieved through manual movement of the head using [[basic airway management|various techniques]], with the most widely taught and used being the \"head tilt — chin lift\", although other methods such as the \"modified [[jaw thrust]]\" can be used, especially where spinal injury is suspected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement|title=Airway Management|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021030909/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement| archivedate= 21 October 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref> although in some countries, its use is not recommended for lay rescuers for safety reasons.<ref name=rsukbls>{{cite journal|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|title=Adult Basic Life Support|journal=Resuscitation UK Guidelines|publisher=Resuscitaton Council (UK)|page=14|accessdate=2008-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202034805/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2005}}</ref>

Higher level practitioners such as [[emergency medical service]] personnel may use more [[invasive airway management|advanced techniques]], from [[oropharyngeal airway]]s to [[intubation]], as deemed necessary.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Grande, Christopher M. |author2=Søreide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=211 |isbn=978-0-8247-0537-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Conscious patients===
In the conscious patient, other signs of airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and [[cyanosis]].<ref name=rsukils>{{cite book|title=Immediate Life Support|publisher=Resuscitation Council(UK)|author1=Soar, J |author2=Nolan, J|author3= Perkins, G|author4= Scott, M|author5= Goodman, N|author6= Mitchell, S|year=2006|isbn=978-1-903812-12-9}}</ref>

== Breathing ==

===Unconscious patients===
In the unconscious patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the patient's breathing,<ref name=rsukbls/> primarily to find if the patient is making normal respiratory efforts.  Normal breathing rates are between 12 and 20 breaths per minute,<ref name=rsukils/> and if a patient is breathing below the minimum rate, then in current ILCOR basic life support protocols, CPR should be considered, although professional rescuers may have their own protocols to follow, such as [[artificial respiration]].

Rescuers are often warned against mistaking [[agonal breathing]], which is a series of noisy gasps occurring in around 40% of cardiac arrest victims, for normal breathing.<ref name=rsukbls/>

If a patient is breathing, then the rescuer will continue with the treatment indicated for an unconscious but breathing patient, which may include interventions such as the [[recovery position]] and summoning an [[ambulance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstaid.ie/tip_recovery.htm |title=Recovery Position |accessdate=2008-12-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203053219/http://firstaid.ie/tip_recovery.htm |archivedate=2009-02-03 }}</ref>

===Conscious or breathing patients===
In a conscious patient, or where a pulse and breathing are clearly present, the care provider will initially be looking to diagnose immediately life-threatening conditions such as severe [[asthma]], [[pulmonary oedema]] or [[haemothorax]].<ref name=rsukils/>  Depending on skill level of the rescuer, this may involve steps such as:<ref name=rsukils/>
* Checking for general respiratory distress, such as use of accessory muscles to breathe, abdominal breathing, position of the patient, [[sweat]]ing, or [[cyanosis]]
* Checking the respiratory rate, depth and rhythm - Normal breathing is between 12 and 20 in a healthy patient, with a regular pattern and depth.  If any of these deviate from normal, this may indicate an underlying problem (such as with [[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]])
* Chest deformity and movement - The chest should rise and fall equally on both sides, and should be free of deformity.  Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as [[pneumothorax]] or [[haemothorax]]
* Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or [[stridor]] (which indicates airway obstruction)
* Checking for [[surgical emphysema]] which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a [[pneumothorax]]
* [[Auscultation]] and [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] of the chest by using a [[stethoscope]] to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities
* Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing

== Circulation ==
Once oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body.

===Non-breathing patients===
Circulation is the original meaning of the \"C\" as laid down by Jude, Knickerbocker & Safar, and was intended to suggest assessing the presence or absence of circulation, usually by taking a [[carotid]] [[pulse]], before taking any further treatment steps.

In modern protocols for lay persons, this step is omitted as it has been proven that lay rescuers may have difficulty in accurately determining the presence or absence of a pulse, and that, in any case, there is less risk of harm by performing chest compressions on a beating heart than failing to perform them when the heart is not beating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cjstudios.com/Aquatics/new_cpr_standards.htm|title=New CPR Standards|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> For this reason, lay rescuers proceed directly to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, starting with chest compressions, which is effectively artificial circulation.  In order to simplify the teaching of this to some groups, especially at a basic first aid level, the C for Circulation is changed for meaning CPR or Compressions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emergency Action Plan|publisher=Parasol EMT|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=drabc|accessdate=2008-12-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108043458/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=drabc|archivedate=8 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessor's guide to passing your First Aid at Work exam|publisher=Mediaid Training Services|url=http://www.mediaid.co.uk/assessors-guide.php|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref><ref name=SRAB>{{cite web|title=The Priority Action Plan|publisher=St John New Zealand|url=http://www.stjohn.org.nz/tips/srabcs.aspx|accessdate=2008-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014181831/http://www.stjohn.org.nz/tips/srabcs.aspx|archive-date=2008-10-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It should be remembered, however, that health care professionals will often still include a pulse check in their ABC check, and may involve additional steps such as an immediate [[ECG]] when cardiac arrest is suspected, in order to assess heart rhythm.

===Breathing patients===
In patients who are breathing, there is the opportunity to undertake further diagnosis and, depending on the skill level of the attending rescuer, a number of assessment options are available, including:
* Observation of color and temperature of hands and fingers where cold, blue, pink, pale, or mottled extremities can be indicative of poor circulation
* [[Capillary refill]] is an assessment of the effective working of the capillaries, and involves applying cutaneous pressure to an area of skin to force blood from the area, and counting the time until return of blood.  This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead
* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses
* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock
* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals
* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)
* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infractions]]

== Variations ==
Nearly all first aid organisations use \"ABC\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).

===ABCD===
There are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC). This may stand for different things, depending on what the trainer is trying to teach, and at what level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://student.bmj.com/issues/05/02/education/54.php|title=First Aid: Prehospital Care (Student BMJ website)|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> The D can stand for:

===ABCDE===
Additionally, some protocols call for an 'E' step to patient assessment. ''All'' protocols that use 'E' steps diverge from looking after basic life support at that point, and begin looking for underlying causes.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tilton, Buck |title=Wilderness first responder: how to recognize, treat and prevent emergencies in the backcountry |publisher=Falcon |location=Helena, Mont |year=2004 |pages=11 |isbn=978-0-7627-2801-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> In some protocols, there can be up to 3 E's used.

* '''Glucose''' — The professional rescuer may choose to perform a [[blood glucose]] test, and this can form the 'G' or alternately, the 'DEFG' can stand for \"'''Don't Ever Forget Glucose'''\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Acute Poisoning|author=Clive Roberts|url=http://www.zyworld.com/clive_roberts/Acute_Poisoning.ppt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Student BMJ|title=The perfect crime|url=http://student.bmj.com/issues/04/05/education/188.php}}</ref>
* '''Girl Check''' — Is also used as a reminder that all women of child-bearing age need to be tested for potential pregnancy, as this may guide treatment.

===AcBC===
Some trainers and protocols use an additional (small) 'c' in between the A and B, standing for '[[cervical spine]]' or 'consider C-spine'.<ref>{{cite book|title=Occupational First Aid.

===CABC===
The military frequently use a CABC approach, where the first C stands for \"catastrophic haemorrhage\". Violent trauma cases indicate that major blood loss will kill a casualty before an airway obstruction, so measures to prevent [[hypovolemia|hypovolemic]] shock should occur first.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Militarymedicine/Pages/Survivingbattlefield.aspx The military's use of advanced medical techniques in emergency care on the battlefield]</ref> This is often accomplished by immediately applying a [[emergency tourniquet|tourniquet]] to the affected limb.

'''ABC''' and its variations are [[initialism]] [[mnemonic]]s for essential steps used by both medical professionals and lay persons (such as [[first aid]]ers) when dealing with a patient. In its original form it stands for ''[[Airway]]'', ''[[Breath]]ing,'' and <!--NOTE:Do NOT change this to Compressions' or 'CPR' - please read the article for further explanation -->''[[Circulatory system|Circulation]]''.<ref name=grauniad/> The protocol was originally developed as a memory aid for rescuers performing [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], and the most widely known use of the initialism is in the care of the [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] or unresponsive patient, although it is also used as a reminder of the priorities for assessment and treatment of patients in many acute medical and trauma situations, from first-aid to hospital medical treatment.<ref name=rsukalert/> Airway, breathing, and circulation are all vital for life, and each is required, in that order, for the next to be effective. Since its development, the mnemonic has been extended and modified to fit the different areas in which it is used, with different versions changing the meaning of letters (such as from the original 'Circulation' to 'Compressions') or adding other letters (such as an optional \"D\" step for ''Disability'' or ''[[Defibrillation]]'').

In 2010, the [[American Heart Association]] and [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] changed the recommended order of [[CPR]] interventions for most cases of cardiac arrest to chest compressions, airway, and breathing, or '''CAB'''.<ref name=CircEx10>{{cite journal |vauthors=Field JM, Hazinski MF, Sayre MR |title=Part 1: executive summary: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S640–56 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20956217 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970889 |url=|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref>{{rp|S642}}<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hazinski MF, Nolan JP, Billi JE |title=Part 1: executive summary: 2010 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=16 Suppl 2 |pages=S250–75 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20956249 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970897 |url=|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Medical use==
At all levels of care, the ABC protocol exists to remind the person delivering treatment of the importance of airway, breathing, and circulation to the maintenance of a patient's life.  These three issues are paramount in any treatment, in that the loss (or loss of control of) any one of these items will rapidly lead to the patient's death. The three objectives are so important to successful patient care that they form the foundation of training for not only first aid providers but also participants in many advanced medical training programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofdearborn.org/departments/fire/firedocs/firstaid.htm|title=First Aid (City of Dearborn MI FD website)|accessdate=2008-12-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209122010/http://www.cityofdearborn.org/departments/fire/firedocs/firstaid.htm |archivedate = December 9, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Marianne Gausche-Hill |title=Pediatric airway management |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7637-2066-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpr-pro.com/fa_primary_survey.html|title=Emergency Scene Management|accessdate=2008-12-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203042035/http://cpr-pro.com/fa_primary_survey.html|archivedate=2009-02-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=American College of Physicians |author2=American Academy of Pediatrics |title=APLS: The Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource |edition=Fourth |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2003 |pages=11 |isbn=978-0-7637-3316-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Smith, Roger K. |author2=Joseph S.

[[hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]], the result of insufficient oxygen in the blood, is a potentially deadly condition and one of the leading causes of [[cardiac arrest]]. Cardiac arrest is the ultimate cause of [[clinical death]] for all animals<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| last = Kastenbaum| first = Robert| title = Definitions of Death| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Death and Dying| year = 2006| url = http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Definitions-of-Death.html| accessdate = 2007-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070203141750/http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Definitions-of-Death.html| archivedate= 3 February 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> (although with advanced intervention, such as [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] a cardiac arrest may not necessarily lead to death), and it is linked to an absence of circulation in the body, for any one of a number of reasons.  For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.

Airway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.

===CPR===
The basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].

In this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.

In the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.

Previously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.

== Airway ==
{{main article|airway management}}

=== Unconscious patients ===
In the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  Common problems with the airway of patient with a seriously reduced level of consciousness involve blockage of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] by the [[tongue]], a [[foreign body]], or [[vomiting|vomit]].

At a basic level, opening of the airway is achieved through manual movement of the head using [[basic airway management|various techniques]], with the most widely taught and used being the \"head tilt — chin lift\", although other methods such as the \"modified [[jaw thrust]]\" can be used, especially where spinal injury is suspected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement|title=Airway Management|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021030909/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement| archivedate= 21 October 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref> although in some countries, its use is not recommended for lay rescuers for safety reasons.<ref name=rsukbls>{{cite journal|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|title=Adult Basic Life Support|journal=Resuscitation UK Guidelines|publisher=Resuscitaton Council (UK)|page=14|accessdate=2008-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202034805/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2005}}</ref>

Higher level practitioners such as [[emergency medical service]] personnel may use more [[invasive airway management|advanced techniques]], from [[oropharyngeal airway]]s to [[intubation]], as deemed necessary.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Grande, Christopher M. |author2=Søreide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=211 |isbn=978-0-8247-0537-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Conscious patients===
In the conscious patient, other signs of airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and [[cyanosis]].<ref name=rsukils>{{cite book|title=Immediate Life Support|publisher=Resuscitation Council(UK)|author1=Soar, J |author2=Nolan, J|author3= Perkins, G|author4= Scott, M|author5= Goodman, N|author6= Mitchell, S|year=2006|isbn=978-1-903812-12-9}}</ref>

== Breathing ==

===Unconscious patients===
In the unconscious patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the patient's breathing,<ref name=rsukbls/> primarily to find if the patient is making normal respiratory efforts.  Normal breathing rates are between 12 and 20 breaths per minute,<ref name=rsukils/> and if a patient is breathing below the minimum rate, then in current ILCOR basic life support protocols, CPR should be considered, although professional rescuers may have their own protocols to follow, such as [[artificial respiration]].

Rescuers are often warned against mistaking [[agonal breathing]], which is a series of noisy gasps occurring in around 40% of cardiac arrest victims, for normal breathing.<ref name=rsukbls/>

If a patient is breathing, then the rescuer will continue with the treatment indicated for an unconscious but breathing patient, which may include interventions such as the [[recovery position]] and summoning an [[ambulance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstaid.ie/tip_recovery.htm |title=Recovery Position |accessdate=2008-12-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203053219/http://firstaid.ie/tip_recovery.htm |archivedate=2009-02-03 }}</ref>

===Conscious or breathing patients===
In a conscious patient, or where a pulse and breathing are clearly present, the care provider will initially be looking to diagnose immediately life-threatening conditions such as severe [[asthma]], [[pulmonary oedema]] or [[haemothorax]].<ref name=rsukils/>  Depending on skill level of the rescuer, this may involve steps such as:<ref name=rsukils/>
* Checking for general respiratory distress, such as use of accessory muscles to breathe, abdominal breathing, position of the patient, [[sweat]]ing, or [[cyanosis]]
* Checking the respiratory rate, depth and rhythm - Normal breathing is between 12 and 20 in a healthy patient, with a regular pattern and depth.  If any of these deviate from normal, this may indicate an underlying problem (such as with [[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]])
* Chest deformity and movement - The chest should rise and fall equally on both sides, and should be free of deformity.  Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as [[pneumothorax]] or [[haemothorax]]
* Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or [[stridor]] (which indicates airway obstruction)
* Checking for [[surgical emphysema]] which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a [[pneumothorax]]
* [[Auscultation]] and [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] of the chest by using a [[stethoscope]] to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities
* Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing

== Circulation ==
Once oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body.

===Non-breathing patients===
Circulation is the original meaning of the \"C\" as laid down by Jude, Knickerbocker & Safar, and was intended to suggest assessing the presence or absence of circulation, usually by taking a [[carotid]] [[pulse]], before taking any further treatment steps.

In modern protocols for lay persons, this step is omitted as it has been proven that lay rescuers may have difficulty in accurately determining the presence or absence of a pulse, and that, in any case, there is less risk of harm by performing chest compressions on a beating heart than failing to perform them when the heart is not beating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cjstudios.com/Aquatics/new_cpr_standards.htm|title=New CPR Standards|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> For this reason, lay rescuers proceed directly to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, starting with chest compressions, which is effectively artificial circulation.  In order to simplify the teaching of this to some groups, especially at a basic first aid level, the C for Circulation is changed for meaning CPR or Compressions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emergency Action Plan|publisher=Parasol EMT|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=drabc|accessdate=2008-12-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108043458/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=drabc|archivedate=8 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessor's guide to passing your First Aid at Work exam|publisher=Mediaid Training Services|url=http://www.mediaid.co.uk/assessors-guide.php|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref><ref name=SRAB>{{cite web|title=The Priority Action Plan|publisher=St John New Zealand|url=http://www.stjohn.org.nz/tips/srabcs.aspx|accessdate=2008-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014181831/http://www.stjohn.org.nz/tips/srabcs.aspx|archive-date=2008-10-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It should be remembered, however, that health care professionals will often still include a pulse check in their ABC check, and may involve additional steps such as an immediate [[ECG]] when cardiac arrest is suspected, in order to assess heart rhythm.

===Breathing patients===
In patients who are breathing, there is the opportunity to undertake further diagnosis and, depending on the skill level of the attending rescuer, a number of assessment options are available, including:
* Observation of color and temperature of hands and fingers where cold, blue, pink, pale, or mottled extremities can be indicative of poor circulation
* [[Capillary refill]] is an assessment of the effective working of the capillaries, and involves applying cutaneous pressure to an area of skin to force blood from the area, and counting the time until return of blood.  This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead
* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses
* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock
* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals
* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)
* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infractions]]

== Variations ==
Nearly all first aid organisations use \"ABC\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).

===ABCD===
There are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC). This may stand for different things, depending on what the trainer is trying to teach, and at what level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://student.bmj.com/issues/05/02/education/54.php|title=First Aid: Prehospital Care (Student BMJ website)|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> The D can stand for:

Additionally, some protocols call for an 'E' step to patient assessment. ''All'' protocols that use 'E' steps diverge from looking after basic life support at that point, and begin looking for underlying causes.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tilton, Buck |title=Wilderness first responder: how to recognize, treat and prevent emergencies in the backcountry |publisher=Falcon |location=Helena, Mont |year=2004 |pages=11 |isbn=978-0-7627-2801-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> In some protocols, there can be up to 3 E's used.

===CABC===
The military frequently use a CABC approach, where the first C stands for \"catastrophic haemorrhage\".

The 'ABC' method of remembering the correct [[Medical guideline|protocol]] for [[CPR]] is almost as old as the procedure itself, and is an important part of the [[history of cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the fiscal-legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four members are elected from county districts, and three are elected at-large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive-legislative body of the county is the board of commissioners. The commissioners represent geographic districts, but are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with adopting and executing legislation, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Pulaski County is part of [[Indiana's 2nd congressional district]] and in 2016 was represented by [[Jackie Walorski]] in the [[United States Congress]].<ref>walorski.house.gov</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the fiscal-legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four members are elected from county districts, and three are elected at-large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive-legislative body of the county is the board of commissioners. The commissioners represent geographic districts, but are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with adopting and executing legislation, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Pulaski County is part of [[Indiana's 2nd congressional district]] and in 2016 was represented by [[Jackie Walorski]] in the [[United States Congress]].<ref>walorski.house.gov</ref>
