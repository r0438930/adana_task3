The plan to build a high-quality road was not realised but the semi-circular route was assigned to existing roads through the southern suburbs. A similar plan was revisited in the 1960s under the name of the [[London Ringways]].\n\n===Predecessors===\nIn 1905, the [[Royal Commission on London Traffic]] issued a report recommending improvements to road, tram and rail services including a \"circular road about 75 miles in length at a radius of 12 miles from St Paul's\".\n\nIn 1937, the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] published ''The Highway Development Survey'' by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] and Sir [[Charles Bressey]], which reviewed London's road needs and recommended the construction of many miles of roads and the improvement of junctions at key congestion points. Among the proposals was a series of orbital roads around the city with the outer ones built as American-style [[parkway]]s - wide, landscaped roads with limited access and grade-separated junctions.\n\n==Rail services==\n[[File:Report to the Minister of War Transport 21 January 1946 Map 1.jpg|thumb|Map showing the County of London Plan's four deep level rail routes]]\nThe report recommended electrification of all rail routes and removal of viaducts, with the elimination of rail bridges over the Thames a key priority.<ref name='LondonPlan1943-Ch4'/> It was hoped that the removal of the river bridges would enable the redevelopment of the [[South Bank]]. \n \nThe proposals included a highly ambitious system of two-track bored rail tunnels in loop-shaped routes beneath built-up areas, large enough to handle main-line trains.<ref name='LondonPlan1943-Ch4'/> These tunnels would provide [[London Underground|tube]]-like service but without the need to change from a main-line train to a tube train. As a result, some tube routes would be transformed into freight-only routes, with the northern portion of the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] specifically mentioned in this regard.\n \nThe proposed railway tunnels would have been as follows:<ref name='LondonPlan1943-Ch4'/>\n \n* North Bank Loop: along the north bank of the Thames, from [[Battersea]], to [[London Victoria Station|Victoria]], [[Charing Cross]], [[Cannon Street]], [[Shadwell]] (where a segment would run at surface level using existing tracks), and thence by tunnel to [[Wapping]], [[Surrey Quays|Surrey Docks]], and [[Deptford]]. The various mainline stations on the north bank of the Thames would no longer be served by open-air tracks over viaducts and bridges.\n* South-east, City and West End Loop: proposed as a means of eliminating the railway bridges across the Thames and associated viaducts. It would connect [[Charing Cross]], [[Cannon Street]], [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Junction]], and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]], rising to the surface in the vicinity of [[Surrey Canal]], where it would connect with existing mainline tracks.\n* North-South Tunnel: from [[Herne Hill railway station|Herne Hill]] in the south through [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]], connecting with [[London King's Cross railway station|King\u2019s Cross]] in the north. [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] and [[Elephant and Castle railway station|Elephant and Castle]] would be replaced by sub-surface stations. \n* Northern Arc: connecting [[London Paddington station|Paddington]], [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]], [[Euston railway station|Euston]], [[London King's Cross railway station|King\u2019s Cross]], and [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]].\n \nan \u201cInner Ring\u201d and an \u201cOuter Ring\u201d of freight-only railways was proposed:<ref name='LondonPlan1943-Ch4'/>\n \n* Inner Goods Ring: the northern segments of the Inner Circle (today the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]]) would be converted to freight only, and a continuation through the southern areas of London ([[Battersea]] is mentioned) to form a circular line.\n* Outer Goods Ring: an arc across the northern parts of London, running substantially to the north of, and parallel to, [[Euston Road]]. It is not clear whether this would be at surface level or in tunnel, although there is mention of a tunnel under the Thames at [[Greenwich]].\n\nThese proposals were further reported on in May 1946 by the Railway (London Plan) Committee, which had been appointed by the Minister of War Transport in February 1944. It was chaired by [[Charles Inglis (engineer)#Second World War and after|Sir Charles Inglis]]. The committee concluded that the cost and time required to carry out the recommendations of the London plan meant that the proposals would not be achievable in a short period of time and could not be carried out until adequate alternative capacity could be provided. Of the four central proposals the one supported by the committee was the North-South Tunnel. The 1946 report recommended a dozen new routes totalling over 100 miles, estimated to cost \u20a4230m and take at least 30 years to build. Among them were 'route 8', from East Croydon to Finsbury Park, in tunnel from Norbury via Streatham, Brixton and the [[Victoria line]] route, except Victoria-Hyde Park Corner-Bond St-Euston.<ref>Railway Magazine July 1946 p. 248</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[https://www.roads.org.uk/ringways/early-plans Roads.org.uk (Scroll down to 'Wartime planning')]\n*[[Greater London Plan]]\n* [[Park system]]\n* [[Landscape planning]]\n* [[A406 road|North Circular Road]]- the north London counterpart of the South Circular Road\n* [[M25 London Orbital Motorway]]- the outermost London ring, completed in 1986\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:County Of London Plan}}\n[[Category:1940s in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1940s in London]]\n[[Category:1943 in London]]\n[[Category:Regional planning in London]]\n[[Category:County of London|Plan]]\n[[Category:Aftermath of World War II in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom home front during World War II]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|text=the parallel [[Greater London Plan]] or the modern [[London Plan]]}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name          = County of London Plan\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| image         = County of London Plan 1943.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| caption = \n| author        = [[Patrick Abercrombie]] and <br/>J.H.
