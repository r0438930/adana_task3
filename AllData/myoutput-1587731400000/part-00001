AB De Villiers captained two matches while Fakhar Zaman led the side in six matches. They finished sixth in the season after winning three of their ten matches, and as a result, were eliminated in the group stage for the fourth consecutive year.

In their first match against the [[Multan Sultans]], they went off to a solid start, [[Chris Lynn]] and [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer|Fakhar Zaman]] made an opening partnership of 59 in 4 overs. After that, the team collapsed and scored a total of 138-8. Multan in reply chased the target in 16.1 overs which led Lahore to lose their opening game. In their second match, they batted well and then with the balling dragged the match to the last over. [[Islamabad United]] needed 9 to win of the final over with one wicket in hand and the irresponsible decision of calling [[Usman Khan]] led them to lose and [[Musa Khan]] become a Islamabad hero. In the third match, it was reduced to 12 overs due to rain delay. [[Dilbar Hussain]] bowled well, in the end Lahore lost by 12 runs. Lucked turned around when they won against [[Quetta Gladiators]] in their fourth match, [[Ben Dunk]] scored a terrific 93* with 11 sixes, making a record for the most sixes in an innings in PSL and was named Man-of-the-match. Lahore were humiliated by [[Islamabad United]] in their home ground losing by 71 runs. In their sixth match, the spinners humiliated [[Quetta Gladiators]], taking 9 wickets while conceding 98 runs and winning the match by 8 wickets. [[Ben Dunk]] again made a record for most sixes in an innings with 13 sixes and an unbeaten 99* helping them chase down a huge target of 188 with ease. After consecutively losing to the [[Peshawar Zalmi]] in the last seasons, this time lahore won by 5 wickets 50's from both [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)|Fakhar Zaman]] and [[Chris Lynn]] with [[David Wiese]] finishing it off in style with a six while chasing down a monstrous target of 188 and winning with ease in the end. In their second last match of the group stage against [[Karachi Kings]], they miserably lost with giving a target of 150 and failing to take a wicket while bowling. Their last match was a must win to qualify for the semis, it was against [[Multan Sultans]]. Again they were given to chase 188. The openers [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)|Fakhar Zaman\n]] and [[Chris Lynn]] made a partnership of 100, then Fakhar got out. Chris Lynn led his team to the semis posting the first ever century for a Lahore Qalandars and leading them to the first ever semis.

In their sixth match, the spinners humiliated [[Quetta Gladiators]], taking 9 wickets while conceding 98 runs and winning the match by 8 wickets. [[Ben Dunk]] again made a record for most sixes in an innings with 13 sixes and an unbeaten 99* helping them chase down a huge target of 188 with ease. After consecutively losing to the [[Peshawar Zalmi]] in the last seasons, this time lahore won by 5 wickets 50's from both [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)|Fakhar Zaman]] and [[Chris Lynn]] with [[David Wiese]] finishing it off in style with a six while chasing down a monstrous target of 188 and winning with ease in the end. In their second last match of the group stage against [[Karachi Kings]], they miserably lost with giving a target of 150 and failing to take a wicket while bowling. Their last match was a must win to qualify for the semis, it was against [[Multan Sultans]]. Again they were given to chase 188. The openers [[Fakhar Zaman]] and [[Chris Lynn]] made a partnership of 100, then Fakhar got out. Chris Lynn led his team to the semis posting the first ever century for a Lahore Qalandars and leading them to the first ever semis.
