response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal.... George Eads does what he can to bring a bit of energy to the MacGyver spy crew, but it\u2019s a futile effort. MacGyver may know a lot about chemistry, but this unmemorable team has none.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Maureen|title=TV Review: 'Lethal Weapon' and 'MacGyver'|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/lethal-weapon-macgyver-tv-review-damon-wayans-clayne-crawford-1201860866/|accessdate=September 24, 2016|website=[[Variety.com]]|date=September 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: \"If... you\u2019re looking for something approaching the original\u2019s simple DIY charms \u2014 or, for that matter, something even marginally original \u2014 look elsewhere.

response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal.... George Eads does what he can to bring a bit of energy to the MacGyver spy crew, but it\u2019s a futile effort. MacGyver may know a lot about chemistry, but this unmemorable team has none.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Maureen|title=TV Review: 'Lethal Weapon' and 'MacGyver'|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/lethal-weapon-macgyver-tv-review-damon-wayans-clayne-crawford-1201860866/|accessdate=September 24, 2016|website=[[Variety.com]]|date=September 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: \"If... you\u2019re looking for something approaching the original\u2019s simple DIY charms \u2014 or, for that matter, something even marginally original \u2014 look elsewhere.
