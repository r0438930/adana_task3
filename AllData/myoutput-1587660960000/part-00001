Most were [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal forts]].\n\nThey stand up to {{convert|40|ft|m}} high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15\u201325 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy [[artillery]] piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse, and hence fire, over a complete 360\u00b0 circle. A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence.\n\nThe Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century, but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful [[rifled]] artillery. Many have survived to the present day, often preserved as historic monuments.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, during the premiership of [[Lord Palmerston]], there was another spate of tower and fort building. The [[Palmerston Forts]] are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Tour de la Mortella.jpg|thumb|left|The resistance of the [[Torra di Mortella]] to the British in 1794 inspired Martello towers]]\nMartello towers were inspired by a round fortress, part of a larger [[Genoa|Genoese]] defence system, at [[Torra di Mortella|Mortella]] (Myrtle) Point in [[Corsica]]. The designer was [[Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino]] (el Fratin),<ref>Vigano (2001), pp. 41\u201357.</ref> and the tower was completed in 1565.\n\nSince the 15th century, the Corsicans had built similar towers at strategic points around the island to protect coastal villages and shipping from North African [[pirates]]. The towers stood one or two storeys high and measured {{convert|12|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a single doorway five metres off the ground that one could access only via a ladder that the occupants could remove.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\">Abram (2003), p. 103.</ref>\n\nLocal villagers paid for the towers and watchmen, known as ''torregiani'', who would signal the approach of unexpected ships by lighting a beacon fire on the tower's roof. The fire would alert the local defence forces to the threat. Although the pirate threat subsequently dwindled, the Genovese built a newer generation of circular towers (the [[Genoese tower]]s), that warded off later foreign raids.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\" />\n\n[[File:Plaines d'Abraham et tour martello.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower on the [[plains of Abraham]] in [[Quebec City]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]]), at the top of Cap Diamant overlooking the [[Saint Lawrence River]].]]\nOn 7 February 1794 as part of the [[Siege of San Fiorenzo|siege of Saint-Florent]], two British warships, {{HMS|Fortitude |1780|6}} (74 guns) and {{HMS|Juno|1780|2}} (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]] after two days of heavy fighting. What helped the British was that the tower's two 18-pounder guns fired seaward, while only the one 6-pounder could fire land-ward.\n\nVice-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] reported:\n\n{{quote|...The ''Fortitude'' and ''Juno'' were ordered against it, without making the least impression by a continued cannonade of two hours and a half; and the former ship being very much damaged by red-hot shot, both hauled off. The walls of the Tower were of a prodigious thickness, and the parapet, where there were two eighteen-pounders, was lined with bass junk,{{refn|Bass-junk was a type of cable made of grass.<ref>''The United Service Magazine'', Volume 51, p.301.</ref> The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' reports that \"bass\" is a name \"given elliptically to various articles made of this [fibre] or similar material; e.g. a mat, a hassock, a flat plaited bag or flexible basket.\"|group=Note}} five feet from the walls, and filled up with sand; and although it was cannonaded from the Height for two days, within 150 yards, and appeared in a very shattered state, the enemy still held out; but a few hot shot setting fire to the bass, made them call for quarter. The number of men in the Tower were 33; only two were wounded, and those mortally.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13631|date=15 March 1794|page=222}}</ref>}}\n\nLate in the previous year, the tower's French defenders had abandoned it after {{HMS|Lowestoffe|1761|6}} (32 guns) had fired two broadsides at it. The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them.<ref name=Sutcliffe>Sutcliffe (1973).</ref>  Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended, and copied the design. But, they got the name wrong, misspelling \"Mortella\" as \"Martello\" (which means \"hammer\" in Italian). When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1803, with great difficulty they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state.<ref name=Sutcliffe />\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[File:Tour Martello 3 d\u00e9molition.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec city]] had four Martello towers, but tower n\u00b03 was demolished in 1904. In this picture, the internal structure can be seen.]]\nThe towers were about {{convert|40|ft|m}} high with walls about {{convert|8|ft|m}} thick. In some towers the rooms were not built in the centre, but more to the landside, leaving the walls thicker on seaside. These were cases where an attack with a cannon from the landside was thought very unlikely. Entry was by ladder to a door about {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the base above which was a machicolated (slotted) platform which allowed for downward fire on attackers. The flat roof or ''terreplein'' had a high parapet and a raised platform in the centre with a pivot (sometimes a converted cannon) for a cannon that would traverse a 360\u00b0 arc. (Some towers were designed to carry more than one gun, with each having a more limited arc of fire.) The walls had narrow slits for defensive musket fire.\n\n[[File:Martello tower diagram EN.svg|thumb|Diagram of the interior of a Martello tower]]\nThe interior of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The [[garrison]] of 24 men and one officer lived in a [[casemate]] on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating.<ref name=\"robert19\">Ciucevich (2005), pp. 19\u201321.</ref> The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size. A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water. An internal drainage system linked to the roof enabled rainwater to refill the cistern.<ref name=\"robert19\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n== Martello towers around the world ==\n[[File:Martello towers worldwide map.png|thumb|center|600px|Distribution of Martello towers worldwide]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the British government embarked on a large-scale programme of building Martello towers to guard the British and Irish coastlines. Around 140 were built, mostly along the south coast of [[England]]. Governments in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Menorca]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] also constructed towers. The construction of Martello towers abroad continued until as late as the 1870s but was discontinued after it became clear that they could not withstand the new generation of rifled artillery weapons.\n\nThe French built similar towers along their own coastline that they used as platforms for communication by [[optical telegraph]]s (using the [[Claude Chappe|Chappe Telegraph]]). The [[United States]] government also built a number of Martello towers along the east coast of the US that copied the British design with some modifications.\n\n=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===\n[[File:Portmarnock martello.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Portmarnock]] Martello tower, one of many on Ireland's east coast]]\nGreat Britain and Ireland were united as a single political entity, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], from 1801 to 1922, spanning the time during which most Martello towers were erected (the initial scheme started under the previous entities of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]). Consequently, the Martello towers of Great Britain and Ireland can be considered to have been part of a single defensive system, designed to protect the coastlines of the two main islands of the [[British Isles]] as a whole.<ref>Rooke (1857), p.68.</ref><ref name=Clements>Clements (1998).</ref>\n\nThis is most clearly visible on the south and east coasts of [[England]] and the east coast of [[Ireland]], where chains of Martello towers were built. Elsewhere in the world, individual Martello towers were erected to provide point defence of strategic locations.\n\n==== England ====\n[[File:Martello tower 500.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of a Martello tower]]\nBetween 1804 and 1812 the British authorities built a chain of towers based on the original Mortella tower to [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803\u20131805|defend the south and east coast of England]], Ireland, [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] to guard against [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|possible invasion]] from [[France]], then under the rule of the [[Napoleon I of France|Emperor Napoleon]]. A total of 103<ref name=Sutcliffe /> Martello towers were built in England, set at regular intervals along the coast from [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]], [[Sussex]], to [[Aldeburgh]], [[Suffolk]]. Most were constructed under the direction of General [[William Twiss]] (1745\u20131827) and a Captain Ford.<ref>Mead (1948), pp. 205\u201317, 294\u2013303.</ref><ref>Ward (1949), pp. 18\u201337.</ref>  The northern-most tower at Aldeburgh is of quatrefoil design, i.e. four in one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/martello-tower-9317|title=Holiday at Martello Tower in Aldeburgh, Suffolk - The Landmark Trust|website=www.landmarktrust.org.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211003141/http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/martello-tower-9317|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIncluded in the scheme were three much larger circular forts or [[redoubt]]s that were constructed at [[Harwich Redoubt|Harwich]], [[Dymchurch Redoubt|Dymchurch]] and [[Eastbourne Redoubt|Eastbourne]]; they acted as supply depots for the smaller towers as well as being powerful fortifications in their own right.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.martello-towers.co.uk/south-coast/towers/dymchurch-redoubt.htm |title=Dymchurch Redoubt |publisher=Martello-towers.co.uk |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2010-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223024147/http://www.martello-towers.co.uk/south-coast/towers/dymchurch-redoubt.htm |archivedate=23 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of Britain's Martello towers was never actually tested in combat against a Napoleonic invasion fleet. They were, however, effective in hindering smuggling.<ref>Daly (2007), p.34.</ref> After the threat had passed, the Martello towers in England met a variety of fates. [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|The Coastguard]] took over many to aid in the fight against smuggling.\n[[File:Martello tower 700.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower at [[Clacton-on-Sea]] on the east coast of England.]]\nFifteen towers were demolished to enable the re-use of their masonry. The sea washed thirty away and the military destroyed four in experiments to test the effectiveness of the new [[rifled]] artillery. During the [[Second World War]], some Martello towers returned to military service as observation platforms and firing platforms for [[anti-aircraft artillery]].\n\nForty-seven Martello towers have survived in England, a few of which have been restored and transformed into museums (e.g., the tower at [[St Osyth and Seaford]]) visitor centres, and galleries (such as [[Jaywick Martello Tower]]).

The most notable surviving towers are the two located in [[Pembroke Dock]], which were built between 1848 and 1857 to protect the naval base there. Today, one of the towers is privately owned. The other is located on the town's riverfront, next to the old entrance of the naval base. It was converted into a small museum that focused on the local history of the dock and its defences. The museum has now shut down because of water influx. Recently Pembrokeshire County Council has decided to put the tower up for sale.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.guntowermuseum.org.uk/index.html| title=Gun Tower Museum| publisher=Pembroke Dock Gun Tower Museum Trust| accessdate=2012-03-10| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305142434/http://www.guntowermuseum.org.uk/index.html| archivedate=5 March 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Ireland ====\n[[File:Martello Tower Balbriggan.jpg|thumb|Martello tower at [[Balbriggan]]]]\nAbout fifty Martello towers were built around the Irish coastline, especially along the east coast, from [[Millmount Fort|Millmount]] (Drogheda), to [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], around [[Dublin Bay]] but also around [[Cork Harbour]] on the south coast. On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were in line of sight of each other, providing the ability to communicate with one another, or warn of any incoming attacks.\n\nPossibly the most famous is the Martello tower in [[Sandycove]], near [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], in which [[James Joyce]] lived for a few days. Joyce shared the tower with [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], then a medical student but later to become famous in Irish history as a surgeon, politician and writer. In ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the fictional character [[Stephen Dedalus]] lives in the tower with a medical student, Malachi \"Buck\" Mulligan, whom Joyce based on Gogarty. The [[James Joyce Tower]], as the tower is now known, houses a museum dedicated to Joyce.\n\nA number of other Martello towers are extant nearby at [[Bullock Harbour]], [[Dalkey Island]], [[Blackrock, Dublin|Williamstown]], [[Seapoint]] and [[Sandymount]] and Martello towers feature in many literary works set in [[Dublin]]. During the 1980s, [[Bono]] owned the Martello tower in [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[County Wicklow]].\n\n[[File:Killiney Martello No7.jpg|thumb|left|Martello tower (South No.7) at [[Killiney]]]]\nMartello Tower South No.7, on Tara Hill, Killiney Bay, is unique, as is its location as an [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading tower]].

There are also Martello towers at [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] and [[Rostellan]], though these are no longer intact.\n\nThe British built two Martello towers on the Hook Peninsula to protect the fort near [[Duncannon]], [[Co. Wexford]] and the entrance to [[Waterford]] Harbour. There is a third tower on the headland at Baginbun Bay in Co. Wexford.\n\nOne of the most interesting Martello towers is [[Meelick Martello Tower]] at [[Clonahenoge]], [[County Offaly]], guarding the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] river crossing to [[Meelick, County Galway]]. As this tower supports three guns (unlike the normal Martello tower which is circular on plan and carries only one gun), it is cam shaped on plan.

It is square rather than round, unlike the traditional Martello tower. This tower is known locally as the Gabhla Fhranca (\"French Tower\") or the Napoleonic Tower. It is marked on an 1838 [[Ordnance Survey]] chart and denoted \"Signal Tower,\" suggesting it was used with a series of other stations for communication. The tower's position offers a view of the sea both to the north and south of the island and is therefore well-suited for that purpose. By the 1830s the tower was described as a \"watch-house of the coast-guard.\"\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==== Antigua and Barbuda ====\n[[File:Antigua 8 Cent Stamp 1953.jpg|thumb|A 1953 stamp of Antigua showing the Martello Tower in Barbuda.]]\nThe British originally constructed River Fort Martello Tower in the early 19th century, on the site of a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was [[Barbuda]]'s original quay.

It the first such tower constructed in the Caribbean, was built in 1745 by [[Sir William Codrington]], and was designed by Commodore Charles Knowles RN, later Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]] Bt, who was then commanding the Leeward Islands station.<ref> \u201cMartello Towers Worldwide\u201d by Bill Clements,  Pen & Sword Military 2011 pp. 146-148 </ref>\n\nIt is attached to what remains of the pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a [[daymark]] from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.\n\n==== Australia ====\n[[File:Fort Denison 9.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fort Denison]], [[Sydney Harbour]].]]\nThe last Martello tower built in the British Empire is said to be that which composes a part of the larger [[Fort Denison, New South Wales|Fort Denison]], built on a small island, Pinchgut Island, in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], [[New South Wales]]. It is the only Martello tower to have been built in Australia.\n\nFortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. The construction had begun following an 1839 night-time incursion into [[Sydney]] Harbour by two American warships. Concern with the threat of foreign attack had caused the government to review the harbour's inner defences, which were found to be inadequate, and the establishment of a fort was recommended to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Construction resumed in 1855 to provide Sydney with protection against the threat of a naval attack by the [[Russia]]ns during the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s. However, construction was completed only in 1857, well after the war had ended. Fort Denison is well preserved and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n\n==== Bermuda ====\n[[File:Martello Tower seen from Ferry Island Fort, Ferry Reach, Bermuda 2011.jpg|thumb| The Martello tower at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda]] (1822) (background), contrasts with the Ferry Island Fort (1790s) (foreground).]]\n\nThere is a Martello tower located at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]] in [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]. The tower is the third fortification on the site.<ref>Harris (1988).</ref> Major Thomas Blanshard built it of Bermuda limestone between 1822\u20131823. The tower shows the effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822. The earlier ''Ferry Island Fort'' nearby had multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, while the Martello tower used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area.\n\nLike its predecessors in the UK, it has an ovoid footprint with the thickness of its walls ranging from nine to 11 feet. It is surrounded by a dry moat. The tower's purpose was to defend the Ferry Reach Channel and so impede any attack on [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]] from the main island of Bermuda, and attacking vessels from slipping through [[Castle Harbour]] and the channel between Ferry Reach and [[Coney Island, Bermuda|Coney Island]]. The main channel by which vessels reach most parts of Bermuda west of St. George's, including the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland]], the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]], [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|The Flatts]], [[Murray's Anchorage, Bermuda|Murray's Anchorage]], and other important sites, carries them around the east ends of [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's]] and [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's]] Islands, where the coastal artillery was always most heavily concentrated. Two more Martello towers to protect the Dockyard were planned, but never built.\n\nThe tower was restored in 2008 and an 18-pounder cannon brought from [[Fort St. Catherine]] was mounted on top. The site is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Friday in the summer and in the winter by appointment only, by calling the Parks Department. It is part of the [[Bermuda Railway]] Trail.\n\n==== British Virgin Islands ====\n[[File:Fort Recovery 01.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]], in the British Virgin Islands.]]\nWhen the British rebuilt [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]] on the west end of [[Tortola]] they added a Martello tower.\n\n==== Canada ====\nNine of the fourteen Martello towers built in [[Canada]] still survive.<ref>Saunders (1976).</ref> (In addition, the existing fortifications at [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable cone-shaped roofs to protect against snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions \u2013 for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.\n\n[[File:Tour Martello de Quebec numero 1 - 01.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower no. 1, Quebec City]]\n[[Quebec City]] originally had four Martello towers.

Photos suggest that Martello Menara was not a true Martello, but rather a circular fort. The tower was operational until 1878, when it became a storage site, and was abandoned in 1908. Bidadari Island was also known as Pulau Sakit (Sick Island) as it housed a leper colony during the 17th century. More recently, the island came to be called \"Angel Island\", to honour the [[leprosarium]] that had been there.\n\n==== Italy ====\n[[File:Torre di Magnisi.JPG|thumb|Magnisi tower at Priolo Gargallo.]]\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the British \"Protectorate\" of [[Sicily]] after the escape of the [[Bourbons]] from Naples, Sicily began to build towers to resist an invasion by Napoleon's armies led by [[Joachim Murat]]. The new higher rate of fire of ships' guns led to the choice of the Martello tower as the model.\n\nThe Sicilian Martello towers were built around 1810. The estimate rests on the historical context and on the descriptions of the topographer [[William Henry Smyth|W.H. Smyth]], who carried out his research in 1814 and 1815.\nOf the seven towers built in Sicily, only four remain. One is the Mazzone Tower (or the British Fort) at Faro Point, Messina. The second is the Magnisi tower at [[Priolo Gargallo]], Syracuse. The Italian Navy used this tower as an observation post during the Second World War. Third is the Cariddi tower at [[Ganzirri]] in [[Messina]]. Lastly, the fourth tower is situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea from where it can defend the [[Castello Maniace]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==== Jamaica ====\nThere is a Martello tower located at what was Fort Nugent. In 1709, the Spanish slave agent in Jamaica, James Castillo, built a fort in [[Harbour View, Jamaica|Harbour View]], to guard his home against attack. An English Governor, [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|George Nugent]], later strengthened the fort to guard the eastern entrance of the city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] Harbour.

Various modifications were made, including mounting a 64-pound rifled muzzle loading (RML) gun on the roof for coastal defence. From the late 19th century onwards it defended part of the [[Victoria Lines]]. The tower remained in use until World War II.

Two towers were built at Grand River North West; on the south-west side of the river bay the tower was built at Pointe aux Sables whilst Fort Victoria was built covering the north-eastern flank. The remaining two were built to support existing batteries, which were also improved, at the mouth of the Black River; one to the north at La Preneuse and the other south of Grande-Rivi\u00e8re-Noire at Batterie de l'Harmonie.

The tower at Simon\u2019s Town and Cape Town were both built in 1795. The tower at Cape Town was demolished over 100 years ago, but the tower at Simon's Town now is sometimes claimed as the oldest Martello in the world.

To the northwest of Mah\u00f3n the British built two more towers, Sa Torreta and Sa Mezquita.\n\nOne tower, the Princess Tower, or the Erskine Tower, was incorporated into the [[Fortress of Isabel II]], built between 1850 and 1875. The tower was converted to a powder magazine, which led to its destruction in 1958, when lightning struck the tower. The explosion destroyed the tower, blowing out large sections of its walls.\n\n[[File:Sanitja tower.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower at Cap Cavalleria, Menorca.]]\nThe British erected Stuart's Tower in 1798 on Turks Hill or Hangman's Hill to the south of the port of [[Mah\u00f3n]] at San Esteban or Saint Stephen's bay on the southern side of the [[Fortress of San Felipe]]. In 1756 and again in 1781, batteries on the hill had supported successful attacks on the Fortress. The tower was built both to secure the hill and protect the entrance to the bay. The tower's name was later changed to Torre d\u00b4en Penjat, or Hangman's Tower.\n\nTo protect the harbor of [[Fornells, Menorca|Fornells]], the British built a tower on the rocky headland overlooking the harbor's mouth, and a small tower on the island of Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.\n\nLastly, the British built one tower at Santandria to protect the old capital of [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]].\n\nIn addition to the 12 towers that they built, the British made use of three towers that the Spanish had built earlier.<ref name=Grundy>Grundy (1991).</ref>  In 1781, Captain Francisco Fernandez de Angulo had built towers south of Port Mahon at Punta Prima and Alcufar, based on the design of those that the Spanish had built in Gando, [[Gran Canaria]], in 1740. At [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]] the British used the St. Nicholas's Tower, built in 1690. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] returned Menorca to Spain in 1802. Around 1804, the Spanish built a tower at Punta Na Radona to protect the beach at [[Son Bou, Menorca|Son Bou]], Menorca. In 1808, Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], commanding the 38-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] {{HMS|Imperieuse|1805|6}}, sent ashore a landing party that destroyed the unarmed tower.

Two are at [[Key West, Florida]]; others were built at the harbours of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[New York City]]. Two more Martello towers stood at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] and Bayou Dupre, [[Louisiana]].<ref>Angus Konstam, ''American Civil War Fortification: Coastal Stone Forts''. Osprey Publishing, 2003</ref>\n\n[[File:41stInfRegtCOA.png|thumb|41st Infantry Coat of arms with a Martello Tower]]\nAlthough the Americans copied the design from the towers the British erected in Canada, the American Martello towers differed in some significant respects from the British. The Martello tower built at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] was constructed around 1815 utilizing wood and [[Tabby (cement)|tabby]], a common local building material at the time, instead of the brick or stone that the British towers used. Also unlike the British towers, the Tybee tower featured [[embrasure|gun loops]] on the garrison floor that enabled [[musket]]s to be fired through the walls.<ref name=\"robert19\" /> It was never tested in battle and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] was in a state of disrepair. Its unfamiliar design confused local writers, who often said that the Spanish had built the tower when Georgia was Spain's colony.<ref name=\"robert19\" />\n\nThe Key West towers, though the locals refer to them as Martellos, were square instead of round and had thin walls with long gun loops. In addition, a curtain wall of heavy guns encircled the Key West towers making them, effectively, keeps instead of standalone towers.\n\nA Martello tower figures in the arms of the [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st Infantry Regiment of the United States Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Inf/41%20Infantry%20Regiment.htm |title=41st Infantry Regiment |publisher=Tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil |accessdate=2008-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527145914/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Inf/41%20Infantry%20Regiment.htm |archivedate=27 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== List of Martello towers outside Great Britain ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Country\n!Location\n!Tower name\n!Built\n!Current status\n|-\n| [[Australia]]\n| [[Sydney]]\n| [[Fort Denison]]\n| 1856\n| Museum, harbour light station.\n|-\n| [[Barbuda]]\n| Near [[Codrington, Barbuda|Codrington]]\n| River Fort Martello Tower\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Bermuda]]\n| [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]]\n|\n| 1823\u20131828\n| Can be visited\n|-\n| [[British Virgin Islands]]\n| [[Tortola]]\n| [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]]\n|\n| Private (hotel)\n|-\n| [[Canada]]\n| [[Point Pleasant Park]], [[Nova Scotia]]\n| Prince of Wales's Tower\n| 1796\n| Open to public\n|-\n|\n| [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n| Duke of York's Tower\n| c.1798\n| Lower levels still exist.

Most were [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal forts]].\n\nThey stand up to {{convert|40|ft|m}} high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15\u201325 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy [[artillery]] piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse, and hence fire, over a complete 360\u00b0 circle. A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence.\n\nThe Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century, but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful [[rifled]] artillery. Many have survived to the present day, often preserved as historic monuments.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, during the premiership of [[Lord Palmerston]], there was another spate of tower and fort building. The [[Palmerston Forts]] are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Tour de la Mortella.jpg|thumb|left|The resistance of the [[Torra di Mortella]] to the British in 1794 inspired Martello towers]]\nMartello towers were inspired by a round fortress, part of a larger [[Genoa|Genoese]] defence system, at [[Torra di Mortella|Mortella]] (Myrtle) Point in [[Corsica]]. The designer was [[Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino]] (el Fratin),<ref>Vigano (2001), pp. 41\u201357.</ref> and the tower was completed in 1565.\n\nSince the 15th century, the Corsicans had built similar towers at strategic points around the island to protect coastal villages and shipping from North African [[pirates]]. The towers stood one or two storeys high and measured {{convert|12|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a single doorway five metres off the ground that one could access only via a ladder that the occupants could remove.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\">Abram (2003), p. 103.</ref>\n\nLocal villagers paid for the towers and watchmen, known as ''torregiani'', who would signal the approach of unexpected ships by lighting a beacon fire on the tower's roof. The fire would alert the local defence forces to the threat. Although the pirate threat subsequently dwindled, the Genovese built a newer generation of circular towers (the [[Genoese tower]]s), that warded off later foreign raids.<ref name=\"Abram 2003, p. 103\" />\n\n[[File:Plaines d'Abraham et tour martello.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower on the [[plains of Abraham]] in [[Quebec City]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]]), at the top of Cap Diamant overlooking the [[Saint Lawrence River]].]]\nOn 7 February 1794 as part of the [[Siege of San Fiorenzo|siege of Saint-Florent]], two British warships, {{HMS|Fortitude |1780|6}} (74 guns) and {{HMS|Juno|1780|2}} (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]] after two days of heavy fighting. What helped the British was that the tower's two 18-pounder guns fired seaward, while only the one 6-pounder could fire land-ward.\n\nVice-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] reported:\n\n{{quote|...The ''Fortitude'' and ''Juno'' were ordered against it, without making the least impression by a continued cannonade of two hours and a half; and the former ship being very much damaged by red-hot shot, both hauled off.

The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them.<ref name=Sutcliffe>Sutcliffe (1973).</ref>  Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended, and copied the design. But, they got the name wrong, misspelling \"Mortella\" as \"Martello\" (which means \"hammer\" in Italian). When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1803, with great difficulty they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state.<ref name=Sutcliffe />\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[File:Tour Martello 3 d\u00e9molition.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec city]] had four Martello towers, but tower n\u00b03 was demolished in 1904.

In some towers the rooms were not built in the centre, but more to the landside, leaving the walls thicker on seaside. These were cases where an attack with a cannon from the landside was thought very unlikely. Entry was by ladder to a door about {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the base above which was a machicolated (slotted) platform which allowed for downward fire on attackers. The flat roof or ''terreplein'' had a high parapet and a raised platform in the centre with a pivot (sometimes a converted cannon) for a cannon that would traverse a 360\u00b0 arc. (Some towers were designed to carry more than one gun, with each having a more limited arc of fire.) The walls had narrow slits for defensive musket fire.\n\n[[File:Martello tower diagram EN.svg|thumb|Diagram of the interior of a Martello tower]]\nThe interior of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The [[garrison]] of 24 men and one officer lived in a [[casemate]] on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating.<ref name=\"robert19\">Ciucevich (2005), pp. 19\u201321.</ref> The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size. A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water.

Around 140 were built, mostly along the south coast of [[England]]. Governments in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Menorca]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] also constructed towers. The construction of Martello towers abroad continued until as late as the 1870s but was discontinued after it became clear that they could not withstand the new generation of rifled artillery weapons.\n\nThe French built similar towers along their own coastline that they used as platforms for communication by [[optical telegraph]]s (using the [[Claude Chappe|Chappe Telegraph]]). The [[United States]] government also built a number of Martello towers along the east coast of the US that copied the British design with some modifications.\n\n=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===\n[[File:Portmarnock martello.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Portmarnock]] Martello tower, one of many on Ireland's east coast]]\nGreat Britain and Ireland were united as a single political entity, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], from 1801 to 1922, spanning the time during which most Martello towers were erected (the initial scheme started under the previous entities of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]). Consequently, the Martello towers of Great Britain and Ireland can be considered to have been part of a single defensive system, designed to protect the coastlines of the two main islands of the [[British Isles]] as a whole.<ref>Rooke (1857), p.68.</ref><ref name=Clements>Clements (1998).</ref>\n\nThis is most clearly visible on the south and east coasts of [[England]] and the east coast of [[Ireland]], where chains of Martello towers were built.

They were, however, effective in hindering smuggling.<ref>Daly (2007), p.34.</ref> After the threat had passed, the Martello towers in England met a variety of fates. [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|The Coastguard]] took over many to aid in the fight against smuggling.\n[[File:Martello tower 700.jpg|thumb|A Martello tower at [[Clacton-on-Sea]] on the east coast of England.]]\nFifteen towers were demolished to enable the re-use of their masonry. The sea washed thirty away and the military destroyed four in experiments to test the effectiveness of the new [[rifled]] artillery. During the [[Second World War]], some Martello towers returned to military service as observation platforms and firing platforms for [[anti-aircraft artillery]].\n\nForty-seven Martello towers have survived in England, a few of which have been restored and transformed into museums (e.g., the tower at [[St Osyth and Seaford]]) visitor centres, and galleries (such as [[Jaywick Martello Tower]]).

The most notable surviving towers are the two located in [[Pembroke Dock]], which were built between 1848 and 1857 to protect the naval base there. Today, one of the towers is privately owned. The other is located on the town's riverfront, next to the old entrance of the naval base. It was converted into a small museum that focused on the local history of the dock and its defences. The museum has now shut down because of water influx.

On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were in line of sight of each other, providing the ability to communicate with one another, or warn of any incoming attacks.\n\nPossibly the most famous is the Martello tower in [[Sandycove]], near [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], in which [[James Joyce]] lived for a few days. Joyce shared the tower with [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], then a medical student but later to become famous in Irish history as a surgeon, politician and writer. In ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the fictional character [[Stephen Dedalus]] lives in the tower with a medical student, Malachi \"Buck\" Mulligan, whom Joyce based on Gogarty. The [[James Joyce Tower]], as the tower is now known, houses a museum dedicated to Joyce.\n\nA number of other Martello towers are extant nearby at [[Bullock Harbour]], [[Dalkey Island]], [[Blackrock, Dublin|Williamstown]], [[Seapoint]] and [[Sandymount]] and Martello towers feature in many literary works set in [[Dublin]]. During the 1980s, [[Bono]] owned the Martello tower in [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[County Wicklow]].\n\n[[File:Killiney Martello No7.jpg|thumb|left|Martello tower (South No.7) at [[Killiney]]]]\nMartello Tower South No.7, on Tara Hill, Killiney Bay, is unique, as is its location as an [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading tower]].

There is also an extant Martello tower located near the settlement of [[Magilligan|Magilligan Point]] in [[County Londonderry]], built between 1812 and 1871 to defend against a possible French invasion during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; it is now currently used as a visitor attraction. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://discovernorthernireland.com/Magilligan-Martello-Tower-Limavady-P2926/ |title=Magilligan Martello Tower\n |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=discovernorthernireland.com |publisher= Discover Northern Ireland |access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> \n\nA Martello-like tower was built on [[Achill Island]], according to local memory during the Napoleonic Wars. It is square rather than round, unlike the traditional Martello tower. This tower is known locally as the Gabhla Fhranca (\"French Tower\") or the Napoleonic Tower. It is marked on an 1838 [[Ordnance Survey]] chart and denoted \"Signal Tower,\" suggesting it was used with a series of other stations for communication. The tower's position offers a view of the sea both to the north and south of the island and is therefore well-suited for that purpose. By the 1830s the tower was described as a \"watch-house of the coast-guard.\"\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==== Antigua and Barbuda ====\n[[File:Antigua 8 Cent Stamp 1953.jpg|thumb|A 1953 stamp of Antigua showing the Martello Tower in Barbuda.]]\nThe British originally constructed River Fort Martello Tower in the early 19th century, on the site of a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was [[Barbuda]]'s original quay.

It the first such tower constructed in the Caribbean, was built in 1745 by [[Sir William Codrington]], and was designed by Commodore Charles Knowles RN, later Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]] Bt, who was then commanding the Leeward Islands station.<ref> \u201cMartello Towers Worldwide\u201d by Bill Clements,  Pen & Sword Military 2011 pp. 146-148 </ref>\n\nIt is attached to what remains of the pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a [[daymark]] from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.\n\n==== Australia ====\n[[File:Fort Denison 9.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fort Denison]], [[Sydney Harbour]].]]\nThe last Martello tower built in the British Empire is said to be that which composes a part of the larger [[Fort Denison, New South Wales|Fort Denison]], built on a small island, Pinchgut Island, in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], [[New South Wales]]. It is the only Martello tower to have been built in Australia.\n\nFortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. The construction had begun following an 1839 night-time incursion into [[Sydney]] Harbour by two American warships. Concern with the threat of foreign attack had caused the government to review the harbour's inner defences, which were found to be inadequate, and the establishment of a fort was recommended to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Construction resumed in 1855 to provide Sydney with protection against the threat of a naval attack by the [[Russia]]ns during the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s. However, construction was completed only in 1857, well after the war had ended. Fort Denison is well preserved and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n\n==== Bermuda ====\n[[File:Martello Tower seen from Ferry Island Fort, Ferry Reach, Bermuda 2011.jpg|thumb| The Martello tower at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda]] (1822) (background), contrasts with the Ferry Island Fort (1790s) (foreground).]]\n\nThere is a Martello tower located at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]] in [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]. The tower is the third fortification on the site.<ref>Harris (1988).</ref> Major Thomas Blanshard built it of Bermuda limestone between 1822\u20131823. The tower shows the effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822. The earlier ''Ferry Island Fort'' nearby had multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, while the Martello tower used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area.\n\nLike its predecessors in the UK, it has an ovoid footprint with the thickness of its walls ranging from nine to 11 feet. It is surrounded by a dry moat. The tower's purpose was to defend the Ferry Reach Channel and so impede any attack on [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's Island]] from the main island of Bermuda, and attacking vessels from slipping through [[Castle Harbour]] and the channel between Ferry Reach and [[Coney Island, Bermuda|Coney Island]]. The main channel by which vessels reach most parts of Bermuda west of St. George's, including the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland]], the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]], [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|The Flatts]], [[Murray's Anchorage, Bermuda|Murray's Anchorage]], and other important sites, carries them around the east ends of [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's]] and [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St. George's]] Islands, where the coastal artillery was always most heavily concentrated. Two more Martello towers to protect the Dockyard were planned, but never built.\n\nThe tower was restored in 2008 and an 18-pounder cannon brought from [[Fort St. Catherine]] was mounted on top. The site is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Friday in the summer and in the winter by appointment only, by calling the Parks Department. It is part of the [[Bermuda Railway]] Trail.\n\n==== British Virgin Islands ====\n[[File:Fort Recovery 01.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]], in the British Virgin Islands.]]\nWhen the British rebuilt [[Fort Recovery, Tortola|Fort Recovery]] on the west end of [[Tortola]] they added a Martello tower.\n\n==== Canada ====\nNine of the fourteen Martello towers built in [[Canada]] still survive.<ref>Saunders (1976).</ref> (In addition, the existing fortifications at [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable cone-shaped roofs to protect against snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions \u2013 for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.\n\n[[File:Tour Martello de Quebec numero 1 - 01.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower no. 1, Quebec City]]\n[[Quebec City]] originally had four Martello towers.

Photos suggest that Martello Menara was not a true Martello, but rather a circular fort. The tower was operational until 1878, when it became a storage site, and was abandoned in 1908. Bidadari Island was also known as Pulau Sakit (Sick Island) as it housed a leper colony during the 17th century. More recently, the island came to be called \"Angel Island\", to honour the [[leprosarium]] that had been there.\n\n==== Italy ====\n[[File:Torre di Magnisi.JPG|thumb|Magnisi tower at Priolo Gargallo.]]\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the British \"Protectorate\" of [[Sicily]] after the escape of the [[Bourbons]] from Naples, Sicily began to build towers to resist an invasion by Napoleon's armies led by [[Joachim Murat]]. The new higher rate of fire of ships' guns led to the choice of the Martello tower as the model.\n\nThe Sicilian Martello towers were built around 1810. The estimate rests on the historical context and on the descriptions of the topographer [[William Henry Smyth|W.H. Smyth]], who carried out his research in 1814 and 1815.\nOf the seven towers built in Sicily, only four remain. One is the Mazzone Tower (or the British Fort) at Faro Point, Messina. The second is the Magnisi tower at [[Priolo Gargallo]], Syracuse. The Italian Navy used this tower as an observation post during the Second World War. Third is the Cariddi tower at [[Ganzirri]] in [[Messina]]. Lastly, the fourth tower is situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea from where it can defend the [[Castello Maniace]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==== Jamaica ====\nThere is a Martello tower located at what was Fort Nugent. In 1709, the Spanish slave agent in Jamaica, James Castillo, built a fort in [[Harbour View, Jamaica|Harbour View]], to guard his home against attack. An English Governor, [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|George Nugent]], later strengthened the fort to guard the eastern entrance of the city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] Harbour. The tower was probably built between 1808 and 1811,<ref name=Clements /> at a reported cost of \u00a312,000.\n\n==== Jersey ====\n[[File:Tou d'V\u00eende, J\u00e8rri 2.jpg|thumb|La Tour de Vinde, [[Saint Br\u00e9lade]], Jersey]]\nThe British built eight true Martello towers in [[Jersey]], three between 1808 and 1814, and five between 1834 and 1837, one of which, L'Etacq, the German occupation forces destroyed during World War II. The three original towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Icho Tower]] (1811)\n* [[Portelet Tower]] (1808)\n* [[La Tour de Vinde]] (AKA Noirmont; 1808\u20131814)<ref name=Grimsley>Grimsley (1988), p.43.</ref>\nThe four surviving, later towers are:<ref name=Clements />\n* [[Lewis Tower, Jersey|Lewis Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 1; 1835)\n* [[Kempt Tower]] (AKA St Ouen 2; 1834)\n* [[La Collette Tower]] \u2013 Absorbed into the 19th-century artificers' barracks and workshops\n* [[Victoria Tower, Jersey|Victoria Tower]] (1837)\n\nIn addition, there are a number of towers in Jersey (the [[Jersey Round Tower]]s), that are frequently referred to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos.

However, [[Madliena Tower]], which was one of thirteen [[De Redin towers]] built in Malta in 1658\u20131659, began to be used as if it was a Martello Tower and it is sometimes considered as such. Various modifications were made, including mounting a 64-pound rifled muzzle loading (RML) gun on the roof for coastal defence. From the late 19th century onwards it defended part of the [[Victoria Lines]]. The tower remained in use until World War II. It still stands today, despite having some minor modifications to its original structure, and it was recently restored.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Madliena Tower \u2013 Malta's 'Martello' Tower|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=19 July 2014|date=11 August 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019035044/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/madliena-tower-maltas-martello-tower.html|archivedate=19 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Mauritius ====\nThe British built five Martello Towers between 1832 and 1835 at Grand River North West (2), Black River (2), and Port Louis (1), of which three survive. \nOne tower, named Cunningham Tower after Lieutenant-Colonel Cunningham, the commanding Royal Engineer, was constructed as part of Fort George at the northern side of the entrance to Port Louis harbour. Two towers were built at Grand River North West; on the south-west side of the river bay the tower was built at Pointe aux Sables whilst Fort Victoria was built covering the north-eastern flank. The remaining two were built to support existing batteries, which were also improved, at the mouth of the Black River; one to the north at La Preneuse and the other south of Grande-Rivi\u00e8re-Noire at Batterie de l'Harmonie.

The tower at Simon\u2019s Town and Cape Town were both built in 1795. The tower at Cape Town was demolished over 100 years ago, but the tower at Simon's Town now is sometimes claimed as the oldest Martello in the world. It is arguable as to whether one should properly call it a Martello Tower.<ref>Brock & Brock (1976), p.162.</ref>\n\nThat said, [[Vice Admiral]] [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|George Elphinstone]], who commanded the force that captured the colony and then served briefly as its governor, had served with the Mediterranean fleet off Corsica in 1794.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> The British built the tower at Fort Beaufort in 1837, and it is probably the only example of an inland Martello tower.\n\n==== Spain ====\n\nDuring the last period of British occupation (1798\u20131802) of [[Menorca]], Sir [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]], the then British governor, ordered Engineer Captain Robert D\u00b4Arcy to build some 12 Martello towers along the coast.<ref name=Sutcliffe /> These, when added to the three Spanish towers already in place, gave Menorca 15 towers.<ref name=Grundy />\n\nThe British built five towers to protect [[Mah\u00f3n]]: Phillipet on Lazareto Island, Cala Taulera (St. Clair) and Los Freus (Erskine) on the peninsula of La Mola, Stuart's Tower, and a tower on the Punta de Sant Carlos, which the Spanish destroyed when they took regained possession of Menorca. To the northwest of Mah\u00f3n the British built two more towers, Sa Torreta and Sa Mezquita.\n\nOne tower, the Princess Tower, or the Erskine Tower, was incorporated into the [[Fortress of Isabel II]], built between 1850 and 1875. The tower was converted to a powder magazine, which led to its destruction in 1958, when lightning struck the tower. The explosion destroyed the tower, blowing out large sections of its walls.\n\n[[File:Sanitja tower.JPG|thumb|left|Martello tower at Cap Cavalleria, Menorca.]]\nThe British erected Stuart's Tower in 1798 on Turks Hill or Hangman's Hill to the south of the port of [[Mah\u00f3n]] at San Esteban or Saint Stephen's bay on the southern side of the [[Fortress of San Felipe]]. In 1756 and again in 1781, batteries on the hill had supported successful attacks on the Fortress. The tower was built both to secure the hill and protect the entrance to the bay. The tower's name was later changed to Torre d\u00b4en Penjat, or Hangman's Tower.\n\nTo protect the harbor of [[Fornells, Menorca|Fornells]], the British built a tower on the rocky headland overlooking the harbor's mouth, and a small tower on the island of Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.\n\nLastly, the British built one tower at Santandria to protect the old capital of [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]].\n\nIn addition to the 12 towers that they built, the British made use of three towers that the Spanish had built earlier.<ref name=Grundy>Grundy (1991).</ref>  In 1781, Captain Francisco Fernandez de Angulo had built towers south of Port Mahon at Punta Prima and Alcufar, based on the design of those that the Spanish had built in Gando, [[Gran Canaria]], in 1740. At [[Ciutadella de Menorca|Ciutadella]] the British used the St. Nicholas's Tower, built in 1690. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] returned Menorca to Spain in 1802. Around 1804, the Spanish built a tower at Punta Na Radona to protect the beach at [[Son Bou, Menorca|Son Bou]], Menorca. In 1808, Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]], commanding the 38-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] {{HMS|Imperieuse|1805|6}}, sent ashore a landing party that destroyed the unarmed tower.

Two are at [[Key West, Florida]]; others were built at the harbours of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[New York City]]. Two more Martello towers stood at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] and Bayou Dupre, [[Louisiana]].<ref>Angus Konstam, ''American Civil War Fortification: Coastal Stone Forts''. Osprey Publishing, 2003</ref>\n\n[[File:41stInfRegtCOA.png|thumb|41st Infantry Coat of arms with a Martello Tower]]\nAlthough the Americans copied the design from the towers the British erected in Canada, the American Martello towers differed in some significant respects from the British. The Martello tower built at [[Tybee Island, Georgia]] was constructed around 1815 utilizing wood and [[Tabby (cement)|tabby]], a common local building material at the time, instead of the brick or stone that the British towers used. Also unlike the British towers, the Tybee tower featured [[embrasure|gun loops]] on the garrison floor that enabled [[musket]]s to be fired through the walls.<ref name=\"robert19\" /> It was never tested in battle and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] was in a state of disrepair.
