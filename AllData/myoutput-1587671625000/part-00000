Shielding is typically applied to enclosures to isolate electrical devices from their surroundings, and to cables to isolate wires from the environment through which the cable runs. Electromagnetic shielding that blocks [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electromagnetic radiation]] is also known as '''RF shielding'''.\n\nThe shielding can reduce the [[Coupling (electronics)|coupling]] of [[Radio frequency|radio waves]], electromagnetic fields, and [[electrostatic field]]s. A conductive enclosure used to block electrostatic fields is also known as a [[Faraday cage]]. The amount of reduction depends very much upon the material used, its thickness, the size of the shielded volume and the frequency of the fields of interest and the size, shape and orientation of apertures in a shield to an incident electromagnetic field.\n\n==Materials used==\nTypical materials used for electromagnetic shielding include [[sheet metal]], metal screen, and [[metal foam]]. Common sheet metals for shielding include copper, brass, nickel, silver, steel, and tin. Shielding effectiveness, that is how well a shield reflects or absorbs/suppresses electromagnetic radiation, is affected by the physical properties of the metal.\u00a0 These may include conductivity, solderability, permeability, thickness, and weight. A metal\u2019s properties are an important consideration in material selection. For example, electrically dominant waves are reflected by highly conductive metals like copper, silver, and brass, while magnetically dominant waves are absorbed/suppressed by a less conductive metal such as steel or stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ceptech.net/understanding-emi-rfi-shielding-to-manage-interference/|title=Understanding EMI/RFI Shielding to Manage Interference|website=Ceptech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> Further, any holes in the shield or mesh must be significantly smaller than the [[wavelength]] of the radiation that is being kept out, or the enclosure will not effectively approximate an unbroken conducting surface.\n\nAnother commonly used shielding method, especially with electronic goods housed in plastic enclosures, is to coat the inside of the enclosure with a metallic ink or similar material.  The ink consists of a carrier material loaded with a suitable metal, typically [[copper]] or [[nickel]], in the form of very small particulates.  It is sprayed on to the enclosure and, once dry, produces a continuous conductive layer of metal, which can be electrically connected to the [[chassis ground]] of the equipment, thus providing effective shielding.\n\nElectromagnetic shielding is the process of lowering the electromagnetic field in an area by barricading it with conductive or magnetic material. [[Copper in architecture#Radio frequency shielding|Copper is used for radio frequency (RF) shielding]] because it absorbs [[radio wave|radio]] and other [[electromagnetic wave]]s. Properly designed and constructed [[Copper in architecture#Radio frequency shielding|copper RF shielding]] enclosures satisfy most RF shielding needs, from computer and electrical switching rooms to hospital [[CAT-scan]] and [[MRI]] facilities.<ref>Seale, Wayne (2007).

The shielding impedes the escape of any signal from the core conductor, and also prevents signals from being added to the core conductor.\nSome cables have two separate [[coaxial]] screens, one connected at both ends, the other at one end only, to maximize shielding of both electromagnetic and electrostatic fields.\n\nThe door of a [[microwave oven]] has a screen built into the window. From the perspective of microwaves (with wavelengths of 12&nbsp;cm) this screen finishes a [[Faraday cage]] formed by the oven's metal housing.  Visible light, with wavelengths ranging between 400&nbsp;nm and 700&nbsp;nm, passes easily through the screen holes.\n\nRF shielding is also used to prevent access to data stored on [[RFID]] chips embedded in various devices, such as [[biometric passports]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8227-metal-shields-and-encryption-for-us-passports.html |title=Metal shields and encryption for US passports |publisher=Newscientist.com |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[NATO]] specifies electromagnetic shielding for computers and keyboards to prevent passive monitoring of keyboard emissions that would allow passwords to be captured; consumer keyboards do not offer this protection primarily because of the prohibitive cost.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/keyboard/|title=Compromising Electromagnetic Emanations of Wired and Wireless Keyboards|date=2009-06-01|author=Martin Vuagnoux and Sylvain Pasini|publisher=Security and Cryptography Laboratory (LASEC)|location=[[Lausanne]]}}</ref>\n\nRF shielding is also used to protect medical and laboratory equipment to provide protection against interfering signals, including AM, FM, TV, emergency services, dispatch, pagers, ESMR, cellular, and PCS.  It can also be used to protect the equipment at the AM, FM or TV broadcast facilities.\n\nAnother example of the practical use of electromagnetic shielding would be defense applications. As technology improves, so does the susceptibility to various types of nefarious electromagnetic interference. The idea of encasing a cable inside a grounded conductive barrier can provide mitigation to these risks. See [[Shielded cable|Shielded Cables]], and [[Electromagnetic interference]].\n\n== How it works ==\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of coupled [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields.  The electric field produces [[force]]s on the [[electric charge|charge]] carriers (i.e., [[electron]]s) within the conductor.  As soon as an electric field is applied to the surface of an ideal conductor, it induces a [[current (electricity)|current]] that causes displacement of charge inside the conductor that cancels the applied field inside, at which point the current stops. See [[Faraday cage#Operation|Faraday cage]] for more explanation.\n\nSimilarly, ''varying'' [[magnetic field]]s generate [[eddy current]]s that act to cancel the applied magnetic field.  (The conductor does not respond to static magnetic fields unless the conductor is moving relative to the magnetic field.)  The result is that [[electromagnetic radiation]] is reflected from the surface of the conductor: internal fields stay inside, and external fields stay outside.\n\nSeveral factors serve to limit the shielding capability of real RF shields. One is that, due to the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductor, the excited field does not completely cancel the incident field.  Also, most conductors exhibit a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] response to low-frequency magnetic fields, so that such fields are not fully attenuated by the conductor.  Any holes in the shield force current to flow around them, so that fields passing through the holes do not excite opposing electromagnetic fields.  These effects reduce the field-reflecting capability of the shield.\n\nIn the case of high-[[frequency]] electromagnetic radiation, the above-mentioned adjustments take a non-negligible amount of time, yet any such radiation energy, as far as it is not reflected, is absorbed by the skin (unless it is extremely thin), so in this case there is no electromagnetic field inside either. This is one aspect of a greater phenomenon called the [[skin effect]]. A measure of the depth to which radiation can penetrate the shield is the so-called [[skin depth]].\n\n== Magnetic shielding ==\nEquipment sometimes requires isolation from external magnetic fields.  For static or slowly varying magnetic fields (below about 100&nbsp;kHz) the Faraday shielding described above is ineffective.  In these cases shields made of high [[magnetic permeability]] metal [[alloy]]s can be used, such as sheets of [[permalloy]] and [[mu-metal]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnetic-shield.com/literature/pdf/mu-2.pdf |title=MuMETAL |id=Catalog MU-2 |publisher=Magnetic Shield Corp. |date=2012 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73410422&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch|title=Trademark Status & Document Retrieval|website=tsdr.uspto.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref> or with nanocrystalline grain structure ferromagnetic metal coatings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/item/emcdirectory-design_2009/index.php#/134 |title=Interference Technology Magazine Whitepaper on Ferromagnetic Nanocrystalline Metal Magnetic Shield Coatings |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315010701/http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/item/emcdirectory-design_2009/index.php#/134 |archivedate=March 15, 2010 }}</ref>  These materials don't block the magnetic field, as with electric shielding, but rather draw the field into themselves, providing a path for the [[magnetic field lines]] around the shielded volume.  The best shape for magnetic shields is thus a closed container surrounding the shielded volume.  The effectiveness of this type of shielding depends on the material's permeability, which generally drops off at both very low magnetic field strengths and at high field strengths where the material becomes [[magnetic saturation|saturated]].  So to achieve low residual fields, magnetic shields often consist of several enclosures one inside the other, each of which successively reduces the field inside it.\n\nBecause of the above limitations of passive shielding, an alternative used with static or low-frequency fields is active shielding; using a field created by [[electromagnet]]s to cancel the ambient field within a volume.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acornnmr.com/appnotes/shielding.htm |title=NMR Magnet Shielding: The seat of the pants guide to understanding the problems of shielding NMR magnets |publisher=Acorn NMR |date=22 January 2003 |accessdate=27 June 2016}}</ref>  [[Solenoid]]s and [[Helmholtz coil]]s are types of coils that can be used for this purpose.\n\nAdditionally, [[superconductivity|superconducting]] materials can expel magnetic fields via the [[Meissner effect]].\n\n==Mathematical model==\n\nSuppose that we have a spherical shell of a (linear and isotropic) diamagnetic material with [[relative magnetic permeability|relative permeability]] <math>\\mu_\\text{r}</math>, with inner radius <math>a</math> and outer radius <math>b</math>.
