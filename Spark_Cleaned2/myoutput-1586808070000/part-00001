On 2 May 2016, it was announced that Sidwell had returned to the role. Steven made his return on 27 May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a795763/eastenders-steven-beale-aaron-sidwell-explains-return/ | title=EastEnders: Find out why Steven Beale is back| date=2016-05-27}}</ref> On 9 August 2017, it was announced that Sidwell would leave the show again. Steven made his final exit on 8 September 2017 when the character was killed off during a high-profile stunt week.\n\nIn the 1990s, Steven's storylines mostly concerned his paternity and the ongoing [[custody battle]] between his mother, [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), and his stepfather, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). In the early 2000s, a darker side to adolescent Steven emerged as he began writing [[poison pen]] letters to neighbours, before moving to New Zealand to be with his father. In the late 2000s, Steven's storyline focused on his hostile relationship with Ian, and involved stalking Ian, taking Ian hostage, multiple [[suicide]] attempts, and accidentally shooting Ian's new wife, [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]). Steven also dates [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) but struggles with his sexuality and an attraction to Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), and he attempts to murder his grandmother, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Since his 2016 return, Steven becomes deceitful with his girlfriend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) by having an affair with her sister [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) - which sparks the events of the character being responsible for Abi's pregnancy; fabricating a lie about having a brain tumour; and nearly killing Jane again after Lauren and Abi's father, [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]), blackmails him in setting fire to the restaurant in his plan to kill her as revenge for her contribution to getting him wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of half-sister [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), who was previously killed by their stepbrother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington). Ultimately, Steve contemplates on rescuing Jane and ends up getting injured in the fire by Max - which consequently triggers the character suffering a fatal cardiac arrest in hospital; Steve dies and his lies are soon discovered at his funeral a week later.\n\n==Storylines==\n=== 1989\u20132002 ===\nSteven is born in December 1989; his mother is [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and his father is [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]) - even though Cindy is married to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]); she goes as far as to convince Ian that he is Steven's father. Simon becomes Steven's godfather, despite knowing that he is his biological father. Cindy tells Ian the truth when she and Simon reconcile. They leave Walford with Steven in December 1990; however, Ian and Cindy reconcile in 1992, and Ian raises Steven as his son. In December 1993, Steven becomes a half-brother when his sister [[Lucy Beale]] and brother [[Peter Beale]] are born to Ian and Cindy. Unhappy in her marriage, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian in 1996, and when this fails, she snatches Steven and Peter and flees to [[Italy]]. In 1997, Ian tracks her, Steven and Peter down and kidnaps them back. Cindy fights for custody and wins, but on the day she reclaims Steven, Lucy and Peter, she is arrested when the hitman confesses to the attempted murder of Ian and Ian gains custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter. She dies in childbirth in prison in November 1998. Steven alone attends her funeral.\n\nSteven then grows up with various different stepmothers, and though he grows close to them all, he feels abandoned when they leave. When Ian prepares to marry [[Laura Dunn]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]), Steven is anxious that they too will end up splitting; his fears are realised when he catches Ian kissing  [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) in 2002. From being a quiet, sensitive boy, Steven starts rebelling and skipping school. When Laura finds out, she confronts Steven, who reveals that Ian had kissed Janine. The subsequent rows have a negative effect on Steven; he becomes angry with the world and starts writing poison pen letters to people. Ian eventually finds out and confronts Steven. Following an argument, Steven goes to his room and overhears Ian calling him \"Cindy's little brat!\"; Ian is forced to tell Steven that he is not his natural father. Distressed and angry, Steven decides to leave Walford to meet Simon, who lives in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008 ===\nIn September 2007, Steven returns and begins stalking Ian, pretending to be Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death. He is angry that Ian had not retrieved him from New Zealand; living with his biological father had not been a happy experience, and he had ended up feeling rejected and in the way.\n\nSteven then tries to commit suicide with a gun that Lucy gives him to dispose of. Ian, Jane and Lucy try to stop him, a struggle ensues, and Jane is accidentally shot in the stomach; as a result, she is unable to have children. Ian admits Steven to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When released, Steven goes off his medication. He tries to apologise to Jane and Ian, but finds them hostile. Hoping he will leave Walford, Ian humiliates and rejects Steven several times, going as far as to break a snow globe he had given to Steven when he was young right in front of him. Once again depressed, Steven tries to commit suicide by dousing himself in petrol; however, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) stops him from setting fire to himself. When Ian discovers what Steven has been planning to do, he reconciles with him. Displeased, Jane fights against Steven being part of her family, but eventually relents and in January 2008, she agrees to let Steven move into the Beales' home; however, she makes it clear that she is waiting for him to mess up so he will be gone from her life for good.\n\nSteven and Stacey grow closer in early 2008, as he supports her through the breakdown of her marriage. Steven is attracted to Stacey. She initially rejects his advances, but eventually agrees to date him. Their relationship progresses, until Steven decides that he is ready to lose his virginity, but their attempt at consummation ends in disaster when Steven can not perform sexually. Embarrassed, Steven pretends that he had lost his virginity; however, Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) realises he is lying and publicly announces it, leaving Steven humiliated. Steven confronts Christian and, after releasing his pent-up anger and frustration, he spontaneously kisses Christian. Realising Steven is gay, Christian tries to make Steven face up to his sexuality. Steven maintains that he is heterosexual, and successfully has sex with Stacey, but their relationship soon ends when Christian tells Stacey that Steven had kissed him.\n\nDistraught, Steven propositions Christian, but is rejected. In revenge, Steven tells Ian that Christian had tried to seduce him. Ian is furious until Jane discovers the truth, leading Steven to confess that he is gay. Steven is grateful when Ian proves supportive, as his biological father had not been. Ian is full of praise for Steven; however, he does not realise that Steven has been hiding his runaway daughter, Lucy. Steven does not want to share Ian's attention, so he makes plans for Lucy to flee to France; however, Pat discovers his plan and is hit by a car as she is trying to apprehend him. Pat is hospitalised, and in order to stop her from telling Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to smother her with a pillow. Pat wakes up, but Steven continues in his murder attempt until Ian interrupts him. When Pat tells Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to deny it, but Ian sees through his lies. He traces Steven to [[St Pancras railway station]], and discovers him with Lucy. Steven has booked her a ticket on the [[Eurostar]], but Ian persuades her not to go and Steven flees. Later, back in Walford, Ian spots Steven spying on Lucy. Ian confronts him, admitting that he is glad that Steven is not his biological son; he tells him that if he ever returns to Albert Square, he will kill him. Devastated, Steven heads to the tube station and leaves Walford. In 2014, Peter reveals that Steven was living in New Zealand with his father, Simon. Peter (now [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) and fianc\u00e9e [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) leave Walford for New Zealand to join Steven in February 2015.\n\n=== 2016\u20132017 ===\nIn May 2016, Steven returns with Lauren and [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie|Louie]] after they learn that Jane is in hospital after being attacked by [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington), who also confessed to killing Lucy. Ian initially rejects Steven, but Steven says he is back to help and repair any damage he made in the past. Ian accepts Steven's offer of driving him to the hospital. Steven and Lauren do not tell anyone that they are together but when Ian finds out, he throws them out. Ian eventually accepts Steven back into the family but Jane is wary of him. Steven helps Ian at his restaurant and impresses him with his sales skills. Sadly, Jane soon finds an unfinished credit card application in Lucy's name and accuses Steven. Steven admits being responsible because he realised Ian is struggling financially. Ian promotes Steven to restaurant manager. When the restaurant is burgled, it is revealed that Steven arranged it and sold the kitchen equipment to pay debts. [[Kyle Slater]] ([[Riley Carter Millington]]), an employee at the restaurant, realises Steven arranged the burglary, so Steven sends him on a training course, and he admits to Lauren what he did. Later, Kyle asks Steven for a pay rise, saying he has kept quiet about the burglary, but Steven refuses.\n\nSteven worries when Jane asks to look at the restaurant's accounts as he has stolen money. He makes excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop and tells Lauren he will fake some invoices. Steven is overjoyed when Louie says his first word, \"mama\", and gets him to say \"dada\", filming it to show Lauren. However, she sends the video to Peter, upsetting Steven as he tells Lauren that he sees himself as Louie's father but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. Steven also worries that Lauren never says she loves him when he says it to her. When Jane looks at the restaurant's accounts and realizes payments are being made to a fake company, she knows it can only be Ian or Steven but worries about confronting the wrong person. She soon discovers that Steven set up the fake company and confronts him; he explains he borrowed the money to help Peter, who was drinking heavily and getting into fights and Lauren does not know the whole truth, so Jane tells him to be honest with her. She is angry that Steven was not honest and considers visiting Peter; Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake.\n\nLauren meets [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]), a man who works in her father [[Max Branning]]'s ([[Jake Wood]]) office, and they are attracted to each other. Josh encourages Lauren to apply for a job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her to spend more time with him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes his head against the wall, causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], claiming that he has [[cancer]] and he is dying.\n\nAlthough Abi discovers the truth, she decides not to tell Lauren after Steven tells her he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. However, Steven tells Lauren he wants to adopt Louie and stuns Abi by proposing marriage to Lauren in The Queen Vic. When Lauren leaves Walford to visit Tanya, conflicted on her relationship with Steven, Max tells him he knows he lied about the brain tumour and gives him an ultimatum: help him move some clients from his property or he will tell Lauren the truth. Max tells Steven to set fire to the flat while making sure the clients safely exit the premises. Steven refuses and tells Max that he will tell Lauren the truth when she returns and tells Abi that their affair was a mistake. However, when Lauren texts to say that she will be staying with Tanya for longer, Steven agrees to Max's plan. However, the plan appears to backfire when the residents hear sirens of fire engines, police cars and ambulances. Max finds Steven in The Vic alleyway and Steven tells him he does not know if the clients exited the flat. Max tells Steven that he is on his own as he drove Ian's car to the flat, while dismissing Steven's claim that if he goes to prison, Max will go down too. Max tells him to find an alibi, so Steven asks Abi. Steven tells Max that he has an alibi and mentions that the clients did exit the flat. Jane later discovers Max's revenge plan and Steven's brain tumour lie and Max convinces Steven that Jane is trying to get rid of him. Steven confronts Jane and blames her for Max's behaviour, but Jane tries to reason with Steven and reveals Abi is pregnant. However, Steven refuses to believe her, and after berating her about framing Max for Lucy's murder, sets fire to the restaurant, and leaves Jane to perish in the flames. Believing Lauren trapped inside, Steven and Max run back into the inferno and Steven saves Abi, who became trapped upon finding, and attempting to save Jane. Max tried to get Steven to kill Jane but he refuses and tries to save her. Max violently shoves him into a countertop, causing Steven to be rushed to hospital where he tells Abi that he loves her and will try to make their relationship work. He then suffers a [[cardiac arrest]] and dies from his injuries. When Steven's lies are revealed, it is also revealed that Steven died of injuries to the liver (likely from when Max pushed him) and so only Abi attends his funeral and reads a eulogy dedicated to him. Abi then has Steven cremated and hides his ashes away from Lauren when they visit their mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) in Exeter. However, Lauren eventually discovers the truth after finding Abi in her wedding dress. Horrified by what she has learned, Lauren tries to flush Steven's ashes down the toilet, but Abi stops her, eventually telling her the truth about her pregnancy with his baby. In December 2017, Abi and Lauren learn about their father's scheme before discovering his knowledge over the former's pregnancy with Steven's baby. They eventually find out on Christmas that year the truth about Steven's death when their mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]] reveals that Max killed him \u2013 causing them to disown their father, who subsequently gets into a fight with Ian when he and his mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] learn the truth as well; the latter then explains this to Phil, who then confronts and attacks Max. Shortly afterwards, Abi and Lauren fall from the Queen Vic roof; both survive and are taken to hospital, where an ultrasound shows Abi and Steven's baby is alive. Fearing that Abi may go into cardiac arrest following her devastating diagnosis of brain stem death, the doctors decide to deliver the baby via cesarean section. Soon after, the doctors switch off Abi's life support when it becomes clear that the chances of reviving her are impossible.\n\nA year later, many people blamed Bobby for Max's revenge including the deaths of Steven and his own daughter Abi.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Early storylines===\nThe character's conception was a part of one of the most notable storylines in ''EastEnders'' during 1989, a love triangle between [[Cindy Beale|Cindy Williams]] (played by [[Michelle Collins]]), [[Simon Wicks]] (played by [[Nick Berry]]) and [[Ian Beale]] (played by [[Adam Woodyatt]]).<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Steven was the result of a [[one-night stand]] (in the bar of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven's true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon's mother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat would believe Cindy's claim initially. Simon's rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy pretend that the child was Ian's.\n\nThe character's birth occurred in an episode that aired on 28 December 1989, although in the on-screen events, he was born on [[Boxing Day]]. In the storyline, Steven was born two months prematurely, and was therefore supposed to be small; however, the baby who originally played Steven, Edward Farrell, was actually large for his age, and was nicknamed \"Chunky\" by actor Adam Woodyatt.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=9780563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> According to former ''EastEnders'' writer, [[David Yallop]], it had been agreed in September 1989, that Steven Beale would be killed off in the serial. This was part of producer [[Mike Gibbon]]'s plan to increase the ratings by culling a large number of the soap's long-running cast. Yallop said, \"We had to reach a decision with the illegitimate child who was in the process of being born as a result of an earlier storyline. We wanted to know what to do with it. Either the child would be allowed to live or it would die. They decided to make the child 'seriously ill', but the reprieve was temporary. In episode 606 I resolved the problem.\" He claimed that on his draft of the storyline he wrote the words \"Baby die\". The plot never came to fruition, as Gibbon was abruptly replaced as the soap's boss and Yallop's plots were scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/soap-operas-producers-aimed-axe-at-poor-acting-1556027.html|title=Soap opera's producers 'aimed axe at poor acting' |newspaper=The Independent| date = 8 October 1992|accessdate=19 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Handbook]]'' by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for roles in ''EastEnders'' is usually done locally, so that children and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> This occurred with Steven's original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: \"Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing her hair back under her hat but lots of [viewers] still spotted it\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven's christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, \"When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn\u2019t recover and I kissed him for it.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nBefore his first screen birthday, Steven was central to storylines surrounding his parents and stepfather Ian, including a special week of off-set episodes filmed in Devon, where Ian discovered that his best friend Simon was Steven's real father and that he had reunited with Cindy. The love triangle between Simon, Cindy and Ian, and the events surrounding Steven's paternity dominated the soap during 1990; it has been described by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the year's \"big story\".<ref name=\"10years\"/> Steven was written out of the serial after actors Nick Berry and Michelle Collins decided to leave the show. His exit aired on 27 December 1990, though in the on-screen events it was Boxing Day, Steven's first birthday. In 1992, Michelle Collins reprised her role of Cindy, and Steven was also reintroduced, played by a different actor, Stuart Stevens. On-screen, Simon abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian traced them to a bedsit and brought them back to Walford, where Steven was brought up as Ian's real son. Steven was written out once again in 1996, when Collins quit for a second time. In the on-screen events, Cindy absconded with Steven and his brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]] following Cindy's failed attempt to have Ian assassinated. Upon his return in 1997 \u2013 where Ian once again regained custody \u2013 Steven's role was recast to another actor, [[Edward Savage (footballer)|Edward Savage]]. As the character aged, his actor was given a more substantial role in the serial, Steven remaining with Ian following the death of his mother, who died in prison during child birth. Savage remained in the role until 2002, when he opted to leave. On-screen, Steven discovered that Ian had been lying about his paternity. He began rebelling, and was found to be the author of several mysterious poison pen letters. When he was caught, he demanded to travel to New Zealand, so he could meet his real father, Simon Wicks. A BBC source commented to the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', \"Regular viewers will know Steven is a deeply troubled boy. But his unmasking as the poison pen author is going to shock everyone on the Square. The lad is almost inviting punishment. It's as if he wants Ian and [his stepmother] [[Laura Beale|Laura]] to wash their hands of him. Could Steven be a new [[Nick Cotton]] in the making?\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a9530/writer-of-eastenders-poison-pen-letters-revealed.html|title= Writer of 'EastEnders' poison pen letters revealed|website=[[Digital Spy]] | author=Neil Wilkes| date = 6 November 2002| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reintroduction (2007); stalking, kidnapping and mental illness===\nIn 2005, the British media claimed that the character of Steven was due to return to ''EastEnders'', three years after he had last appeared. The ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' speculated that ''EastEnders'' bosses were hoping to cast an Australian actor to play Steven, to signify that he had been in New Zealand. It was claimed that actors from Australia's long-running soaps, ''[[Neighbours]]'' or ''[[Home and Away]]'', were being considered.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a19045/eastenders-return-for-kathy-beale.html|title= 'EastEnders' return for Kathy Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Daniel Kilkelly| date = 6 February 2005| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> The rumours turned out to be false, and a subsequent rumour in January 2007 predicting that ''[[Footballers' Wives]]''' actor [[Craig Gallivan]] was to play the role, was also quashed.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a42116/footie-wives-actor-tipped-as-new-steven-beale.html|title= Footie Wives actor tipped as new Steven Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Kris Green| date = 25 January 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:Stevenbeale 2007.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Steven Beale as he appeared in 2007]]\nThe character was eventually to make his return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] as part of a storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured to the top of a deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/22/comment.tvandradioarts1|title= For whom the Beale tolls|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author= Anne Pickard | date = 22 September 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy.<ref name=\"ds\"/> [[Aaron Sidwell]] was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him.

Steven's games were uncovered, and during the confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having \"a whiff of [[Bront\u00eb]] about it\", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, \"It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, but I hate those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love \u2013 Ian Beale \u2013 as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show. Soap audiences like continuity. They dip in and out and if they haven't watched for a few weeks, then tune in to find no one they recognise, it can be disconcerting.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/08/mondaymediasection12|title= The art of storytelling|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author=  Stephen Armstrong| date = 8 October 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nMentally ill, Steven was admitted to a psychiatric hospital by Ian. Sidwell has commented on Steven's mental instability: \"He's so unpredictable...you never know what he's going to do next...He'll be normal one minute and he'll be crazy the next. He's kind of the [[Donnie Darko (character)|Donnie Darko]] of ''EastEnders''...that's the kind of person I styled him after...[he is] a similar character...He is always going to be a bit unstable and there will always be danger. I don't think even he knows what he's going to do next \u2013 but he's deadly, so don't let the nice guy act fool you.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref name=\"lucky\"/>\n\nSteven returned to the serial as a regular character following his release from hospital. Subsequent plots saw him unsuccessfully attempting to make amends with Ian and Jane for his past wrongdoing. The character also formed a friendship with [[Stacey Slater]] (played by [[Lacey Turner]]), who stopped him from committing suicide in December 2007. In the on-screen events, Steven \u2013 infuriated by Ian's rejection \u2013 soaked himself with petrol and threatened to light himself on fire. In the end, Stacey managed to persuade him not to go through with suicide by showing him that friends can be just as important as family. Despite hostilities from Jane, Steven gradually regained Ian's trust, and in episodes that aired over the Christmas period of 2007, Ian welcomed Steven back into his home as part of the Beale family.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Departure (2008); sexuality and Lucy's disappearance===\nIn February 2008, the BBC announced that Steven was being written out of ''EastEnders'' once again.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20080222_n2.shtml|title= Steven's farewell|publisher=BBC | date = 22 February 2008| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> An ''EastEnders'' spokeswoman revealed: \"[Sidwell]'s contract has run out \u2013 he only came for that length of contract.

John Partridge, has commented, \"Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset.

The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales' lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out, and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot was described as \"controversial\", and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: \"A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well.\"<ref name=\"chris\" />\n\nA final twist in Steven's story was his involvement in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy ([[Melissa Suffield]]). In episodes that aired in May 2008, it was revealed that Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. \n\nExplaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, \"It's all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian's love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She's the one who gets most of Ian's time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He's been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn\u2019t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian\u2019s life for good [...] He craves Ian\u2019s full attention and is willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.

Steven made his final exit on 8 September 2017 when the character was killed off during a high-profile stunt week.\n\nIn the 1990s, Steven's storylines mostly concerned his paternity and the ongoing [[custody battle]] between his mother, [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), and his stepfather, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). In the early 2000s, a darker side to adolescent Steven emerged as he began writing [[poison pen]] letters to neighbours, before moving to New Zealand to be with his father. In the late 2000s, Steven's storyline focused on his hostile relationship with Ian, and involved stalking Ian, taking Ian hostage, multiple [[suicide]] attempts, and accidentally shooting Ian's new wife, [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]). Steven also dates [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) but struggles with his sexuality and an attraction to Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), and he attempts to murder his grandmother, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Since his 2016 return, Steven becomes deceitful with his girlfriend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) by having an affair with her sister [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) - which sparks the events of the character being responsible for Abi's pregnancy; fabricating a lie about having a brain tumour; and nearly killing Jane again after Lauren and Abi's father, [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]), blackmails him in setting fire to the restaurant in his plan to kill her as revenge for her contribution to getting him wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of half-sister [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), who was previously killed by their stepbrother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington). Ultimately, Steve contemplates on rescuing Jane and ends up getting injured in the fire by Max - which consequently triggers the character suffering a fatal cardiac arrest in hospital; Steve dies and his lies are soon discovered at his funeral a week later.\n\n==Storylines==\n=== 1989\u20132002 ===\nSteven is born in December 1989; his mother is [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and his father is [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]) - even though Cindy is married to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]); she goes as far as to convince Ian that he is Steven's father. Simon becomes Steven's godfather, despite knowing that he is his biological father. Cindy tells Ian the truth when she and Simon reconcile. They leave Walford with Steven in December 1990; however, Ian and Cindy reconcile in 1992, and Ian raises Steven as his son. In December 1993, Steven becomes a half-brother when his sister [[Lucy Beale]] and brother [[Peter Beale]] are born to Ian and Cindy. Unhappy in her marriage, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian in 1996, and when this fails, she snatches Steven and Peter and flees to [[Italy]]. In 1997, Ian tracks her, Steven and Peter down and kidnaps them back. Cindy fights for custody and wins, but on the day she reclaims Steven, Lucy and Peter, she is arrested when the hitman confesses to the attempted murder of Ian and Ian gains custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter. She dies in childbirth in prison in November 1998. Steven alone attends her funeral.\n\nSteven then grows up with various different stepmothers, and though he grows close to them all, he feels abandoned when they leave. When Ian prepares to marry [[Laura Dunn]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]), Steven is anxious that they too will end up splitting; his fears are realised when he catches Ian kissing  [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) in 2002. From being a quiet, sensitive boy, Steven starts rebelling and skipping school. When Laura finds out, she confronts Steven, who reveals that Ian had kissed Janine. The subsequent rows have a negative effect on Steven; he becomes angry with the world and starts writing poison pen letters to people. Ian eventually finds out and confronts Steven. Following an argument, Steven goes to his room and overhears Ian calling him \"Cindy's little brat!\"; Ian is forced to tell Steven that he is not his natural father. Distressed and angry, Steven decides to leave Walford to meet Simon, who lives in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008 ===\nIn September 2007, Steven returns and begins stalking Ian, pretending to be Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death. He is angry that Ian had not retrieved him from New Zealand; living with his biological father had not been a happy experience, and he had ended up feeling rejected and in the way.\n\nSteven then tries to commit suicide with a gun that Lucy gives him to dispose of. Ian, Jane and Lucy try to stop him, a struggle ensues, and Jane is accidentally shot in the stomach; as a result, she is unable to have children. Ian admits Steven to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When released, Steven goes off his medication. He tries to apologise to Jane and Ian, but finds them hostile. Hoping he will leave Walford, Ian humiliates and rejects Steven several times, going as far as to break a snow globe he had given to Steven when he was young right in front of him. Once again depressed, Steven tries to commit suicide by dousing himself in petrol; however, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) stops him from setting fire to himself. When Ian discovers what Steven has been planning to do, he reconciles with him. Displeased, Jane fights against Steven being part of her family, but eventually relents and in January 2008, she agrees to let Steven move into the Beales' home; however, she makes it clear that she is waiting for him to mess up so he will be gone from her life for good.\n\nSteven and Stacey grow closer in early 2008, as he supports her through the breakdown of her marriage. Steven is attracted to Stacey. She initially rejects his advances, but eventually agrees to date him. Their relationship progresses, until Steven decides that he is ready to lose his virginity, but their attempt at consummation ends in disaster when Steven can not perform sexually. Embarrassed, Steven pretends that he had lost his virginity; however, Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) realises he is lying and publicly announces it, leaving Steven humiliated. Steven confronts Christian and, after releasing his pent-up anger and frustration, he spontaneously kisses Christian. Realising Steven is gay, Christian tries to make Steven face up to his sexuality. Steven maintains that he is heterosexual, and successfully has sex with Stacey, but their relationship soon ends when Christian tells Stacey that Steven had kissed him.\n\nDistraught, Steven propositions Christian, but is rejected. In revenge, Steven tells Ian that Christian had tried to seduce him. Ian is furious until Jane discovers the truth, leading Steven to confess that he is gay. Steven is grateful when Ian proves supportive, as his biological father had not been. Ian is full of praise for Steven; however, he does not realise that Steven has been hiding his runaway daughter, Lucy. Steven does not want to share Ian's attention, so he makes plans for Lucy to flee to France; however, Pat discovers his plan and is hit by a car as she is trying to apprehend him. Pat is hospitalised, and in order to stop her from telling Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to smother her with a pillow. Pat wakes up, but Steven continues in his murder attempt until Ian interrupts him. When Pat tells Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to deny it, but Ian sees through his lies. He traces Steven to [[St Pancras railway station]], and discovers him with Lucy. Steven has booked her a ticket on the [[Eurostar]], but Ian persuades her not to go and Steven flees. Later, back in Walford, Ian spots Steven spying on Lucy. Ian confronts him, admitting that he is glad that Steven is not his biological son; he tells him that if he ever returns to Albert Square, he will kill him. Devastated, Steven heads to the tube station and leaves Walford. In 2014, Peter reveals that Steven was living in New Zealand with his father, Simon. Peter (now [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) and fianc\u00e9e [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) leave Walford for New Zealand to join Steven in February 2015.\n\n=== 2016\u20132017 ===\nIn May 2016, Steven returns with Lauren and [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie|Louie]] after they learn that Jane is in hospital after being attacked by [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington), who also confessed to killing Lucy. Ian initially rejects Steven, but Steven says he is back to help and repair any damage he made in the past. Ian accepts Steven's offer of driving him to the hospital. Steven and Lauren do not tell anyone that they are together but when Ian finds out, he throws them out. Ian eventually accepts Steven back into the family but Jane is wary of him. Steven helps Ian at his restaurant and impresses him with his sales skills. Sadly, Jane soon finds an unfinished credit card application in Lucy's name and accuses Steven. Steven admits being responsible because he realised Ian is struggling financially. Ian promotes Steven to restaurant manager. When the restaurant is burgled, it is revealed that Steven arranged it and sold the kitchen equipment to pay debts. [[Kyle Slater]] ([[Riley Carter Millington]]), an employee at the restaurant, realises Steven arranged the burglary, so Steven sends him on a training course, and he admits to Lauren what he did. Later, Kyle asks Steven for a pay rise, saying he has kept quiet about the burglary, but Steven refuses.\n\nSteven worries when Jane asks to look at the restaurant's accounts as he has stolen money. He makes excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop and tells Lauren he will fake some invoices. Steven is overjoyed when Louie says his first word, \"mama\", and gets him to say \"dada\", filming it to show Lauren. However, she sends the video to Peter, upsetting Steven as he tells Lauren that he sees himself as Louie's father but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. Steven also worries that Lauren never says she loves him when he says it to her. When Jane looks at the restaurant's accounts and realizes payments are being made to a fake company, she knows it can only be Ian or Steven but worries about confronting the wrong person. She soon discovers that Steven set up the fake company and confronts him; he explains he borrowed the money to help Peter, who was drinking heavily and getting into fights and Lauren does not know the whole truth, so Jane tells him to be honest with her. She is angry that Steven was not honest and considers visiting Peter; Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake.\n\nLauren meets [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]), a man who works in her father [[Max Branning]]'s ([[Jake Wood]]) office, and they are attracted to each other. Josh encourages Lauren to apply for a job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her to spend more time with him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes his head against the wall, causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], claiming that he has [[cancer]] and he is dying.\n\nAlthough Abi discovers the truth, she decides not to tell Lauren after Steven tells her he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. However, Steven tells Lauren he wants to adopt Louie and stuns Abi by proposing marriage to Lauren in The Queen Vic. When Lauren leaves Walford to visit Tanya, conflicted on her relationship with Steven, Max tells him he knows he lied about the brain tumour and gives him an ultimatum: help him move some clients from his property or he will tell Lauren the truth. Max tells Steven to set fire to the flat while making sure the clients safely exit the premises. Steven refuses and tells Max that he will tell Lauren the truth when she returns and tells Abi that their affair was a mistake. However, when Lauren texts to say that she will be staying with Tanya for longer, Steven agrees to Max's plan. However, the plan appears to backfire when the residents hear sirens of fire engines, police cars and ambulances. Max finds Steven in The Vic alleyway and Steven tells him he does not know if the clients exited the flat. Max tells Steven that he is on his own as he drove Ian's car to the flat, while dismissing Steven's claim that if he goes to prison, Max will go down too. Max tells him to find an alibi, so Steven asks Abi. Steven tells Max that he has an alibi and mentions that the clients did exit the flat. Jane later discovers Max's revenge plan and Steven's brain tumour lie and Max convinces Steven that Jane is trying to get rid of him. Steven confronts Jane and blames her for Max's behaviour, but Jane tries to reason with Steven and reveals Abi is pregnant. However, Steven refuses to believe her, and after berating her about framing Max for Lucy's murder, sets fire to the restaurant, and leaves Jane to perish in the flames. Believing Lauren trapped inside, Steven and Max run back into the inferno and Steven saves Abi, who became trapped upon finding, and attempting to save Jane. Max tried to get Steven to kill Jane but he refuses and tries to save her. Max violently shoves him into a countertop, causing Steven to be rushed to hospital where he tells Abi that he loves her and will try to make their relationship work. He then suffers a [[cardiac arrest]] and dies from his injuries. When Steven's lies are revealed, it is also revealed that Steven died of injuries to the liver (likely from when Max pushed him) and so only Abi attends his funeral and reads a eulogy dedicated to him. Abi then has Steven cremated and hides his ashes away from Lauren when they visit their mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) in Exeter. However, Lauren eventually discovers the truth after finding Abi in her wedding dress. Horrified by what she has learned, Lauren tries to flush Steven's ashes down the toilet, but Abi stops her, eventually telling her the truth about her pregnancy with his baby. In December 2017, Abi and Lauren learn about their father's scheme before discovering his knowledge over the former's pregnancy with Steven's baby. They eventually find out on Christmas that year the truth about Steven's death when their mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]] reveals that Max killed him \u2013 causing them to disown their father, who subsequently gets into a fight with Ian when he and his mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] learn the truth as well; the latter then explains this to Phil, who then confronts and attacks Max. Shortly afterwards, Abi and Lauren fall from the Queen Vic roof; both survive and are taken to hospital, where an ultrasound shows Abi and Steven's baby is alive. Fearing that Abi may go into cardiac arrest following her devastating diagnosis of brain stem death, the doctors decide to deliver the baby via cesarean section. Soon after, the doctors switch off Abi's life support when it becomes clear that the chances of reviving her are impossible.\n\nA year later, many people blamed Bobby for Max's revenge including the deaths of Steven and his own daughter Abi.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Early storylines===\nThe character's conception was a part of one of the most notable storylines in ''EastEnders'' during 1989, a love triangle between [[Cindy Beale|Cindy Williams]] (played by [[Michelle Collins]]), [[Simon Wicks]] (played by [[Nick Berry]]) and [[Ian Beale]] (played by [[Adam Woodyatt]]).<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Steven was the result of a [[one-night stand]] (in the bar of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven's true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon's mother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat would believe Cindy's claim initially. Simon's rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy pretend that the child was Ian's.\n\nThe character's birth occurred in an episode that aired on 28 December 1989, although in the on-screen events, he was born on [[Boxing Day]]. In the storyline, Steven was born two months prematurely, and was therefore supposed to be small; however, the baby who originally played Steven, Edward Farrell, was actually large for his age, and was nicknamed \"Chunky\" by actor Adam Woodyatt.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=9780563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> According to former ''EastEnders'' writer, [[David Yallop]], it had been agreed in September 1989, that Steven Beale would be killed off in the serial. This was part of producer [[Mike Gibbon]]'s plan to increase the ratings by culling a large number of the soap's long-running cast. Yallop said, \"We had to reach a decision with the illegitimate child who was in the process of being born as a result of an earlier storyline. We wanted to know what to do with it. Either the child would be allowed to live or it would die. They decided to make the child 'seriously ill', but the reprieve was temporary. In episode 606 I resolved the problem.\" He claimed that on his draft of the storyline he wrote the words \"Baby die\". The plot never came to fruition, as Gibbon was abruptly replaced as the soap's boss and Yallop's plots were scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/soap-operas-producers-aimed-axe-at-poor-acting-1556027.html|title=Soap opera's producers 'aimed axe at poor acting' |newspaper=The Independent| date = 8 October 1992|accessdate=19 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Handbook]]'' by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for roles in ''EastEnders'' is usually done locally, so that children and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> This occurred with Steven's original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: \"Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing her hair back under her hat but lots of [viewers] still spotted it\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven's christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, \"When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn\u2019t recover and I kissed him for it.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nBefore his first screen birthday, Steven was central to storylines surrounding his parents and stepfather Ian, including a special week of off-set episodes filmed in Devon, where Ian discovered that his best friend Simon was Steven's real father and that he had reunited with Cindy. The love triangle between Simon, Cindy and Ian, and the events surrounding Steven's paternity dominated the soap during 1990; it has been described by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the year's \"big story\".<ref name=\"10years\"/> Steven was written out of the serial after actors Nick Berry and Michelle Collins decided to leave the show. His exit aired on 27 December 1990, though in the on-screen events it was Boxing Day, Steven's first birthday. In 1992, Michelle Collins reprised her role of Cindy, and Steven was also reintroduced, played by a different actor, Stuart Stevens. On-screen, Simon abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian traced them to a bedsit and brought them back to Walford, where Steven was brought up as Ian's real son. Steven was written out once again in 1996, when Collins quit for a second time. In the on-screen events, Cindy absconded with Steven and his brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]] following Cindy's failed attempt to have Ian assassinated. Upon his return in 1997 \u2013 where Ian once again regained custody \u2013 Steven's role was recast to another actor, [[Edward Savage (footballer)|Edward Savage]]. As the character aged, his actor was given a more substantial role in the serial, Steven remaining with Ian following the death of his mother, who died in prison during child birth. Savage remained in the role until 2002, when he opted to leave. On-screen, Steven discovered that Ian had been lying about his paternity. He began rebelling, and was found to be the author of several mysterious poison pen letters. When he was caught, he demanded to travel to New Zealand, so he could meet his real father, Simon Wicks. A BBC source commented to the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', \"Regular viewers will know Steven is a deeply troubled boy. But his unmasking as the poison pen author is going to shock everyone on the Square. The lad is almost inviting punishment. It's as if he wants Ian and [his stepmother] [[Laura Beale|Laura]] to wash their hands of him.

The ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' speculated that ''EastEnders'' bosses were hoping to cast an Australian actor to play Steven, to signify that he had been in New Zealand. It was claimed that actors from Australia's long-running soaps, ''[[Neighbours]]'' or ''[[Home and Away]]'', were being considered.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a19045/eastenders-return-for-kathy-beale.html|title= 'EastEnders' return for Kathy Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Daniel Kilkelly| date = 6 February 2005| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> The rumours turned out to be false, and a subsequent rumour in January 2007 predicting that ''[[Footballers' Wives]]''' actor [[Craig Gallivan]] was to play the role, was also quashed.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a42116/footie-wives-actor-tipped-as-new-steven-beale.html|title= Footie Wives actor tipped as new Steven Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Kris Green| date = 25 January 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:Stevenbeale 2007.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Steven Beale as he appeared in 2007]]\nThe character was eventually to make his return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] as part of a storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured to the top of a deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/22/comment.tvandradioarts1|title= For whom the Beale tolls|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author= Anne Pickard | date = 22 September 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy.<ref name=\"ds\"/> [[Aaron Sidwell]] was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him.

Steven's games were uncovered, and during the confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having \"a whiff of [[Bront\u00eb]] about it\", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, \"It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, but I hate those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love \u2013 Ian Beale \u2013 as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show. Soap audiences like continuity. They dip in and out and if they haven't watched for a few weeks, then tune in to find no one they recognise, it can be disconcerting.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/08/mondaymediasection12|title= The art of storytelling|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author=  Stephen Armstrong| date = 8 October 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nMentally ill, Steven was admitted to a psychiatric hospital by Ian. Sidwell has commented on Steven's mental instability: \"He's so unpredictable...you never know what he's going to do next...He'll be normal one minute and he'll be crazy the next. He's kind of the [[Donnie Darko (character)|Donnie Darko]] of ''EastEnders''...that's the kind of person I styled him after...[he is] a similar character...He is always going to be a bit unstable and there will always be danger.

Subsequent plots saw him unsuccessfully attempting to make amends with Ian and Jane for his past wrongdoing. The character also formed a friendship with [[Stacey Slater]] (played by [[Lacey Turner]]), who stopped him from committing suicide in December 2007. In the on-screen events, Steven \u2013 infuriated by Ian's rejection \u2013 soaked himself with petrol and threatened to light himself on fire. In the end, Stacey managed to persuade him not to go through with suicide by showing him that friends can be just as important as family. Despite hostilities from Jane, Steven gradually regained Ian's trust, and in episodes that aired over the Christmas period of 2007, Ian welcomed Steven back into his home as part of the Beale family.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Departure (2008); sexuality and Lucy's disappearance===\nIn February 2008, the BBC announced that Steven was being written out of ''EastEnders'' once again.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20080222_n2.shtml|title= Steven's farewell|publisher=BBC | date = 22 February 2008| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> An ''EastEnders'' spokeswoman revealed: \"[Sidwell]'s contract has run out \u2013 he only came for that length of contract.

The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales' lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out, and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot was described as \"controversial\", and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: \"A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well.\"<ref name=\"chris\" />\n\nA final twist in Steven's story was his involvement in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy ([[Melissa Suffield]]). In episodes that aired in May 2008, it was revealed that Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. \n\nExplaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, \"It's all about Ian again.

An ''EastEnders'' source told ''Digital Spy'': \"Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian.

Sidwell commented, \"Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him.

The problem is ''EastEnders'' is a realistic show, so with Steven being a larger-than-life character it was always going to be hard having him doing the same crazy things day in, day out. I wasn't expecting to stay on the Square forever. It was my first big job out of drama college and I couldn't have asked for a better start in the industry. I've had a great time and the character isn't being killed off, so who knows what might happen a few years down the line.
