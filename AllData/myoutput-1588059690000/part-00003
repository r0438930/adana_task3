Endophytes are ubiquitous and have been found in all species of plants studied to date; however, most of the endophyte/plant relationships are not well understood. Some endophytes may enhance host growth, nutrient acquisition and improve the plant's ability to tolerate abiotic stresses, such as drought, and decrease biotic stresses by enhancing plant resistance to insects, pathogens and [[herbivore]]s.\n\n== History ==\nEndophytes were first described by the German botanist [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link]] in 1809. They were thought to be plant parasitic fungi and they were later termed as \"microzymas\" by the French scientist B\u00e9champ. There was a belief that plants were healthy under sterile conditions and it was not until 1887 that [[Marie Louis Victor Galippe|Victor Galippe]] discovered bacteria normally occurring inside plant tissues.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00050-14|pmid=26136581|title=The Hidden World within Plants: Ecological and Evolutionary Considerations for Defining Functioning of Microbial Endophytes|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|volume=79|issue=3|pages=293\u2013320|year=2015|last1=Hardoim|first1=Pablo R.|last2=Van Overbeek|first2=Leonard S.|last3=Berg|first3=Gabriele|last4=Pirttil\u00e4|first4=Anna Maria|last5=Compant|first5=St\u00e9phane|last6=Campisano|first6=Andrea|last7=D\u00f6ring|first7=Matthias|last8=Sessitsch|first8=Angela|pmc=4488371}}</ref>\n\n== Transmission ==\nEndophytes may be transmitted either vertically (directly from parent to offspring) or horizontally (among individuals).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Suryanarayanan|first=Trichur S.|date=2013-12-01|title=Endophyte research: going beyond isolation and metabolite documentation|journal=Fungal Ecology|volume=6|issue=6|pages=561\u2013568|doi=10.1016/j.funeco.2013.09.007}}</ref> Vertically transmitted fungal endophytes are typically considered [[Cloning|clonal]] and transmit via [[Fungus|fungal]] [[hypha]]e penetrating the embryo within the host's [[seed]]s, while reproduction of the fungi through asexual [[conidia]] or sexual spores leads to horizontal transmission, where endophytes may spread between plants in a population or community.<ref name=\"Tadych 181\u2013201\">{{Cite journal|last=Tadych|first=Mariusz|last2=Bergen|first2=Marshall S.|last3=White|first3=James F.|date=2014-03-01|title=Epichlo\u00eb spp. associated with grasses: new insights on life cycles, dissemination and evolution|url=|journal=Mycologia|language=en|volume=106|issue=2|pages=181\u2013201|doi=10.3852/106.2.181|pmid=24877257}}</ref>\n\n== Symbiosis ==\nMost endophyte-plant relationships are still not well understood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Megan|last2=Glenn|first2=Anthony E.|last3=Kohn|first3=Linda M.|date=2010-09-01|title=Exploring the evolutionary ecology of fungal endophytes in agricultural systems: using functional traits to reveal mechanisms in community processes|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=3|issue=5\u20136|pages=525\u2013537|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00141.x|issn=1752-4571|pmc=3352505|pmid=25567944}}</ref> Endophytes and plants often engage in mutualism, with endophytes primarily aiding in the health and survival of the host plant with issues such as pathogens and disease, water stress, heat stress, nutrient availability and poor soil quality, salinity, and herbivory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hardoim|first=Pablo R.|last2=Overbeek|first2=Leonard S. van|last3=Berg|first3=Gabriele|last4=Pirttil\u00e4|first4=Anna Maria|last5=Compant|first5=St\u00e9phane|last6=Campisano|first6=Andrea|last7=D\u00f6ring|first7=Matthias|last8=Sessitsch|first8=Angela|date=2015-09-01|title=The Hidden World within Plants: Ecological and Evolutionary Considerations for Defining Functioning of Microbial Endophytes|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|language=en|volume=79|issue=3|pages=293\u2013320|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00050-14|issn=1092-2172|pmc=4488371|pmid=26136581}}</ref> In exchange the endophyte receives carbon for energy from the plant host.

They typically colonize plant shoots where they form a systemic intercellular infection. Class 1 endophytes are mainly transmitted from host to host by vertical transmission, in which maternal plants pass fungi on to their offspring through seeds.

They typically colonize plant shoots where they form a systemic intercellular infection. Class 1 endophytes are mainly transmitted from host to host by vertical transmission, in which maternal plants pass fungi on to their offspring through seeds. Class 1 endophytes can further be divided into Types I, II and III. Among these three types of clavicipitaceous endophytes are different interactions with their plant hosts. These interaction range from [[pathogen]]ic to symbiotic and symptomatic to [[asymptomatic]]. Type III clavicipitaceous endophytes grow within their plant host without manifesting symptoms of disease or harming their host.

Endophytes also provide their hosts with an increased resilience to both abiotic and biotic stressors such as drought, poor soils and herbivory. The increased growth and resilience is likely causes by the endophytes ability to improve plant nutrition or secondary metabolite production, as in the case of ''Phoma eupatorii''{{'}}s inhibition of the phytopathogen ''Phytophthora infestans''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Vries|first1=Sophie|last2=von Dahlen|first2=Janina K|last3=Schnake|first3=Anika|last4=Ginschel|first4=Sarah|last5=Schulz|first5=Barbara|last6=Rose|first6=Laura E|title=Broad-spectrum inhibition of Phytophthora infestans by fungal endophytes|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|date=8 March 2018|doi=10.1093/femsec/fiy037|pmid=29528408|pmc=5939626|volume=94|issue=4}}</ref> Endophytes accomplish this by increasing the uptake of valuable land limited nutrients from the soil such as phosphorus and making other plant nutrients available to plants such as [[rock phosphate]] and atmospheric nitrogen which are normally trapped informs that are inaccessible to plants.<ref name=\":72\"/>\n\nMany endophytes protect plants from herbivory from both insects and animals by producing secondary metabolites that are either unappetizing or toxic to the herbivore. Increasingly there has been great importance placed on endophytes that protect valuable crops from invasive insects. One example of an endophyte-plant-insect interaction is located in the New Zealand grasslands, where endophytes, known as AR1 and AR37 are utilized to protect valuable ryegrass from the [[Argentine stem weevil]] but remain palatable to another important food source, livestock.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Le Cocq|first=K |last2=Gurr |first2=SJ |last3=Hirsch |first3=PR |last4=Mauchline |first4=TH |date=2016|title=Exploration of Endophytes for Sustainable Agricultural Intensification|journal=Molecular Plant Pathology|volume=18|issue=3 |pages=469\u2013473|doi=10.1111/mpp.12483|pmid=27559722 |pmc=5347965 }}</ref>\n\nThere are several endophytes that have been discovered that exhibit insecticidal properties. One such endophyte comes from the ''Nodulisporium sp''. which was first harvested from the plant ''[[Bontia daphnoides]]''. Indole [[diterpene]]s, known as nodulisporic acids, have been harvested from this endophyte which have effective insecticidal properties against the blowfly larvae.<ref name=\":63\"/>\n\nThere are many obstacles to successfully implementing the use of endophytes in agriculture. Despite the many known benefits that endophytes may confer to their plant hosts, [[Conventional agriculture|conventional agricultural]] practices continue to take priority. Current agriculture relies heavily on fungicides and high levels of chemical fertilizers. The use of fungicides has a negative effect on endophytic fungi and fertilizers reduce a plant's dependence on its endophytic symbiont.<ref name=\":4\" /> Despite this, the interest and use of bio-insecticides and using endophytes to aid in plant growth is increasing as organic and [[sustainable agriculture]] is considered more important. As humans become more aware of the damage that synthetic insecticides cause to the environment and beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies biological insecticides may become more important to the agricultural industry.<ref name=\":63\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Biofertilizer]]\n* [[List of endophytes]]\n* [[Plant use of endophytic fungi in defense]]\n* [[Arbuscular mycorrhiza]]\n* [[Mycorrhiza]]\n* [[Rhizobia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n[[Category:Microbial growth and nutrition]]\n[[Category:Fungus ecology]]\n[[Category:Bacteriology]]\n[[Category:Symbiosis]]\n", "name_user": "\u7531\u7406", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDrug discovery:italicizing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophyte"}
