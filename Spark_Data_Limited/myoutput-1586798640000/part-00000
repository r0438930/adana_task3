An auxiliary schooner, she was acquired by the Navy in 1940, and assigned to the [[United States Naval Academy]] where she served in a noncommissioned status through 1962.\n\n==Ship History==\n\nAn Act of Congress of 6 June 1940 authorized the Secretary of the Navy to accept without expense to the Government the 88-foot 2-masted schooner FREEDOM and her equipment as a gift from her owner, Sterling Morton, to the Naval Academy. She had been designed by John G. Alden and built at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The yacht was delivered to the Navy on 10 Sep 40 at the shipyard of [[Henry B. Nevins, Incorporated|Henry B. Nevins, Inc.]], [[City Island, Bronx]] and arrived at the Naval Academy two days later. On 24 Oct 40 CNO assigned her the class designation \"Unclassified\" and directed that her name be retained. On 8 Jan 41 SecNav approved the adoption by BuShips of the symbol IX, already in use in the Navy Filing Manual, for vessels designated \"Unclassified,\" and BuShips assigned her the hull designation IX-43. She proved to be an excellent boat for ocean cruising and for teaching midshipmen how to handle a large sailing rig. She was sold in 1968 following the investigation of the faltering sailing program at the Naval Academy by the Fales Committee in the mid-1960s. Purchased by the Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship in Annapolis, Md., she became the miscellaneous function (training) vessel FREEDOM and was still in service in 1972.\n\n==References==\n:{{DANFS}}\n\n\n[[Category:Unclassified miscellaneous vessels of the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:United States Naval Academy]]\n[[Category:Schooners of the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:Individual yachts]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|An unclassified miscellaneous vessel of the US Navy in service 1940-42}}\n{{otherships|USS Freedom}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin |infobox caption=''USS Freedom''}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=\n|Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox Ship Career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=United States\n|Ship flag={{USN flag|1962}}\n|Ship name= USS Freedom\n|Ship namesake=\n|Ship owner= United States \n|Ship operator= United States Navy\n|Ship registry= IX-43\n|Ship route=\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship awarded=\n|Ship builder= Great Lakes Boat Building Co. \n|Ship original cost=\n|Ship yard number=\n|Ship way number=\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=\n|Ship sponsor=\n|Ship christened=\n|Ship completed=\n|Ship acquired=10 September 1940\n|Ship commissioned=\n|Ship recommissioned=\n|Ship decommissioned=\n|Ship maiden voyage= \n|Ship in service= 10 September 1940\n|Ship out of service= 1962\n|Ship renamed=\n|Ship reclassified=\n|Ship refit=\n|Ship struck=\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship homeport=\n|Ship identification=\n|Ship motto=\n|Ship nickname=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship honors=\n|Ship captured=\n|Ship fate= unknown\n|Ship status=placed out of Naval Register and Struck, date unknown\n|Ship notes= Ship Radio Callsign: NACY\n|Ship badge=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship type= Two Masted Auxiliary Schooner\n|Ship tonnage=\n|Ship displacement= 60 light tons, 72 gross tons\n|Ship tons burthen=\n|Ship length= 88 Feet 8 Inches\n|Ship beam= 20 Feet\n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship depth=\n|Ship hold depth=\n|Ship decks=\n|Ship deck clearance=\n|Ship ramps=\n|Ship ice class=\n|Ship power=\n|Ship propulsion= Hall Scott Gasoline auxiliary engine single propeller,175 shp\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship range=\n|Ship endurance=\n|Ship test depth=\n|Ship boats=\n|Ship capacity=\n|Ship troops=\n|Ship complement=\n|Ship crew=\n|Ship time to activate=\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=\n|Ship armour=\n|Ship armor=none\n|Ship aircraft=none\n|Ship aircraft facilities=none\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\n'''''Freedom'' (IX-43)''', an [[unclassified miscellaneous vessel]], was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] of that name.
