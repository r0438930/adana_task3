Constantine studied in England. Alec's mother, Hulda Prokopp, could trace her origins back to [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] (now part of Germany). It was not through his mother's kinships that Issigonis was not a [[first uncle once removed]] to [[BMW]] (and more briefly [[Volkswagen]]) director [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bardsley, Gillian|title=Issigonis: The Official Biography|publisher=Icon Books|isbn=1-84046-687-1}}</ref>\n\nBecause Alec and his sister were Turkish subjects, they were evacuated to Malta by [[Royal Marines|British Royal Marines]] in September 1922, ahead of the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] and the Turkish capture of Smyrna at the end of the [[Greco-Russian War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. Following the death of his father in 1922, Alec and his mother moved to the UK in 1923. Alec studied engineering at [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]] in London. He failed his mathematics exams three times and subsequently called [[pure mathematics]] 'the enemy of every creative genius'.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} After [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]], Alec decided to enter the [[University of London External Programme]] to complete his university education.\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Issigonis Lightweight Special (1938).ogg\n |title        =1938 Issigonis Lightweight Special at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009\n |type         =sound\n<!-- |style        =float:left;clear:none -->\n}}\nIssigonis went into the motor industry as an engineer and designer working for [[Humber Limited|Humber]] and competed successfully in motor racing during the 1930s and 1940s.  \nStarting around 1930, he raced a supercharged \"Ulster\" [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]], later fitting it with a front axle of his own design, leading to employment at [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]]. This greatly modified machine was replaced with a radical special completed in 1939, constructed of plywood laminated in aluminium sheeting. The suspension was also of advanced design, with trailing arm front suspension attached to a steel cross-member, and swing axle rear, all with rubber springs made of catapult elastic. This car was remarkably light, weighing 587&nbsp;lb, of which the engine contributed 252&nbsp;lb. By the time the chassis had been completed (hard labour\u2014it was all done by hand, no power tools), Issigonis had moved to [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]], but Austin supplied a \"works\" specification supercharged side-valve engine. Issigonis usually won, even when entered in the 1100cc class if there was no 750cc category. Most events entered were sprints, but he also raced at circuits.\n\nIn 1936, he moved to Morris Motors Limited at Cowley working on an independent front suspension system for the [[Morris 10]]. The war prevented this design from going into production but it was later used on the [[MG Y-type]]. He worked on various projects for Morris through the war and towards its end started work on an advanced post war car codenamed ''Mosquito'' that became the [[Morris Minor]], which was produced from 1948 until 1971. In 1952, just as BMC was formed by the merger of Morris and Austin, he moved to [[Alvis Cars]] where he designed an advanced saloon with all-aluminium V-8 engine, and experimented with interconnected [[independent suspension]] systems. This prototype was never manufactured because its cost was beyond Alvis's resources.\n\nAt the end of 1955, Issigonis was recruited back into BMC, this time into the Austin plant at Longbridge, by its chairman [[Leonard Lord|Sir Leonard Lord]], to design a new model family of three cars. The XC (experimental car) code names assigned for the new cars were ''XC/9001'', for a large comfortable car, ''XC/9002'', for a medium-sized family car, and ''XC/9003'', for a small town car. During 1956 Issigonis concentrated on the larger two cars, producing several prototypes for testing.\n\nHowever, at the end of 1956, following fuel rationing brought about by the [[Suez Crisis]], Issigonis was ordered by Lord to bring the smaller car, ''XC/9003'', to production as quickly as possible. By early 1957, prototypes were running, and by mid-1957 the project was given an official drawing office project number (''ADO15'') so that the thousands of drawings required for production could be produced. In August 1959 the car was launched as the Morris Mini Minor and the Austin Seven, which soon became known as the Austin Mini. In later years, the car would become known simply as the ''[[Mini]]''. Due to time pressures, the interconnected suspension system that Issigonis had planned for the car was replaced by an equally novel, but cruder, rubber cone system designed by [[Alex Moulton]]. The Mini went on to become the best selling British car in history with a production run of 5.3&nbsp;million cars. This ground-breaking design, with its [[front wheel drive]], [[transverse engine]], sump gearbox, 10-inch wheels, and phenomenal space efficiency, was still being manufactured in 2000 and has been the inspiration for almost all small front-wheel drive cars produced since the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, with the Mini gaining popularity, Issigonis was promoted to Technical Director of BMC. He continued to be responsible for his original ''XC'' projects.  ''XC/9002'' became ''ADO16'' and was launched as the [[Morris 1100]] with the [[Hydrolastic]] interconnected suspension system in August 1962.  ''XC/9001'' became ''ADO17'' and was launched, also with the Hydrolastic suspension system, as the [[Austin 1800]] in October 1964.The same principle was carried over for his next production car the [[Austin Maxi]], However, by then he had become more aware of the cost considerations of vehicle manufacture and in service warranty costs which were crippling BMC. It certainly appeared by the Maxi development era that Issigonis wanted to \"do his own thing\" as cost cutting and development costs spiraled. He would instead research work on his [[Mini]] replacement the 9X with its compact [[transverse engine]].\nWith the creation of [[British Leyland]] in 1969, new chairman [[Lord Stokes]] quickly sidelined Issigonis and made him into what was termed \"Special Developments Director\", replacing him with Harry Webster as the new Technical Director (Small/Medium cars). Stokes was heard on his appointment to say: \"We'll sharp sort this bloke Issigonis out!\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIssigonis was nicknamed \"the Greek god\" by his contemporaries.<ref

Constantine studied in England. Alec's mother, Hulda Prokopp, could trace her origins back to [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] (now part of Germany). It was through his mother's kinships that Issigonis was a [[first cousin once removed]] to [[BMW]] (and more briefly [[Volkswagen]]) director [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bardsley, Gillian|title=Issigonis: The Official Biography|publisher=Icon Books|isbn=1-84046-687-1}}</ref>\n\nBecause Alec and his parents were British subjects, they were evacuated to Malta by [[Royal Marines|British Royal Marines]] in September 1922, ahead of the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] and the Turkish capture of Smyrna at the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. Following the death of his father in 1922, Alec and his mother moved to the UK in 1923. Alec studied engineering at [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]] in London. He failed his mathematics exams three times and subsequently called [[pure mathematics]] 'the enemy of every creative genius'.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} After [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]], Alec decided to enter the [[University of London External Programme]] to complete his university education.\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Issigonis Lightweight Special (1938).ogg\n |title        =1938 Issigonis Lightweight Special at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009\n |type         =sound\n<!-- |style        =float:left;clear:none -->\n}}\nIssigonis went into the motor industry as an engineer and designer working for [[Humber Limited|Humber]] and competed successfully in motor racing during the 1930s and 1940s.  \nStarting around 1930, he raced a supercharged \"Ulster\" [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]], later fitting it with a front axle of his own design, leading to employment at [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]]. This greatly modified machine was replaced with a radical special completed in 1939, constructed of plywood laminated in aluminium sheeting. The suspension was also of advanced design, with trailing arm front suspension attached to a steel cross-member, and swing axle rear, all with rubber springs made of catapult elastic. This car was remarkably light, weighing 587&nbsp;lb, of which the engine contributed 252&nbsp;lb. By the time the chassis had been completed (hard labour\u2014it was all done by hand, no power tools), Issigonis had moved to [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]], but Austin supplied a \"works\" specification supercharged side-valve engine. Issigonis usually won, even when entered in the 1100cc class if there was no 750cc category. Most events entered were sprints, but he also raced at circuits.\n\nIn 1936, he moved to Morris Motors Limited at Cowley working on an independent front suspension system for the [[Morris 10]]. The war prevented this design from going into production but it was later used on the [[MG Y-type]]. He worked on various projects for Morris through the war and towards its end started work on an advanced post war car codenamed ''Mosquito'' that became the [[Morris Minor]], which was produced from 1948 until 1971. In 1952, just as BMC was formed by the merger of Morris and Austin, he moved to [[Alvis Cars]] where he designed an advanced saloon with all-aluminium V-8 engine, and experimented with interconnected [[independent suspension]] systems. This prototype was never manufactured because its cost was beyond Alvis's resources.\n\nAt the end of 1955, Issigonis was recruited back into BMC, this time into the Austin plant at Longbridge, by its chairman [[Leonard Lord|Sir Leonard Lord]], to design a new model family of three cars. The XC (experimental car) code names assigned for the new cars were ''XC/9001'', for a large comfortable car, ''XC/9002'', for a medium-sized family car, and ''XC/9003'', for a small town car. During 1956 Issigonis concentrated on the larger two cars, producing several prototypes for testing.\n\nHowever, at the end of 1956, following fuel rationing brought about by the [[Suez Crisis]], Issigonis was ordered by Lord to bring the smaller car, ''XC/9003'', to production as quickly as possible. By early 1957, prototypes were running, and by mid-1957 the project was given an official drawing office project number (''ADO15'') so that the thousands of drawings required for production could be produced. In August 1959 the car was launched as the Morris Mini Minor and the Austin Seven, which soon became known as the Austin Mini. In later years, the car would become known simply as the ''[[Mini]]''. Due to time pressures, the interconnected suspension system that Issigonis had planned for the car was replaced by an equally novel, but cruder, rubber cone system designed by [[Alex Moulton]]. The Mini went on to become the best selling British car in history with a production run of 5.3&nbsp;million cars. This ground-breaking design, with its [[front wheel drive]], [[transverse engine]], sump gearbox, 10-inch wheels, and phenomenal space efficiency, was still being manufactured in 2000 and has been the inspiration for almost all small front-wheel drive cars produced since the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, with the Mini gaining popularity, Issigonis was promoted to Technical Director of BMC. He continued to be responsible for his original ''XC'' projects.  ''XC/9002'' became ''ADO16'' and was launched as the [[Morris 1100]] with the [[Hydrolastic]] interconnected suspension system in August 1962.  ''XC/9001'' became ''ADO17'' and was launched, also with the Hydrolastic suspension system, as the [[Austin 1800]] in October 1964.The same principle was carried over for his next production car the [[Austin Maxi]], However, by then he had become more aware of the cost considerations of vehicle manufacture and in service warranty costs which were crippling BMC. It certainly appeared by the Maxi development era that Issigonis wanted to \"do his own thing\" as cost cutting and development costs spiraled. He would instead research work on his [[Mini]] replacement the 9X with its compact [[transverse engine]].\nWith the creation of [[British Leyland]] in 1969, new chairman [[Lord Stokes]] quickly sidelined Issigonis and made him into what was termed \"Special Developments Director\", replacing him with Harry Webster as the new Technical Director (Small/Medium cars). Stokes was heard on his appointment to say: \"We'll sharp sort this bloke Issigonis out!\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIssigonis was nicknamed \"the Greek god\" by his contemporaries.<ref
