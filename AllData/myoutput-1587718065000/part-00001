It is part of the [[Olympus OM system]].\n\n==History==\nThe first model was presented at [[photokina 1972|photokina]] in [[Cologne]] in 1972 and was called the '''Olympus M-1'''. Thirteen years earlier, the release of the [[Nikon F]] had made the 35&nbsp;mm SLR the standard choice for professionals accustomed to [[Leica Camera|Leica]] and other rangefinders, but it had driven the market towards heavy and bulky cameras. The Olympus M-1 changed this and with it began a reduction of size, weight and noise of the 35&nbsp;mm SLRs. It was designed by a team led by [[Yoshihisa Maitani]], who had already created the [[Olympus Pen|Pen]] and [[Olympus Pen F|Pen F]] cameras, noted for their compactness.\n\n[[File:Olympus om1 jm2.jpg|left|thumb|Olympus OM-1n with 50mm / f1.8 lens]]\nSince Leica's flagship rangefinder cameras are known as the [[Leica M mount|M Series]], Leica complained about the name of the M-1, forcing Olympus to rename it as the OM-1 to further clarify between the brands.  Because of this, today bodies and lenses with the original M name are rare (52000 bodies were made according to Olympus) and sought after by collectors.\n\nThe OM-1 is an all-mechanical SLR. It has a large viewfinder with interchangeable screens but a fixed prism. It also has a [[Through-the-lens metering|through-the-lens exposure meter]] controlling a needle visible in the viewfinder. It has a compact body, essentially retained on later models. The shutter speed dial is located around the lens mount, which allows photographers to keep the camera at the eye between shots more easily than SLRs with the dial located on the top plate.\n\n[[File:24mmPCleft.jpg|thumb|Olympus OM-1n with 24mm Zuiko-Shift lens]]\nOriginally, the bottom plate needed to be modified to mount a motor drive on the OM-1. In 1974, Olympus launched the '''OM-1MD''' (MD standing for Motor Drive), to which a motor drive can be attached without need for modification. This new version has a small plate marked 'MD' on the front, and a small slot with a circular cover on the underside that covers the motor drive coupling.\n\nThe '''OM-1n''' is similar to the OM-1MD, with a redesigned film advance lever, a flash ready/sufficient flash LED in the viewfinder, and automatic [[flash synchronization]] (X-sync), regardless of the position of the FP/X switch when used with a T-series flash unit mounted on Flash Shoe 4.\n\nProfessional photographers who used the OM-1 include [[Patrick Lichfield]], [[Jane Bown]], [[David Bailey]], [[Josef Koudelka]], [[Chris Bonnington]], and [[Kate Garner]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/olympusom1n2/om1/ |title= Modern Classic SLRs Series: Olympus OM-1(n) |first= Leo |last= Foo |year= 2000 |work= Photography in Malaysia |accessdate= 16 December 2005 }}\n* {{cite web |url= http://photographic.co.nz/cameraworks/cameras/om1_shutter/|title= Olympus OM-1 shutter|first= Robert Ian |last= Axford |work= Robert Ian Axford's Camera-Works |accessdate= 16 December 2005}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Olympus OM-1}}\n* [http://www.olympus-global.com/en/corc/history/camera/om/ Olympus History : OM Series] Olympus Corporation History Page.\n* [http://www.arransalerno.com/olympus-m-1/ Olympus M-1] User review and further details.\n\n{{From Camerapedia|Olympus_OM-1/2/3/4|26 May 2006}}\n{{Olympus OM System}}\n\n[[Category:Olympus SLR cameras|OM-1]]\n[[Category:Cameras introduced in 1972]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2012}}\n{{Infobox camera\n | maker       = [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus Optical Co., Ltd]]\n | camera_name = Olympus OM-1\n | image  = Olympus OM-1.jpg\n | caption     = OM-1MD with 50&nbsp;mm f/1.8 lens\n | type        = [[single-lens reflex|SLR]]\n | recording_medium = [[135 film]]\n | lens_mount  = [[Olympus OM system|Olympus OM mount]]\n | lens        = \n | focus       = Manual focus\n | exposure    = Manual\n | shutterRange = 1&nbsp;s \u2013 1/1000&nbsp;s; Bulb\n | flash       = [[Hot shoe]]\n | frame-rate  = manually wound\n | dimensions  = 136 \u00d7 83 \u00d7 50&nbsp;mm\n | weight      = {{convert|510|g|abbr=on}}\n | made_in     = \n | footnotes   = <ref name=\"mediajoy_om-1\">{{cite web|title=Olympus OM-1|url=http://www.mediajoy.com/en/cla_came/olympus-om1/index.html|work=Guide to Classic Cameras|publisher=mediajoy|accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ting|first=Ed|title=Olympus OM1 and OM2 Overview|url=http://www.scopereviews.com/om.html|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=23 June 2008}}</ref> \n}}\nThe '''Olympus OM-1''' is a manually operated [[35mm format|35mm]] [[single-lens reflex]] [[camera]].
