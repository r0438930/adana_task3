He currently works as a [[sports agent]].\n\nFor most of his career, Sheffield played [[right fielder|right field]], though he has also played [[Left fielder|left field]], [[third base]], [[shortstop]], and a handful of games at [[first baseman|first base]]. He played for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[Florida Marlins]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and the [[New York Mets]]. Sheffield was a first-round pick of the Brewers, who selected him sixth overall in the {{baseball year|1986}} amateur draft after a standout prep career at [[Hillsborough High School (Florida)|Hillsborough High School]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He bats and throws right-handed.\n\nSheffield hit his 500th home run on April 17, 2009.  As of his last game, Sheffield ranked second among all active players in [[base on balls|walks]] (1,475), third in [[run (baseball)|runs]] (1,636), fourth in [[Run batted in|RBIs]] (1,676), fifth in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (2,689) and [[home run]]s (509), and sixth in [[hit by pitch]]es (135).\n\nSheffield's batting swing was an exemplary mix of savage speed and pinpoint control.  Despite his high home run total, Sheffield only topped 80 strikeouts twice in 22 seasons, while finishing his career among the all-time top 20 walks leaders.  Because of his combination of skill, sportswriter [[Joe Posnanski]] wrote, \"I can't imagine there has ever been a scarier hitter to face.\"  His first manager [[Tom Trebelhorn]] said, \"Gary can turn on a 38-caliber bullet.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joeposnanski.substack.com/p/ballot-12-gary-sheffield|title=Ballot 12: Gary Sheffield|last=Posnanski|first=Joe|website=joeposnanski.substack.com|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\nHe is the nephew of [[Dwight Gooden]].

They played baseball frequently and Sheffield learned how to hit a [[fastball]] from Gooden,<ref name=\"Jock\"/> who is only four years older than he is. Sheffield has publicly said that his grandfather had a significant positive impact on his life, influencing him as a person and as an athlete.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nSheffield was a good hitter in the Little Leagues. However, Sheffield had problems with his temper and attitude, which would continue in the Major Leagues. Once, when he was late to practice, his coach benched him and Sheffield picked up a bat and chased the coach all over the field, resulting in him being kicked off the team for a year.<ref name=\"Jock\"/> When Sheffield was eleven, he was selected to the Belmont Heights Little League All-Stars, which included future [[Chicago Cubs]] #1 pick Ty Griffin, future Major Leaguer [[Derek Bell (baseball)|Derek Bell]], and other future [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] players.<ref name=\"Jock\"/> The team made it to the finals of the [[1980 Little League World Series]] but lost to [[Taiwan national baseball team|Taiwan]] 4\u20133. He set a record for doubles that would be broken in [[2012 Little League World Series|2012]] by Bradley Smith.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===High school===\n\nIn 1983, Sheffield made the [[Hillsborough High School (Florida)|Hillsborough High School]] varsity baseball team. During his junior year, he bulked up to 175 pounds and was a [[pitcher]] and [[third baseman]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/> During his senior year, his fastball reached the upper 80's and he frequently showed home run power. As a batter, Sheffield hit .500 and 15 [[home run]]s, in only 62 official [[at-bats]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/> At the end of the season he was named the [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade National Player of the Year]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n==Professional baseball career==\n[[File:Gary Sheffield - El Paso Diablos - 1988.jpg|thumb|Sheffield in 1988]]\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAfter high school, the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] drafted Sheffield with the sixth pick of the first round of the [[1986 Major League Baseball draft|1986 MLB draft]].<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sheffga01.shtml Baseball-Reference.com Bio]</ref> Sheffield later said that if he had not been drafted in the first round, he probably would have played [[college baseball]] for the [[Miami Hurricanes baseball|Miami Hurricanes]].<ref name=\"streetsmarts\">{{cite news|last1=Gammons|first1=Peter|title=Street Smarts|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/04/05/119664/street-smarts-gary-sheffield-learned-his-baseball-and-more-in-tampas-belmont-heights|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=April 5, 1989}}</ref> After being drafted he was shipped to [[Helena Brewers|Helena]] of the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]], where he had a .365 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and 71 RBIs in 57 games. The only question was what [[Baseball positions|position]] he would play. He was slotted at shortstop, but struggled at the position, committing many [[error (baseball)|errors]] and wild throws. In 1987, he was assigned to [[Stockton Ports|Stockton]] of the [[Class A (baseball)|Class-A]] [[California League]], where his defense improved and he produced at the plate. His batting average went below .300, but he led the league in RBIs with 103, and at the end of the year he was voted the Brewers' best prospect. In his third season, he went from Double-A to the majors. In 134 games for the [[El Paso Diablos]] and [[Denver]], he batted .327 with 28 homers and 118 RBIs and was considered ready for the majors.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nSheffield was called up from the minors when rosters were expanded in September and made his major league debut on September 3, 1988. As a teenager, he got off to a fast start, with his first career hit being a home run off [[Mark Langston]], though Sheffield finished the season with a .238 batting average and four home runs in 24 games. After a decline in play and several injuries, he found himself competing with [[Bill Spiers]] in a race for starting shortstop. After this, he was moved to third base and criticized the team, saying it was a black and white issue.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DF1330F93BA15756C0A966958260Sheffield Is Older and Better]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> At the end of the 1989 season, he batted .247 with five home runs and 32 RBIs. In 1990, he worked under [[Don Baylor]], who had been hired as their [[hitting coach]]. He finished the season batting .294, with 10 home runs. While his playing improved, there were issues with Sheffield in the clubhouse, and went as far as accusing the organization of being racist after keeping him at third instead of playing him at shortstop where the white Spiers played.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=alipour/070315&sportCat=mlb Espn.com Interview]</ref> In his final season with the Brewers, he injured his wrist, thumb, and shoulder, playing in only 50 games.<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===San Diego Padres===\nAfter four seasons in Milwaukee, the Brewers traded Sheffield to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Ricky Bones]], [[Jos\u00e9 Valentin]], and [[Matt Mieske]] on March 26, 1992. Sheffield faced his uncle [[Dwight Gooden]] for the first time in a Major League game on May 12, 1992, getting a hit in three at-bats. In his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] season, he contended for the [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] for much of the year; while he missed out on the home run (33, two fewer than the leader, teammate [[Fred McGriff]]) and RBIs (100, nine fewer than leader [[Darren Daulton]]) titles, he won the [[National League]] batting title (the only one of the nine in Padre history not won by [[Tony Gwynn]]) with a .330 average.\n\nIn 1993, he started the season by hitting 10 home runs and batting .295 and was traded in midseason to the [[Florida Marlins]].\n\n===Florida Marlins===\nOn June 24, 1993, he was traded, with [[Rich Rodriguez (baseball)|Rich Rodriguez]], to the [[Florida Marlins]] for [[Trevor Hoffman]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Berumen]]. He finished the season hitting 10 home runs, batting .292 and knocking in 37 runs while with the Marlins, and was the starting third baseman for the NL in the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. At the end of the season, the Marlins gave him a four-year deal that made him the highest-paid player at third base.<ref>[http://www.futilityinfielder.com/blog/2004/08/gary-sheffield-reconsidered-part-i.shtmlGary Sheffield, Reconsidered \u2013 Part I]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> During the 1994 season, the Marlins moved him from third base to right field, where he showed great success with an impressive arm. Sheffield hit 112 home runs with the Marlins from 1994 to 1998, including 42 in 1996, making the All-Star Game in 1996, and leading them to victory in the [[1997 World Series]] against the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in 1998 because the Marlins allegedly could not afford a contract extension and because the Dodgers' parent company at the time, [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], was looking to secure a television contract with the Marlins in exchange for trading popular Dodger [[Mike Piazza]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nOn May 14, 1998, he was traded along with [[Manuel Barrios]], [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]], [[Bobby Bonilla]], and [[Jim Eisenreich]] to the Los Angeles Dodgers for [[Mike Piazza]] and [[Todd Zeile]]. Sheffield finished the season with the Dodgers batting .316 and hitting 16 homers while driving in 57 runs. In 3\u00bd seasons with the Dodgers, he hit 129 home runs and drove in 367 runs. He made three All-Star games while playing with the Dodgers and had become one of the best outfielders in the game. But during the offseason, he began lobbying for a trade because he thought the Dodgers were spending their money stupidly and sliding in the wrong direction, and publicly criticized coaches and teammates.<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===Atlanta Braves===\nOn January 15, 2002, Sheffield was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for [[Brian Jordan]], [[Odalis P\u00e9rez]], and [[Andrew Brown (pitcher)|Andrew Brown]]. He spent two seasons with the Braves hitting 64 home runs and knocking in 216 RBIs including 132 in 2003. After two seasons with the Braves, he became a [[free agent]] for the first time in his long career on October 27, 2003.\n\n===New York Yankees===\nOn December 19, 2003, after negotiations between Sheffield and [[George Steinbrenner]], a contract was agreed upon with the [[New York Yankees]] worth $39 million over three years. This deal included $13.5 million in deferred money and a $13 million team option for 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1688518 |title=Sheff prepared for Boss to lean on him |accessdate=August 6, 2009|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 17, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> He joined a lineup that included [[Derek Jeter]], [[Jason Giambi]] and the newly acquired [[Alex Rodriguez]]. In his first season with the Yankees, Sheffield started slowly, but finished the season with 36 home runs, 121 RBIs, and a .290 batting average, helping him finish second in the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|MVP]] voting behind [[Vladimir Guerrero]]. On July 27 Sheffield hit his 400th career homerun off of [[Micheal Nakamura]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in the top of the 9th inning. In his second season with the Yankees, he continued to play well, hitting another 34 home runs and driving in 123 runs. Sheffield started the 2006 season on pace for a .300 batting average and 30 homers, before he collided with [[Shea Hillenbrand]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on April 29, 2006. He tried to play despite the injury, but ultimately needed wrist surgery. Sheffield did not return until late September. He had lost his right field job to [[Bobby Abreu]], whom the Yankees had acquired in a trade deadline transaction. This forced Sheffield to play first base for the first time in his MLB career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sheffga01.shtml|title=Gary Sheffield Stats|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> At the end of the 2006 season, the Yankees picked up Sheffield's 2007 option and traded him to the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\n[[File:Sheffield BP.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sheffield (right) with the Tigers in {{baseball year|2007}}.]]\nOn November 10, 2006, he was traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for minor league pitchers [[Humberto S\u00e1nchez]], [[Kevin Whelan]], and [[Anthony Claggett]].

Baseball]] [[outfielder]] who played with eight teams from 1988 to 2009. He currently works as a [[sports agent]].\n\nFor most of his career, Sheffield played [[right fielder|right field]], though he has also played [[Left fielder|left field]], [[third base]], [[shortstop]], and a handful of games at [[first baseman|first base]]. He played for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[Florida Marlins]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and the [[New York Mets]]. Sheffield was a first-round pick of the Brewers, who selected him sixth overall in the {{baseball year|1986}} amateur draft after a standout prep career at [[Hillsborough High School (Florida)|Hillsborough High School]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He bats and throws right-handed.\n\nSheffield hit his 500th home run on April 17, 2009.  As of his last game, Sheffield ranked second among all active players in [[base on balls|walks]] (1,475), third in [[run (baseball)|runs]] (1,636), fourth in [[Run batted in|RBIs]] (1,676), fifth in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (2,689) and [[home run]]s (509), and sixth in [[hit by pitch]]es (135).\n\nSheffield's batting swing was an exemplary mix of savage speed and pinpoint control.  Despite his high home run total, Sheffield only topped 80 strikeouts twice in 22 seasons, while finishing his career among the all-time top 20 walks leaders.  Because of his combination of skill, sportswriter [[Joe Posnanski]] wrote, \"I can't imagine there has ever been a scarier hitter to face.\"  His first manager [[Tom Trebelhorn]] said, \"Gary can turn on a 38-caliber bullet.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joeposnanski.substack.com/p/ballot-12-gary-sheffield|title=Ballot 12: Gary Sheffield|last=Posnanski|first=Joe|website=joeposnanski.substack.com|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\nHe is the nephew of [[Dwight Gooden]].

His batting average went below .300, but he led the league in RBIs with 103, and at the end of the year he was voted the Brewers' best prospect. In his third season, he went from Double-A to the majors. In 134 games for the [[El Paso Diablos]] and [[Denver]], he batted .327 with 28 homers and 118 RBIs and was considered ready for the majors.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nSheffield was called up from the minors when rosters were expanded in September and made his major league debut on September 3, 1988. As a teenager, he got off to a fast start, with his first career hit being a home run off [[Mark Langston]], though Sheffield finished the season with a .238 batting average and four home runs in 24 games. After a decline in play and several injuries, he found himself competing with [[Bill Spiers]] in a race for starting shortstop. After this, he was moved to third base and criticized the team, saying it was a black and white issue.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DF1330F93BA15756C0A966958260Sheffield Is Older and Better]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> At the end of the 1989 season, he batted .247 with five home runs and 32 RBIs. In 1990, he worked under [[Don Baylor]], who had been hired as their [[hitting coach]]. He finished the season batting .294, with 10 home runs. While his playing improved, there were issues with Sheffield in the clubhouse, and went as far as accusing the organization of being racist after keeping him at third instead of playing him at shortstop where the white Spiers played.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=alipour/070315&sportCat=mlb Espn.com Interview]</ref> In his final season with the Brewers, he injured his wrist, thumb, and shoulder, playing in only 50 games.<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===San Diego Padres===\nAfter four seasons in Milwaukee, the Brewers traded Sheffield to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Ricky Bones]], [[Jos\u00e9 Valentin]], and [[Matt Mieske]] on March 26, 1992. Sheffield faced his uncle [[Dwight Gooden]] for the first time in a Major League game on May 12, 1992, getting a hit in three at-bats. In his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] season, he contended for the [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] for much of the year; while he missed out on the home run (33, two fewer than the leader, teammate [[Fred McGriff]]) and RBIs (100, nine fewer than leader [[Darren Daulton]]) titles, he won the [[National League]] batting title (the only one of the nine in Padre history not won by [[Tony Gwynn]]) with a .330 average.\n\nIn 1993, he started the season by hitting 10 home runs and batting .295 and was traded in midseason to the [[Florida Marlins]].\n\n===Florida Marlins===\nOn June 24, 1993, he was traded, with [[Rich Rodriguez (baseball)|Rich Rodriguez]], to the [[Florida Marlins]] for [[Trevor Hoffman]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Berumen]]. He finished the season hitting 10 home runs, batting .292 and knocking in 37 runs while with the Marlins, and was the starting third baseman for the NL in the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. At the end of the season, the Marlins gave him a four-year deal that made him the highest-paid player at third base.<ref>[http://www.futilityinfielder.com/blog/2004/08/gary-sheffield-reconsidered-part-i.shtmlGary Sheffield, Reconsidered \u2013 Part I]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> During the 1994 season, the Marlins moved him from third base to right field, where he showed great success with an impressive arm. Sheffield hit 112 home runs with the Marlins from 1994 to 1998, including 42 in 1996, making the All-Star Game in 1996, and leading them to victory in the [[1997 World Series]] against the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in 1998 because the Marlins allegedly could not afford a contract extension and because the Dodgers' parent company at the time, [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], was looking to secure a television contract with the Marlins in exchange for trading popular Dodger [[Mike Piazza]].<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nOn May 14, 1998, he was traded along with [[Manuel Barrios]], [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]], [[Bobby Bonilla]], and [[Jim Eisenreich]] to the Los Angeles Dodgers for [[Mike Piazza]] and [[Todd Zeile]]. Sheffield finished the season with the Dodgers batting .316 and hitting 16 homers while driving in 57 runs. In 3\u00bd seasons with the Dodgers, he hit 129 home runs and drove in 367 runs. He made three All-Star games while playing with the Dodgers and had become one of the best outfielders in the game. But during the offseason, he began lobbying for a trade because he thought the Dodgers were spending their money stupidly and sliding in the wrong direction, and publicly criticized coaches and teammates.<ref name=\"Jock\"/>\n\n===Atlanta Braves===\nOn January 15, 2002, Sheffield was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for [[Brian Jordan]], [[Odalis P\u00e9rez]], and [[Andrew Brown (pitcher)|Andrew Brown]]. He spent two seasons with the Braves hitting 64 home runs and knocking in 216 RBIs including 132 in 2003. After two seasons with the Braves, he became a [[free agent]] for the first time in his long career on October 27, 2003.\n\n===New York Yankees===\nOn December 19, 2003, after negotiations between Sheffield and [[George Steinbrenner]], a contract was agreed upon with the [[New York Yankees]] worth $39 million over three years. This deal included $13.5 million in deferred money and a $13 million team option for 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1688518 |title=Sheff prepared for Boss to lean on him |accessdate=August 6, 2009|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 17, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> He joined a lineup that included [[Derek Jeter]], [[Jason Giambi]] and the newly acquired [[Alex Rodriguez]]. In his first season with the Yankees, Sheffield started slowly, but finished the season with 36 home runs, 121 RBIs, and a .290 batting average, helping him finish second in the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|MVP]] voting behind [[Vladimir Guerrero]]. On July 27 Sheffield hit his 400th career homerun off of [[Micheal Nakamura]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in the top of the 9th inning. In his second season with the Yankees, he continued to play well, hitting another 34 home runs and driving in 123 runs. Sheffield started the 2006 season on pace for a .300 batting average and 30 homers, before he collided with [[Shea Hillenbrand]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on April 29, 2006. He tried to play despite the injury, but ultimately needed wrist surgery. Sheffield did not return until late September. He had lost his right field job to [[Bobby Abreu]], whom the Yankees had acquired in a trade deadline transaction. This forced Sheffield to play first base for the first time in his MLB career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sheffga01.shtml|title=Gary Sheffield Stats|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> At the end of the 2006 season, the Yankees picked up Sheffield's 2007 option and traded him to the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\n[[File:Sheffield BP.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sheffield (right) with the Tigers in {{baseball year|2007}}.]]\nOn November 10, 2006, he was traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for minor league pitchers [[Humberto S\u00e1nchez]], [[Kevin Whelan]], and [[Anthony Claggett]].
