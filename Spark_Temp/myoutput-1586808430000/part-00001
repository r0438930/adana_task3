No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.\n\nIn theory, a particle and its anti-particle (for example, proton and antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.\n\nA collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light. The amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] equation, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |date=11 August 2011\n |title=Smidgen of Antimatter Surrounds Earth\n |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926174944/http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html\n |archivedate=26 September 2011\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\nAntimatter particles bind with each other to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{Cite arXiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter.

They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons .

No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.\n\nIn theory, a particle and its anti-particle (for example, proton and antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.\n\nA collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{Cite arXiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter.

This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.\n\nOne researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:\n{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |year=2004 [2008]\n |title=Angels and Demons: Do antimatter atoms exist?\n |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |publisher=[[CERN]]\n |accessdate=2010-11-18\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160609/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archivedate=2010-11-16\n}}</ref>}}\n--->\n\n===Weapons===\n{{Main|Antimatter weapon}}\n\nAntimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |title=Antimatter weapons\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424174413/http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |archivedate=24 April 2013\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref> A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Gsponer |first1=Andre\n |last2=Hurni |first2=Jean-Pierre\n |year=1987\n |chapter=The physics of antimatter induced fusion and thermonuclear explosions\n |editor1-last=Velarde |editor1-first=G.\n |editor2-last=Minguez |editor2-first=E.\n |title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems, Madrid, June/July, 1986\n |volume=4 |issue=30 |pages=66\u2013169\n |publisher=[[World Scientific]]\n |arxiv=physics/0507114\n |bibcode=2005physics...7114G\n}}</ref> However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the [[Cold War]], and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/04/MNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |title=Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons / Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609101650/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F10%2F04%2FMNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |archivedate=9 June 2012\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Antimatter comet}}\n* {{annotated link|Plasma cosmology#Alfv\u00e9n\u2013Klein cosmology}}\n* {{annotated link|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=G.
