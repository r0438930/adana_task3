Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like [[Roger Zelazny]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[Philip Jose Farmer]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the [[Beat Generation]] (especially [[William S. Burroughs]]' own SF), [[Dadaism]], and their own ideas.<ref>[http://comicsalliance.com/new-worlds-magazine-returns/ \u2018NEW WORLDS': ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI MAGAZINES RETURNS THIS FALL]<br />Ballard\u2019s think-pieces on the intrusion of technology and media \u2014 \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", \"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\", \"The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\" (collected with others as ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' with illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner) \u2014 paved the way for cyberpunk. Brian Aldiss practically populated his own subgenre with quirky epics like ''Acid Head War'', a messianic tale of freestyle narrative set in a post-war Europe in which hallucinogenic drugs had affected entire populations, and ''Report on Probability A'', an experimental story about the observations of three characters named G, S, and C.</ref> Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the \"archetypes\" popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as [[Joseph Campbell]] argued in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with \"more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol5lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&lpg=PT60#v=onepage&q=cyberpunk%20%22new%20wave%22 Cyberpunk, Steampunk and Wizardry: Science Fiction Since 1980] Chapter 4. The New Wave</ref>\n\nThis had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement \"Cyberpunk\". One, [[Bruce Sterling]], later said:\n{{quote|In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation \u2014 cyberpunks and humanists and so forth \u2014 [Ballard] was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom. We knew we were not fit to polish the man\u2019s boots, and we were scarcely able to understand how we could get to a position to do work which he might respect or stand, but at least we were able to see the peak of achievement that he had reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballardian.com/unblinking-clinical-from-ballard-to-cyberpunk|title=Ballardian \u00bb 'Unblinking, clinical': From Ballard to cyberpunk|website=www.Ballardian.com|access-date=28 December 2017|date=2008-11-26}}</ref>}}\n\nBallard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more \"realism\" to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.\n\nSimilarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]]'', first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more \"realist\" than the [[Isaac Asimov]] ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series that laid its philosophical foundation. Dick's protege and friend [[K. W. Jeter]] wrote a very dark and imaginative novel called ''[[Dr. Adder]]'' in 1972 that, Dick lamented, might have been more influential in the field had it been able to find a publisher at that time.{{cn|date=November 2019}} It was not published until 1984, after which Jeter made it the first book in a trilogy, followed by ''The Glass Hammer'' (1985) and ''Death Arms'' (1987). Jeter wrote other standalone cyberpunk novels before going on to write three authorized sequels to ''Do Androids Dream of electric sheep'', named ''Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human'' (1995), ''Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night'' (1996), and ''Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon''.\n\n''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'' was made into the seminal movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', released in 1982. This was one year after William Gibson's story, \"[[Johnny Mnemonic]]\" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. That story, which also became a film years later in 1995, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.\n\nIn 1983 a short story written by [[Bruce Bethke]], called ''[[Cyberpunk (novel)|Cyberpunk]]'', was published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. The term was picked up by [[Gardner Dozois]], editor of ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.\n\nHe described the idea thus:\n{{quote|The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at. Further, the parents and other adult authority figures of the early 21st Century were going to be terribly ill-equipped to deal with the first generation of teenagers who grew up truly \u201cspeaking computer.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.neondystopia.com/cyberpunk-books-fiction/the-early-life-of-the-word-cyberpunk/|title=The Early Life of the Word \"Cyberpunk\" - Neon Dystopia|date=13 November 2016|website=NeonDystopia.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nAfterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article where he said \"About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic \u201cschool\u201d would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as \u201ccyberpunks\u201d \u2014 Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1984/12/30/science-fiction-in-the-eighties/526c3a06-f123-4668-9127-33e33f57e313/|title=Science Fiction in the Eighties|first=Gardner|last=Dozois|date=30 December 1984|publisher=|access-date=28 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref>\n\nAbout that time in 1984, William Gibson's novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk \"virtual reality\", with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called \"Neuromantics\", a pun on the name of the novel plus \"[[New Romantics]]\", a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased [[Michael Swanwick]]'s argument for the term: \"the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly Imitation ''Neuromancer''\".\n\nSterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as either keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athabascau.ca/courses/engl/491/cyberpunk_history.pdf|title=Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image|website=AthabascaU.ca|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> In 1986 he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called ''[[Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology]]'', an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling's perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speculiction.blogspot.com/2013/01/review-of-mirrorshades-cyberpunk.html|title=Speculiction...: Review of \"Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology\" Edited by Bruce Sterling|last=Jesse|date=27 January 2013|website=Speculiction.Blogspot.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' in 1992.\n\nBookending the Cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called ''[[Headcrash]]'', like ''Snow Crash'' a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the [[Philip K. Dick Award]].\n\nIt satirized the genre in this way:\n{{quote|...full of young guys with no social lives, no sex lives and no hope of ever moving out of their mothers' basements ... They're total wankers and losers who indulge in Messianic fantasies about someday getting even with the world through almost-magical computer skills, but whose actual use of the Net amounts to dialing up the scatophilia forum and downloading a few disgusting pictures.

Elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously [[Steampunk]], but also a host of other [[Cyberpunk derivatives]].\n\n== Style and ethos ==\nPrimary figures in the cyberpunk movement include [[William Gibson]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Bruce Bethke]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Rudy Rucker]], and [[John Shirley]]. [[Philip K. Dick]] (author of ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', from which the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' was adapted) is also seen by some as prefiguring the movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/0003637k/project/html/litaut.htm |title=The Cyberpunk Movement&nbsp;\u2013 Cyberpunk authors |publisher=[[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute]] |accessdate=2009-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720051349/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/0003637k/project/html/litaut.htm |archivedate=2009-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n''Blade Runner'' can be seen as a quintessential example of the cyberpunk style and theme.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> [[Video game]]s, [[board games]], and [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, such as ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' and ''[[Shadowrun]]'', often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies.

It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of cultural revolution in science fiction. In the words of author and critic [[David Brin]]:\n\n<blockquote>...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic ...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others ''do'' depict [[Orwellian]] accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate [[elite]].<ref>[[David Brin|Brin, David]] ''The Transparent Society'', Basic Books, 1998 [http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/basic/book_detail.jsp?isbn=0738201448 Book link]</ref></blockquote>\n\nCyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the [[Internet]]. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the [[World Wide Web]] entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as [[Arthur C.

William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for ''[[Neuromancer]]'', a book he was then working on. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]]'' (1999-2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.\n\nThe number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since ''Blade Runner''.

The filmmaker [[Sogo Ishii]] introduced this subculture to [[Japanese cinema]] with the [[punk film]] ''[[Panic High School]]'' (1978) and the punk [[biker film]] ''[[Crazy Thunder Road]]'' (1980), both portraying the rebellion and anarchy associated with punk, and the latter featuring a punk [[biker gang]] aesthetic.

In [[Japan]], where [[cosplay]] is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's ''Neuromancer,'' whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], one of Japan's largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with Western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements.\"<ref>Ruh, Brian (2000), \"[http://www.animeresearch.com/Articles/LiberatingCels Liberating Cels: Forms of the Female in Japanese Cyberpunk Animation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232446/http://www.animeresearch.com/Articles/LiberatingCels/ |date=2007-09-27 }}.\" AnimeResearch.com December 2000.</ref> William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality:\n<blockquote>Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk.

Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Clock DVA]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]].\n\nSome musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as [[Gary Numan]]'s ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'', ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' and ''[[Telekon]]'' were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and ''[[Computer World]]'' albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. [[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' also fits into this category. [[Fear Factory]] concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' and ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. \n\n[[Vaporwave]] and [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] are also influenced by cyberpunk.

These include the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as \"cyberpunks\", attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.\n\n[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|Gothic]] subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]], and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, \"post apocalypse\", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like \"tech wear\", \"goth ninja\" or \"tech ninja\".

These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is \"[[steampunk]],\" which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.<ref>Michael Berry, \"Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,\" ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].</ref>\n\nAnother subgenre is \"[[biopunk]]\" (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].\n\nCyberpunk works have been described as well situated within [[postmodern literature]].<ref>McHale, Brian (1991). \"POSTcyberMODERNpunkISM.\" in [[Larry McCaffery]], ed., ''[[Storming the Reality Studio|Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction]]''.

Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like [[Roger Zelazny]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[Philip Jose Farmer]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the [[Beat Generation]] (especially [[William S. Burroughs]]' own SF), [[Dadaism]], and their own ideas.<ref>[http://comicsalliance.com/new-worlds-magazine-returns/ \u2018NEW WORLDS': ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI MAGAZINES RETURNS THIS FALL]<br />Ballard\u2019s think-pieces on the intrusion of technology and media \u2014 \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", \"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\", \"The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\" (collected with others as ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' with illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner) \u2014 paved the way for cyberpunk. Brian Aldiss practically populated his own subgenre with quirky epics like ''Acid Head War'', a messianic tale of freestyle narrative set in a post-war Europe in which hallucinogenic drugs had affected entire populations, and ''Report on Probability A'', an experimental story about the observations of three characters named G, S, and C.</ref> Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the \"archetypes\" popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as [[Joseph Campbell]] argued in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with \"more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol5lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&lpg=PT60#v=onepage&q=cyberpunk%20%22new%20wave%22 Cyberpunk, Steampunk and Wizardry: Science Fiction Since 1980] Chapter 4. The New Wave</ref>\n\nThis had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement \"Cyberpunk\". One, [[Bruce Sterling]], later said:\n{{quote|In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation \u2014 cyberpunks and humanists and so forth \u2014 [Ballard] was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom. We knew we were not fit to polish the man\u2019s boots, and we were scarcely able to understand how we could get to a position to do work which he might respect or stand, but at least we were able to see the peak of achievement that he had reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballardian.com/unblinking-clinical-from-ballard-to-cyberpunk|title=Ballardian \u00bb 'Unblinking, clinical': From Ballard to cyberpunk|website=www.Ballardian.com|access-date=28 December 2017|date=2008-11-26}}</ref>}}\n\nBallard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more \"realism\" to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.\n\nSimilarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]]'', first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more \"realist\" than the [[Isaac Asimov]] ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series that laid its philosophical foundation. Dick's protege and friend [[K. W. Jeter]] wrote a very dark and imaginative novel called ''[[Dr. Adder]]'' in 1972 that, Dick lamented, might have been more influential in the field had it been able to find a publisher at that time.{{cn|date=November 2019}} It was not published until 1984, after which Jeter made it the first book in a trilogy, followed by ''The Glass Hammer'' (1985) and ''Death Arms'' (1987). Jeter wrote other standalone cyberpunk novels before going on to write three authorized sequels to ''Do Androids Dream of electric sheep'', named ''Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human'' (1995), ''Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night'' (1996), and ''Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon''.\n\n''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'' was made into the seminal movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', released in 1982. This was one year after William Gibson's story, \"[[Johnny Mnemonic]]\" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. That story, which also became a film years later in 1995, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.\n\nIn 1983 a short story written by [[Bruce Bethke]], called ''[[Cyberpunk (novel)|Cyberpunk]]'', was published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. The term was picked up by [[Gardner Dozois]], editor of ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.\n\nHe described the idea thus:\n{{quote|The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at.

The filmmaker [[Sogo Ishii]] introduced this subculture to [[Japanese cinema]] with the [[punk film]] ''[[Panic High School]]'' (1978) and the punk [[biker film]] ''[[Crazy Thunder Road]]'' (1980), both portraying the rebellion and anarchy associated with punk, and the latter featuring a punk [[biker gang]] aesthetic.

In [[Japan]], where [[cosplay]] is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread.

The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with Western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture.

Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Clock DVA]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]].\n\nSome musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as [[Gary Numan]]'s ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'', ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' and ''[[Telekon]]'' were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and ''[[Computer World]]'' albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. [[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' also fits into this category. [[Fear Factory]] concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' and ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. \n\n[[Vaporwave]] and [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] are also influenced by cyberpunk.

These include the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as \"cyberpunks\", attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.\n\n[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|Gothic]] subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]], and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, \"post apocalypse\", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction.

These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is \"[[steampunk]],\" which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.<ref>Michael Berry, \"Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,\" ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].</ref>\n\nAnother subgenre is \"[[biopunk]]\" (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].\n\nCyberpunk works have been described as well situated within [[postmodern literature]].<ref>McHale, Brian (1991). \"POSTcyberMODERNpunkISM.\" in [[Larry McCaffery]], ed., ''[[Storming the Reality Studio|Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction]]''.
