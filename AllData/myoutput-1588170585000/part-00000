Warner Bros. allowed the single \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\" to be released via a small, independent distributor, [[Bellmark Records]], in February 1994. The release reached No. 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries, but it did not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing ''The Gold Experience'', fearing poor sales and citing \"[[market saturation]]\" as a defense.

The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was shipped; these pre-orders were delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the ''Kamasutra'' disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail; one is a four-disc sized jewel case with a white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle while the other contains all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case.

Prince continued to use the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and to play a Love Symbol-shaped guitar.
