Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is a [[disco]] queen who is fascinated by her sexuality, likes boys and has many relationship troubles. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) is unhappily overweight and angry that she is still a virgin. Her parents are overprotective, and she has an annoying younger sister. Annie ([[Cherie Currie]]) is a teenage runaway who drinks, uses drugs, and runs away from her abusive [[police officer]] father. Jeanie ([[Jodie Foster]]) feels she has to take care of them all, is fighting with her divorced mother, and is yearning for a closer relationship with her distant father, a [[tour manager]] for the rock band [[Angel (band)|Angel]].\n\nThe girls believe school is a waste of time, their boyfriends are immature, and that they are alienated from the adults in their lives. All four seem immersed in the decadence of the late 1970s. The only way for them to loosen up and forget the bad things happening in their lives is to party and have fun. Annie is the least responsible, while Jeanie is ready to grow up and wants to stop acting like a child. Jeanie is most worried about Annie and continually takes risks to try to keep Annie clean and safe. Annie's unstable behavior keeps everyone on edge, and finally leads to her death in an automobile accident.\n\nAnnie's death brings changes for the rest of the girls. Madge marries Jay ([[Randy Quaid]]), an older man who deflowered her, Deirdre no longer acts boy-crazy, and Jeanie graduates from high school and is about to head off to college. After Madge and Jay's wedding, Jeanie visits Annie's grave and smokes a cigarette. With a smile, she muses that Annie wanted to be buried under a pear tree, \"not in a box or anything\", so that each year her friends could come by, have a pear and say, \"Annie's tastin' good this year, huh?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Jeanie\n* [[Scott Baio]] as Brad\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Jay\n* [[Sally Kellerman]] as Mary\n* [[Cherie Currie]] as Annie Mallick\n* Marilyn Kagan as Madge Axman\n* Kandice Stroh as Deirdre Tompkins\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Mrs. Axman\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Debbie\n* [[Robert Romanus]] as Scott\n* [[Adam Faith]] as Bryan\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received an approval rating of 67% from 9 reviews of [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/foxes|title= Foxes (1980)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nNoted film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a good review, writing:<blockquote>\nThe movie follows its four foxes through several days and several adventures.
