They were accomplished at the service of King [[Eurystheus]]. The episodes were later connected by a continuous narrative. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an [[epic poem]], now lost, written by [[Peisander]], dated about 600 BC.<ref>According to [[Walter Burkert]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> After Heracles killed his wife and children, he went to the oracle at Delphi. He prayed to the god Apollo for guidance. Heracles was told to serve the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus, for ten years. During this time, he is sent to perform a series of difficult feats, called labours.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA253 p. 253].</ref>\n\n==Backstory==\n[[File:P. Oxy. XXII 2331.jpg|thumb|The [[Heracles Papyrus]], a fragment of a 3rd-century Greek manuscript of a poem about the Labours of Heracles ([[Oxyrhynchus Papyrus]] 2331)]]\nDriven mad by [[Hera]]  (queen of the gods), Heracles slew his sons by his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, p. 186.</ref> After recovering his sanity, Heracles deeply regretted his actions; he was purified by King [[Thespius]], then traveled to [[Delphi]] to inquire how he could atone for his actions. [[Pythia]], the Oracle of Delphi, advised him to go to [[Tiryns]] and serve his cousin, King [[Eurystheus]], for ten years, performing whatever labors Eurystheus might set him; in return, he would be rewarded with immortality. Heracles despaired at this, loathing to serve a man whom he knew to be far inferior to himself, yet fearing to oppose his father [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he placed himself at Eurystheus's disposal.\n\nEurystheus originally ordered Heracles to perform ten labours. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus refused to recognize two: the slaying of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], as Heracles' nephew and charioteer [[Iolaus]] had helped him; and the cleansing of the [[Augean stables|Augeas]], because Heracles accepted payment for the labour. Eurystheus set two more tasks (fetching the Golden Apples of [[Hesperides]] and capturing [[Cerberus]]), which Heracles also performed, bringing the total number of tasks to twelve.\n\n==Labours==\n[[File:Map_of_Heracles's_Early_Labors.jpg|thumb|Heracles's first six labours were located in the [[Peloponnese]].]]\n\nAs they survive, the labours of Heracles are not recounted in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples<ref name=\"ruck\">{{cite book | last = Ruck | first = Carl | author2=Danny Staples | year = 1994 | pages = 169 | title = The World of Classical Myth | location = Durham, North Carolina| publisher = Carolina Academic Press}}</ref> assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were located in the [[Peloponnese]], culminating with the rededication of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Six others took the hero farther afield, to places that were, per Ruck, \"all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld\".<ref name=\"ruck\"/> In each case, the pattern was the same: Heracles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Eurystheus (as Hera's representative) a magical animal or plant.\n\nA famous depiction of the labours in Greek sculpture is found on the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which date to the 450s BC.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- \nthere are no \"fixed\" number of metopes: in the Archaic period, it may actually have been the labours' display on the twelve available metopes on temples which led to their being counted as twelve in number.\n-->\n\nIn his labours, Heracles was sometimes accompanied by a male companion (an ''[[eromenos]]''), according to [[Licymnius]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and others, such as [[Iolaus]], his nephew. Although he was supposed to perform only ten labours, this assistance led to two labours being disqualified: Eurystheus refused to recognize slaying the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, and the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was paid for his services and/or because the rivers did the work. Several of the labours involved the offspring (by various accounts) of [[Typhon]] and his mate [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], all overcome by Heracles.\n\nA traditional order of the labours found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref> by Pseudo-Apollodorus is:\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]].\n# Steal three of the golden apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===First: Nemean lion===\n{{Main|Nemean lion}}\n[[File:Hercules with head of Nemean Lion.jpg|thumb|Hercules with the head of the Nemean lion]]\n\nHeracles wandered the area until he came to the town of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]]. There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to [[Zeus]], but if he did not return within 30 days or if he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.\n\nWhile searching for the lion, Heracles fletched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable. When he found and shot the lion, firing at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property as the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Ther/LeonNemeios.html|title=NEMEAN LION (Leon Nemeios) - Labour of Heracles in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref> Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt. Others say that Heracles' armor was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].\n\nWhen he returned on the 30th day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; from then on he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus would then tell Heracles his tasks through a herald, not personally. Eurystheus even had a large bronze jar made for him in which to hide from Heracles if need be. Eurystheus then warned him that the tasks would become increasingly difficult.\n\n===Second: Lernaean Hydra===\n{{Main|poop\n}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra.webp|thumb|left|Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra]]\nHeracles' second labour was to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], which [[Hera]] had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near [[Lerna|Lake Lerna]], where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles used a cloth to cover his mouth and nose to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He fired flaming arrows into the Hydra's lair, the spring of [[Amymone]], a deep cave that it only came out of to terrorize neighboring villages.<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (angelo) 1959:144.</ref> He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a harvesting [[sickle]] (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword or his famed club. Ruck and Staples (1994: 170) have pointed out that the [[chthonic]] creature's reaction was botanical: upon cutting off each of its heads he found that two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the [[hero]]. Additionally, one of the Hydra's heads - the middle one - was immortal.\n\nThe details of the struggle are explicit in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.2): realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew [[Iolaus]] for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by [[Athena]]) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. He cut off the Hydra's one immortal head with a golden sword given to him by Athena. Heracles placed it under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius (Kerenyi 1959:144), and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, and so his second task was complete. The alternative version of this myth is that after cutting off one head, he then dipped his sword in it and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the [[Hydra (constellation)|constellation Hydra]]. She then turned the crab into the [[Cancer (constellation)|constellation Cancer]].\n\nLater, Heracles used an arrow dipped in the Hydra's poisonous blood to kill the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]; and Nessus's tainted blood was applied to the [[Tunic of Nessus]], by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] report that the stench of the river Anigrus in [[Elis]], making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra's venom, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.<ref>Strabo, viii.3.19, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], v.5.9; Grimal 1987:219.</ref>\n\n===Third: Ceryneian Hind===\n{{Main|Ceryneian Hind}}\n\n[[File:Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind.webp|thumb|Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind]]\nEurystheus and Hera were greatly angered that Heracles had survived the Nemean Lion and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. For the third labour, they found a task which they thought would spell doom for the hero. It was not slaying a beast or monster, as it had already been established that Heracles could overcome even the most fearsome opponents. Instead, Eurystheus ordered him to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], which was so fast that it could outrun an arrow.\n\nAfter beginning the search, Heracles awoke from sleeping and saw the hind by the glint on its [[antlers]]. Heracles then chased the hind on foot for a full year through [[Greece]], [[Thrace]], [[Istria]], and the land of the [[Hyperboreans]]. In some versions, he captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net. In other versions, he encountered [[Artemis]] in her temple; she told him to leave the hind and tell Eurystheus all that had happened, and his third labor would be considered to be completed. Yet another version claims that Heracles trapped the Hind with an arrow between its forelegs.\n\nEurystheus had given Heracles this task hoping to incite Artemis' anger at Heracles for his desecration of her sacred animal. As he was returning with the hind, Heracles encountered Artemis and her brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. He begged the goddess for forgiveness, explaining that he had to catch it as part of his penance, but he promised to return it. Artemis forgave him, foiling Eurystheus' plan to have her punish him.\n\nUpon bringing the hind to Eurystheus, he was told that it was to become part of the King's [[menagerie]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind as he had promised, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. The King came out, but the moment that Heracles let the hind go, it sprinted back to its mistress and Heracles left, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.\n\n===Fourth: Erymanthian Boar===\n{{Main|Erymanthian Boar}}\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar.jpg|thumb|left|Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar]]\nEurystheus was disappointed that Heracles had overcome yet another creature and was humiliated by the hind's escape, so he assigned Heracles another dangerous task. By some accounts, the fourth labour was to bring the fearsome [[Erymanthian Boar]] back to Eurystheus alive (there is no single definitive telling of the labours). On the way to Mount Erymanthos where the boar lived, Heracles visited [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] (\"caveman\"), a kind and hospitable [[centaur]] and old friend. Heracles ate with Pholus in his cavern (though the centaur devoured his meat raw) and asked for wine. Pholus had only one jar of wine, a gift from [[Dionysus]] to all the centaurs on Mount Erymanthos. Heracles convinced him to open it, and the smell attracted the other centaurs. They did not understand that wine needs to be tempered with water, became drunk, and attacked Heracles. Heracles shot at them with his poisonous arrows, killing many, and the centaurs retreated all the way to [[Chiron]]'s cave.\n\nPholus was curious why the arrows caused so much death. He picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his hoof, poisoning him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well. He was immortal, but he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great that he volunteered to give up his immortality and take the place of [[Prometheus]], who had been chained to the top of a mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an [[eagle]]. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught [[Achilles]]. The tale of the centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.\n\nHeracles had visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this labour in mid-winter. Heracles caught the boar, bound it, and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage ''[[pithos]]'', begging Heracles to get rid of the beast.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Fifth: Augean stables===\n{{Main|Augeas}}\n\n[[File:Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the rive.jpg|thumb|Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the river]]\nThe fifth labour was to clean the stables of King [[Augeas]]. This assignment was intended to be both humiliating (rather than impressive, as the previous labours had been) and impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (and immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. The Augean Stables ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|\u0259|n}}) had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and over 1,000 cattle lived there. However, Heracles succeeded by re-routing the rivers [[Alfeios River|Alpheus]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] to wash out the filth.\n\nBefore starting on the task, Heracles had asked Augeas for one-tenth of the cattle if he finished the task in one day, and Augeas agreed. But afterwards Augeas refused to honour the agreement on the grounds that Heracles had been ordered to carry out the task by Eurystheus anyway. Heracles claimed his reward in court, and was supported by Augeas' son [[Phyleus]]. Augeas banished them both before the court had ruled. Heracles returned, slew Augeas, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus. Heracles then founded the Olympic Games.\nThe success of this labour was ultimately discounted as the rushing waters had done the work of cleaning the stables and because Heracles was paid for doing the labour. \nEurystheus said that Heracles still had seven labours to perform.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|title=Maps of Mount Olympus|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921212448/http://www.olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth: Stymphalian birds===\n{{Main|Stymphalian birds}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds.png|thumb|left|Hercules and the Stymphalian birds]]\n\nThe sixth labour was to defeat the [[Stymphalian birds]], man-eating birds with beaks made of [[bronze]] and sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims. They were sacred to [[Ares]], the god of war. Furthermore, their dung was highly toxic. They had migrated to [[Lake Stymphalia]] in [[Arcadia]], where they bred quickly and took over the countryside, destroying local crops, fruit trees, and townspeople. Heracles could not go too far into the swamp, for it would not support his weight. [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, gave Heracles a rattle which [[Hephaestus]] had made especially for the occasion. Heracles shook the rattle and frightened the birds into the air. Heracles then shot many of them with his arrows. The rest flew far away, never to return. The [[Argonauts]] would later encounter them.\n\n===Seventh: Cretan Bull===\n{{Main|Cretan Bull}} \n[[File:Herculean effort.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles forces the Cretan Bull to the ground ([[engraving]] by B. Picart, 1731)]]\n\nThe seventh labour was to capture the [[Cretan Bull]], father of the [[Minotaur]]. Heracles sailed to [[Crete]], where King [[Minos]] gave Heracles permission to take the bull away and even offered him assistance (which Heracles declined, plausibly because he did not want the labor to be discounted as before).<ref name=\"Apollod\">''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.7</ref> The bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles sneaked up behind the bull and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his ''[[pithos]]'' at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the bull to Hera, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered into [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.<ref name=\"Apollod\" /> [[Theseus]] would later sacrifice the bull to [[Athena]] and/or [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].\n\n===Eighth: Mares of Diomedes===\n{{Main|Mares of Diomedes}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses, 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - ''Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses'', 1752]]\nAs the eighth of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], also categorised as the second of the Non-[[Peloponnese|Peloponneisan]] labours<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morford, Mark P.

After overpowering Diomedes\u2019 men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, [[Abderus]], while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] next to the boy's tomb<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn't have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club<ref name=\":1\" />), and fed Diomedes\u2019 body to the horses to calm them.\n\nIn yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares ''before'' releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the [[Bistones|Bistonians]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.\n\nAll versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to [[Hera]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rose, H.

To please his daughter, Eurystheus ordered Heracles to retrieve the belt as his ninth labour.\n\nTaking a band of friends with him, Heracles set sail, stopping at the island of [[Paros]], which was inhabited by some sons of Minos. The sons killed two of Heracles' companions, an act which set Heracles on a rampage. He killed two of the sons of Minos and threatened the other inhabitants until he was offered two men to replace his fallen companions. Heracles agreed and took two of Minos' grandsons, [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Sthenelus]]. They continued their voyage and landed at the court of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], whom Heracles defended in a battle against King [[Mygdon of Bebryces]]. After killing King Mygdon, Heracles gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]. The crew then set off for [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], where Hippolyta lived.\n\nAll would have gone well for Heracles had it not been for Hera. Hippolyta, impressed with Heracles and his exploits, agreed to give him the belt and would have done so had Hera not disguised herself and walked among the Amazons sowing seeds of distrust. She claimed the strangers were plotting to carry off the queen of the Amazons. Alarmed, the women set off on horseback to confront Heracles. When Heracles saw them, he thought Hippolyta had been plotting such treachery all along and had never meant to hand over the belt, so he killed her, took the belt and returned to Eurystheus.\n\n===Tenth: Cattle of Geryon===\n{{Main|Geryon}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones.webp|thumb|Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones]]\nThe tenth labour was to obtain the Cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]]. In the fullest account in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', 2.5.10.</ref> [[Hercules|Heracles]] had to go to the island of Erytheia in the far west (sometimes identified with the [[Hesperides]], or with the island which forms the city of [[C\u00e1diz]]) to get the cattle. On the way there, he crossed the [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n desert<ref>''Libya'' was the generic name for [[North Africa]] to the Greeks.</ref> and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at the [[Sun]]. The sun-god [[Helios]] \"in admiration of his courage\" gave Heracles the golden cup Helios used to sail across the sea from west to east each night. Heracles rode the cup to Erytheia; Heracles in the cup was a favorite motif on [[black-figure pottery]].{{fact|date=March 2020}} Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the \"red island\" of the sunset.\n\nWhen Heracles landed at Erytheia, he was confronted by the two-headed dog [[Orthrus]]. With one blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed Orthrus. [[Eurytion]] the herdsman came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.\n\nOn hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields and three spears, and wearing three helmets. He attacked Heracles at the River Anthemus, but was slain by one of Heracles' poisoned arrows. Heracles shot so forcefully that the arrow pierced Geryon's forehead, \"and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once.\"<ref>[[Stesichorus]], fragment, translated by Denys Page.</ref>\n\nHeracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] versions of the narrative, Heracles drove the cattle over the [[Aventine Hill]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. The giant [[Cacus]], who lived there, stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young [[Hermes]]. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past the cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In other versions, Cacus' sister [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and set up an altar on the spot, later the site of Rome's [[Forum Boarium]] (the cattle market).\n\nTo annoy Heracles, Hera sent a [[Gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them, and scatter them. Within a year, Heracles retrieved them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much that Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\n===Eleventh: Golden Apples of the Hesperides===\n{{Main|Hesperides}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|left|Atlas and Hercules]]\n[[File:Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides.webp|thumb|Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides]]\nAfter [[Hercules|Heracles]] completed the first ten labours, Eurystheus gave him two more, claiming that slaying the Hydra did not count (because [[Iolaus]] helped Heracles), neither did cleaning the Augean Stables (either because he was paid for the job or because the rivers did the work).\n\nThe first additional labour was to steal three of the golden apples from the garden of the [[Hesperides]]. Heracles first caught the [[Old Man of the Sea]], the shapeshifting sea god,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959, p.172, identifies him in this context as [[Nereus]]; as a shapeshifter he is often identified as [[Proteus]].</ref> to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located.<ref>In some versions of the tale, Hercules was directed to ask [[Prometheus]]. As payment, he freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found as part of the story of the [[Erymanthian Boar]], since it is associated with [[Chiron]] choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus' place.</ref>\n\nIn some variations, Heracles, either at the start or at the end of this task, meets [[Antaeus]], who was invincible as long as he touched his mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bear hug.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus ii. 5; [[Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 31</ref>\n\n[[Herodotus]] claims that Heracles stopped in [[Egypt]], where King [[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]] decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.\n\nHeracles finally made his way to the garden of the Hesperides, where he encountered [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Heracles persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas could get the apples because, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides. This would have made the labour \u2013 like the Hydra and the Augean stables \u2013 void because Heracles had received help. When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Heracles adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away with the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the apples instead. Eurystheus was furious that Heracles had accomplished something that Eurystheus thought could not possibly be done.\n\n===Twelfth: Cerberus===\n\n{{Main|Cerberus}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and Cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Cerberus]]\n\nThe twelfth and final labour was the capture of [[Cerberus]], the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog that was the guardian of the gates of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. To prepare for his descent into the Underworld, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] (or [[Athens]]) to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He entered the Underworld, and [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]] were his guides.\n\nWhile in the Underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by [[Hades]] for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs, then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the Earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the goddess for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.\n\nHeracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could subdue the beast without using weapons. Heracles overpowered Cerberus with his bare hands and slung the beast over his back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his ''[[pithos]]''.  Eurystheus begged Heracles to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours when Cerberus disappeared back to his master.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece by Jean-Francois Detroy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece'' by Jean-Francois Detroy]]\nAfter completing the Twelve Labours, one tradition says Heracles joined Jason and the [[Argonauts]] in their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. However, [[Herodorus]] (c. 400 BC) disputed this and denied Heracles ever sailed with the Argonauts. A separate tradition (e.g. ''[[Argonautica]]'') has Heracles accompany the Argonauts, but he did not travel with them as far as [[Colchis]].\n\n==Allegorical interpretation==\nSome ancient Greeks found allegorical meanings of a moral, psychological or philosophical nature in the Labors of Heracles.  This trend became more prominent in the Renaissance.<ref>Brumble, H. David. ''Classical Myths and Legends in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: A Dictionary of Allegorical Meanings''. Routledge, 2013.</ref>  For example, [[Heraclitus_(commentator)|Heraclitus the Grammarian]] wrote in his ''Homeric Problems'':\n{{Quote \n|text=\nI turn to Heracles. We must not suppose he attained such power in those days as a result of his physical strength. Rather, he was a man of intellect, an initiate in heavenly wisdom, who, as it were, shed light on philosophy, which had been hidden in deep darkness. The most authoritative of the Stoics agree with this account.... The (Erymanthian) boar which he overcame is the common incontinence of men; the (Nemean) lion is the indiscriminate rush towards improper goals; in the same way, by fettering irrational passions he gave rise to the belief that he had fettered the violent (Cretan) bull. He banished cowardice also from the world, in the shape of the hind of Ceryneia. There was another \"labor\" too, not properly so called, in which he cleared out the mass of dung (from the Augean stables) \u2014 in other words, the foulness that disfigures humanity. The (Stymphalian) birds he scattered are the windy hopes that feed our lives; the many-headed hydra that he burned, as it were, with the fires of exhortation, is pleasure, which begins to grow again as soon as it is cut out.\n|author=Donald Andrew Russell, David Konstan\n|source=''Heraclitus: Homeric Problems'' 33 (2005)<ref>Russell, Donald Andrew; Konstan, David (trs.).

They were accomplished at the service of King [[Eurystheus]]. The episodes were later connected by a continuous narrative. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an [[epic poem]], now lost, written by [[Peisander]], dated about 600 BC.<ref>According to [[Walter Burkert]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> After Heracles killed his wife and children, he went to the oracle at Delphi. He prayed to the god Apollo for guidance. Heracles was told to serve the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus, for ten years. During this time, he is sent to perform a series of difficult feats, called labours.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA253 p. 253].</ref>\n\n==Backstory==\n[[File:P. Oxy. XXII 2331.jpg|thumb|The [[Heracles Papyrus]], a fragment of a 3rd-century Greek manuscript of a poem about the Labours of Heracles ([[Oxyrhynchus Papyrus]] 2331)]]\nDriven mad by [[Hera]]  (queen of the gods), Heracles slew his sons by his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, p. 186.</ref> After recovering his sanity, Heracles deeply regretted his actions; he was purified by King [[Thespius]], then traveled to [[Delphi]] to inquire how he could atone for his actions. [[Pythia]], the Oracle of Delphi, advised him to go to [[Tiryns]] and serve his cousin, King [[Eurystheus]], for ten years, performing whatever labors Eurystheus might set him; in return, he would be rewarded with immortality. Heracles despaired at this, loathing to serve a man whom he knew to be far inferior to himself, yet fearing to oppose his father [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he placed himself at Eurystheus's disposal.\n\nEurystheus originally ordered Heracles to perform ten labours. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus refused to recognize two: the slaying of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], as Heracles' nephew and charioteer [[Iolaus]] had helped him; and the cleansing of the [[Augean stables|Augeas]], because Heracles accepted payment for the labour. Eurystheus set two more tasks (fetching the Golden Apples of [[Hesperides]] and capturing [[Cerberus]]), which Heracles also performed, bringing the total number of tasks to twelve.\n\n==Labours==\n[[File:Map_of_Heracles's_Early_Labors.jpg|thumb|Heracles's first six labours were located in the [[Peloponnese]].]]\n\nAs they survive, the labours of Heracles are not recounted in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples<ref name=\"ruck\">{{cite book | last = Ruck | first = Carl | author2=Danny Staples | year = 1994 | pages = 169 | title = The World of Classical Myth | location = Durham, North Carolina| publisher = Carolina Academic Press}}</ref> assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were located in the [[Peloponnese]], culminating with the rededication of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Six others took the hero farther afield, to places that were, per Ruck, \"all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld\".<ref name=\"ruck\"/> In each case, the pattern was the same: Heracles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Eurystheus (as Hera's representative) a magical animal or plant.\n\nA famous depiction of the labours in Greek sculpture is found on the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which date to the 450s BC.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- \nthere are no \"fixed\" number of metopes: in the Archaic period, it may actually have been the labours' display on the twelve available metopes on temples which led to their being counted as twelve in number.\n-->\n\nIn his labours, Heracles was sometimes accompanied by a male companion (an ''[[eromenos]]''), according to [[Licymnius]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and others, such as [[Iolaus]], his nephew. Although he was supposed to perform only ten labours, this assistance led to two labours being disqualified: Eurystheus refused to recognize slaying the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, and the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was paid for his services and/or because the rivers did the work. Several of the labours involved the offspring (by various accounts) of [[Typhon]] and his mate [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], all overcome by Heracles.\n\nA traditional order of the labours found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref> by Pseudo-Apollodorus is:\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]].\n# Steal three of the golden apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===First: Nemean lion===\n{{Main|Nemean lion}}\n[[File:Hercules with head of Nemean Lion.jpg|thumb|Hercules with the head of the Nemean lion]]\n\nHeracles wandered the area until he came to the town of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]]. There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to [[Zeus]], but if he did not return within 30 days or if he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.\n\nWhile searching for the lion, Heracles fletched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable. When he found and shot the lion, firing at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property as the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Ther/LeonNemeios.html|title=NEMEAN LION (Leon Nemeios) - Labour of Heracles in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref> Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt. Others say that Heracles' armor was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].\n\nWhen he returned on the 30th day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; from then on he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus would then tell Heracles his tasks through a herald, not personally. Eurystheus even had a large bronze jar made for him in which to hide from Heracles if need be. Eurystheus then warned him that the tasks would become increasingly difficult.\n\n===Second: Lernaean Hydra===\n{{Main|Lernaean Hydra}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra.webp|thumb|left|Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra]]\nHeracles' second labour was to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], which [[Hera]] had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near [[Lerna|Lake Lerna]], where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles used a cloth to cover his mouth and nose to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He fired flaming arrows into the Hydra's lair, the spring of [[Amymone]], a deep cave that it only came out of to terrorize neighboring villages.<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (angelo) 1959:144.</ref> He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a harvesting [[sickle]] (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword or his famed club. Ruck and Staples (1994: 170) have pointed out that the [[chthonic]] creature's reaction was botanical: upon cutting off each of its heads he found that two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the [[hero]]. Additionally, one of the Hydra's heads - the middle one - was immortal.\n\nThe details of the struggle are explicit in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.2): realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew [[Iolaus]] for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by [[Athena]]) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. He cut off the Hydra's one immortal head with a golden sword given to him by Athena. Heracles placed it under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius (Kerenyi 1959:144), and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, and so his second task was complete. The alternative version of this myth is that after cutting off one head, he then dipped his sword in it and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the [[Hydra (constellation)|constellation Hydra]]. She then turned the crab into the [[Cancer (constellation)|constellation Cancer]].\n\nLater, Heracles used an arrow dipped in the Hydra's poisonous blood to kill the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]; and Nessus's tainted blood was applied to the [[Tunic of Nessus]], by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] report that the stench of the river Anigrus in [[Elis]], making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra's venom, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.<ref>Strabo, viii.3.19, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], v.5.9; Grimal 1987:219.</ref>\n\n===Third: Ceryneian Hind===\n{{Main|Ceryneian Hind}}\n\n[[File:Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind.webp|thumb|Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind]]\nEurystheus and Hera were greatly angered that Heracles had survived the Nemean Lion and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. For the third labour, they found a task which they thought would spell doom for the hero. It was not slaying a beast or monster, as it had already been established that Heracles could overcome even the most fearsome opponents. Instead, Eurystheus ordered him to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], which was so fast that it could outrun an arrow.\n\nAfter beginning the search, Heracles awoke from sleeping and saw the hind by the glint on its [[antlers]]. Heracles then chased the hind on foot for a full year through [[Greece]], [[Thrace]], [[Istria]], and the land of the [[Hyperboreans]]. In some versions, he captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net. In other versions, he encountered [[Artemis]] in her temple; she told him to leave the hind and tell Eurystheus all that had happened, and his third labor would be considered to be completed. Yet another version claims that Heracles trapped the Hind with an arrow between its forelegs.\n\nEurystheus had given Heracles this task hoping to incite Artemis' anger at Heracles for his desecration of her sacred animal. As he was returning with the hind, Heracles encountered Artemis and her brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. He begged the goddess for forgiveness, explaining that he had to catch it as part of his penance, but he promised to return it. Artemis forgave him, foiling Eurystheus' plan to have her punish him.\n\nUpon bringing the hind to Eurystheus, he was told that it was to become part of the King's [[menagerie]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind as he had promised, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. The King came out, but the moment that Heracles let the hind go, it sprinted back to its mistress and Heracles left, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.\n\n===Fourth: Erymanthian Boar===\n{{Main|Erymanthian Boar}}\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar.jpg|thumb|left|Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar]]\nEurystheus was disappointed that Heracles had overcome yet another creature and was humiliated by the hind's escape, so he assigned Heracles another dangerous task. By some accounts, the fourth labour was to bring the fearsome [[Erymanthian Boar]] back to Eurystheus alive (there is no single definitive telling of the labours). On the way to Mount Erymanthos where the boar lived, Heracles visited [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] (\"caveman\"), a kind and hospitable [[centaur]] and old friend. Heracles ate with Pholus in his cavern (though the centaur devoured his meat raw) and asked for wine. Pholus had only one jar of wine, a gift from [[Dionysus]] to all the centaurs on Mount Erymanthos. Heracles convinced him to open it, and the smell attracted the other centaurs. They did not understand that wine needs to be tempered with water, became drunk, and attacked Heracles. Heracles shot at them with his poisonous arrows, killing many, and the centaurs retreated all the way to [[Chiron]]'s cave.\n\nPholus was curious why the arrows caused so much death. He picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his hoof, poisoning him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well. He was immortal, but he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great that he volunteered to give up his immortality and take the place of [[Prometheus]], who had been chained to the top of a mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an [[eagle]]. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught [[Achilles]]. The tale of the centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.\n\nHeracles had visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this labour in mid-winter. Heracles caught the boar, bound it, and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage ''[[pithos]]'', begging Heracles to get rid of the beast.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Fifth: Augean stables===\n{{Main|Augeas}}\n\n[[File:Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the rive.jpg|thumb|Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the river]]\nThe fifth labour was to clean the stables of King [[Augeas]]. This assignment was intended to be both humiliating (rather than impressive, as the previous labours had been) and impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (and immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. The Augean Stables ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|\u0259|n}}) had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and over 1,000 cattle lived there. However, Heracles succeeded by re-routing the rivers [[Alfeios River|Alpheus]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] to wash out the filth.\n\nBefore starting on the task, Heracles had asked Augeas for one-tenth of the cattle if he finished the task in one day, and Augeas agreed. But afterwards Augeas refused to honour the agreement on the grounds that Heracles had been ordered to carry out the task by Eurystheus anyway. Heracles claimed his reward in court, and was supported by Augeas' son [[Phyleus]]. Augeas banished them both before the court had ruled. Heracles returned, slew Augeas, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus. Heracles then founded the Olympic Games.\nThe success of this labour was ultimately discounted as the rushing waters had done the work of cleaning the stables and because Heracles was paid for doing the labour. \nEurystheus said that Heracles still had seven labours to perform.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|title=Maps of Mount Olympus|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921212448/http://www.olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth: Stymphalian birds===\n{{Main|Stymphalian birds}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds.png|thumb|left|Hercules and the Stymphalian birds]]\n\nThe sixth labour was to defeat the [[Stymphalian birds]], man-eating birds with beaks made of [[bronze]] and sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims. They were sacred to [[Ares]], the god of war. Furthermore, their dung was highly toxic. They had migrated to [[Lake Stymphalia]] in [[Arcadia]], where they bred quickly and took over the countryside, destroying local crops, fruit trees, and townspeople. Heracles could not go too far into the swamp, for it would not support his weight. [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, gave Heracles a rattle which [[Hephaestus]] had made especially for the occasion. Heracles shook the rattle and frightened the birds into the air. Heracles then shot many of them with his arrows. The rest flew far away, never to return. The [[Argonauts]] would later encounter them.\n\n===Seventh: Cretan Bull===\n{{Main|Cretan Bull}} \n[[File:Herculean effort.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles forces the Cretan Bull to the ground ([[engraving]] by B. Picart, 1731)]]\n\nThe seventh labour was to capture the [[Cretan Bull]], father of the [[Minotaur]]. Heracles sailed to [[Crete]], where King [[Minos]] gave Heracles permission to take the bull away and even offered him assistance (which Heracles declined, plausibly because he did not want the labor to be discounted as before).<ref name=\"Apollod\">''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.7</ref> The bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles sneaked up behind the bull and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his ''[[pithos]]'' at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the bull to Hera, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered into [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.<ref name=\"Apollod\" /> [[Theseus]] would later sacrifice the bull to [[Athena]] and/or [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].\n\n===Eighth: Mares of Diomedes===\n{{Main|Mares of Diomedes}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses, 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - ''Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses'', 1752]]\nAs the eighth of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], also categorised as the second of the Non-[[Peloponnese|Peloponneisan]] labours<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morford, Mark P.

After overpowering Diomedes\u2019 men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, [[Abderus]], while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] next to the boy's tomb<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn't have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club<ref name=\":1\" />), and fed Diomedes\u2019 body to the horses to calm them.\n\nIn yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares ''before'' releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the [[Bistones|Bistonians]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.\n\nAll versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to [[Hera]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rose, H.

After the incident, Eurystheus sent Heracles to bring back [[Hippolyta|Hippolyta's Girdle]].\n\n===Ninth: Belt of Hippolyta===\n{{Main|Hippolyta}}\n[[File:The magic girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.jpg|thumb|eft|The magic girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons]]\n[[Eurystheus]]' daughter [[Admete]] wanted the Belt of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], a gift from her father Ares. To please his daughter, Eurystheus ordered Heracles to retrieve the belt as his ninth labour.\n\nTaking a band of friends with him, Heracles set sail, stopping at the island of [[Paros]], which was inhabited by some sons of Minos. The sons killed two of Heracles' companions, an act which set Heracles on a rampage. He killed two of the sons of Minos and threatened the other inhabitants until he was offered two men to replace his fallen companions. Heracles agreed and took two of Minos' grandsons, [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Sthenelus]]. They continued their voyage and landed at the court of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], whom Heracles defended in a battle against King [[Mygdon of Bebryces]]. After killing King Mygdon, Heracles gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]. The crew then set off for [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], where Hippolyta lived.\n\nAll would have gone well for Heracles had it not been for Hera. Hippolyta, impressed with Heracles and his exploits, agreed to give him the belt and would have done so had Hera not disguised herself and walked among the Amazons sowing seeds of distrust. She claimed the strangers were plotting to carry off the queen of the Amazons. Alarmed, the women set off on horseback to confront Heracles. When Heracles saw them, he thought Hippolyta had been plotting such treachery all along and had never meant to hand over the belt, so he killed her, took the belt and returned to Eurystheus.\n\n===Tenth: Cattle of Geryon===\n{{Main|Geryon}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones.webp|thumb|Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones]]\nThe tenth labour was to obtain the Cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]]. In the fullest account in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', 2.5.10.</ref> [[Hercules|Heracles]] had to go to the island of Erytheia in the far west (sometimes identified with the [[Hesperides]], or with the island which forms the city of [[C\u00e1diz]]) to get the cattle. On the way there, he crossed the [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n desert<ref>''Libya'' was the generic name for [[North Africa]] to the Greeks.</ref> and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at the [[Sun]]. The sun-god [[Helios]] \"in admiration of his courage\" gave Heracles the golden cup Helios used to sail across the sea from west to east each night. Heracles rode the cup to Erytheia; Heracles in the cup was a favorite motif on [[black-figure pottery]].{{fact|date=March 2020}} Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the \"red island\" of the sunset.\n\nWhen Heracles landed at Erytheia, he was confronted by the two-headed dog [[Orthrus]]. With one blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed Orthrus. [[Eurytion]] the herdsman came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.\n\nOn hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields and three spears, and wearing three helmets. He attacked Heracles at the River Anthemus, but was slain by one of Heracles' poisoned arrows. Heracles shot so forcefully that the arrow pierced Geryon's forehead, \"and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once.\"<ref>[[Stesichorus]], fragment, translated by Denys Page.</ref>\n\nHeracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] versions of the narrative, Heracles drove the cattle over the [[Aventine Hill]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. The giant [[Cacus]], who lived there, stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young [[Hermes]]. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past the cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In other versions, Cacus' sister [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and set up an altar on the spot, later the site of Rome's [[Forum Boarium]] (the cattle market).\n\nTo annoy Heracles, Hera sent a [[Gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them, and scatter them. Within a year, Heracles retrieved them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much that Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\n===Eleventh: Golden Apples of the Hesperides===\n{{Main|Hesperides}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|left|Atlas and Hercules]]\n[[File:Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides.webp|thumb|Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides]]\nAfter [[Hercules|Heracles]] completed the first ten labours, Eurystheus gave him two more, claiming that slaying the Hydra did not count (because [[Iolaus]] helped Heracles), neither did cleaning the Augean Stables (either because he was paid for the job or because the rivers did the work).\n\nThe first additional labour was to steal three of the golden apples from the garden of the [[Hesperides]]. Heracles first caught the [[Old Man of the Sea]], the shapeshifting sea god,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959, p.172, identifies him in this context as [[Nereus]]; as a shapeshifter he is often identified as [[Proteus]].</ref> to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located.<ref>In some versions of the tale, Hercules was directed to ask [[Prometheus]]. As payment, he freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found as part of the story of the [[Erymanthian Boar]], since it is associated with [[Chiron]] choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus' place.</ref>\n\nIn some variations, Heracles, either at the start or at the end of this task, meets [[Antaeus]], who was invincible as long as he touched his mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bear hug.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus ii. 5; [[Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 31</ref>\n\n[[Herodotus]] claims that Heracles stopped in [[Egypt]], where King [[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]] decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.\n\nHeracles finally made his way to the garden of the Hesperides, where he encountered [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Heracles persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas could get the apples because, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides. This would have made the labour \u2013 like the Hydra and the Augean stables \u2013 void because Heracles had received help. When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Heracles adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away with the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the apples instead. Eurystheus was furious that Heracles had accomplished something that Eurystheus thought could not possibly be done.\n\n===Twelfth: Cerberus===\n\n{{Main|Cerberus}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and Cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Cerberus]]\n\nThe twelfth and final labour was the capture of [[Cerberus]], the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog that was the guardian of the gates of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. To prepare for his descent into the Underworld, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] (or [[Athens]]) to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He entered the Underworld, and [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]] were his guides.\n\nWhile in the Underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by [[Hades]] for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs, then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the Earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the goddess for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.\n\nHeracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could subdue the beast without using weapons. Heracles overpowered Cerberus with his bare hands and slung the beast over his back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his ''[[pithos]]''.  Eurystheus begged Heracles to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours when Cerberus disappeared back to his master.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece by Jean-Francois Detroy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece'' by Jean-Francois Detroy]]\nAfter completing the Twelve Labours, one tradition says Heracles joined Jason and the [[Argonauts]] in their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. However, [[Herodorus]] (c. 400 BC) disputed this and denied Heracles ever sailed with the Argonauts. A separate tradition (e.g. ''[[Argonautica]]'') has Heracles accompany the Argonauts, but he did not travel with them as far as [[Colchis]].\n\n==Allegorical interpretation==\nSome ancient Greeks found allegorical meanings of a moral, psychological or philosophical nature in the Labors of Heracles.  This trend became more prominent in the Renaissance.<ref>Brumble, H. David. ''Classical Myths and Legends in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: A Dictionary of Allegorical Meanings''. Routledge, 2013.</ref>  For example, [[Heraclitus_(commentator)|Heraclitus the Grammarian]] wrote in his ''Homeric Problems'':\n{{Quote \n|text=\nI turn to Heracles. We must not suppose he attained such power in those days as a result of his physical strength. Rather, he was a man of intellect, an initiate in heavenly wisdom, who, as it were, shed light on philosophy, which had been hidden in deep darkness. The most authoritative of the Stoics agree with this account.... The (Erymanthian) boar which he overcame is the common incontinence of men; the (Nemean) lion is the indiscriminate rush towards improper goals; in the same way, by fettering irrational passions he gave rise to the belief that he had fettered the violent (Cretan) bull. He banished cowardice also from the world, in the shape of the hind of Ceryneia. There was another \"labor\" too, not properly so called, in which he cleared out the mass of dung (from the Augean stables) \u2014 in other words, the foulness that disfigures humanity. The (Stymphalian) birds he scattered are the windy hopes that feed our lives; the many-headed hydra that he burned, as it were, with the fires of exhortation, is pleasure, which begins to grow again as soon as it is cut out.\n|author=Donald Andrew Russell, David Konstan\n|source=''Heraclitus: Homeric Problems'' 33 (2005)<ref>Russell, Donald Andrew; Konstan, David (trs.).
