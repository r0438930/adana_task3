Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often [[bay (horse)|bay]] in colour, they show significant [[horse markings|white markings]] due to the presence of [[sabino horse|sabino genetics]]. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draught purposes today. The [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] are some of the most famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British [[Household Cavalry]]. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.\n\nThe breed was developed from [[Flemish]] stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares. The first recorded use of the name \"Clydesdale\" for the breed was in 1826, and by 1830, a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England. A [[breed society]] was formed in 1877. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world, including to Australia and New Zealand, where they became known as \"the breed that built Australia\". \n\nDuring the [[First World War]], population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanisation and war conscription. This decline continued, and by the 1970s, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] considered the breed vulnerable to extinction. Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening period, but they are still thought to be vulnerable.\n\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clydesdale wagon.jpg|thumb|Two New Zealand Clydesdales pulling a wagon]]\nThe Clydesdale takes its name from [[Clydesdale]], the old name for [[Lanarkshire]], noted for the [[River Clyde]].<ref name=IMH>{{cite web|url=http://imh.org/exhibits/online/clydesdale |title=Clydesdale|publisher=International Museum of the Horse|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In the mid-18th century, [[Flemish]] [[stallion]]s were imported to Scotland and bred to local [[mare]]s, resulting in [[foal]]s that were larger than the existing local stock. These included a [[black (horse)|black]] unnamed stallion imported from England by a John Paterson of Lochlyloch and an unnamed [[bay (horse)|dark-brown]] stallion owned by the [[James Douglas-Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]].<ref name=Society/>\n\nAnother prominent stallion was a {{convert|16.1|hands|cm|disp=flip|0|abbr=on}} [[driving (horse)|coach horse]] stallion of unknown lineage named Blaze. Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early nineteenth century, and in 1806, a [[filly]], later known as \"Lampits mare\" after the farm name of her owner, was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion. This mare is listed in the ancestry of almost every Clydesdale living today. One of her foals was Thompson's Black Horse (known as Glancer), which was to have a significant influence on the Clydesdale breed.<ref name=Society>{{cite web|url=http://www.clydesdalehorsesociety.com/breed-history.html|title=Breed History|publisher=Clydesdale Horse Society|accessdate=4 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909020346/http://clydesdalehorsesociety.com/breed-history.html|archive-date=9 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe first recorded use of the name \"Clydesdale\" in reference to the breed was in 1826 at an exhibition in Glasgow.<ref name=Hendricks/> Another theory of their origin, that of them descending from Flemish horses brought to Scotland as early as the 15th century, was also promulgated in the late 18th century. However, even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely.<ref>Biddell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA system of hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records dating back to 1837.<ref name=IMH/> This programme consisted of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. The owner was then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares.<ref>McNeilage, p. 73</ref> Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England.\n\n[[File:Clydesdale, draw.JPG|thumb|A 1904 drawing of a Clydesdale mare]] \nThrough extensive [[crossbreed]]ing with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same.<ref name=Hendricks>Hendricks, pp. 133\u2013134</ref> In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American [[stud book]] was published in 1882.<ref name=IMH/> In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded to compete with the Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed, who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of [[Shire horse|Shire]] blood into the Clydesdale.<ref name=Edwards>Edwards, pp. 284\u2013285</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with 1617 stallions leaving the country in 1911 alone. Between 1884 and 1945, export certificates were issued for 20,183 horses. These horses were exported to other countries in the [[British Empire]], as well as North and South America, continental Europe, and Russia.<ref name=Society/> \n\nThe [[First World War]] had the conscription of thousands of [[Horses in World War I|horses]] for the war effort, and after the war, breed numbers declined as farms became increasingly mechanised. This decline continued between the wars.  Following the Second World War, the number of Clydesdale breeding stallions in England dropped from more than 200 in 1946 to 80 in 1949.

On average, the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Clydesdales do not have the Sabino 1 (''SB1'') gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds, and researchers theorise that several other genes are responsible for these patterns.<ref name=brooks2005>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Samantha |author2=Ernest Bailey |year=2005 |title=Exon skipping in the KIT gene causes a sabino spotting pattern in horses |journal=Mammalian Genome |volume=16 |pages=893\u2013902 |doi=10.1007/s00335-005-2472-y |pmid=16284805 |issue=11}}</ref> \n\nMany buyers pay a premium for bay and black horses, especially those with four white legs and white facial markings.

These horses were first owned by the [[Anheuser-Busch|Budweiser Brewery]] at the end of [[Prohibition in the United States]], and have since become an international symbol of both the breed and the brand.

Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often [[bay (horse)|bay]] in colour, they show significant [[horse markings|white markings]] due to the presence of [[sabino horse|sabino genetics]]. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draught purposes today. The [[Budweiser Clydesdales]] are some of the most famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British [[Household Cavalry]]. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.\n\nThe breed was developed from [[Flemish]] stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares. The first recorded use of the name \"Clydesdale\" for the breed was in 1826, and by 1830, a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England. The first [[breed registry]] was formed in 1877. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of Clydesdales were exported from Scotland and sent throughout the world, including to Australia and New Zealand, where they became known as \"the breed that built Australia\". \n\nDuring [[World War I]], population numbers began to decline due to increasing mechanisation and war conscription. This decline continued, and by the 1970s, the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] considered the breed vulnerable to extinction. Population numbers have increased slightly in the intervening period, but they are still thought to be vulnerable.\n\n==Breed characteristics==\nThe [[equine conformation|conformation]] of the Clydesdale has changed greatly throughout its history. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was a compact horse smaller than the [[Shire horse|Shire]], [[Percheron]], and [[Belgian horse|Belgian]].

Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early 19th century, and in 1806, a [[filly]], later known as \"Lampits mare\" after the farm name of her owner, was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion.

However, even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely.<ref>Biddell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA system of hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records dating back to 1837.<ref name=IMH/> This program consisted of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. The owner was then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares.<ref>McNeilage, p. 73</ref> Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England.\n\n[[File:Clydesdale, draw.JPG|thumb|A 1904 drawing of a Clydesdale mare]] \nThrough extensive [[crossbreed]]ing with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same.<ref name=Hendricks>Hendricks, pp. 133\u2013134</ref> In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts.
