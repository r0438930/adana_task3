They are composed of multiple masses, or ''[[pluton]]s'', bodies of igneous rock of irregular dimensions (typically at least several kilometers) that can be distinguished from adjacent igneous rock by some combination of criteria including age, composition, texture, or mappable structures. Individual plutons are solidified from magma that traveled toward the surface from a zone of [[partial melting]] near the base of the Earth's crust.\n\n[[File:Vitosha platoto.jpg|thumb|The eroded laccolith above the batholith system of [[Vitosha]] - [[Plana (mountain)|Plana]] domed mountains, next to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]]]\n\nTraditionally, these plutons have been considered to form by ascent of relatively [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] magma in large masses called ''plutonic [[diapir]]s''. Because the diapirs are liquified and very hot, they tend to rise through the surrounding native [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]], pushing it aside and partially melting it. Most diapirs do not reach the surface to form [[volcano]]es, but instead they slow down, cool, and usually solidify 5 to 30 kilometers underground as plutons (hence the use of the word ''pluton''; in reference to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god of the underworld [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]]). An alternate view is that plutons commonly are formed not by ascent of large magma diapirs, but rather by aggregation of smaller volumes of magma that ascend as [[Dike (geology)|dikes]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Clarence A., Jr.|title=Introduction to the geology of southern California and its native plants|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520249325|page=22}}</ref>\n\nA batholith is formed when many plutons converge to form a huge expanse of granitic rock. Some batholiths are mammoth, paralleling past and present [[Subduction|subduction zones]] and other heat sources for hundreds of kilometers in [[continental crust]]. One such batholith is the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]], which is a continuous granitic formation that makes up much of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]]. An even larger batholith, the [[Coast Plutonic Complex]], is found predominantly in the [[Coast Mountains]] of western [[Canada]]; it extends for 1,800 kilometers and reaches into southeastern [[Alaska]].\n\n==Surface expression and erosion==\nA batholith is an exposed area of (mostly) continuous plutonic rock that covers an area larger than 100 square kilometers (40 square miles). Areas smaller than 100 square kilometers are called ''[[Stock (geology)|stocks]]''.<ref>GLENCOE SCIENCE | Earth Science Twelfth Grade High School Textbook (Georgia); pg. 115 paragraph 1, pg. 521 question 9</ref> However, the majority of batholiths visible at the surface (via outcroppings) have areas far greater than 100 square kilometers. These areas are exposed to the surface through the process of [[erosion]] accelerated by [[Orogeny|continental uplift]] acting over many tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. This process has removed several tens of square kilometers of overlying rock in many areas, exposing the once deeply buried batholiths.\n\nBatholiths exposed at the surface are subjected to huge pressure differences between their former location deep in the earth and their new location at or near the surface. As a result, their [[crystal structure]] expands slightly over time. This manifests itself by a form of [[mass wasting]] called [[exfoliation (geology)|exfoliation]]. This form of weathering causes convex and relatively thin sheets of rock to slough off the exposed surfaces of batholiths (a process accelerated by [[Weathering#Frost weathering|frost wedging]]). The result is fairly clean and rounded rock faces. A well-known result of this process is [[Half Dome]] in [[Yosemite Valley]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Africa===\n*Aswan Granite Batholith\n*Cape Coast Batholith, Ghana\n*Paarl Rock, South Africa\n*Darling Batholith, South Africa\n*[[Hook granite massif]], Zambia\n*Mubende Batholith, Uganda\n\n===Antarctica===\n*Antarctic Peninsula Batholith\n*Queen Maud Batholith\n\n===Asia===\n*[[Angara-Vitim batholith]], Siberia\n*[[Bhongir, Telangana|Bhongir]] Fort Batholith, [[Telangana]], India<ref>http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/010616/telangana-bhongir-fort-s-batholith-marvel.html</ref>\n*Mount Abu, India <ref>http://suvratk.blogspot.com/2018/07/mount-abu-geology.html?m=1</ref>\n*[[Gangdese batholith]], Himalaya\n*Trans-Himalayan Batholith, Himalaya\n*[[Kalba-Narym batholith]], Kazakhstan\n*Karakorum Batholith, Himalaya\n*Tak batholith, Thailand\n*Tien Shan batholith, Central Asia\n*Ranchi batholith,Ranchi,India\n\n===Europe===\n*Bindal Batholith, Norway\n*[[Cornubian batholith]], England\n*Corsica-Sardinia Batholith\n*[[Donegal batholith]], Ireland\n*Leinster Batholith, Ireland\n*Mancellian batholith, France\n*[[North Pennine Batholith]], England\n*[[Ljusdal Batholith]], Sweden\n*[[Geology of Andorra|Mt-Louis-Andorra Batholith]]\n*Riga Batholith, Latvia\n*Salmi Batholith, Republic of Karelia, Russia\n*Sunnhordaland Batholith, Norway\n*[[Transscandinavian Igneous Belt]], Sweden and Norway\n:*Revsund Massif\n:*R\u00e4tan Batholith\n:*Sm\u00e5land\u2013V\u00e4rmland Belt\n\n===North America===\n*[[Bald Rock Dome|Bald Rock Batholith]]\n*[[Boulder Batholith]]\n*[[The Baths|British Virgin Islands]]\n*[[Chambers-Strathy Batholith]]\n*[[Enchanted Rock|Town Mountain Granite]] batholith, Texas\n*Golden Horn Batholith\n*[[Idaho Batholith]]\n*Ilimaussaq Batholith, [[Greenland]]\n*[[Kenosha Pass|Kenosha Batholith]]\n*[[Ruby Mountains]]\n*Rio Verde Batholith, Mexico\n*[[Sierra Nevada Batholith]]\n*[[South Mountain (Nova Scotia)|South Mountain Batholith, Nova Scotia]]\n*[[Peninsular Ranges]], [[Baja California (region)|Baja]] and [[Southern California]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BFWXBAAAQBAJ&dq=%22Peninsular+Batholith%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s Douglas M.
