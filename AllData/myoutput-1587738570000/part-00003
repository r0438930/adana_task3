The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and perform institutional leadership.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nHeated wrangling took place between the cities of [[Calgary]] and Edmonton over the location of the provincial capital and of the university. It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it.<ref name=Rutherford/> The city of Edmonton became the capital and the then-separate city of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]] on the south bank of the river, where Premier Alexander Rutherford lived, was granted the university. When the two cities were [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] in 1912, Edmonton became both the political and academic capital.\n\nWith [[Henry Marshall Tory]] as its first president, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908. Forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, on the top floor of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona, while the first campus building, Athabasca Hall, was under construction.<ref name=MacLeod>\"All True Things: A History of the University of Alberta, 1908\u20132008\", Rod Macleod, The University of Alberta Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-88864-444-2}}</ref> In a letter to [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] in early 1906, while he was in the process of setting up [[University of British Columbia|McGill University College]] in [[Vancouver]], Tory wrote, ''\"If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, you should start on a teaching basis.\"''<ref name=ToryQuote>Tory to Rutherford,  March 6, 1906.

But along with these early milestones came the First World War and the global influenza pandemic of 1918, whose toll on the university resulted in a two-month suspension of classes in the fall of 1918.<ref name=MacLeod /> Despite these setbacks, the university continued to grow. By 1920, it had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy).

In addition, the single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. On September 19, 1960, the university opened a new 130-hectare campus in Calgary.<ref name=\"pound2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref> By 1966, the [[University of Calgary]] had been established as an autonomous institution.<ref name=\"MacLeod\" />\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, the university enjoyed sustained growth. In 1970, the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Jean began offering French-language instruction in arts, science and education. In 1984, the School of Native Studies was established. Buildings that had been started in the 1960s, such as Biological Sciences and the Central Academic Building, were completed in the early 1970s. Extensive renovations restored the venerable Arts Building, as well as the Athabasca and Pembina halls.<ref name=Centenary /> New buildings completed in the early 1980s included the Business Building and the first phase of the Walter C.

The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and perform institutional leadership.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nHeated wrangling took place between the cities of [[Calgary]] and Edmonton over the location of the provincial capital and of the university. It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it.<ref name=Rutherford/> The city of Edmonton became the capital and the then-separate city of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]] on the south bank of the river, where Premier Alexander Rutherford lived, was granted the university. When the two cities were [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] in 1912, Edmonton became both the political and academic capital.\n\nWith [[Henry Marshall Tory]] as its first president, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908. Forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, on the top floor of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona, while the first campus building, Athabasca Hall, was under construction.<ref name=MacLeod>\"All True Things: A History of the University of Alberta, 1908\u20132008\", Rod Macleod, The University of Alberta Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-88864-444-2}}</ref> In a letter to [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] in early 1906, while he was in the process of setting up [[University of British Columbia|McGill University College]] in [[Vancouver]], Tory wrote, ''\"If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, you should start on a teaching basis.\"''<ref name=ToryQuote>Tory to Rutherford,  March 6, 1906.

But along with these early milestones came the First World War and the global influenza pandemic of 1918, whose toll on the university resulted in a two-month suspension of classes in the fall of 1918.<ref name=MacLeod /> Despite these setbacks, the university continued to grow. By 1920, it had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy).

In addition, the single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. On September 19, 1960, the university opened a new 130-hectare campus in Calgary.<ref name=\"pound2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref> By 1966, the [[University of Calgary]] had been established as an autonomous institution.<ref name=\"MacLeod\" />\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, the university enjoyed sustained growth. In 1970, the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Jean began offering French-language instruction in arts, science and education. In 1984, the School of Native Studies was established. Buildings that had been started in the 1960s, such as Biological Sciences and the Central Academic Building, were completed in the early 1970s. Extensive renovations restored the venerable Arts Building, as well as the Athabasca and Pembina halls.<ref name=Centenary /> New buildings completed in the early 1980s included the Business Building and the first phase of the Walter C.
