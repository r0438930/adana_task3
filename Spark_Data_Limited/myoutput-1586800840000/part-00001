Czechoslovakia wanted to hold onto this area because of its many valuable [[mining|mines]]. Czechoslovakia sent Czech troops into the German area to stop disorders, and the Vienna press printed reports of Czech troops firing on and killing Germans in that area, including 15\u201320 in [[Kaaden]], 3 in [[Eger]], and 2 in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]]. During this, on about March&nbsp;1, Herr Mayer, Austria's [[Minister of War]] (a native of Eger), went to go to Eger and was arrested at [[Gratzen]] after crossing the border, but was allowed to continue to Eger; two days later he went into Germany via [[Sch\u00e4rding]], and by railway via [[Regensburg]] and [[Passau]] back to Vienna.\n\nIn January 1920 the Czechoslovakian army, breaking prior agreements with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], crossed the demarcation line and by force of arms occupied the [[Zaolzie]], where a 60% majority of the population was Polish, compared to 25% Czechs. After brief fights they made a truce on the power of which Czechoslovakia occupied areas to the west of [[Olza River]]. The Czech claim to [[Lusatia]], which had been part of the Bohemian Kingdom until the [[Thirty Years' War]], was rejected. \n\nOn September&nbsp;10, 1919, Czechoslovakia signed the Minorities Treaty, placing its ethnic minorities under the protection of the [[League of Nations]].\n\n==Statehood==\nThe establishment of the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|Constitution of 1920]] installed a [[parliamentary system]] and [[representative democracy]] with relatively few [[Electoral district|constituents]] for each representative. This allowed a great variety of [[Political party|political parties]] to emerge, with no clear front runner or leading political entity.\n\n[[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk|Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] was elected the country's first president in the 1920 election and his guidance helped to hold the country together. A coalition of five Czechoslovak parties, which became known as the \"[[P\u011btka]]\" (The Five), constituted the backbone of the government and maintained stability. Prime Minister [[Antonin Svehla]] led the P\u011btka for most of the 1920s and designed a pattern of coalition politics that survived until 1938. Masaryk was re-elected in 1925 and 1929, serving as President until December&nbsp;14, 1935 when he resigned due to poor health. He was succeeded by [[Edvard Bene\u0161]].\n\n[[Image:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|250px|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]\n\nBene\u0161 had served as Czechoslovak [[foreign minister]] from 1918 to 1935, and created the system of alliances that determined the republic's international stance until 1938. A democratic statesman of Western orientation, Bene\u0161 relied heavily on the [[League of Nations]] as guarantor of the post war [[status quo]] and the security of newly formed states. He negotiated the [[Little Entente]] (an alliance with [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]]) in 1921 to counter [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[revanchism]] and [[Habsburg]] restoration.\n\nThe leaders of Czechoslovakia needed to find solutions for the multiplicity of cultures living within one country. From 1928 and 1940, Czechoslovakia was divided into the four \"lands\" ({{lang-cs|zem\u011b}}, {{lang-sk|krajiny}}); Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Although in 1927 assemblies were provided for Bohemia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, their jurisdiction was limited to adjusting laws and regulations of the central government to local needs. National minorities were assured special protection; in districts where they constituted 20% of the population, members of minority groups were granted full freedom to use their language in everyday life, in schools, and in matters dealing with authorities. [[Germany|German]] parties also participated in the government starting in 1926, while [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] parties, supporting Hungarian irredentist claims, never joined the Czechoslovak government but were not openly hostile to it.\n\n==Growing conflict==\nDue to Czechoslovakia's centralized political structure, nationalism arose in the non-Czech nationalities, and several parties and movements were formed with the aim of broader political autonomy.  The [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party|Slovak People's Party]] led by [[Andrej Hlinka]] is an example.\n\nWhen German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, fear of German aggression became widespread in eastern Central Europe. Bene\u0161 ignored the possibility of a stronger Central European alliance system, remaining faithful to his Western policy. He did, however, seek the participation of the [[Soviet Union]] in an alliance to include [[France]]. (Bene\u0161's earlier attitude towards the Soviet regime had been one of caution.) In 1935 the Soviet Union signed treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. In essence, the treaties provided that the Soviet Union would come to Czechoslovakia's aid, but only if French assistance came first. Hitler himself remarked to his foreign minister von Neurath and top military officials in 1937 that he intended to absorb Bohemia and Austria, with a vague sentence about the need to expel two million Czechs and the eventual elimination of the Czech nation.<ref>''Prague in black: Nazi rule and Czech nationalism, p. 108\u2013109, Chad Carl Bryant, Harvard University Press 2007</ref>\n\nThere was [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|a large German minority in Czechoslovakia]], mostly living in [[Sudetenland]]. \n[[File:Czechoslovakia1930linguistic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Linguistic map of interwar Czechoslovakia (c. 1930).]]\nThey demanded [[autonomy]] within Czechoslovakia, claiming they were oppressed by the national government. The political vehicle for this agitation was the newly founded [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' - SdP) led by [[Konrad Henlein]], and financed with Nazi money. {{Citation needed|reason=other sources tell that the rise of the SdP started before the rise of the Nazis|date=February 2019}} In the 1935 Parliamentary elections, the SdP had a surprise success, securing over 2/3 of the [[Sudeten German]] vote. This worsened diplomatic relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Hitler met with Henlein in Berlin on March&nbsp;28, 1938, and ordered him to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. On April&nbsp;24, the SdP issued the [[Carlsbad Programme]], demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. If these demands were granted, the Sudetenland could then align with Nazi Germany.\n\nOn 17 September 1938 Adolf Hitler ordered the establishment of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]], a paramilitary organization that took over the structure of Ordnersgruppe, an organization of ethnic-Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day due to its implication in large number of terrorist activities. The organization was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducting cross border terrorist operations into Czechoslovak territory. Relying on the [[War of aggression#The Convention for the Definition of Aggression|Convention for the Definition of Aggression]], Czechoslovak president [[Edvard Bene\u0161]]<ref>President Bene\u0161' declaration made on 16 December 1941</ref> and the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|government-in-exile]]<ref>Note of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile dated 22 February 1944</ref> later regarded 17 September 1938 as the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war.

He was succeeded by [[Edvard Bene\u0161]].\n\n[[Image:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|250px|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]\n\nBene\u0161 had served as Czechoslovak [[foreign minister]] from 1918 to 1935, and created the system of alliances that determined the republic's international stance until 1938. A democratic statesman of Western orientation, Bene\u0161 relied heavily on the [[League of Nations]] as guarantor of the post war [[status quo]] and the security of newly formed states. He negotiated the [[Little Entente]] (an alliance with [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]]) in 1921 to counter [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[revanchism]] and [[Habsburg]] restoration.\n\nThe leaders of Czechoslovakia needed to find solutions for the multiplicity of cultures living within one country. From 1928 and 1940, Czechoslovakia was divided into the four \"lands\" ([[Czech language|Czech]]: \"zem\u011b\", [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: \"krajiny\"); Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Although in 1927 assemblies were provided for Bohemia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, their jurisdiction was limited to adjusting laws and regulations of the central government to local needs. National minorities were assured special protection; in districts where they constituted 20% of the population, members of minority groups were granted full freedom to use their language in everyday life, in schools, and in matters dealing with authorities. [[Germany|German]] parties also participated in the government starting in 1926, while [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] parties, supporting Hungarian irredentist claims, never joined the Czechoslovak government but were not openly hostile to it.\n\n==Growing conflict==\nDue to Czechoslovakia's centralized political structure, nationalism arose in the non-Czech nationalities, and several parties and movements were formed with the aim of broader political autonomy.  The [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party|Slovak People's Party]] led by [[Andrej Hlinka]] is an example.\n\nWhen German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, fear of German aggression became widespread in eastern Central Europe. Bene\u0161 ignored the possibility of a stronger Central European alliance system, remaining faithful to his Western policy. He did, however, seek the participation of the [[Soviet Union]] in an alliance to include [[France]]. (Bene\u0161's earlier attitude towards the Soviet regime had been one of caution.) In 1935 the Soviet Union signed treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. In essence, the treaties provided that the Soviet Union would come to Czechoslovakia's aid, but only if French assistance came first. Hitler himself remarked to his foreign minister von Neurath and top military officials in 1937 that he intended to absorb Bohemia and Austria, with a vague sentence about the need to expel two million Czechs and the eventual elimination of the Czech nation.<ref>''Prague in black: Nazi rule and Czech nationalism, p. 108\u2013109, Chad Carl Bryant, Harvard University Press 2007</ref>\n\nThere was [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|a large German minority in Czechoslovakia]], mostly living in [[Sudetenland]]. \n[[File:Czechoslovakia1930linguistic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Linguistic map of interwar Czechoslovakia (c. 1930).]]\nThey demanded [[autonomy]] within Czechoslovakia, claiming they were oppressed by the national government. The political vehicle for this agitation was the newly founded [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' - SdP) led by [[Konrad Henlein]], and financed with Nazi money. {{Citation needed|reason=other sources tell that the rise of the SdP started before the rise of the Nazis|date=February 2019}} In the 1935 Parliamentary elections, the SdP had a surprise success, securing over 2/3 of the [[Sudeten German]] vote. This worsened diplomatic relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Hitler met with Henlein in Berlin on March&nbsp;28, 1938, and ordered him to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. On April&nbsp;24, the SdP issued the [[Carlsbad Programme]], demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. If these demands were granted, the Sudetenland could then align with Nazi Germany.\n\nOn 17 September 1938 Adolf Hitler ordered the establishment of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]], a paramilitary organization that took over the structure of Ordnersgruppe, an organization of ethnic-Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day due to its implication in large number of terrorist activities. The organization was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducting cross border terrorist operations into Czechoslovak territory. Relying on the [[War of aggression#The Convention for the Definition of Aggression|Convention for the Definition of Aggression]], Czechoslovak president [[Edvard Bene\u0161]]<ref>President Bene\u0161' declaration made on 16 December 1941</ref> and the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|government-in-exile]]<ref>Note of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile dated 22 February 1944</ref> later regarded 17 September 1938 as the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war. This understanding has been assumed also by the contemporary [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Czech Constitutional court]].<ref name=\"Con Court ruling\">{{Citation\n| last       = Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic\n| first      = \n| year       = 1997\n| title      = Ruling No. II. \u00daS 307/97\n| publisher  = \n| publication-place = Brno\n| page       = \n| url        = \n| accessdate = \n| language   = Czech\n}} ''Stran interpretace \"kdy zem\u011b vede v\u00e1lku\", obsa\u017een\u00e9 v \u010dl.
