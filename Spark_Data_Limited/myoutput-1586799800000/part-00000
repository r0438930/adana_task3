Sablan justified the action by saying that he was giving the fans a preview of the Tigers' future brand of basketball, in reference to the trio and Akomo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/10/16/touted-as-the-future-steve-akomo-vows-to-do-best-for-ust |title=Touted as 'the future,' Steve Akomo vows to do best for UST |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|author=Naredo, Camille B. |access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref>\n*'''The Past'''\nFormer head coach [[Pido Jarencio]], who gave the Tigers the [[UAAP Season 69 basketball tournaments|2006 UAAP Championship]] title and a back-to-back finals appearances in 2012 and 2013, indirectly gave the UST community a glimmer of hope when he sent out a controversial [[Twitter|tweet]] from his [[social media]] account on December 6.\n\nThe message reads, \"I am just a call away,\" and a follow-up [[Twitter|tweet]] had Jarencio exclaiming, \"let's bring back the glory!\"\n\nFans were quick to attribute his messages to the dismal performance of the team in the tournament, which was quite the opposite of their finals run the previous year. Jarencio later confirmed in interviews that he was actually willing to come back to coach the team on two conditions: if the position for head coach became vacant and if the management and the UST community wanted him back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/ust/156286-pido-jarencio-open-ust-coaching-return-if-called |title=Jarencio open to UST coaching return if called upon |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJarencio resigned as UST's head coach in January 2014 in exchange for a coaching job in the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/philippines/48979-end-of-an-era-pido-jarencio-leaves-ust-moves-to-globalport |title=End of an era: Pido Jarencio leaves UST, moves to Globalport |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref>\n*'''Departure of Key Players'''\nOn May 4, Renzo Subido announced his plan to skip the upcoming [[UAAP Season 80 basketball tournaments|UAAP Season 80 basketball tournament]].

Sablan justified the action by saying that he was giving the fans a preview of the Tigers' future brand of basketball, in reference to the trio and Akomo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/10/16/touted-as-the-future-steve-akomo-vows-to-do-best-for-ust |title=Touted as 'the future,' Steve Akomo vows to do best for UST |website=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|author=Naredo, Camille B. |access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref>\n*'''The Past'''\nFormer head coach [[Pido Jarencio]], who gave the Tigers the [[UAAP Season 69 basketball tournaments|2006 UAAP Championship]] title and a back-to-back finals appearances in 2012 and 2013, indirectly gave the UST community a glimmer of hope when he sent out a controversial [[Twitter|tweet]] from his [[social media]] account on December 6.\n\nThe message reads, \"I am just a call away,\" and a follow-up [[Twitter|tweet]] had Jarencio exclaiming, \"let's bring back the glory!\"\n\nFans were quick to attribute his messages to the dismal performance of the team in the tournament, which was quite the opposite of their finals run the previous year. Jarencio later confirmed in interviews that he was actually willing to come back to coach the team on two conditions: if the position for head coach became vacant and if the management and the UST community wanted him back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/ust/156286-pido-jarencio-open-ust-coaching-return-if-called |title=Jarencio open to UST coaching return if called upon |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJarencio resigned as UST's head coach in January 2014 in exchange for a coaching job in the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/philippines/48979-end-of-an-era-pido-jarencio-leaves-ust-moves-to-globalport |title=End of an era: Pido Jarencio leaves UST, moves to Globalport |website=[[Rappler]]|author=Bracher, Jane |access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref>\n*'''Departure of Key Players'''\nOn May 4, Renzo Subido announced his plan to skip the upcoming [[UAAP Season 80 basketball tournaments|UAAP Season 80 basketball tournament]].

On May 11, he had cited experiencing [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] as one of the reasons for wanting to leave the team. He also expressed his intention to join a [[PBA Developmental League|D-League]] team during his time away from the Tigers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/sports/basketball/20170511/bonleon-to-miss-next-uaap-cites-burnout |title=Bonleon to miss next UAAP, cites 'burnout' |website=[[The Varsitarian]]|author=Suing, Ivan Ruiz L. |access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>\n*'''Rumored Dissatisfaction With the Coach'''\nThe Growling Tigers joined the [[2017 Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup|Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup]] in the summer, but failed to make it past the elimination round, losing 7 games against only 1 win.
