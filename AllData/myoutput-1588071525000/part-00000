''M. sexta'' has five larval [[instar]]s, which are separated by [[ecdysis]] (molting), but may add larval instars when nutrient conditions are poor. Near the end of this stage, the caterpillar seeks a location for [[pupa]]tion, burrows underground, and pupates. The searching behaviour is known as \"wandering\".

Often people mistake this stage for a dead or dying caterpillar.\n\n=== Pupa ===\nThe pupal stage lasts approximately 18 days under laboratory conditions (17 hours light, 7 hours dark, 27&nbsp;\u00b0C). When reared on a short-day [[photoperiod]] (12 hours light, 12 hours dark), pupae enter a state of [[diapause]] that can last several months. During the pupal stage, structures of the adult moth form within the pupal case, which is shed during [[eclosion]] (adult emergence).\n\n=== Adult ===\nAdult ''M. sexta'' have narrow wings with a wing span of approximately 100&nbsp;mm. ''M. sexta'' moths are [[nectarivorous]] and feed on flowers, demonstrating a remarkable ability to hover.\n\nAdults are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Males are identifiable by their broader [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and the presence of [[valva|claspers]] at the end of the [[abdomen]]. Female moths are typically ready to mate one week after [[eclosion]], and do so only once. Males may mate many times. Mating generally occurs on a vertical surface at night, and can last several hours, with the male and female facing in opposite positions, their posterior ends touching.  After mating, females deposit their fertilized eggs on foliage, usually on the underside of leaves.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" >\nManduca sexta MHNT CUT 2010 0 104 Caranavi, La Paz Bolivia male dorsal.jpg|Male\nManduca sexta MHNT CUT 2010 0 104 Caranavi, La Paz Bolivia male ventral.jpg|Male underside\nManduca sexta MHNT CUT 2010 0 104 Dos Amates Catemaco VeraCruz Mexico female dorsal.jpg|Female\nManduca sexta MHNT CUT 2010 0 104 Dos Amates Catemaco VeraCruz Mexico female ventral.jpg|Female underside\n</gallery>\n\n=== Laboratory rearing ===\n\nLike ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', ''M. sexta'' is commonly used as a [[model organism]] for experiments.  They are frequently studied in the laboratory due to their large size and relative ease of rearing.  They may be reared on host plants, such as tobacco and tobacco relatives, tomato plants, or wheat-germ-based artificial diet.  Their rearing is straightforward, as long as they receive a \"long day\" (i.e., 14 hour) daylight cycle during development to prevent [[diapause]].\n\nEggs are rinsed for one to five minutes in dilute household bleach for disinfection<!--, at [[Binghamton University]] .05% [[Clorox]] is used-->.\n\nEggs are placed on diet cubes or host plants.  The eggs hatch and develop at different speeds depending on temperature.  The larvae are moved to fresh diet or leaves as their food spoils or is consumed.  When they start to \"wander\", they are about to pupate, so are placed in a pupation chamber.  Pupation chambers are holes drilled into a wood board.  The ''Manduca'' larvae are sealed in the chamber using a stopper and allowed to pupate.  After pupation, the pupae are placed in a breeding or colony chamber to [[Eclosion|eclose]].  Providing a cup of sugar water and a tobacco (or related) plant will allow mated females to [[oviposit]] fertile eggs, which can then be reared.\n\nWhen fed an artificial diet, ''Manduca'' larvae do not consume the [[xanthophyll]] -which is a yellow pigment- needed to produce their green coloration; instead they appear blue.  On some diets, they have very little pigment and pigment precursors, so are a very pale blue-white.  As vitamin A and other [[carotenoids]] are necessary for the visual pigments ([[rhodopsin]]), an artificial-diet-reared hornworm may have poor vision due to lack of carotenoids in the diet.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== As pet food ===\n\nCaptive-bred hornworms fed on an artificial diet are often given to insectivorous exotic animals, such as certain [[reptile]]s, fish and small [[mammal]]s. They are preferred over wild-collected hornworms, which may [[bioaccumulate]] poisonous substances found in dietary plants. Hornworms, though originally bred for laboratories, are also farmed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlakeshornworm.com/|title=Great Lakes Hornworms|website=Great Lakes Hornworm}}</ref><ref>http://www.mulberryfarms.com/Live-Hornworms-c51/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbowmealworms.net/hornworms|title=Hornworms AKA Goliath Worms|website=Rainbow Mealworms}}</ref> They are often sold already-packed into pods that include everything the larvae need, including food.

However, the larvae prefer solanaceous plants, such as tobacco and tomato plants. On these types of plants, larvae grow and develop faster. The lateral and medial [[sensilla]] styloconia, which are sensory receptors, on their mouthparts help them to identify solanaceous plants by recognizing indioside D, a steroidal glycoside found in those particular plants (del Campo et al., 2001).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=del Campo | first1=M.L. | last2=Miles | first2=C.I. | last3=Schroeder | first3=F.C. | last4=Mueller | first4=C. | last5=Booker | first5=R. | last6=Renwick | first6=J.A. | title=Host recognition by the tobacco hornworm is mediated by a host plant compound | journal=Nature | volume=411 | pages=186\u2013189 | year=2001 | issue=6834 | doi=10.1038/35075559 | pmid=11346793}}</ref> Tobacco hornworms are considered pests because they feed on the upper leaves of tobacco plants and leave green or black droppings on the plants.

When dehydrated, tobacco hornworm larvae will move towards a source of water or to an area with a high relative level of humidity. They use their antennae to locate water to drink (Rowley and Hanson, 2007).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Rowley | first1=M. | last2=Hanson | first2=F. | title=Humidity detection and hygropreference behavior in larvae of the tobacco hornworm, ''Manduca sexta'' | journal=Journal of Insect Science | volume=7 | issue=39 | pages=1\u201310 | year=2007 | pmc=2999434 | pmid=20302460 | doi=10.1673/031.007.3901}}</ref>\n\n=== Defense ===\n\n[[Nicotine]] is poisonous to most animals that use muscles to move because nicotine targets the [[acetylcholine receptor]] at the neuromuscular junction. However, the tobacco hornworm is capable of metabolizing nicotine from the tobacco plant and using nicotine as a defense against predators. It possesses a gene called cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) that converts nicotine into a metabolite. About 0.65% of nicotine metabolites are transported from the gut to the [[hemolymph]], where they are reconverted to nicotine and released into the air from the tobacco hornworm's spiracles. The emitted nicotine is used as a way to deter spiders, a practice known as \u201ctoxic halitosis.\u201d  In one study, tobacco hornworms that fed from nicotine-deficient plants or expressed low levels of CYP6B46 were more susceptible to wolf spider predation (Kumar et al., 2013).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Kumar | first1=P. | last2=Pandit | first2=S.S. | last3=Steppuhn | first3=A. | last4=Baldwin | first4=I.T. | title=Natural history-driven, plant-mediated RNAi-based study reveals ''CYP6B46''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s role in a nicotine-mediated antipredator herbivore defense | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | pages=1245\u201352 | year=2013 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/12/27/1314848111 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1314848111 | pmid=24379363 | volume=111| issue=4 | pmc=3910579 }}</ref>\n\nTobacco hornworm caterpillars emit short clicking sounds from their mandibles when they are being attacked. This sound production is believed to be a type of acoustic aposematism, or warning sounds that let predators know that trying to eat them will be troublesome; tobacco hornworms have been observed to thrash and bite predators after producing those clicking sounds. These clicks can be heard at a close distance with a frequency range of 5 to 50&nbsp;kHz. The intensity of clicks increases with the number of attacks (Bura et al., 2012).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Bura | first1=V.L. | last2=Hnain | first2=A.K. | last3=Hick | first3=J.N. | last4=Yack | first4=J.E. | title=Defensive sound production in the tobacco hornworm, ''Manduca sexta'' (Bombycoidea: Sphingidae) | journal=Journal of Insect Behavior | volume=25 | issue=2 | pages=114\u2013126 | year=2012 | doi=10.1007/s10905-011-9282-8}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Britishentomologyvolume5Plate195.jpg|Illustration from [[John Curtis (entomologist)|John Curtis]]'s ''[[British Entomology]]'' Volume 5, possibly the only British record for this species\nFile:Manduca sexta on tomato.JPG|Feeding on tomato plant\nFile:Tomato Hornworm Parasitized by Braconid Wasp.jpg|''Manduca sexta'' parasitized by [[braconidae]] wasp larvae\nFile:Tobacco Hornworm with cocoons.jpg|A tobacco hornworm with wasp cocoons\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.070896 |title=Spatial accuracy of a rapid defense behavior in caterpillars |year=2013 |last1=Van Griethuijsen |first1=L.

Often people mistake this stage for a dead or dying caterpillar.\n\n=== Pupa ===\nThe pupal stage lasts approximately 18 days under laboratory conditions (17 hours light, 7 hours dark, 27&nbsp;\u00b0C). When reared on a short-day [[photoperiod]] (12 hours light, 12 hours dark), pupae enter a state of [[diapause]] that can last several months. During the pupal stage, structures of the adult moth form within the pupal case, which is shed during [[eclosion]] (adult emergence).\n\n=== Adult ===\nAdult ''M. sexta'' have narrow wings with a wing span of approximately 100&nbsp;mm. ''M. sexta'' moths are [[nectarivorous]] and feed on flowers, demonstrating a remarkable ability to hover.\n\nAdults are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Males are identifiable by their broader [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and the presence of [[valva|claspers]] at the end of the [[abdomen]]. Female moths are typically ready to mate one week after [[eclosion]], and do so only once. Males may mate many times. Mating generally occurs on a vertical surface at night, and can last several hours, with the male and female facing in opposite positions, their posterior ends touching.  After mating, females deposit their fertilized eggs on foliage, usually on the underside of leaves.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" >\nManduca sexta MHNT CUT 2010 0 104 Caranavi, La Paz Bolivia male dorsal.jpg|Male\nManduca sexta MHNT CUT 2010 0 104 Caranavi, La Paz Bolivia male ventral.jpg|Male underside\nManduca sexta MHNT CUT 2010 0 104 Dos Amates Catemaco VeraCruz Mexico female dorsal.jpg|Female\nManduca sexta MHNT CUT 2010 0 104 Dos Amates Catemaco VeraCruz Mexico female ventral.jpg|Female underside\n</gallery>\n\n=== Laboratory rearing ===\n\nLike ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', ''M. sexta'' is commonly used as a [[model organism]] for experiments.  They are frequently studied in the laboratory due to their large size and relative ease of rearing.  They may be reared on host plants, such as tobacco and tobacco relatives, tomato plants, or wheat-germ-based artificial diet.  Their rearing is straightforward, as long as they receive a \"long day\" (i.e., 14 hour) daylight cycle during development to prevent [[diapause]].\n\nEggs are rinsed for one to five minutes in dilute household bleach for disinfection<!--, at [[Binghamton University]] .05% [[Clorox]] is used-->.\n\nEggs are placed on diet cubes or host plants.  The eggs hatch and develop at different speeds depending on temperature.  The larvae are moved to fresh diet or leaves as their food spoils or is consumed.  When they start to \"wander\", they are about to pupate, so are placed in a pupation chamber.  Pupation chambers are holes drilled into a wood board.  The ''Manduca'' larvae are sealed in the chamber using a stopper and allowed to pupate.  After pupation, the pupae are placed in a breeding or colony chamber to [[Eclosion|eclose]].  Providing a cup of sugar water and a tobacco (or related) plant will allow mated females to [[oviposit]] fertile eggs, which can then be reared.\n\nWhen fed an artificial diet, ''Manduca'' larvae do not consume the [[xanthophyll]] -which is a yellow pigment- needed to produce their green coloration; instead they appear blue.  On some diets, they have very little pigment and pigment precursors, so are a very pale blue-white.  As vitamin A and other [[carotenoids]] are necessary for the visual pigments ([[rhodopsin]]), an artificial-diet-reared hornworm may have poor vision due to lack of carotenoids in the diet.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== As pet food ===\n\nCaptive-bred hornworms fed on an artificial diet are often given to insectivorous exotic animals, such as certain [[reptile]]s, fish and small [[mammal]]s. They are preferred over wild-collected hornworms, which may [[bioaccumulate]] poisonous substances found in dietary plants. Hornworms, though originally bred for laboratories, are also farmed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlakeshornworm.com/|title=Great Lakes Hornworms|website=Great Lakes Hornworm}}</ref><ref>http://www.mulberryfarms.com/Live-Hornworms-c51/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbowmealworms.net/hornworms|title=Hornworms AKA Goliath Worms|website=Rainbow Mealworms}}</ref> They are often sold already-packed into pods that include everything the larvae need, including food.

However, the larvae prefer solanaceous plants, such as tobacco and tomato plants. On these types of plants, larvae grow and develop faster. The lateral and medial [[sensilla]] styloconia, which are sensory receptors, on their mouthparts help them to identify solanaceous plants by recognizing indioside D, a steroidal glycoside found in those particular plants (del Campo et al., 2001).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=del Campo | first1=M.L. | last2=Miles | first2=C.I. | last3=Schroeder | first3=F.C. | last4=Mueller | first4=C. | last5=Booker | first5=R. | last6=Renwick | first6=J.A. | title=Host recognition by the tobacco hornworm is mediated by a host plant compound | journal=Nature | volume=411 | pages=186\u2013189 | year=2001 | issue=6834 | doi=10.1038/35075559 | pmid=11346793}}</ref> Tobacco hornworms are considered pests because they feed on the upper leaves of tobacco plants and leave green or black droppings on the plants.

When dehydrated, tobacco hornworm larvae will move towards a source of water or to an area with a high relative level of humidity. They use their antennae to locate water to drink (Rowley and Hanson, 2007).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Rowley | first1=M. | last2=Hanson | first2=F. | title=Humidity detection and hygropreference behavior in larvae of the tobacco hornworm, ''Manduca sexta'' | journal=Journal of Insect Science | volume=7 | issue=39 | pages=1\u201310 | year=2007 | pmc=2999434 | pmid=20302460 | doi=10.1673/031.007.3901}}</ref>\n\n=== Defense ===\n\n[[Nicotine]] is poisonous to most animals that use muscles to move because nicotine targets the [[acetylcholine receptor]] at the neuromuscular junction. However, the tobacco hornworm is capable of metabolizing nicotine from the tobacco plant and using nicotine as a defense against predators. It possesses a gene called cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) that converts nicotine into a metabolite. About 0.65% of nicotine metabolites are transported from the gut to the [[hemolymph]], where they are reconverted to nicotine and released into the air from the tobacco hornworm's spiracles. The emitted nicotine is used as a way to deter spiders, a practice known as \u201ctoxic halitosis.\u201d  In one study, tobacco hornworms that fed from nicotine-deficient plants or expressed low levels of CYP6B46 were more susceptible to wolf spider predation (Kumar et al., 2013).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Kumar | first1=P. | last2=Pandit | first2=S.S. | last3=Steppuhn | first3=A. | last4=Baldwin | first4=I.T. | title=Natural history-driven, plant-mediated RNAi-based study reveals ''CYP6B46''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s role in a nicotine-mediated antipredator herbivore defense | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | pages=1245\u201352 | year=2013 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/12/27/1314848111 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1314848111 | pmid=24379363 | volume=111| issue=4 | pmc=3910579 }}</ref>\n\nTobacco hornworm caterpillars emit short clicking sounds from their mandibles when they are being attacked. This sound production is believed to be a type of acoustic aposematism, or warning sounds that let predators know that trying to eat them will be troublesome; tobacco hornworms have been observed to thrash and bite predators after producing those clicking sounds. These clicks can be heard at a close distance with a frequency range of 5 to 50&nbsp;kHz. The intensity of clicks increases with the number of attacks (Bura et al., 2012).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Bura | first1=V.L. | last2=Hnain | first2=A.K. | last3=Hick | first3=J.N. | last4=Yack | first4=J.E. | title=Defensive sound production in the tobacco hornworm, ''Manduca sexta'' (Bombycoidea: Sphingidae) | journal=Journal of Insect Behavior | volume=25 | issue=2 | pages=114\u2013126 | year=2012 | doi=10.1007/s10905-011-9282-8}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Britishentomologyvolume5Plate195.jpg|Illustration from [[John Curtis (entomologist)|John Curtis]]'s ''[[British Entomology]]'' Volume 5, possibly the only British record for this species\nFile:Manduca sexta on tomato.JPG|Feeding on tomato plant\nFile:Tomato Hornworm Parasitized by Braconid Wasp.jpg|''Manduca sexta'' parasitized by [[braconidae]] wasp larvae\nFile:Tobacco Hornworm with cocoons.jpg|A tobacco hornworm with wasp cocoons\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.070896 |title=Spatial accuracy of a rapid defense behavior in caterpillars |year=2013 |last1=Van Griethuijsen |first1=L.
