It stands near the confluence of the two sources of the river [[Danube]] (in {{lang-de|Donau}}; the town's name is an [[eponym]]).\n\nDonaueschingen stands in a [[Drainage basin|basin]] within low mountainous terrain. It is located about {{convert|13|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Villingen-Schwenningen]], {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Tuttlingen]], and about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} north of the Swiss town of [[Schaffhausen]]. In 2015 the population was 21,750, making it the second largest town in the district (''Kreis'') of Schwarzwald-Baar. It is a regional rail hub.\n\n==Geography==\nDonaueschingen lies in the [[Baar (region)|Baar]] basin in the southern [[Black Forest]] at the confluence of the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] rivers\u2014 the two source tributaries of the [[Danube]]\u2014 from which the town gets its name. This is today considered the true source of the Danube.\n\n[[File:Donauquelle 4168.jpg|thumb|right|Source of the Donaubach in Donaueschingen (historically considered the source of the Danube)]]\nAn enclosed [[karst spring]] on the castle grounds, the source of the \"Donaubach\", is known as the [[source of the Danube]].\n\nThe municipal area extends continuously from the [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] of the Black Forest through the [[Triassic]] formations of the Schwarzwald-Baar [[talus slope|talus]] to the [[Swabian Alb]], and exhibits all [[strata]] of the southern German [[cuesta]] country. The heights decrease from {{convert|1020|m|ft}} in the Black Forest to about {{convert|660|m|ft}} on the Baar plateau, then increase to above the {{convert|900|m|ft}} mark again at the Swabian Alb. A model showing the extraordinary geological setting of the city and its surrounding region is located in the park opposite the train station.\n\nThe town is close to Lake [[Titisee]] and less than an hour's drive from both [[Switzerland]] and [[France]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Adel im Wandel337.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The town of Donaueschingen in 1827]]\n[[Image:Brandkatastrophe in Donaueschingen 1908.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Destruction after the August 1908 fire]]\n\nDonaueschingen is first recorded as ''Esginga'' in 889; the modern form of the name is first attested in 1292.<ref>Berger, Dieter, ''Duden. Geographische Names in Deutschland'', 2nd edition, Duden 1999.</ref> In 1283, [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph von Habsburg]] granted the principality of Baar and Donaueschingen to Heinrich von [[F\u00fcrstenberg (state)|F\u00fcrstenberg]]. The right to brew beer was also connected with this grant. This is the source of the [[Royal F\u00fcrstenberg Brewery]]. In 1488, possession was passed to the Count of [[F\u00fcrstenberg-Baar]]. From the 18th Century it was the residence of the [[F\u00fcrstenberg-F\u00fcrstenberg|Princes of F\u00fcrstenberg]]. In 1806, Donaueschingen came under the rule of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] and was granted township in 1810. A large part of the town was destroyed by fire in 1908. Donaueschingen has a tradition as a military garrison; since [[World War II]] the [[French military]] has maintained barracks in the town, and, until the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Air Force]] operated a contingency hospital there. The hospital never received casualties on a large scale from military operations; it saw the most activity in 1989, when the [[United States]] offered the facility as temporary housing for refugees leaving from [[East Germany]] to the West.\n\nThough the Princes of F\u00fcrstenberg were nominally [[German Mediatisation|mediatised]] and deposed as absolute ruler of the principality, they still own huge property in their former lands, including their palace with the surrounding parks and gardens. The Schlosspark (palace gardens) which used to be public and the only park accessible to the citizens of the town since 1806 recently became off-limits again. The Princes of F\u00fcrstenberg were also the owners of an important manuscript of the [[Nibelungenlied]] (Manuscript C) until they sold it in 2001. The ancestral brewery has also been sold.\n\n==Government==\nThe results of the 2014 local elections are as follows:\n\n{|\n| [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] || : 13 Seats\n|----\n| [[Freie Demokratische Partei|FDP]]/FW || : 6 Seats\n|----\n| [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|SPD]] || : 6 Seats\n|----\n| Independents || : 5 Seats\n|----\n| [[B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen]] || : 6 Seats\n|}\n\n==Economy==\nThe town's economy consists of nearly 1,000 various enterprises, of which 24 are medium-sized employing 2,200 people. The most important industries are machine assembly, [[semiconductors]], [[injection moulding]], magnetics, [[dyes]], and shoe manufacturing.\n\n===Transport===\n[[Donaueschingen station]] is a regional rail hub; four rail lines join in the town. It sits on the [[Black Forest Railway (Baden)|Schwarzwaldbahn]] line from [[Offenburg]] to [[Konstanz]] and it is the start of the [[H\u00f6llentalbahn (Black Forest)|H\u00f6llentalbahn]] from Donaueschingen to [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. Both of these lines are uniquely constructed because of the rough Black Forest terrain they cover. Donaueschingen is also the starting point for the [[Danube Valley Railway (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg)|Donautalbahn]] and the [[Bregtalbahn]], which run to [[Ulm]] and [[Br\u00e4unlingen]] respectively. The town is part of the Schwarzwald-Baar public transport system.\n\nThe town is on the A 864, a spur of the A 81 to [[Stuttgart]]. Three federal highways meet in the vicinity of Donaueschingen: the B 27 from Stuttgart to Schaffhausen; the B 31 from Freiburg im Breisgau to Lindau and the B 33 from Offenburg to Konstanz.\n\nThe long-distance [[Donauradweg|Danube Cycle Trail]] begins in Donaueschingen and follows the course of the Danube. It is one of the best-known and longest bicycle trails in Europe.\n\n==Education==\nThe town has four secondary schools: the [[F\u00fcrstenberg-Gymnasium]] and the Wirtschaftsgymnasium, one Realschule, and one Hauptschule. There are four elementary schools associated with these schools: Eichendorffschule, Erich-K\u00e4stner-Schule, Grundschule Pfohren, and the Grundschule Wolterdingen. There are two special-needs schools: the Heinrich-Feuerstein-Schule and the Karl-Wacker-Schule.\n\nThere are two professional training schools: the Donaueschingen Commercial School and the Business and Home Economics Schools. There is also the Nursing College and the College for Agriculture. The Academy for Further Education and Personal Development is located in the former district hospital.\n\n==Culture==\nThe [[Donaueschingen Festival]] for contemporary music (\"Donaueschinger Musiktage\"), founded in 1921 and one of the world's oldest festivals for [[Contemporary classical music|new music]], takes place every year in October. Guest composers have included [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Elliott Carter]], [[John Cage]], and [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]].\n\nThe F\u00fcrstenberg Library in Donaueschingen holds early copies of five of [[Mozart]]'s operas, which have been an important source in reviving [[Historically informed performance|historically informed]] performances of 18th-century opera.<ref>Phelan, Nancy.
