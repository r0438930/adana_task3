Raburn signed and began playing in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]] at third base, his natural position. He originally was a member of the [[Gulf Coast League Tigers]], but was brought up to play on the [[Oneonta Tigers]] in July 2001. In 2001, Raburn was a part of [[Baseball America]]'s short-season all-star team. At one point, he was the [[New York\u2013Penn League]]'s player of the week and his eight [[triple (baseball)|triples]] were the most in that league during the season. However, Raburn also committed 23 errors, which tied for the league most by third basemen. After the 2001 season was over, Baseball America named Raburn as Detroit's 18th-best prospect.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nRaburn began 2002 unable to play because of a right hip strain. In July, he got back into action with a rehab stint in the Gulf Coast League. On July 17, he joined the [[West Michigan Whitecaps]]. He immediately started an eight-game hitting streak that lasted until July 25. During that stretch, Raburn posted a .355 batting average and drove in eight runs.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/> During the 2002 season, Raburn appeared in 40 games with West Michigan. He batted .220, hit six home runs and totaled 28 runs batted in.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/><ref name=\"BR Minors\">{{cite web|title=Ryan Raburn Minor League Statistics and History|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=raburn001rya|work=Sports-Reference.com|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=January 26, 2013}}</ref> After the season, Baseball America ranked Raburn as the Tigers' 25th-best prospect.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nRaburn started off the 2003 season with West Michigan, but he appeared in only 16 games for the Whitecaps before moving on to the [[Lakeland Tigers]] in late April. In his 95 games with Lakeland, he batted .222, with 12 homers and 56 RBI.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/><ref name=\"BR Minors\"/>\n\nIn 2004, the Tigers, lacking depth in the middle infield, moved Raburn to second base. Raburn was a September call-up during the 2004 season for the Tigers. He made his big league debut on September 12 and struck out in his first at bat. On September 16, Raburn got his first hit, an RBI double on a pitch from [[Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[CC Sabathia]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nRaburn spent the entire 2005 season with Toledo, posting a .253 batting average and hitting 19 home runs in 130 games.<ref name=\"BR Minors\"/> He committed the most errors (21) by any second baseman in the [[International League]]. During the postseason, he batted .348 and drove in 3 runs. He was rated by Baseball America as the 18th-best minor league prospect for the Tigers at season's end.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nFollowing the 2006 season, the Tigers chose to not add Raburn to the [[40-man roster]]. This left him unprotected in the [[Rule 5 draft]], allowing any team to add him for a cost of $50,000, provided he spent the entire season on a major league roster. Raburn was not selected and returned to the Tigers and their Triple-A affiliate [[Toledo Mud Hens]].\n\n====2007 season====\nRaburn returned to the major leagues for the first time since 2004 when Tigers utility infielder [[Neifi P\u00e9rez]] was suspended 25 games after testing positive for [[amphetamine]] usage. Raburn had a two-out RBI single in his first at bat of that season.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET200707060.shtml July 6, 2007 Boston Red Sox at Detroit Tigers Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> On July 25 against the [[Chicago White Sox]], Raburn went 4\u20135 with two home runs, a double and a single and had a total of seven RBIs.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA200707250.shtml July 25, 2007 Detroit Tigers at Chicago White Sox Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref>\n\nRaburn earned the 2007 Tigers Rookie of the Year award from the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association.\n\n[[File:Ryan Raburn on June 22, 2008.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Raburn playing for the [[2008 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers in 2008]]]]\n\n====2008 season====\nFor the first time in his career, Raburn started the season on Detroit's opening day roster. After getting into one game as a pinch runner, Raburn was sent down to Toledo on April 5. He made five appearances with the Mud Hens before rejoining the Tigers on April 13.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nDuring the 2008 season, Raburn made sporadic starts at third base, second base, and all three outfield positions.  Manager [[Jim Leyland]] often employed Raburn as a late-innings defensive replacement in the outfield or as a [[pinch runner]].\n\nRaburn hit his first career [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] on June 28, 2008 against [[Colorado Rockies]] pitcher [[Jeff Francis]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280628106 Tigers blow 3-run lead, overtake Rockies on Cabrera double].

He did not make the Tigers 25-man roster and began the 2009 season playing for the [[Toledo Mud Hens]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/> He was called up to Detroit on April 22, three days after [[Marcus Thames]] was placed on the [[disabled list]].<ref>{{cite book|title=2010 Tigers Information Guide|year=2010|pages=231|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/det/downloads/y2010/2010_DET_Media_Guide.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2009, Raburn made his first career start at first base.  It was the sixth different position he had started at in the major leagues.\n\nOn June 23, 2009, Raburn hit his first career [[walk-off home run]] to lift the Tigers over the Chicago Cubs 5\u20134.  According to Raburn, it was the first walk-off home run he had ever hit, including the minors leagues, college, high school, and [[Little League]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kornacki|first=Steve|title=Ryan Raburn's walkoff homer in ninth finishes what Brandon Inge started in Tigers' win vs. Cubs|url=http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2009/06/ryan_raburns_walk_off_homer_pu.html|publisher=MLive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2012|date=June 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====2010 season====\nRaburn entered the 2010 season as a key bench player expecting to see time at every defensive position except catcher and shortstop.  As of mid-June, he was regularly filling in for injured right fielder [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], but was hitting poorly. During the second half of the season, when he became an everyday starter primarily playing in the outfield, his bat heated up. By the end of 2010, he had played in 113 games, and sported a .280 batting average with 15 home runs and 61 RBIs.\n\n====2011 season====\n[[File:Ryan Raburn on August 14, 2011.jpg|200px|thumb|Raburn with the [[2011 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers in 2011]]]]\nRaburn signed a two-year contract extension after the 2010 season, and was a regular starter in left field at the beginning of the 2011 season. Near the end of May, Raburn took over at second base after [[Scott Sizemore]] was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]]. In addition, another Tiger second baseman, [[Carlos Guill\u00e9n]], was on the disabled list through the entire first half. Raburn's batting average slumped in the first half (.213 at the All-Star break), but he showed flashes of power with eight home runs. [[Andy Dirks]] and new acquisition [[Delmon Young]] played Raburn's left field position for much of the second half while he saw more time at second base. After another strong second half, Raburn finished the 2011 regular season at .256 with 14 home runs and 49 RBIs in 387 at-bats.\n\n====2012 season====\nAlthough his six Spring training homers shared the team lead,<ref>Wagner, John.

On September 16, Raburn got his first hit, an RBI double on a pitch from [[Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[CC Sabathia]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nRaburn spent the entire 2005 season with Toledo, posting a .253 batting average and hitting 19 home runs in 130 games.<ref name=\"BR Minors\"/> He committed the most errors (21) by any second baseman in the [[International League]]. During the postseason, he batted .348 and drove in 3 runs. He was rated by Baseball America as the 18th-best minor league prospect for the Tigers at season's end.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nFollowing the 2006 season, the Tigers chose to not add Raburn to the [[40-man roster]]. This left him unprotected in the [[Rule 5 draft]], allowing any team to add him for a cost of $50,000, provided he spent the entire season on a major league roster. Raburn was not selected and returned to the Tigers and their Triple-A affiliate [[Toledo Mud Hens]].\n\n====2007 season====\nRaburn returned to the major leagues for the first time since 2004 when Tigers utility infielder [[Neifi P\u00e9rez]] was suspended 25 games after testing positive for [[amphetamine]] usage. Raburn had a two-out RBI single in his first at bat of that season.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET200707060.shtml July 6, 2007 Boston Red Sox at Detroit Tigers Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> On July 25 against the [[Chicago White Sox]], Raburn went 4\u20135 with two home runs, a double and a single and had a total of seven RBIs.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA200707250.shtml July 25, 2007 Detroit Tigers at Chicago White Sox Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref>\n\nRaburn earned the 2007 Tigers Rookie of the Year award from the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association.\n\n[[File:Ryan Raburn on June 22, 2008.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Raburn playing for the [[2008 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers in 2008]]]]\n\n====2008 season====\nFor the first time in his career, Raburn started the season on Detroit's opening day roster. After getting into one game as a pinch runner, Raburn was sent down to Toledo on April 5. He made five appearances with the Mud Hens before rejoining the Tigers on April 13.<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/>\n\nDuring the 2008 season, Raburn made sporadic starts at third base, second base, and all three outfield positions.  Manager [[Jim Leyland]] often employed Raburn as a late-innings defensive replacement in the outfield or as a [[pinch runner]].\n\nRaburn hit his first career [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] on June 28, 2008 against [[Colorado Rockies]] pitcher [[Jeff Francis]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280628106 Tigers blow 3-run lead, overtake Rockies on Cabrera double].

He did not make the Tigers 25-man roster and began the 2009 season playing for the [[Toledo Mud Hens]].<ref name=\"Tigers Information Guide\"/> He was called up to Detroit on April 22, three days after [[Marcus Thames]] was placed on the [[disabled list]].<ref>{{cite book|title=2010 Tigers Information Guide|year=2010|pages=231|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/det/downloads/y2010/2010_DET_Media_Guide.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2009, Raburn made his first career start at first base.  It was the sixth different position he had started at in the major leagues.\n\nOn June 23, 2009, Raburn hit his first career [[walk-off home run]] to lift the Tigers over the Chicago Cubs 5\u20134.  According to Raburn, it was the first walk-off home run he had ever hit, including the minors leagues, college, high school, and [[Little League]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kornacki|first=Steve|title=Ryan Raburn's walkoff homer in ninth finishes what Brandon Inge started in Tigers' win vs. Cubs|url=http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2009/06/ryan_raburns_walk_off_homer_pu.html|publisher=MLive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2012|date=June 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====2010 season====\nRaburn entered the 2010 season as a key bench player expecting to see time at every defensive position except catcher and shortstop.  As of mid-June, he was regularly filling in for injured right fielder [[Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], but was hitting poorly. During the second half of the season, when he became an everyday starter primarily playing in the outfield, his bat heated up. By the end of 2010, he had played in 113 games, and sported a .280 batting average with 15 home runs and 61 RBIs.\n\n====2011 season====\n[[File:Ryan Raburn on August 14, 2011.jpg|200px|thumb|Raburn with the [[2011 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers in 2011]]]]\nRaburn signed a two-year contract extension after the 2010 season, and was a regular starter in left field at the beginning of the 2011 season. Near the end of May, Raburn took over at second base after [[Scott Sizemore]] was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]]. In addition, another Tiger second baseman, [[Carlos Guill\u00e9n]], was on the disabled list through the entire first half. Raburn's batting average slumped in the first half (.213 at the All-Star break), but he showed flashes of power with eight home runs. [[Andy Dirks]] and new acquisition [[Delmon Young]] played Raburn's left field position for much of the second half while he saw more time at second base. After another strong second half, Raburn finished the 2011 regular season at .256 with 14 home runs and 49 RBIs in 387 at-bats.\n\n====2012 season====\nAlthough his six Spring training homers shared the team lead,<ref>Wagner, John.
