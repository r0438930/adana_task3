An example is [[Cadillac]], which developed a prototype vehicle named the [[Cadillac Cyclone]] which used the new radar technology to detect objects in front of the car with the radar sensors mounted inside \"nose cones\". It was deemed too costly to manufacture.\n\nThe first modern forward collision avoidance system was demonstrated in 1995 by a team of scientists and engineers at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]] in [[Malibu, California]]. The project was funded by [[Delco Electronics]], and was led by HRL physicist Ross D. Olney. The technology was marketed as ''Forewarn''.

The system first provides warning of an impending accident, activating hazard warning lights, closing windows and sunroof, and pretensioning front seat belts. The warning is followed by light braking to get the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of {{cvt|3|m/s2|ft/s2|1}}. The fourth phase increases braking to {{cvt|5|m/s2|ft/s2|1}} followed by automatic full braking power, roughly half a second before projected impact. \"Pre sense rear\", is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The seats are moved forward to protect the car's occupants. 2015 introduced the \"avoidance assistant\" system that intervenes in the steering to help the driver avoid an obstacle. If an accident occurs, the \"turning assistant\" monitors opposing traffic when turning left at low speeds.

Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a full brake application. Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about {{convert|72|km/h|abbr=on}} , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible belt tensioners, are deployed. If the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary{{snd}} by depressing the brake pedal, activating the hold function, or moving the selector lever to \"P\"{{snd}} the system increases the brake pressure to keep the vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> Pre-Safe Impulse works an early phase of the crash, before the resulting deceleration starts to increase, the front occupants are pulled away from the direction of impact and deeper into their seats by their seat belts. By the time the accident enters the phase when loads peak, the extra distance they are retracted by can be used while dissipating energy in a controlled fashion. Pre-acceleration and force limitation allow the occupants to be temporarily isolated from the effects of the crash, significantly reducing the risk and severity of injuries in a frontal collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/>\n\n===Nissan===\nNissan's [[Infiniti]] brand offers both [[lidar|laser-based]] and [[radar|radar-based]] systems.  Brake assist with preview function anticipates the need to apply emergency braking and pre-pressurize the brake system to help improve brake response. Intelligent brake assist (IBA) with forward emergency braking (FEB) (on QX80) uses radar to monitor approaching speed to the vehicle ahead, helping detect an imminent collision. It provides a two-stage warning to alert the driver, and if the driver takes no action, the system automatically engages the brakes to mitigate the collision speed and impact. Predictive forward collision warning system warns the driver of risks that may be obscured from the driver's view. It senses the relative velocity and distance of a vehicle directly ahead, as well as a vehicle travelling in front of the preceding one. The forward emergency braking system judges that deceleration is required, it alerts the driver using both a screen display and sound, then generates a force that pushes the accelerator pedal up and applies partial braking to assist the driver in slowing the vehicle down. When the system judges that there is the possibility of a collision, it will automatically apply harder braking to help avoid one.\n\n===Subaru===\nSubaru's system, branded \"EyeSight\", was announced in May 2008 using stereo camera technology to detect pedestrians and bicyclists.

It was deemed too costly to manufacture.\n\nThe first modern forward collision avoidance system was demonstrated in 1995 by a team of scientists and engineers at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]] in [[Malibu, California]]. The project was funded by [[Delco Electronics]], and was led by HRL physicist Ross D. Olney. The technology was marketed as ''Forewarn''.

The system first provides warning of an impending accident, activating hazard warning lights, closing windows and sunroof, and pretensioning front seat belts. The warning is followed by light braking to get the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking at a rate of {{cvt|3|m/s2|ft/s2|1}}. The fourth phase increases braking to {{cvt|5|m/s2|ft/s2|1}} followed by automatic full braking power, roughly half a second before projected impact. \"Pre sense rear\", is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The seats are moved forward to protect the car's occupants. 2015 introduced the \"avoidance assistant\" system that intervenes in the steering to help the driver avoid an obstacle. If an accident occurs, the \"turning assistant\" monitors opposing traffic when turning left at low speeds. In critical situation, it brakes the car. \"Multicollision brake assist\" uses controlled braking maneuvers during the accident to aid the driver.

Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a full brake application. Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about {{convert|72|km/h|abbr=on}} , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible belt tensioners, are deployed. If the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary{{snd}} by depressing the brake pedal, activating the hold function, or moving the selector lever to \"P\"{{snd}} the system increases the brake pressure to keep the vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/> Pre-Safe Impulse works an early phase of the crash, before the resulting deceleration starts to increase, the front occupants are pulled away from the direction of impact and deeper into their seats by their seat belts. By the time the accident enters the phase when loads peak, the extra distance they are retracted by can be used while dissipating energy in a controlled fashion. Pre-acceleration and force limitation allow the occupants to be temporarily isolated from the effects of the crash, significantly reducing the risk and severity of injuries in a frontal collision.<ref name=\"media.daimler.com\"/>\n\n===Nissan===\nNissan's [[Infiniti]] brand offers both [[lidar|laser-based]] and [[radar|radar-based]] systems.  Brake assist with preview function anticipates the need to apply emergency braking and pre-pressurize the brake system to help improve brake response. Intelligent brake assist (IBA) with forward emergency braking (FEB) (on QX80) uses radar to monitor approaching speed to the vehicle ahead, helping detect an imminent collision. It provides a two-stage warning to alert the driver, and if the driver takes no action, the system automatically engages the brakes to mitigate the collision speed and impact. Predictive forward collision warning system warns the driver of risks that may be obscured from the driver's view. It senses the relative velocity and distance of a vehicle directly ahead, as well as a vehicle travelling in front of the preceding one. The forward emergency braking system judges that deceleration is required, it alerts the driver using both a screen display and sound, then generates a force that pushes the accelerator pedal up and applies partial braking to assist the driver in slowing the vehicle down. When the system judges that there is the possibility of a collision, it will automatically apply harder braking to help avoid one.\n\n===Subaru===\nSubaru's system, branded \"EyeSight\", was announced in May 2008 using stereo camera technology to detect pedestrians and bicyclists.
