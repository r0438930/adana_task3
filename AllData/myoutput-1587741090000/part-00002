It was first broadcast on 10 February 1995.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe episode opens with Richie and Eddie sitting in \"the best seats for the annual [[Hammersmith]] [[riot]]\"\u2014leaning out of their lounge window. While admiring the ongoing violence taking place during what is supposed to be a [[carnival]] parade, Richie and Eddie decide to do some [[looting]] \"when [[Currys]] blows\", with one of the planned items to loot being a TV set. They later return to the flat arguing over the fact that Eddie dropped the TV while being run over by the \"[[riot squad]]\" but, to his excitement, still made away with a [[rubber duck]] that \"came free with the telly.\" Despite missing out on the coveted electrical goods, they still manage to pick up their shopping for the year, over 60 [[Orion (company)|Orion]] [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] (43 being sequestered in the attic), as well as a BBC video camera and tape which Richie stole from a BBC van, justifying the theft by claiming he has every right to as he pays his [[television licence]] fees.\n\nRichie reveals his motivations for the theft. He plans to film a series of [[home movies]], making them both famous, thus leaving them with their \"pick of the [[Woman|birds]].\" After dismissing Eddie's screen pitches (namely a [[remake]] of ''[[9\u00bd Weeks]]'' and the original title ''Nude Birds Go Upstairs To Eddie's Bedroom'') Richie states that instead he intends to film his own [[prime time]] current affairs discussion program, inspired by the successes of \"[[Robert Kilroy-Silk|the sexiest man on TV]].\" As Eddie films Richie (sporting a white wig and a suit) descending the stairs as part of the introduction to a \"studio special report\" on whether [[Parking enforcement officer|traffic wardens]] should be armed, Richie trips and falls down the stairs, through the bathroom door and head-first into the toilet. Eddie then suggests that if he had remembered to turn the camera on they would have had a good video to send into the fictional TV show ''[[Jeremy Beadle]]'s [[You've Been Framed!|Viciously Hilarious Domestic Violent Incidents]]''. Newly inspired, Richie instead decides to return to the [[living room|drawing room]] and agrees with Eddie's idea to film an (orchestrated) accident in which \"you accidentally catch a dart in your head\".\n\nEddie is next shown (dressed in an apron) wandering into their kitchen as he works at the stove, loudly expressing his hope that \"no viciously hilarious accidents happen!\" Richie ruins the first take by inadvertently throwing a dart into Eddie's eye instead of his forehead, necessitating a second take. A more subdued Eddie (who breaks the fourth wall to protest that in spite of the ostensible ordinariness of the day he has now lost the sight in one eye) opens the next take with Richie successfully managing to hit the target in the forehead this time. Compounding the injury by \"accidentally\" pouring a frying pan of burning fat over his body Eddie, after being set alight by Richie, hurls himself through the window.\n\nAs Eddie is recovering in some pain, Richie sheepishly reveals that the filming moved him to tears. Not because of Eddie's performance but, rather, due to the realisation that he had forgotten to put the tape into the camera. Eddie flatly refuses Richie's demand for a re-shoot as Richie angrily states that a blank tape is useless to him, only for this to give him an idea\u2014they will instead send a completely blank tape to Beadle's show, claiming they had forgotten that it should have contained footage of Richie's wife \"sewing her head to the curtains.\" Richie suggests they check the tape is blank, finding a use for the VCRs Eddie had stolen. Eddie spends an entire year getting the video up and running (having wasted months simply unwrapping it) and only finishes the eve of the following year's carnival and just after Richie returns from a holiday abroad. Despite Eddie's efforts leading the VCR to explode once the power is connected, they manage to get the tape up and running with the aid of an unfortunate repair man.\n\nWhile eventually viewing the tape, they find out that, despite the recording being made in mute, it contains a film of the then [[John Major|Prime Minister]] having an [[affair]]. Richie hits upon the idea of using the tape for [[blackmail]] and phones the government stating their intentions. In the course of the conversation Richie accidentally uses his real name and hangs up in terror. He tells Eddie to phone instead and use an assumed name leading Eddie to ring and give the name \"Richard Richard\" when asked. As a result, the building is soon surrounded by the [[Special Air Service|SAS]]. Eddie suggests turning the siege into a chance to \"eat like kings\" and demand food. This does not go according to plan and merely results in a hail of bullets perforating the flat. In response to the SAS commander's demand to \"throw down the video\" Eddie complies by throwing the entire machine out of the window, landing on their besiegers in the process. As Richie and Eddie debate the meaning of the last words they heard over the phone (\"Go, A-squad!\") several masked SAS operatives burst into the flat. They open fire as the panicked flatmates utter their last words\u2014\"Oh, shit!\"\n\n==Continuity and production errors==\n* There is a scene where Richie asks Eddie if it is so good to get his feet up. Eddie responds with \"No, I'm not that pervy\", with Richie saying \"Are you not?\". In an out-take (seen on the ''Bottom Fluff'' video), Edmondson says \"No. Do you know... I've forgotten my next line...!\". In the next take, he forgets to say \"no\", and it looks as if Eddie ignored Richie's question.\n*Eddie says that he is going to write to his [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[Tony Blair]] (who was [[Leader of the Opposition]] at the time of broadcast). Blair was MP for the constituency of [[Sedgefield]], County Durham. Since ''Bottom'' is set in Hammersmith, London, it is impossible that he is their MP so this might be a play on their ignorance of life.\n*When Richie is enacting the introduction to his daytime discussion programme, he trips on trailing cables and falls down the stairs. However, although he is wearing navy blue jeans, the stunt double is clearly wearing light blue jeans. Once Richie is stuck in the toilet, he is wearing the correct colour jeans again.\n*Whilst setting up the VCR, Eddie announces that he will be connecting the [[SCART]] socket to the lan connector. However, neither of these wires are actually attached to the VCR, rendering the action useless.\n*Eddie doesn't install a video recorder until this episode, implying that he and Richie have never owned one before, although in [['S Up]] he and Richie watched a video called ''The Furry Honey-pot Adventure'' and in [[Accident (Bottom)|Accident]] he watches ''[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm]]'' with Hedgehog and Spudgun.\n*In the opening sequences, when the shot momentarily switches to the inside of the flat to show Eddie's stash of [[Malibu (rum)|Malibu]] crates, the outline of the camera used to film the opening shots, from the perspective of 'outside the flat' is visible through the window.\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Eddie reads the VCR instruction manual in [[German language|German]], it's loosely translated to \"stick your head up your rear\".\n*The lyric that Richie sings when back from holiday (\"He rattled his [[maracas]] close to me\") is from \"[[Y Viva Espa\u00f1a]]\", which was a hit in the UK charts in 1974.\n*The scene where Eddie and Richie put on their balaclavas the wrong way around resulting in Eddie bumping into things and falling over the sofa is revealed to be a blooper in the series 3 outtakes, following two takes with Ade and Rik forgetting their lines the third take which involved Ade bashing into the set and falling over was kept in the final cut of the episode.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
