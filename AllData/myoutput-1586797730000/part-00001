Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest [[List of Greek mythological figures#Heroes|Greek heroes]]: [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]] in [[Roman mythology]]) and [[Perseus]]. According to the ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]], Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in extreme [[Hesperides|west]].<ref name=\"517\u2013520\"/> Later, he became commonly identified with the [[Atlas Mountains]] in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of [[Mauretania]].<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy.

[[Virgil]] took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them with adjectives that explained them: for Atlas his adjective is ''durus'', \"hard, enduring\",<ref>''[[Aeneid]]'' iv.247: \"''Atlantis duri''\" and other instances; see Robert W.

Since the Atlas mountains rise in the region inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]], it has been suggested that the name might be taken from one of the [[Berber languages|Berber]], specifically ''\u00e1dr\u0101r'' 'mountain'.<ref>Strabo, 17.3;</ref>\n\nTraditionally historical linguists etymologize the Ancient Greek word \u1f0c\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 ([[genitive case|genitive]]: \u1f0c\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) as comprised from copulative \u03b1- and the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*telh\u2082-'' 'to uphold, support' (whence also \u03c4\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9), and which was later reshaped to an nt-stem.<ref name=\"Beekes\">{{Cite document|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek |volume=1 |author-link=Robert Beekes |first=Robert |last=Beekes |first2=Lucien |last2=van Beek |page=163 |year=2010 |publisher=Brill|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

When the Titans were defeated, many of them (including Menoetius) were confined to [[Tartarus]], but [[Zeus]] condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia (the Earth)]] and hold up the sky on his shoulders.<ref name=\"517\u2013520\"/> Thus, he was ''Atlas Telamon'', \"enduring Atlas,\" and became a doublet of [[Coeus]], the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve.<ref>The usage in [[Virgil]]'s ''maximum Atlas axem umero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum'' (''Aeneid'', iv.481f , cf vi.796f), combining poetic and parascientific images, is discussed in P. R. Hardie, \"Atlas and Axis\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' N.S. '''33'''.1 (1983:220-228).</ref>\n\nA common misconception today is that Atlas was forced to hold the Earth on his shoulders, but Classical art shows Atlas holding the [[celestial spheres]], not the [[globe|terrestrial globe]]; the solidity of the marble globe borne by the renowned [[Farnese Atlas]] may have aided the conflation, reinforced in the 16th century by the developing usage of ''atlas'' to describe a corpus of [[Atlas|terrestrial maps]].\n\n===Encounter with Perseus===\n{{main|Perseus}}\nThe Greek poet [[Polyidus]] c. 398 BC<ref>[[Polyeidos (poet)|Polyeidos]], Fragment 837; Ovid, 'Metamorphoses'' 4.627''</ref> tells a tale of Atlas, then a shepherd, encountering [[Perseus]] who [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turned him to stone]]. Ovid later gives a more detailed account of the incident, combining it with the myth of Heracles. In this account Atlas is not a shepherd but a King.<ref>Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', IV.617ff ([http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Perseus.html#Atlas on-line English translation at Theoi Project]).</ref> According to Ovid, Perseus arrives in Atlas' Kingdom and asks for shelter, declaring he is a son of Zeus. Atlas, fearful of a prophecy which warned of a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples from his orchard, refuses Perseus hospitality.<ref name=\"LOTN\"/> In this account, Atlas is turned not just into stone by Perseus, but an entire mountain range: Atlas' head the peak, his shoulders ridges and his hair woods. The prophecy did not relate to Perseus stealing the golden apples but [[Heracles]], another son of Zeus, and Perseus' great-grandson.<ref>{{harvp|Ogden|2008|pp=49, 108, 114}}</ref>\n\n===Encounter with Heracles===\n{{main|Heracles}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|Atlas and Hercules]]\nOne of the [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]] of the hero [[Heracles]] was to fetch some of the golden apples which grow in [[Hera]]'s garden, tended by Atlas' reputed daughters, the [[Hesperides]] which were also called the Atlantides, and guarded by the dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]. Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from his daughters.<ref name=\":0\">[[Diodorus Siculus]].

Heracles, suspecting Atlas did not intend to return, pretended to agree to Atlas' offer, asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders. When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again, Heracles took the apples and ran away.\n\nIn some versions,<ref>A lost passage of [[Pindar]] quoted by Strabo (3.5.5) was the earliest reference in this context: \"the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles\"; the passage in Pindar has not been traced.</ref> Heracles instead built the two great [[Pillars of Hercules]] to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas much as he liberated [[Prometheus]].\n\n===Other Variations===\n[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Atlas and the Hesperides - 1925.jpg|thumb|''Atlas and the Hesperides'' by Singer Sargent, John (1925)]]\n\n====King of Atlantis====\nAccording to [[Plato]], the first king of [[Atlantis]] was also named '''Atlas''', but that Atlas was a son of [[Poseidon]] and the mortal woman Cleito.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''</ref> The works of [[Eusebius]]<ref name=\"Eusebius\"/> and [[Diodorus]]<ref name=\"Diodorus\"/> also give an Atlantean account of Atlas. In these accounts, Atlas' father was [[Uranus]] and his mother was [[Gaia]]. His grandfather was [[Elyon#Sanchuniathon|Elium]] \"King of [[Phoenicia]]\" who lived in [[Byblos]] with his wife [[Baal Berith|Beruth]]. Atlas was raised by his sister, [[Basilea (queen)|Basilia]].<ref>For further comment on Mercator's chosen Titanic genealogy see {{harvp|Keuning|1947}}, {{harvp|Akerman|1994}} and {{harvp|Ramachandran|2015|p=42}}</ref><ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>See {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book III}}, Eusebius' ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' references the same mythology as Diodorus stating \"These then are the principal heads of the theology held among the Atlanteans\".</ref>\n\n====King of Mauretania====\nAtlas was also a legendary king of [[Mauretania]], the land of the [[Mauri people|Mauri]] in antiquity roughly corresponding with modern [[Maghreb]]. In the 16th century [[Gerardus Mercator]] put together the first collection of maps to be called an \"[[Atlas]]\" and devoted his book to the \"King of Mauretania\".<ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>{{harvp|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|p=103}}</ref>\n\nAtlas became associated with Northwest Africa over time. He had been connected with the [[Hesperides]], \"Nymphs\" which guarded the [[golden apple]]s, and [[Gorgons]] both of which lived beyond Ocean in the extreme west of the world since [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]].<ref>See {{harvp|Gantz|1993|p=401}} and {{harvp|Ogden|2008|p=47-49}}</ref> [[Diodorus]] and [[Palaephatus]] mention that the Gorgons lived in the Gorgades, islands in the [[Aethiopian Sea]]. The main island was called Cerna and modern day arguments have been advanced that these islands may correspond to [[Cape Verde]] due to [[Phoenicia]]n exploration.<ref>For instance the Phoenician [[Hanno the Navigator]] is said to have sailed as far as [[Mount Cameroon]] in the 5th or 6th century BC.

Riley {{ISBN|978-1-4209-3395-6}}</ref> The Northwest Africa region emerged as the canonical home of the King via separate sources. In particular, according to Ovid, after Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain range, he flies over [[Aethiopia]], the blood of Medusa's head giving rise to Libyan snakes. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the habit of associating Atlas' home to a chain of mountains, the [[Atlas mountains]], which were near [[Mauretania]] and [[Numidia]], was firmly entrenched.<ref>{{harvp|Lempri\u00e8re|1833|pp=249-250}}</ref>\n\n====Other====\n<!-- Hatnote at [[Aril]] redirects here -->\nThe identifying name ''Aril'' is inscribed on two 5th-century BC Etruscan bronze items: a mirror from [[Vulci]] and a ring from an unknown site.<ref>Paolo Martini, ''Il nome etrusco di Atlante'', (Rome:Universit\u00e0 di Roma) 1987 investigates the etymology of ''aril'', rejecting a link to the verbal morpheme ''ar-'' (\"support\") in favor of a Phoenician etymon in an unattested possible form ''*'arrab(a)'', signifying \"guarantor in a commercial transaction\" with the connotation of \"mediator\", related to the Latin borrowing ''arillator'', \"middleman\".

Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest [[List of Greek mythological figures#Heroes|Greek heroes]]: [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]] in [[Roman mythology]]) and [[Perseus]]. According to the ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]], Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in extreme [[Hesperides|west]].<ref name=\"517\u2013520\"/> Later, he became commonly identified with the [[Atlas Mountains]] in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of [[Mauretania]].<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy.

In Ancient Greek, Plato's Timaeus dialogue also mentions \"\u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2\" (English:\"[[Atlantis]] nisos\") meaning \"Atlas's Island\", giving rise to the English derivative: Atlantis (Atlantean / of Atlas).<ref>https://www.dictionary.com/e/atlantis/</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Atlas'' is uncertain. [[Virgil]] took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them with adjectives that explained them: for Atlas his adjective is ''durus'', \"hard, enduring\",<ref>''[[Aeneid]]'' iv.247: \"''Atlantis duri''\" and other instances; see Robert W. Cruttwell, \"Virgil, Aeneid, iv. 247: 'Atlantis Duri'\" ''The Classical Review'' '''59'''.1 (May 1945), p. 11.</ref> which suggested to George Doig<ref>George Doig, \"Vergil's Art and the Greek Language\" ''The Classical Journal'' '''64'''.1 (October 1968, pp. 1-6) p. 2.</ref> that Virgil was aware of the Greek \u03c4\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \"to endure\"; Doig offers the further possibility that Virgil was aware of [[Strabo]]'s remark that the native North African name for this mountain was ''Douris''. Since the Atlas mountains rise in the region inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]], it has been suggested that the name might be taken from one of the [[Berber languages|Berber]], specifically ''\u00e1dr\u0101r'' 'mountain'.<ref>Strabo, 17.3;</ref>\n\nTraditionally historical linguists etymologize the Ancient Greek word \u1f0c\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 ([[genitive case|genitive]]: \u1f0c\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) as comprised from copulative \u03b1- and the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*telh\u2082-'' 'to uphold, support' (whence also \u03c4\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9), and which was later reshaped to an nt-stem.<ref name=\"Beekes\">{{Cite document|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek |volume=1 |author-link=Robert Beekes |first=Robert |last=Beekes |first2=Lucien |last2=van Beek |page=163 |year=2010 |publisher=Brill|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

When the Titans were defeated, many of them (including Menoetius) were confined to [[Tartarus]], but [[Zeus]] condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia (the Earth)]] and hold up the sky on his shoulders.<ref name=\"517\u2013520\"/> Thus, he was ''Atlas Telamon'', \"enduring Atlas,\" and became a doublet of [[Coeus]], the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve.<ref>The usage in [[Virgil]]'s ''maximum Atlas axem umero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum'' (''Aeneid'', iv.481f , cf vi.796f), combining poetic and parascientific images, is discussed in P. R. Hardie, \"Atlas and Axis\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' N.S. '''33'''.1 (1983:220-228).</ref>\n\nA common misconception today is that Atlas was forced to hold the Earth on his shoulders, but Classical art shows Atlas holding the [[celestial spheres]], not the [[globe|terrestrial globe]]; the solidity of the marble globe borne by the renowned [[Farnese Atlas]] may have aided the conflation, reinforced in the 16th century by the developing usage of ''atlas'' to describe a corpus of [[Atlas|terrestrial maps]].\n\n===Encounter with Perseus===\n{{main|Perseus}}\nThe Greek poet [[Polyidus]] c. 398 BC<ref>[[Polyeidos (poet)|Polyeidos]], Fragment 837; Ovid, 'Metamorphoses'' 4.627''</ref> tells a tale of Atlas, then a shepherd, encountering [[Perseus]] who [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turned him to stone]]. Ovid later gives a more detailed account of the incident, combining it with the myth of Heracles. In this account Atlas is not a shepherd but a King.<ref>Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', IV.617ff ([http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Perseus.html#Atlas on-line English translation at Theoi Project]).</ref> According to Ovid, Perseus arrives in Atlas' Kingdom and asks for shelter, declaring he is a son of Zeus. Atlas, fearful of a prophecy which warned of a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples from his orchard, refuses Perseus hospitality.<ref name=\"LOTN\"/> In this account, Atlas is turned not just into stone by Perseus, but an entire mountain range: Atlas' head the peak, his shoulders ridges and his hair woods. The prophecy did not relate to Perseus stealing the golden apples but [[Heracles]], another son of Zeus, and Perseus' great-grandson.<ref>{{harvp|Ogden|2008|pp=49, 108, 114}}</ref>\n\n===Encounter with Heracles===\n{{main|Heracles}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|Atlas and Hercules]]\nOne of the [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]] of the hero [[Heracles]] was to fetch some of the golden apples which grow in [[Hera]]'s garden, tended by Atlas' reputed daughters, the [[Hesperides]] which were also called the Atlantides, and guarded by the dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]. Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from his daughters.<ref name=\":0\">[[Diodorus Siculus]].

Heracles, suspecting Atlas did not intend to return, pretended to agree to Atlas' offer, asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders. When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again, Heracles took the apples and ran away.\n\nIn some versions,<ref>A lost passage of [[Pindar]] quoted by Strabo (3.5.5) was the earliest reference in this context: \"the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles\"; the passage in Pindar has not been traced.</ref> Heracles instead built the two great [[Pillars of Hercules]] to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas much as he liberated [[Prometheus]].\n\n===Other Variations===\n[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Atlas and the Hesperides - 1925.jpg|thumb|''Atlas and the Hesperides'' by Singer Sargent, John (1925)]]\n\n====King of Atlantis====\nAccording to [[Plato]], the first king of [[Atlantis]] was also named '''Atlas''', but that Atlas was a son of [[Poseidon]] and the mortal woman Cleito.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''</ref> The works of [[Eusebius]]<ref name=\"Eusebius\"/> and [[Diodorus]]<ref name=\"Diodorus\"/> also give an Atlantean account of Atlas. In these accounts, Atlas' father was [[Uranus]] and his mother was [[Gaia]]. His grandfather was [[Elyon#Sanchuniathon|Elium]] \"King of [[Phoenicia]]\" who lived in [[Byblos]] with his wife [[Baal Berith|Beruth]]. Atlas was raised by his sister, [[Basilea (queen)|Basilia]].<ref>For further comment on Mercator's chosen Titanic genealogy see {{harvp|Keuning|1947}}, {{harvp|Akerman|1994}} and {{harvp|Ramachandran|2015|p=42}}</ref><ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>See {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book III}}, Eusebius' ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' references the same mythology as Diodorus stating \"These then are the principal heads of the theology held among the Atlanteans\".</ref>\n\n====King of Mauretania====\nAtlas was also a legendary king of [[Mauretania]], the land of the [[Mauri people|Mauri]] in antiquity roughly corresponding with modern [[Maghreb]]. In the 16th century [[Gerardus Mercator]] put together the first collection of maps to be called an \"[[Atlas]]\" and devoted his book to the \"King of Mauretania\".<ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>{{harvp|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|p=103}}</ref>\n\nAtlas became associated with Northwest Africa over time. He had been connected with the [[Hesperides]], \"Nymphs\" which guarded the [[golden apple]]s, and [[Gorgons]] both of which lived beyond Ocean in the extreme west of the world since [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]].<ref>See {{harvp|Gantz|1993|p=401}} and {{harvp|Ogden|2008|p=47-49}}</ref> [[Diodorus]] and [[Palaephatus]] mention that the Gorgons lived in the Gorgades, islands in the [[Aethiopian Sea]]. The main island was called Cerna and modern day arguments have been advanced that these islands may correspond to [[Cape Verde]] due to [[Phoenicia]]n exploration.<ref>For instance the Phoenician [[Hanno the Navigator]] is said to have sailed as far as [[Mount Cameroon]] in the 5th or 6th century BC.

Riley {{ISBN|978-1-4209-3395-6}}</ref> The Northwest Africa region emerged as the canonical home of the King via separate sources. In particular, according to Ovid, after Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain range, he flies over [[Aethiopia]], the blood of Medusa's head giving rise to Libyan snakes. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the habit of associating Atlas' home to a chain of mountains, the [[Atlas mountains]], which were near [[Mauretania]] and [[Numidia]], was firmly entrenched.<ref>{{harvp|Lempri\u00e8re|1833|pp=249-250}}</ref>\n\n====Other====\n<!-- Hatnote at [[Aril]] redirects here -->\nThe identifying name ''Aril'' is inscribed on two 5th-century BC Etruscan bronze items: a mirror from [[Vulci]] and a ring from an unknown site.<ref>Paolo Martini, ''Il nome etrusco di Atlante'', (Rome:Universit\u00e0 di Roma) 1987 investigates the etymology of ''aril'', rejecting a link to the verbal morpheme ''ar-'' (\"support\") in favor of a Phoenician etymon in an unattested possible form ''*'arrab(a)'', signifying \"guarantor in a commercial transaction\" with the connotation of \"mediator\", related to the Latin borrowing ''arillator'', \"middleman\".

For Atlas had worked out the science of astrology to a degree surpassing others and had ingeniously discovered the spherical nature of the stars, and for that reason was generally believed to be bearing the entire firmament upon his shoulders. Similarly in the case of Heracles, when he had brought to the Greeks the doctrine of the sphere, he gained great fame, as if he had taken over the burden of the firmament which Atlas had borne, since men intimated in this enigmatic way what had actually taken place.\" {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book IV 27.4-5}}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Eusebius\">The \"testimony of Eusebius\" was \"drawn from the most ancient historians\" according to Mercator.
