I not only had this opinion of her then\u2014but I actually think so still, now that the spell is long since broken, and the enchantment at an end.''\"\n\nBurns had written \"Handsome Nell\" whilst the family lived at Mount Oliphant Farm, near [[Alloway]] in the autumn of 1774. In the first [[Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|Commonplace Book]] written at [[Ellisland Farm]] he deleted ''virtue'' in the first stanza and substituted it with ''honor'' and wrote that: \"''Lest my works should be thought below criticism; or meet with a Critic who, perhaps, will not look on them with so candid and favorable an eye; I am determined to criticise them myself.''\"\n\n===First stanza===\nThe first line is ''quite too much in the flimsy strain of ordinary street ballads; and on the other hand, the second line ''is too much in the other extreme. The expression is a little awkward, and the sentiment too serious.''\n\n===Second stanza===\nBurns wrote that ''..I am well pleased with; and I think it conveys a fine idea of that amiable part of the sex --- the agreables; or what in our Scotch dialect we call a sweet sonsy lass''.\n\n===Third stanza===\nBurns wrote that it ''has a little of the flimsy turn in it; and the third line has rather too serious a cast''.\n\n===Fourth stanza===\nBurns wrote that this is ''a very indifferent one; the first line is, indeed all in the strain of the second stanza, but the rest is mostly an expletive''. \n\n===Fifth stanza===\nBurns wrote that ''The thoughts in the fifth stanza come finely up to my favourite idea of a sweet sonsy lass; the last line halts a little''.\n\n===Sixth stanza===\nBurns wrote that ''The same sentiments are kept up with equal spirit and tenderness''. '..but the second and fourth lines ending with short syllables hurt the whole''.\n\n===Seventh stanza===\nBurns wrote that it has ''several minute faults; but I remember I composed it in a wild enthusiasm of passion, and to this hour I never recollect it, but my heart melts, and my blood sallies at the rememberance''.\u00b7\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n# Annandale, Charles (Editor) (1890).
