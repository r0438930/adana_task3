In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}} after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and by befriending civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his [[pacifist]] ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]] as an adult and [[K\u014dki Miyata]] as a child. For the English dub, [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices him as an adult and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response; while some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka.\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede.|alt=A black haired Japanese man wearing glasses.]]\n\nVash was created by ''[[Trigun]]'' [[manga]] author [[Yasuhiro Nightow]],<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite web |url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |title=Dark Horse Interview |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]|date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 30, 2012|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011185649/http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |archivedate=October 1, 2013 }}</ref> who created his name on his own in contrast to other character names are references to companies.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |title=Anime Expo 2009 |publisher=[[Anime Expo]] |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150426/http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> Nightow made the character a pacifist because he aimed not to have Vash be a murderer, something typical in action films.

In the gun's original design, there was no way of opening it to insert bullets so Nightow instead used a picture of an upside-down [[Gun barrel|barrel]] as inspiration. Nightow found visual appearance the odd guns that came in later episodes difficult, and the idea of \"baka guns\"\u2014weapons that fire unlimited magical bullets\u2014slowly disappeared.

In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}} after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and by befriending civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his [[pacifist]] ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]] as an adult and [[K\u014dki Miyata]] as a child. For the English dub, [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices him as an adult and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response; while some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka.\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede.|alt=A black haired Japanese man wearing glasses.]]\n\nVash was created by ''[[Trigun]]'' [[manga]] author [[Yasuhiro Nightow]],<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite web |url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |title=Dark Horse Interview |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]|date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 30, 2012|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011185649/http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |archivedate=October 1, 2013 }}</ref> who created his name on his own in contrast to other character names are references to companies.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |title=Anime Expo 2009 |publisher=[[Anime Expo]] |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150426/http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> Nightow made the character a pacifist because he aimed not to have Vash be a murderer, something typical in action films.
