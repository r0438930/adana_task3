Ideologically a Nazbol and [[Khmer nationalism|Khmer nationalist]], he was a leading member of Cambodia's [[Communism|\"communist\"]] movement, the [[Khmer Rouge]], from 1963 until 1997 and served as the [[General Secretary of the \"Communist\" Party of Kampuchea|General Secretary]] of the [[\"Communist\" Party of Kampuchea]] from 1963 to 1981. Under his administration, Cambodia was converted into a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[\"communist\" state]] governed according to Pol Pot's \"interpretation\" of Marxism\u2013Leninism.\n\nBorn to a prosperous farmer in [[Prek Sbauv]], [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French Cambodia]], Pol Pot was educated at some of Cambodia's elite schools. While in [[Paris]] during the 1940s, he joined the [[French Communist Party]]. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] organisation and its guerrilla war against King [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s newly independent government. Following the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist\u2013Leninist controlled [[North Vietnam]], Pol Pot returned to [[Phnom Penh]], working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist\u2013Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the \"Communist\" Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he [[Cambodian Civil War|relaunched the war]] against Sihanouk's government. After [[Lon Nol]] deposed Sihanouk in a [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]], Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against [[Khmer Republic|Lon Nol's government]], which was bolstered by the United States military. Aided by the [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] militia and North Vietnamese troops, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces advanced and controlled all of Cambodia by 1975.\n\nPol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an [[agrarian \"socialist\"]] society that he believed would evolve into a [[\"communist\" society]], Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on [[Collective farming|collective farms]]. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens made to wear the same black clothing. Those the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies were killed. These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population, a period later termed the [[Cambodian genocide]]. Repeated purges of the CPK generated growing discontent; by 1978 Cambodian soldiers were mounting a rebellion in the east. After several years of border clashes, [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|the newly unified Vietnam invaded Cambodia]] in December 1978, toppling Pol Pot and installing a [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation|rival Marxist\u2013Leninist government]] in 1979. The Khmer Rouge retreated to the jungles near the Thai border, from where they continued to fight. In declining health, Pol Pot stepped back from many of his roles in the movement. In 1998 the Khmer Rouge commander [[Ta Mok]] placed Pol Pot under house arrest, shortly after which he died.\n\nTaking power in Cambodia at the height of Marxism\u2013Leninism's global impact, Pol Pot proved divisive among the international communist movement. Many knew he deviated from orthodox Marxism\u2013Leninism, but China backed his government as a bulwark against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in Southeast Asia. To his supporters, he was a champion of Cambodian sovereignty in the face of Vietnamese imperialism and stood against the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|Marxist revisionism]] of the Soviet Union. Conversely, he has been internationally denounced for his role in the Cambodian genocide, regarded as a [[totalitarian]] [[dictator]] guilty of [[crimes against humanity]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Childhood: 1925\u20131941 ===\nPol Pot was born in the village of [[Prek Sbauv]], outside the city of [[Kampong Thom city|Kampong Thom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=7|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=15}} He was named Saloth S\u00e2r ({{lang-km|\u179f\u17b6\u17a1\u17bb\u178f \u179f}} {{IPA-km|sa\u02d0.\u02c8lot s\u0251\u02d0|pron}}), the word ''s\u00e2r'' (\"white, pale\") referencing his comparatively light skin complexion.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=18}} French colonial records placed his birth date on 25 May 1928,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=7}} but biographer [[Philip Short]] argues he was born in March 1925.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Prek Sbauv.JPG|thumb|left|[[Prek Sbauv]], the village where Pol Pot was born and spent his early years]]\nHis family was of mixed [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese]] and [[Khmer people|ethnic Khmer]] heritage, but did not speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and lived as though they were fully Khmer.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=18}} His father Loth, who later took the name Saloth Phem, was a prosperous farmer who owned nine hectares of rice land and several draft cattle.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=8|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=15, 18}} Loth's house was one of the largest in the village and at transplanting and harvest time he hired poorer neighbors to carry out much of the agricultural labour.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=15}} S\u00e2r's mother, Sok Nem, was locally respected as a pious Buddhist.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} S\u00e2r was the eighth of nine children (two girls and seven boys),{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} three of whom died young.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=16}} They were raised as [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravada Buddhists]], and on festivals travelled to the Kampong Thom monastery.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=20}}\n\n[[List of monarchs of Cambodia|Cambodia was a monarchy]], but the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French colonial regime]], not the king, was in political control.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=14}} S\u00e2r's family had connections to the Cambodian royalty: his cousin Meak was a consort of King [[Sisowath Monivong]] and later worked as a [[ballet]] teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=8|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=16\u201317}} When S\u00e2r was six years old, he and an older brother were sent to live with Meak in [[Phnom Penh]]; informal adoptions by wealthier relatives were then common in Cambodia.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} In Phnom Penh, he spent 18 months as a novice monk in the city's Vat Botum Vaddei monastery, learning [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings and to read and write the [[Khmer language]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=9|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=20\u201321}}\n\nIn summer 1935, S\u00e2r went to live with his brother Suong and the latter's wife and child.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=23}} That year he began an education at a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] primary school, the \u00c9cole Miche,{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=17|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=23}} with Meak paying the tuition fees.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} Most of his classmates were the children of French bureaucrats and Catholic [[Vietnamese Cambodians|Vietnamese]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} He became literate in French and familiar with [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} S\u00e2r was not academically gifted and was held back two years, receiving his Certificat d'Etudes Primaires Compl\u00e9mentaires in 1941 at the age of 16.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=28}} He had continued to visit Meak at the king's palace and it was there that he had some of his earliest sexual experiences with some of the king's concubines.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=27}}\n\n=== Later education: 1942\u20131948 ===\nWhile S\u00e2r was at the school, the [[King of Cambodia]] died. In 1941 the French authorities appointed [[Norodom Sihanouk]] as his replacement.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=17|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=28\u201329}} A new junior middle school, the Coll\u00e9ge Pream Sihanouk, was established in Kampong Cham, and S\u00e2r was selected as a [[boarding school|boarder]] at the institution in 1942.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=18|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=28}} This level of education afforded him a privileged position in Cambodian society.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} He learned to play the [[violin]] and took part in school plays.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=19|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=31}} Much of his spare time was spent playing [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=31}} Several fellow pupils, among them [[Hu Nim]] and [[Khieu Samphan]], later served in his government.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=19}} During the new year vacation in 1945, S\u00e2r and several friends from his college theatre troupe went on a provincial tour in a bus to raise money for a trip to [[Angkor Wat]].{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=32\u201333}} In 1947, he left the school.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=21}}\n\nThat year he passed exams that admitted him into the [[Lyc\u00e9e Sisowath]], meanwhile living with Suong and his new wife.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=36}} In summer 1948, he sat the ''brevet'' entry exams for the upper classes of the Lyc\u00e9e, but failed. Unlike several of his friends, he could not continue on at the school for a [[baccalaur\u00e9at]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=42}} Instead, he enrolled in 1948 to study carpentry at the Ecole Technique in [[Russey Keo]], in Phnom Penh's northern suburbs.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=42\u201343}} This drop from an academic education to a vocational one likely came as a shock.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=42}} His fellow students were generally of a lower class than those at the Lyc\u00e9e Sisowath, though they were not peasants.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} At the Ecole Technique he met [[Ieng Sary]], who became a close friend and later a member of his government.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} In summer 1949, S\u00e2r passed his ''brevet'' and secured one of five scholarships allowing him to travel to France to study at one of its engineering schools.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Nazi Germany]] invaded France and in 1945 the Japanese ousted the French from Cambodia, with Sihanouk proclaiming his country's independence.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=31}} After the war ended with Germany's and Japan's defeat, France reasserted its control over Cambodia in 1946,{{sfn|Short|2004|p=34}} but allowed for the creation of a new constitution and the establishment of various political parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=37}} The most successful of these was the [[Democratic Party (Cambodia)|Democratic Party]], which won the [[1946 Cambodian general election|1946 general election]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=23, 24|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=37}} According to Chandler, S\u00e2r and Sary worked for the party during its successful election campaign;{{sfn|Chandler|1992|pp=23, 24}} conversely, Short maintains that S\u00e2r had no contact with the party.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=42}} Sihanouk opposed the party's left-leaning reforms and in 1948 dissolved the National Assembly, instead [[Rule by decree|ruling by decree]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=24}} Operatives of [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s better established Vietnamese Marxist\u2013Leninist group, the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]], also established a nascent Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, but it was beset by ethnic tensions between the Khmer and Vietnamese. News of the group was censored from the press and it is unlikely S\u00e2r was aware of it.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=40\u201342}}\n\n=== Paris: 1949\u20131953 ===\n[[File:Panth\u00e9on May 12, 1960.jpg|thumb|upright|S\u00e2r arrived in Paris, France (pictured in 1960).]]\n\nAccess to further education abroad made S\u00e2r part of a tiny elite in Cambodia.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=43}} He and the 21 other selected students sailed from [[Saigon]] aboard the SS ''Jama\u00efque'', stopping at [[Singapore]], [[Colombo]], and [[Djibouti]] en route to [[Marseille]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=25, 27|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=45}} In January 1950, S\u00e2r enrolled at the [[EFREI|\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de radio\u00e9lectricit\u00e9]] to study [[radio electronics]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} He took a room in the [[Cit\u00e9 Universitaire]]'s Indochinese Pavilion,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=28}} then lodgings on the rue Amyot,{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} and eventually a bedsit on the corner of the rue de Commerce and the rue Letelier.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=51}} S\u00e2r earned good marks during his first year. He failed his first end-of-year exams but was allowed to retake them and narrowly passed, enabling him to continue his studies.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=53}}\n\nS\u00e2r spent three years in Paris.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=28}} In summer 1950, he was one of 18 Cambodian students who joined French counterparts in traveling to [[Yugoslavia]], a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state, to volunteer in a labour battalion building a motorway in [[Zagreb]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=30|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=50}} He returned to Yugoslavia the following year for a camping holiday.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=51}} S\u00e2r made little or no attempt to assimilate into French culture{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=30}} and was never completely at ease in the French language.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} He nevertheless became familiar with much French literature, one of his favorite authors being [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=34}} His most significant friendships in the country were with Ieng Sary, who had joined him there, Thiounn Mumm and [[Keng Vannsak]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|pp=28\u201329}} He was a member of Vannsak's discussion circle, whose ideologically diverse membership discussed ways to achieve Cambodian independence.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=52, 59}}\n\nIn Paris, Ieng Sary and two others established the Cercle Marxiste (\"Marxist Circle\"), a Marxist\u2013Leninist organisation arranged in a [[clandestine cell system]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=63}} The cells met to read Marxist texts and hold [[self-criticism]] sessions.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=64}} S\u00e2r joined a cell that met on the rue Lacep\u00e8de;

the [[Communist Party of China]] had recently come to power under [[Mao Zedong]] and the French Communist Party was one of the country's largest,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=27}} attracting the votes of around 25% of the French electorate.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=69}}\n\n[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|left|In Paris, Pol Pot was inspired by the writings of [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] (pictured together in 1949) on how to conduct a revolution and build a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]]-governed state.]]\nS\u00e2r found many of [[Karl Marx]]'s denser texts difficult, later saying he \"didn't really understand\" them.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=66}} But he became familiar with the writings of [[Soviet leader]] [[Joseph Stalin]],{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=34|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=67}} including ''[[The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)]]''.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=66}} Stalin's approach to Marxism\u2014known as [[Stalinism]]\u2014gave S\u00e2r a sense of purpose in life.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=65}} S\u00e2r also read Mao's work, especially ''On New Democracy'', a text outlining a [[New Democracy|Marxist\u2013Leninist framework for carrying out a revolution in colonial and semi-colonial, semi-feudal societies]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=70}} Alongside these texts, S\u00e2r read the [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s book on the [[French Revolution]], ''The Great Revolution''.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=72}} From Kropotkin he took the idea that an alliance between intellectuals and the peasantry was necessary for revolution;

of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] between 1975 and 1979. Ideologically a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] and [[Khmer nationalism|Khmer nationalist]], he was a leading member of Cambodia's [[Communism|communist]] movement, the [[Khmer Rouge]], from 1963 until 1997 and served as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] from 1963 to 1981. Under his administration, Cambodia was converted into a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[communist state]] governed according to Pol Pot's interpretation of Marxism\u2013Leninism.\n\nBorn to a prosperous farmer in [[Prek Sbauv]], [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French Cambodia]], Pol Pot was educated at some of Cambodia's elite schools. While in [[Paris]] during the 1940s, he joined the [[French Communist Party]]. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] organisation and its guerrilla war against King [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s newly independent government. Following the Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist\u2013Leninist controlled [[North Vietnam]], Pol Pot returned to [[Phnom Penh]], working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist\u2013Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he [[Cambodian Civil War|relaunched the war]] against Sihanouk's government. After [[Lon Nol]] deposed Sihanouk in a [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]], Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against [[Khmer Republic|Lon Nol's government]], which was bolstered by the United States military. Aided by the [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] militia and North Vietnamese troops, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge forces advanced and controlled all of Cambodia by 1975.\n\nPol Pot transformed Cambodia into a one-party state called Democratic Kampuchea. Seeking to create an [[agrarian socialist]] society that he believed would evolve into a [[communist society]], Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on [[Collective farming|collective farms]]. Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens made to wear the same black clothing. Those the Khmer Rouge regarded as enemies were killed. These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 and 2 million people, approximately a quarter of Cambodia's population, a period later termed the [[Cambodian genocide]]. Repeated purges of the CPK generated growing discontent; by 1978 Cambodian soldiers were mounting a rebellion in the east. After several years of border clashes, [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|the newly unified Vietnam invaded Cambodia]] in December 1978, toppling Pol Pot and installing a [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation|rival Marxist\u2013Leninist government]] in 1979. The Khmer Rouge retreated to the jungles near the Thai border, from where they continued to fight. In declining health, Pol Pot stepped back from many of his roles in the movement. In 1998 the Khmer Rouge commander [[Ta Mok]] placed Pol Pot under house arrest, shortly after which he died.\n\nTaking power in Cambodia at the height of Marxism\u2013Leninism's global impact, Pol Pot proved divisive among the international communist movement. Many claimed he deviated from orthodox Marxism\u2013Leninism, but China backed his government as a bulwark against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in Southeast Asia. To his supporters, he was a champion of Cambodian sovereignty in the face of Vietnamese imperialism and stood against the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|Marxist revisionism]] of the Soviet Union. Conversely, he has been internationally denounced for his role in the Cambodian genocide, regarded as a [[totalitarian]] [[dictator]] guilty of [[crimes against humanity]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Childhood: 1925\u20131941 ===\nPol Pot was born in the village of [[Prek Sbauv]], outside the city of [[Kampong Thom city|Kampong Thom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=7|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=15}} He was named Saloth S\u00e2r ({{lang-km|\u179f\u17b6\u17a1\u17bb\u178f \u179f}} {{IPA-km|sa\u02d0.\u02c8lot s\u0251\u02d0|pron}}), the word ''s\u00e2r'' (\"white, pale\") referencing his comparatively light skin complexion.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=18}} French colonial records placed his birth date on 25 May 1928,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=7}} but biographer [[Philip Short]] argues he was born in March 1925.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Prek Sbauv.JPG|thumb|left|[[Prek Sbauv]], the village where Pol Pot was born and spent his early years]]\nHis family was of mixed [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese]] and [[Khmer people|ethnic Khmer]] heritage, but did not speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and lived as though they were fully Khmer.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=18}} His father Loth, who later took the name Saloth Phem, was a prosperous farmer who owned nine hectares of rice land and several draft cattle.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=8|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=15, 18}} Loth's house was one of the largest in the village and at transplanting and harvest time he hired poorer neighbors to carry out much of the agricultural labour.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=15}} S\u00e2r's mother, Sok Nem, was locally respected as a pious Buddhist.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} S\u00e2r was the eighth of nine children (two girls and seven boys),{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} three of whom died young.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=16}} They were raised as [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravada Buddhists]], and on festivals travelled to the Kampong Thom monastery.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=20}}\n\n[[List of monarchs of Cambodia|Cambodia was a monarchy]], but the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French colonial regime]], not the king, was in political control.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=14}} S\u00e2r's family had connections to the Cambodian royalty: his cousin Meak was a consort of King [[Sisowath Monivong]] and later worked as a [[ballet]] teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=8|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=16\u201317}} When S\u00e2r was six years old, he and an older brother were sent to live with Meak in [[Phnom Penh]]; informal adoptions by wealthier relatives were then common in Cambodia.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} In Phnom Penh, he spent 18 months as a novice monk in the city's Vat Botum Vaddei monastery, learning [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings and to read and write the [[Khmer language]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=9|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=20\u201321}}\n\nIn summer 1935, S\u00e2r went to live with his brother Suong and the latter's wife and child.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=23}} That year he began an education at a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] primary school, the \u00c9cole Miche,{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=17|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=23}} with Meak paying the tuition fees.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} Most of his classmates were the children of French bureaucrats and Catholic [[Vietnamese Cambodians|Vietnamese]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} He became literate in French and familiar with [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} S\u00e2r was not academically gifted and was held back two years, receiving his Certificat d'Etudes Primaires Compl\u00e9mentaires in 1941 at the age of 16.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=28}} He had continued to visit Meak at the king's palace and it was there that he had some of his earliest sexual experiences with some of the king's concubines.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=27}}\n\n=== Later education: 1942\u20131948 ===\nWhile S\u00e2r was at the school, the [[King of Cambodia]] died. In 1941 the French authorities appointed [[Norodom Sihanouk]] as his replacement.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=17|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=28\u201329}} A new junior middle school, the Coll\u00e9ge Pream Sihanouk, was established in Kampong Cham, and S\u00e2r was selected as a [[boarding school|boarder]] at the institution in 1942.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=18|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=28}} This level of education afforded him a privileged position in Cambodian society.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} He learned to play the [[violin]] and took part in school plays.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=19|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=31}} Much of his spare time was spent playing [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=31}} Several fellow pupils, among them [[Hu Nim]] and [[Khieu Samphan]], later served in his government.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=19}} During the new year vacation in 1945, S\u00e2r and several friends from his college theatre troupe went on a provincial tour in a bus to raise money for a trip to [[Angkor Wat]].{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=32\u201333}} In 1947, he left the school.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=21}}\n\nThat year he passed exams that admitted him into the [[Lyc\u00e9e Sisowath]], meanwhile living with Suong and his new wife.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=36}} In summer 1948, he sat the ''brevet'' entry exams for the upper classes of the Lyc\u00e9e, but failed. Unlike several of his friends, he could not continue on at the school for a [[baccalaur\u00e9at]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=42}} Instead, he enrolled in 1948 to study carpentry at the Ecole Technique in [[Russey Keo]], in Phnom Penh's northern suburbs.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=42\u201343}} This drop from an academic education to a vocational one likely came as a shock.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=42}} His fellow students were generally of a lower class than those at the Lyc\u00e9e Sisowath, though they were not peasants.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} At the Ecole Technique he met [[Ieng Sary]], who became a close friend and later a member of his government.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} In summer 1949, S\u00e2r passed his ''brevet'' and secured one of five scholarships allowing him to travel to France to study at one of its engineering schools.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Nazi Germany]] invaded France and in 1945 the Japanese ousted the French from Cambodia, with Sihanouk proclaiming his country's independence.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=31}} After the war ended with Germany's and Japan's defeat, France reasserted its control over Cambodia in 1946,{{sfn|Short|2004|p=34}} but allowed for the creation of a new constitution and the establishment of various political parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=37}} The most successful of these was the [[Democratic Party (Cambodia)|Democratic Party]], which won the [[1946 Cambodian general election|1946 general election]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=23, 24|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=37}} According to Chandler, S\u00e2r and Sary worked for the party during its successful election campaign;{{sfn|Chandler|1992|pp=23, 24}} conversely, Short maintains that S\u00e2r had no contact with the party.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=42}} Sihanouk opposed the party's left-leaning reforms and in 1948 dissolved the National Assembly, instead [[Rule by decree|ruling by decree]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=24}} Operatives of [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s better established Vietnamese Marxist\u2013Leninist group, the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]], also established a nascent Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, but it was beset by ethnic tensions between the Khmer and Vietnamese. News of the group was censored from the press and it is unlikely S\u00e2r was aware of it.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=40\u201342}}\n\n=== Paris: 1949\u20131953 ===\n[[File:Panth\u00e9on May 12, 1960.jpg|thumb|upright|S\u00e2r arrived in Paris, France (pictured in 1960).]]\n\nAccess to further education abroad made S\u00e2r part of a tiny elite in Cambodia.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=43}} He and the 21 other selected students sailed from [[Saigon]] aboard the SS ''Jama\u00efque'', stopping at [[Singapore]], [[Colombo]], and [[Djibouti]] en route to [[Marseille]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=25, 27|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=45}} In January 1950, S\u00e2r enrolled at the [[EFREI|\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de radio\u00e9lectricit\u00e9]] to study [[radio electronics]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} He took a room in the [[Cit\u00e9 Universitaire]]'s Indochinese Pavilion,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=28}} then lodgings on the rue Amyot,{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} and eventually a bedsit on the corner of the rue de Commerce and the rue Letelier.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=51}} S\u00e2r earned good marks during his first year. He failed his first end-of-year exams but was allowed to retake them and narrowly passed, enabling him to continue his studies.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=53}}\n\nS\u00e2r spent three years in Paris.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=28}} In summer 1950, he was one of 18 Cambodian students who joined French counterparts in traveling to [[Yugoslavia]], a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state, to volunteer in a labour battalion building a motorway in [[Zagreb]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=30|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=50}} He returned to Yugoslavia the following year for a camping holiday.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=51}} S\u00e2r made little or no attempt to assimilate into French culture{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=30}} and was never completely at ease in the French language.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} He nevertheless became familiar with much French literature, one of his favorite authors being [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=34}} His most significant friendships in the country were with Ieng Sary, who had joined him there, Thiounn Mumm and [[Keng Vannsak]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|pp=28\u201329}} He was a member of Vannsak's discussion circle, whose ideologically diverse membership discussed ways to achieve Cambodian independence.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=52, 59}}\n\nIn Paris, Ieng Sary and two others established the Cercle Marxiste (\"Marxist Circle\"), a Marxist\u2013Leninist organisation arranged in a [[clandestine cell system]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=63}} The cells met to read Marxist texts and hold [[self-criticism]] sessions.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=64}} S\u00e2r joined a cell that met on the rue Lacep\u00e8de; his cell comrades included Hou Yuon, Sien Ary, and Sok Knaol.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=63}} He helped to duplicate the Cercle's newspaper, ''Reaksmei'' (\"The Spark\"), named after [[Iskra|a former Russian paper]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=68}} In October 1951, Yuon was elected head of the Khmer Student Association (AEK; ''I'Association des Estudiants Khmers''), establishing close links between the organisation and the leftist [[Union Nationale des \u00c9tudiants de France]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=62}} The Cercle Marxiste manipulated the AEK and its successor organisations for the next 19 years.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=63}} Several months after the Cercle Marxiste's formation, S\u00e2r and Sary joined the [[French Communist Party]] (CFP).{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=22, 28|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=66}} S\u00e2r attended party meetings, including those of its Cambodian group, and read its magazine, ''Les Cahiers Internationaux''.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=66}} The Marxist\u2013Leninist movement was then in a strong position globally;
