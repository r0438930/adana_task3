Peterbus Unum'''\" is the 18th episode from the second season of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] [[list of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It first aired on July 12, 2000. The episode involved main character [[Peter Griffin]] establishing his house as an independent nation (or [[micronation]]), and then becoming under siege by the U.S. Army after invading their territory. The episode is rated [[TV-14|TV-14 DLS]] and is the only episode of the series to be animated by [[CNK International|Koko Enterprise]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] becomes jealous of his friends who have bought luxuries with their [[tax refund]]s, and plans to build a backyard [[swimming pool]]. After learning that he has no right to build it, he attempts to acquire a [[zoning]] [[Variance (land use)|variance]] from [[City Hall]]. However, as he and [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] examine the map of Quahog, they discover that the Griffins' property is actually not incorporated into Quahog, and thus is not even a part of the [[United States]]. Peter thus declares his house to be the new independent [[micronation]] of \"Petoria\". He spends the night on a \"[[Goodwill Ambassador|goodwill]] mission\" in Quahog, drinking at the Drunken Clam, and flaunts his [[diplomatic immunity]] by committing crimes.\n\nWhile representing Petoria at the [[United Nations]] headquarters in [[New York City]], Peter and his country are humiliated by [[Kofi Annan|the Secretary General]] and other representatives because of his country's smaller size. During lunch, he is approached by another ambassador, who informs him that his [[Ba'athist Iraq|country]] faced similar ridicule by the same leaders until it [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded Kuwait]].  Following his advice, Peter \"invades\" Joe's swimming pool next door. In response to this illegal action, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] agrees to impose sanctions upon Petoria. Days later, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] surrounds Petoria.  Peter refuses to surrender, leading to conflict with his family, who are living without basic amenities due to the siege. He invites the leaders of several countries hostile to the United States over for a [[pool party]] and [[barbecue]]. Not long afterwards, Lois witnesses Stewie imitating an Arab yell, which is enough for her to defect to the U.S. with her children. Peter finally surrenders when an American missile is pointed at him. At the negotiating table with Mayor West, Peter cedes Petoria back to the U.S., but feels better when Lois offers to comfort him every night.\n\nIt is then revealed that the events of the episode were part of a film being shown to [[social studies]] students 200 years into the future, explaining the brief history of Petoria. The teacher asks her students if they have any questions concerning the video, to which a pupil asks if the Griffin family can actually understand [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] or not, with the other students nodding their heads in agreement with the question, before the episode abruptly ends.\n\n==Reception==\nIn his 2009 review, Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]], rating the episode a 9/10, called \"E. Peterbus Unum\" a \"great episode\" and stated that \"the over-the-top political satire\" is \"some of the best\" in the series.<ref name=ign>{{cite web |author=Haque, Ahsan |title=Family Guy: \"E.
