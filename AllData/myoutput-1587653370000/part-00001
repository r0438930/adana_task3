Germination decreases lysine, tryptophan, sulphur and total aromatic amino acids, but most contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference pattern.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\nOligosaccharides, such as stachyose and raffinose, are reduced in higher amounts during germination than during cooking. Minerals and [[B vitamins]] are retained more effectively during germination than with cooking. Phytic acids are reduced significantly, but trypsin inhibitor, tannin, and saponin reduction is less effective than cooking.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Autoclaving, microwave cooking, boiling===\nProtein digestibility is improved by all treatments of cooking. Essential amino acids are slightly increased by boiling and microwave cooking when compared to autoclaving and germination. Overall, microwave cooking leads to a significantly lower loss of nutrients compared to autoclaving and boiling.\n\nFinally, all treatments lead to an improved protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio, and essential amino acid index. Microwave cooking seems to be an effective method to prepare chickpeas because of its improvement of nutritional values and its lower cooking time.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Leaves===\nIn some parts of the world, young chickpea leaves are consumed as cooked green vegetables.

Recent research has indicated that a combination of heat treatment along with the two vital micronutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, are the most critical components to increasing the overall yield of ''Cicer arietinum''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPerennial chickpeas are a fundamental source of nutrition in animal feed as they are high sources of energy and protein for livestock. Unlike other food crops, the perennial chickpea shows a remarkable capacity to change its nutritional content in response to heat cultivation. Treating the chickpea with a constant heat source increases its protein content almost threefold.<ref name=\":1\">Bampidis, V.A. & Christodoulou, V. (2011). Chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) in animal nutrition: A review.

Increasing the height and size of chickpea plants involves using micronutrient fertilization with varying doses of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe level of phosphorus that a chickpea seed is exposed to during its lifecycle has a positive correlation relative to the height of the plant at full maturity.<ref name=\":0\">Mishra, U.S., Sirothia, P., & Bhadoria, U.S. (2009). Effects of phosphorus nutrition on growth and yield of chickpea (''Cicer arietinum'') under rain fed conditions. International Journal of Agricultural and Statistical Sciences, 5(1): 85\u201388.</ref> Increasing the levels of inorganic phosphorus at all doses incrementally increases the height of the chickpea plant. Thus, the seasonal changes in phosphorus soil content as well as periods of drought that are known to be a native characteristic of the dry [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] region where the chickpea is most commonly cultivated have a strong effect on the growth of the plant itself. Plant yield is also affected by a combination of phosphorus nutrition and water supply, resulting in a 12% increase in yield of the crop.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNitrogen nutrition is another factor that affects the yield of ''Cicer arietinum'', although the application itself differs from other perennial crops with regards to the levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant.<ref name=\":2\" /> Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of ''Cicer arietinum''. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and mineral nitrogen supply all have an effect on the yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that ''Cicer arietinum'' differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral nitrogen supply from soil during drought stress.<ref name=\":2\">Wery, J., Deschamps, M., & Leger-Cresson, N.

In Spain, they are used cold in ''[[tapas]]'' and salads, as well as in ''[[cocido madrile\u00f1o]]''.\n\n''[[\u1e24ummu\u1e63]]'' is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for chickpeas, which are often cooked and ground into a paste and mixed with ''[[\u1e6da\u1e25\u012bna]]'' (sesame seed paste), the blend called ''[[hummus|\u1e25ummu\u1e63 bi \u1e6da\u1e25\u012bna]]''. Chickpeas are roasted, spiced, and eaten as a snack, such as ''[[leblebi]]''. By the end of the 20th century, hummus had become commonplace in American cuisine.<ref name=\"marks\">Marks, Gil (2010), ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Food'', John Wiley and Sons, pp. 269\u201371{{ISBN?}}</ref> By 2010, 5% of Americans consumed hummus on a regular basis,<ref name=\"marks\"/> and it was present in 17% of American households.<ref name=\"fox\">{{cite web |last=Ferretti |first=Elena |date=5 April 2010 |url=https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/theres-hummus-among-us |title=There's Hummus Among Us |publisher=Fox News |access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nChickpeas and Bengal grams are used to make curries and are one of the most popular vegetarian foods in the Indian subcontinent and in [[diaspora]] communities of many other countries served with variety of breads or steamed rice. Popular dishes in Indian cuisine are made with chickpea flour, such as ''[[mirchi bajji]]'' and ''mirapakaya bajji.'' In India, as well as in the [[Levant]], unripe chickpeas are often picked out of the pod and eaten as a raw snack and the leaves are eaten as a [[leaf vegetable]] in salads. In India, desserts such as [[Halva#India|besan halwa]] and sweets such as [[besan barfi]] and [[laddu]] are made.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nChickpea flour is used to make \"[[Burmese tofu]]\" which was first known among the [[Shan people|Shan]] people of [[Myanmar|Burma]]. In South Asian cuisine the chickpea flour ([[Gram flour|besan]]) is used as a batter to coat vegetables before deep frying to make [[pakora]]s. The flour is also used as a batter to coat vegetables and meats before frying, or fried alone such as  ''panelle'' (little bread), a chickpea [[fritter]] from [[Sicily]]. Chickpea flour is used to make the Mediterranean flatbread ''[[socca]]'' and  called ''panisse'' in Provence, southern France. It is made of cooked chickpea flour, poured into saucers, allowed to set, cut in strips, and fried in olive oil, often eaten during Lent. In Tuscany chickpea flour (farina di ceci) is used to make an oven baked pancake: the flour is mixed with water, oil and salt. Chickpea flour known as kadlehittu in [[Kannada]] is used for making sweet dish [[Mysorepak]].\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], chickpeas preserved in syrup are eaten as sweets and in desserts such as ''[[halo-halo]]''. [[Jews]] from [[Ashkenazi]] countries traditionally serve whole chickpeas at a ''[[Shalom Zachar]]'' celebration for baby boys.\n\n''[[Guasanas]]'' or ''garbanza'' is a Mexican chickpea street snack. The beans, while still green, are cooked in water and salt, kept in a steamer to maintain their humidity, and served in a plastic bag.\n\nA chickpea-derived liquid (''[[aquafaba]]'') can be used as an egg white replacement to make [[meringue]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2015/06/aquafaba-baking-with-chickpea-liquid-for-vegan-meringues.html|title=Stop Pouring Your Chickpea Liquid Down the Drain.

This leads to higher nutrition values and fewer digestive problems in nonruminants. Nonruminant diets can be completed with 200 g/kg of raw chickpeas to promote egg production and growth of birds and pigs. Higher amounts can be used when chickpeas are treated with heat.<ref name= Bampidis/>\n\nExperiments have shown that ruminants grow equally well and produce an equal amount and quality of milk when soybean or cereal meals are replaced with chickpeas. Pigs show the same performance, but growing pigs experience a negative effect of raw chickpea feed; extruded chickpeas can increase performance even in growing pigs. In poultry diet experiments with untreated chickpeas, only young broilers (starting period) showed worse performance. Fish performed equally well when their soybean or cereal diet was replaced by extruded chickpeas.<ref name= Bampidis/> Chickpea seeds have also been used in rabbit diets.<ref name= \"fao\" />\n\nSecondary components of legumes\u2014such as [[lecithin]], [[polyphenols]], [[oligosaccharides]]; and [[amylase]], [[protease]], [[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]] inhibitors\u2014can lead to lower nutrient availability, and thus to impaired growth and health of animals (especially in non[[ruminants]]). Ruminants have generally less trouble digesting legumes with secondary components, since they can inactivate them in the rumen liquor. Their diets can be supplemented by 300 g/kg or more raw chickpea seeds.<ref name= Bampidis/> However, protein digestibility and energy availability can be improved through treatments, such as germination, dehulling, and heat. Extrusion is a very good heat technique to destroy secondary components in legumes, since the proteins are irreversibly denatured. Overprocessing may decrease the nutritional value; extrusion leads to losses in minerals and vitamins, while dry heating does not change the chemical composition.<ref name= Bampidis/>\n\n==Nutrition==\n{{Infobox nutritional value\n|name=Chickpeas, mature seeds, cooked no salt\n|kJ=686\n|protein=8.86 g\n|fat=2.59 g\n|satfat=0.27 g\n|monofat=0.58 g\n|polyfat=1.16 g\n|carbs=27.42 g\n|sugars=4.8 g\n|fibre=7.6 g\n|sodium_mg=7\n|potassium_mg=291\n|vitA_ug=1\n|vitC_mg=1.3\n|thiamin_mg=0.12\n|riboflavin_mg=0.06\n|niacin_mg=0.53\n|pantothenic_mg=0.29\n|folate_ug=172\n|vitE_mg=0.35\n|vitK_ug=4\n|calcium_mg=49\n|iron_mg=2.89\n|phosphorus_mg=168\n|magnesium_mg=48\n|zinc_mg=1.53\n|vitB6_mg=0.14\n|vitB12_ug=0\n|water=60.21 g\n|source_usda=1\n|right=0}}\n{{Infobox nutritional value\n|name=Chickpeas, mature seeds, raw\n|kJ=1581\n|protein=20.47 g\n|fat=6.04 g\n|satfat=0.603\n|monofat=1.377\n|polyfat=2.731\n|carbs=62.95 g\n|sugars=10.7 g\n|fibre=12.2 g\n|sodium_mg=24\n|potassium_mg=718\n|vitA_ug=3\n|vitC_mg=4\n|thiamin_mg=0.477\n|riboflavin_mg=0.212\n|niacin_mg=1.541\n|pantothenic_mg=1.588\n|folate_ug=557\n|vitE_mg=0.82\n|vitK_ug=9\n|calcium_mg=57\n|copper_mg=0.656\n|iron_mg=4.31\n|manganese_mg=21.306 \t\n|magnesium_mg=79\n|phosphorus_mg=252\n|zinc_mg=2.76\n|vitB6_mg=0.535\n|vitB12_ug=0\n|water=60.21 g\n|source_usda=1\n|right=1}}\n\nChickpeas are a nutrient-dense food, providing rich content (20% or higher of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[protein]], [[dietary fiber]], [[folate]], and certain [[dietary minerals]], such as [[iron]] and [[phosphorus]] in a 100 gram reference amount (see adjacent nutrition table).

Thus, cooking can increase protein quality by inactivating or destroying heat-labile antinutritional factors.<ref name=El-Adawy /> Cooking also increases protein digestibility, essential amino acid index, and protein efficiency ratio. Although cooking lowers concentrations of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, total aromatic, and sulphur-containing amino acids, their contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference.<ref name=El-Adawy /> Diffusion of reducing sugars, raffinose, sucrose and others into cooking water reduces or completely removes these components.  Cooking also significantly reduces fat and mineral contents. The B vitamins riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and pyridoxine dissolve into cooking water at differing rates.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Germination===\nGermination of chickpeas improves protein digestibility, although at a lower level than cooking. Germination degrades proteins to simple peptides, so improves crude protein, nonprotein nitrogen, and crude fiber content. Germination decreases lysine, tryptophan, sulphur and total aromatic amino acids, but most contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference pattern.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\nOligosaccharides, such as stachyose and raffinose, are reduced in higher amounts during germination than during cooking. Minerals and [[B vitamins]] are retained more effectively during germination than with cooking. Phytic acids are reduced significantly, but trypsin inhibitor, tannin, and saponin reduction is less effective than cooking.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Autoclaving, microwave cooking, boiling===\nProtein digestibility is improved by all treatments of cooking. Essential amino acids are slightly increased by boiling and microwave cooking when compared to autoclaving and germination. Overall, microwave cooking leads to a significantly lower loss of nutrients compared to autoclaving and boiling.\n\nFinally, all treatments lead to an improved protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio, and essential amino acid index. Microwave cooking seems to be an effective method to prepare chickpeas because of its improvement of nutritional values and its lower cooking time.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Leaves===\nIn some parts of the world, young chickpea leaves are consumed as cooked green vegetables.

Recent research has indicated that a combination of heat treatment along with the two vital micronutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, are the most critical components to increasing the overall yield of ''Cicer arietinum''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPerennial chickpeas are a fundamental source of nutrition in animal feed as they are high sources of energy and protein for livestock. Unlike other food crops, the perennial chickpea shows a remarkable capacity to change its nutritional content in response to heat cultivation. Treating the chickpea with a constant heat source increases its protein content almost threefold.<ref name=\":1\">Bampidis, V.A. & Christodoulou, V. (2011).

Increasing the height and size of chickpea plants involves using micronutrient fertilization with varying doses of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe level of phosphorus that a chickpea seed is exposed to during its lifecycle has a positive correlation relative to the height of the plant at full maturity.<ref name=\":0\">Mishra, U.S., Sirothia, P., & Bhadoria, U.S. (2009). Effects of phosphorus nutrition on growth and yield of chickpea (''Cicer arietinum'') under rain fed conditions. International Journal of Agricultural and Statistical Sciences, 5(1): 85\u201388.</ref> Increasing the levels of inorganic phosphorus at all doses incrementally increases the height of the chickpea plant. Thus, the seasonal changes in phosphorus soil content as well as periods of drought that are known to be a native characteristic of the dry [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] region where the chickpea is most commonly cultivated have a strong effect on the growth of the plant itself. Plant yield is also affected by a combination of phosphorus nutrition and water supply, resulting in a 12% increase in yield of the crop.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNitrogen nutrition is another factor that affects the yield of ''Cicer arietinum'', although the application itself differs from other perennial crops with regards to the levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant.<ref name=\":2\" /> Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of ''Cicer arietinum''. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and mineral nitrogen supply all have an effect on the yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that ''Cicer arietinum'' differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral nitrogen supply from soil during drought stress.<ref name=\":2\">Wery, J., Deschamps, M., & Leger-Cresson, N.
