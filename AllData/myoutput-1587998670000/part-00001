In 1990, 17.5% of the population in Gikongoro was Tutsi. Tutsi were unevenly distributed throughout the province; 43% of Tutsi lived in [[Mubuga]], with smaller percentages in [[Nyamagabe]] and [[Muko, Rwanda|Muko]]. There were five sectors with a Tutsi-majority population. The pre-genocide figure of 17.5% may be low due to missing data from [[Rwamiko]]. Rwamiko bordered [[Butare province]]\u2014according to the 1991 census Butare province was 17.3%. Tutsi, more than any other province. Many of the sectors around Rwamiko were at least 40% Tutsi. There is a discrepancy between the 1990 local population data and 1991 population census. The 1991 census reported that only 12.8% of Gikongoro residents were Tutsi. According to [[Marijke Verpoorten]], a researcher at [[Universiteit Antwerpen]], the 1991 census under-reported Tutsi population figures. The Rwandan government stopped reporting ethnic demographic data after the genocide. <ref name=verpoorten />\n\nAccording to some estimates, Tutsi men in Gikongoro had only a 25% chance of surviving the genocide. Other estimates have placed the odds even lower, around 10.7%. The genocide was more severe in areas where Tutsi had been persuaded to gather like [[Kibeho]] and [[Kaduha]]; these [[parish]]es were announced as safe locations for Tutsi to gather, but ended up being locations of large scale massacres. The violence was particularly intense in [[Mubugu]] and [[Rukondo]]. There was very little opposition to the genocide amongst local leadership; those who did object, in areas like [[Musebeya]], [[Lake Kivu|Kivu]] and [[Kinyamakara]], were unable to make a significant difference in the overall progress of the genocide and eventually lost their influence to political rivals who took advantage of the situation. [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) has identified Gikongoro as the location of some of the \"earliest attacks\" and \"worst massacres\" of the Rwandan genocide. The violence spread from Gikongoro to nearby areas, spreading outward from [[Kigali]] until it reached [[Gitarama Province]].<ref name=verpoorten />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rwanda-geo-stub}}\n\n{{coord|02|30|S|29|35|E|type:city_source:frwiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Former provinces of Rwanda]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 2006]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Former province of Rwanda}}\n[[Image:Rwanda.geohive.gif|thumb|right|Map showing the former provinces of Rwanda]]\n'''Gikongoro Province''' was one of the former twelve [[provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] (''intara'') of [[Rwanda]] and is situated in the southwest of the country.
