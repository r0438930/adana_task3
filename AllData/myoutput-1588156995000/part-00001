Its station code is DEE. It is managed by Delhi Division of [[Northern Railway zone]]. Many trains from [[Delhi]] to [[Haryana]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]] stop at this station. More than twenty trains including Duronto and AC trains originate at this station.\n\n==Etymology==\n''[[Sarai (resting place)|Sarai]]'' means an inn or resting place for travellers. The station is named after the medieval village it was located in. The village itself was named after a sarai, named after Ruhullah Khan, a noble in the Mughal court. Once it was a ''[[Sarai (resting place)|sarai]]'' on the busy road to [[Delhi]] and pilgrimage town of [[Ajmer]]. He was one of the three sons of Khalil Ullah Khan, the Governor of Delhi province during reign of Mughal Emperor [[Shahjahan]], and also a distant relative of Empress [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. Over time, this name has been corrupted to [[Rohilla]] after Rohillas who ruled a region called [[Rohilkhand]] around [[Bareilly]] and [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] northeast of Delhi during the [[Mughal era]].<ref>{{cite web|title=An inn lost in the march of time |publisher=Hindustan Times |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/An-inn-lost-in-the-march-of-time/Article1-1099594.aspx |author=Nivedita Khandekar |date=28 July 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731073152/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/newdelhi/An-inn-lost-in-the-march-of-time/Article1-1099594.aspx |archivedate=31 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Northern_Railway_zone#History | label 1 = Northern Railway zone history}}\n\n===Start===\nDelhi Sarai Rohilla Terminal railway station was established in 1872 when the [[metre gauge]] railway line from Delhi to [[Jaipur]] and [[Ajmer]] was being laid.
