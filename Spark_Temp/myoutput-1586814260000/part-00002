Belgo-Congolese troops, British Commonwealth forces and local resistance fighters besieged the fort at the market town of [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]] in south-western [[Ethiopia]] in 1941. The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender.\n\nIn the first months of 1941, British and [[Force Publique|Belgian colonial forces]] attacked [[Italian East Africa]] from the colony of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. By the end of March, they had seized the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Sa\u00efo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]] and later General [[Pietro Gazzera]]. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Sa\u00efo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the [[South African Air Force]] put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.\n\nAt the end of the month General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] took charge of the Belgian force. He was instructed by the British to attack when an opportunity presented itself. On 3 July, he assaulted the base of Sa\u00efo Mountain and in the afternoon Gazzera sued for peace. On 6 July, the Belgians formally accepted the surrender of Gazzera, eight of his generals and over {{nowrap|6,000 Italian}} soldiers.\n\n== Background ==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)|l1=Order of Battle, East African Campaign|First Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the colony of ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian victory in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], fought 3 October 1935 \u2013 May 1936) and the existing Italian possessions of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]].{{efn|The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during World War II but the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=6\u20137, 69}}}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===''Regio Esercito''===\n\n{{see also|Regio Esercito}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia shaded relief map 1999, CIA.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Ethiopia}}]]\n[[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], was appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor-General]] of Italian East Africa in November 1937, with a headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]], the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of the ''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana'' (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and ''Generale d'Armata Aerea'' (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 locally recruited}} and Italian-born army, naval and air force personnel, available. By 1 August, mobilisation in Italian East Africa had increased that number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=93}} On 10 June, the ''Regio Esercito'' (Italian Royal Army) was organised in four commands, with the military forces in Ethiopia led by General [[Pietro Gazzera]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\nAosta had the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division ''Cacciatori d'Africa'']] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] from Italy, a battalion of ''[[Alpini]]'' (elite mountain troops), a ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' battalion of motorised infantry, several {{lang|it|Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale}} (MSVN [[MVSN Colonial Militia|''Camicie Nere'']] [Blackshirt]) battalions and an assortment of smaller units; about 70 percent of the Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in Italian East Africa and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\n===British plans===\n\nIn August 1939, Wavell ordered a plan covertly to encourage a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of [[Gojjam]], which the Italians had never been able entirely to repress after the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|Daniel Sandford]] arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. [[Gideon Force|Mission 101]] was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots). In June 1940, [[Haile Selassie]] arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of [[Lake Tana]], to [[Dangila]], Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the ''Arbegnoch''. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=403}}\n\nThe Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and \u00a31 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma\u2013Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n===Belgian plans===\n{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Force Publique'' soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa]]\nAt the conclusion of the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (\"Public Force\" i.e. the colonial army) of the [[Belgian Congo]] in Central Africa. It thus made up the bulk of the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Consisting of 15,000 native ranks and Belgian officers, it was well equipped, well disciplined and dispersed throughout the colony.<ref name= Veranneman83>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=83}}</ref> Through the year, the ''Force Publique'''s defence obligations were considered too important for it to be spared for any offensive operations.

The [[Belgian government in exile]] was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940.<ref name= Veranneman84>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=84}}</ref> Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo.<ref name= weller5>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=5}}</ref>\n\n[[Free French Forces]] consolidated their control over Equatorial Africa at the [[Battle of Gabon]] and more German involvement in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] (begun by Italy in 1939) made the possibility of intervention in Portugal remote.<ref name= weller4/> The staff of the ''Force Publique'' and the Belgian government then resolved to assemble an expedition to fight in Italian East Africa.<ref name= weller5/> Plans were coordinated with the British and in February 1941, after an extended period of preparation, the first group of 8,000 troops and porters set out from the Congo for Ethiopia.<ref name= Veranneman84/> Starting in [[Stanley Pool]], they rode a dozen {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} barges and a tugboat up the [[Congo River]] to [[Aketi (town)|Aketi]].

After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a [[salient (geography)|salient]] formed around the [[Baro River]]. In March 1941, the Italian forces began to withdraw from the salient under increasing pressure.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> On 8 March the first battalion of the Belgo-Congolese expeditionary force marched from Kurmuk towards the Italian-held town of Asosa. They attacked three days later in conjunction with troops of the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR), forcing the garrison to retreat to [[Gidami]].<ref name=weller6/> Next, the Belgians and Congolese began attacking the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] directly from the west while two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of the 2/6 KAR under Captain J.

Numbering at 1,600 soldiers and 600 non-combatant [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], they lacked the strength to seize the plateau. With the Italians receiving reinforcements of troops retreating from the east, the Belgians decided to keep the initiative to disguise their small numbers.<ref name= weller16>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThree days of cold weather and rain preceded the offensive.<ref name= weller21>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=21}}</ref> On 15 April, Lieutenant Colonel Edmond van der Meersch led an attack on the brook. A Belgian lieutenant scouting in [[no man's land]] was ambushed and killed. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by [[sniper]]s concealed in [[the bush]]. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were killed. Three Italians and an estimated 40 [[Eritrean Ascari]] were killed, with approximately 70 Ascari wounded.<ref name= weller16/>\n\nDuring the ensuring stalemate, the Belgians studied the Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and artillery spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their [[artillery barrage]]s were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue up to an hour after they withdrew.<ref name= weller16/> On 21 April, the Italians launched a large [[counterattack]]. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by [[Oromo people|Galla]] snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks.<ref name= weller16/> With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.<ref name= weller21/><ref name= weller17>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=17}}</ref>\n\n=== Belgian supply difficulties ===\n\n[[File:Belgian truck on rough Ethiopian terrain.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Congolese struggle to move a truck across rough Ethiopian terrain}}]]\nBy May, Belgian numbers had risen to 2,500 men, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens. The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their communications and supplies. The Baro and [[Sobat River|Sobat]] rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by [[airdrop]], forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations.<ref name= weller17/> Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Sudan, but died of fatigue and undernourishment.

They then decided to try to sever the Italian supply line between Sa\u00efo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack.<ref name= weller18/> It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Sa\u00efo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered by the arrival of a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Sa\u00efo was being supplied.<ref name= weller19/>\n\nAt the regular front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to increase their patrol activities upon the Sa\u00efo Plateau, to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces.<ref name= weller19/> They used [[shoot-and-scoot]] tactics, avoiding [[counter-battery fire]] and leaving the Italians with the impression that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison and the Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF) committed three [[Hawker Hart]] biplanes to regularly bomb the Sa\u00efo fortress and [[strafe]] the surrounding roads.<ref name= weller20>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=20}}</ref> In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in [[Jimma]] in mid June and withdraw to Sa\u00efo.<ref name= Playfair310>{{harvnb|Playfair|1956|p=310}}</ref> The 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and headed southeast to cut the Sa\u00efo\u2013[[Yubdo (woreda)|Yubdo]] road.<ref name= platt3552/> By the end of the month, the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the [[Didessa River]].

Belgo-Congolese troops, British Commonwealth forces and local resistance fighters besieged the fort at the market town of [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]] in south-western [[Ethiopia]] in 1941. The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender.\n\nIn the first months of 1941, British and [[Force Publique|Belgian colonial forces]] attacked [[Italian East Africa]] from the colony of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. By the end of March, they had seized the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Sa\u00efo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]] and later General [[Pietro Gazzera]]. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Sa\u00efo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the [[South African Air Force]] put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.\n\nAt the end of the month General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] took charge of the Belgian force. He was instructed by the British to attack when an opportunity presented itself. On 3 July, he assaulted the base of Sa\u00efo Mountain and in the afternoon Gazzera sued for peace. On 6 July, the Belgians formally accepted the surrender of Gazzera, eight of his generals and over {{nowrap|6,000 Italian}} soldiers.\n\n== Background ==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)|l1=Order of Battle, East African Campaign|First Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the colony of ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian victory in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], fought 3 October 1935 \u2013 May 1936) and the existing Italian possessions of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]].{{efn|The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during World War II but the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=6\u20137, 69}}}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===''Regio Esercito''===\n\n{{see also|Regio Esercito}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia shaded relief map 1999, CIA.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Ethiopia}}]]\n[[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], was appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor-General]] of Italian East Africa in November 1937, with a headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]], the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of the ''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana'' (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and ''Generale d'Armata Aerea'' (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 locally recruited}} and Italian-born army, naval and air force personnel, available. By 1 August, mobilisation in Italian East Africa had increased that number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=93}} On 10 June, the ''Regio Esercito'' (Italian Royal Army) was organised in four commands, with the military forces in Ethiopia led by General [[Pietro Gazzera]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\nAosta had the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division ''Cacciatori d'Africa'']] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] from Italy, a battalion of ''[[Alpini]]'' (elite mountain troops), a ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' battalion of motorised infantry, several {{lang|it|Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale}} (MSVN [[MVSN Colonial Militia|''Camicie Nere'']] [Blackshirt]) battalions and an assortment of smaller units; about 70 percent of the Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in Italian East Africa and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}\n\n===British plans===\n\nIn August 1939, Wavell ordered a plan covertly to encourage a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of [[Gojjam]], which the Italians had never been able entirely to repress after the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|Daniel Sandford]] arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. [[Gideon Force|Mission 101]] was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots). In June 1940, [[Haile Selassie]] arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of [[Lake Tana]], to [[Dangila]], Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the ''Arbegnoch''. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=403}}\n\nThe Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and \u00a31 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma\u2013Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n===Belgian plans===\n{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Force Publique'' soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa]]\nAt the conclusion of the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (\"Public Force\" i.e. the colonial army) of the [[Belgian Congo]] in Central Africa. It thus made up the bulk of the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Consisting of 15,000 native ranks and Belgian officers, it was well equipped, well disciplined and dispersed throughout the colony.<ref name= Veranneman83>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=83}}</ref> Through the year, the ''Force Publique'''s defence obligations were considered too important for it to be spared for any offensive operations.

The [[Belgian government in exile]] was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940.<ref name= Veranneman84>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=84}}</ref> Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo.<ref name= weller5>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=5}}</ref>\n\n[[Free French Forces]] consolidated their control over Equatorial Africa at the [[Battle of Gabon]] and more German involvement in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] (begun by Italy in 1939) made the possibility of intervention in Portugal remote.<ref name= weller4/> The staff of the ''Force Publique'' and the Belgian government then resolved to assemble an expedition to fight in Italian East Africa.<ref name= weller5/> Plans were coordinated with the British and in February 1941, after an extended period of preparation, the first group of 8,000 troops and porters set out from the Congo for Ethiopia.<ref name= Veranneman84/> Starting in [[Stanley Pool]], they rode a dozen {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} barges and a tugboat up the [[Congo River]] to [[Aketi (town)|Aketi]].

After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a [[salient (geography)|salient]] formed around the [[Baro River]].

After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by [[Oromo people|Galla]] snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks.<ref name= weller16/> With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.<ref name= weller21/><ref name= weller17>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=17}}</ref>\n\n=== Belgian supply difficulties ===\n\n[[File:Belgian truck on rough Ethiopian terrain.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Congolese struggle to move a truck across rough Ethiopian terrain}}]]\nBy May, Belgian numbers had risen to 2,500 men, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens. The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their communications and supplies. The Baro and [[Sobat River|Sobat]] rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by [[airdrop]], forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations.<ref name= weller17/> Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Sudan, but died of fatigue and undernourishment. Some of the officers resorted to stripping the [[camouflage]] netting from their trucks and [[Seine fishing|seining]] the Baro River for fish amid frequent outbreaks of [[Beriberi]].<ref name= weller18>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=18}}</ref> The Italians, encamped on fertile soil and well supplied, faced no such problems.<ref name= weller17/> The Belgians were also subject to regular air attack.<ref name= platt3552>{{harvnb|Platt|1946|p=3552}}</ref>\n\n=== Renewed Belgian offensives ===\n\n[[File:Italian trench captured by Belgian troops.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian trench captured by Belgian troops}}]]\nThe Belgo-Congolese situation remained difficult until early June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to reach them. They then decided to try to sever the Italian supply line between Sa\u00efo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack.<ref name= weller18/> It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Sa\u00efo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered by the arrival of a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Sa\u00efo was being supplied.<ref name= weller19/>\n\nAt the regular front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to increase their patrol activities upon the Sa\u00efo Plateau, to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces.<ref name= weller19/> They used [[shoot-and-scoot]] tactics, avoiding [[counter-battery fire]] and leaving the Italians with the impression that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison and the Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF) committed three [[Hawker Hart]] biplanes to regularly bomb the Sa\u00efo fortress and [[strafe]] the surrounding roads.<ref name= weller20>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=20}}</ref> In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in [[Jimma]] in mid June and withdraw to Sa\u00efo.<ref name= Playfair310>{{harvnb|Playfair|1956|p=310}}</ref> The 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and headed southeast to cut the Sa\u00efo\u2013[[Yubdo (woreda)|Yubdo]] road.<ref name= platt3552/> By the end of the month, the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the [[Didessa River]]. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo, to make their final stand at Sa\u00efo. Heavy rain, actions of the ''Arbegnoch'' and the raids from the SAAF added to their problems.<ref name= Playfair311/><ref name= orpen320>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=320}}</ref>\n\n=== Final assault and Italian surrender ===\n\n[[File:Aerial view of Sa\u00efo fortress.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|{{centre|Aerial view of Sa\u00efo fortress}}]]\nMajor General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] arrived from the Congo before the end of the month.<ref name= weller20/> On 27 June General [[William Platt]], advancing with British forces from Sudan, ordered the Belgians to attack the Italian positions if an opportunity presented itself and Gilliaert immediately undertook preparations for an offensive.<ref name= Playfair311/> The plans for taking Mogi were abandoned and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Sa\u00efo, so all but 50 of the soldiers besieging Mogi were redeployed.<ref name= weller20/><ref name= weller22>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=22}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I based our chances of success upon continuously keeping aggressive activity along Bortai Brook against Mogi and applying [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s maxim that you can try anything against an enemy who refuses to budge himself.|Gilliaert<ref name= weller21/>}}\n\n[[File:Belgian officers in Saio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|{{centre|General Auguste Gilliaert and Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens at the Italian headquarters in Sa\u00efo}}]]\nBelieving the British pursuit to be closer than it actually was, Gazzera ordered the bridge over the Indina River {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Sa\u00efo to be blown, thereby trapping his forces.

In them were eight Italian generals, a Catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them a short distance away from Bortai Brook near Gambela.<ref name= weller21/> They requested that all hostilities south of the [[Blue Nile]] cease and that their army be granted the [[honours of war]].<ref name= Playfair311/> Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Sa\u00efo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.<ref name= orpen321>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=321}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n[[File:Assossa-Gambela-Saio.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Congolese memorial to the actions at Asosa, Gambela and Sa\u00efo in Faradje}}]]\nThe Belgo-Congolese force lost 462 men during the conflict, 80 percent of them to disease. It was estimated that the Italians lost about three times as many men. A total of 6,454 Italian troops were taken prisoner, including Gazzera, eight other generals and 3,500 Askari, along with the seizure of 20 artillery pieces, 200 machine guns, 250 trucks and 500 mules.<ref name= Veranneman85/> With Gazzera's surrender, [[Gondar]] became the only area in Ethiopia that remained under Italian control.{{sfn|MOI|1941|p=136}} The market in Sa\u00efo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Sa\u00efo-Gambela road.<ref name= weller22/><ref name= weller24/>\n\nThough only numbering about 3,000 soldiers and 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners in the former [[Galla-Sidamo Governorate]] after the campaign.<ref name= weller22/> At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean Askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps in the east and sent Congolese guards to protect them from Ethiopian retaliation.<ref name= weller23>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=23}}</ref> The Belgian force quickly returned to the Congo with their [[War looting|spoils of war]].<ref name= weller24/> The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.<ref name= Veranneman85/>\n\n=== Commemoration ===\n\nIn 1943, a three-sided pyramid was erected in [[Faradje]], Belgian Congo to commemorate the actions of the Congolese in Ethiopia.
