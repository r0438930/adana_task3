More recent immigrant groups, from the mid-1990s on, consist of Asian nationalities\u2014especially [[Pakistan]]i and [[Bangladesh]]i\u2014with more recent political asylum and/or illegal migration flows through [[Turkey]] of [[Afghan]]s, [[Iraqi people|Iraqis]], [[Somali people|Somali]] and others. Since the 1990s, increases in such flows have led to the emergence of immigration as an increasingly important political issue in Greece.\n\nImmigrants fill roles mainly in the [[informal sector]], and there are large numbers of [[illegal immigration]] in Greece today. As larger numbers of migrants entered Greece in the 1990s,  the [[politics of Greece|Greek government]]'s immigration policy began to be seen as lacking the control and legal framework to manage the situation. While the Greek government has made some changes in immigration policy, [[immigration reform]] remains a low priority.\n\nIn 2015, arrivals of refugees by sea have increased dramatically in Greece mainly due to the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War]].

At the turn of the century, the majority of Greek immigrants migrated to the [[United States]]; from the 1950s to the 1970s, migration flowed towards other [[European countries]], mainly the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], where there was a labor shortage in the rebuilding process after the [[World War II|second world war]].<ref name=KIP /><ref name=ICD>Icduygu, Ahmet. \"Transborder Crime between Turkey and Greece: Human Smuggling and Its Regional Consequences.\" ''Southeast European and Black Sea Studies'' 4.2 (2004): 294\u2013314.

After the collapse of the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|military dictatorship in 1974]], some of the Greek refugees began to resettle in Greece.

At the beginning of the 1990s when these immigration flows started, Greece did not have the legislative framework to practically manage and control immigration.<ref name=GIP /> Until the Greek government began immigration policy reform in 1991, immigration legislation dated back to the 1920s and made it incredibly difficult for migrants to enter Greece legally for work purposes; it was obligatory for a migrant to have a work permit to enter Greece, which they must have obtained from their home [[consulate]] only after having acquired a job in Greece.<ref name=KIP /> In the mid-90s the Greek immigration policy relied mostly on massive [[deportation]] of mainly Albanian immigrants, hoping to discourage immigration to Greece. This policy tool was largely ineffective and the Greek government had to rethink its immigration policy at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<ref name=GIP /> While strides have been made to bring immigration policy in line with [[European Union|EU]] directives, immigration is still not a high priority for the Greek government, even as migrants continue to make up large portions of the Greek population.<ref name=LAZ2>Lazaridis, Gabriella, and Joanna Poyago\u2010Theotoky. \"Undocumented migrants in Greece: Issues of regularization.\" ''International Migration'' 37.4 (2002): 715\u2013740.</ref>\n\n==Migrant demographics==\n\nSince the 1990s, Greece has become an important country for migrants both as a final destination and as a transit stop between countries of origin and other countries in the EU.<ref name=ANT1>Antonopoulos, Georgios A., and [[John Winterdyk|John A.

Traditionally, the participation of Greek women in the labor force has been very low due to a lack of formal employment opportunities,  an overabundance of unpaid activities in small family businesses or agricultural work, and prevailing cultural attitudes in Greece about the domestic role of women.<ref name=BALD /> Between 1971 and 1996, adult female participation in the paid labor force jumped from 31.2% to 47.5%.<ref name=MW /> A rapid expansion of the [[education in Greece|Greek educational system]], coupled with increased prosperity in Greece, lead to an increase in women in the workplace and a subsequent reduction of supply of labor for certain (usually unpaid) work mostly done by women.<ref name=FAK />  However, Greek cultural values regarding women's \"duties\" within the home has not changed as rapidly as female employment has\u2014Greek women are increasingly taking on responsibilities outside the home while their domestic tasks remain largely unabated.<ref name=MW /> This creates a demand for cheap, migrant labor in areas related to household and care work in Greece that is largely filled by female migrants.\n\nThere is a great degree of [[occupational segregation|job segregation]] by sex for migrants in Greece, with mostly migrant women filling the domestic roles left by Greek women.<ref name=LAZ2 /> Women from the Philippines, Albania, and Eastern Europe dominate migrant domestic work in Greece, and indeed make up the majority of immigrants from those countries\u201476% of Bulgarian immigrants, 70% of Albanians, 76% of Romanian, 85% of Poles, and 80% of Filipino immigrants to Greece are female.<ref name=MW /> Greece has the highest [[feminization of migration|female migration]] rate in Europe.<ref name=MW /> Women from more developed countries tend to work in tourism and office work, while those from Asian, African, and former Soviet bloc countries are predominantly employed in household for domestic work, or as caregivers in medical centers.<ref name=FAK /> Filipino women are primarily employed as maids in families, while Albanian women are confined to domestic or cleaning roles.<ref name=LAZ2 /><ref name=FAK />\n\nWhile the majority of all female migrants are economic immigrants looking for good jobs that earn them a much higher salary than they can find in their homeland, female migrants, particularly undocumented ones, are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.<ref name=MW /><ref name=FAK /> The Greek legal system offers very little protection to domestic workers and in some cases may actually increase their insecurity and vulnerability.<ref name=MW /> Additionally, instances of [[human trafficking in Greece|sex trafficking]] are increasingly on the rise, with estimates citing that over 20,000 migrant women are trafficked into Greece every year for the purposes of [[sex industry|sex work]].<ref name=MW />\n\n==Factors influencing migration==\n\n===Push factors===\n''Poverty:'' In the early 1990s, the income per capita in a large number of sending countries, such as Albania, was less than  US $1000. At the same time, job opportunities in their home countries were pretty scarce. 86.6% of Albanians who migrated to Greece in the 1990s did so for economic reasons.<ref name=\"ANT2\" />\n\n''Armed conflicts and unstable political situations:'' Civil and political unrest and armed conflicts in the Balkans region and the Middle East displaced a large number of people to Greece. [[Yugoslav wars|War in the former Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s, [[Georgian civil war|civil war in Georgia]] and other countries in the early 1990s and 2000s, and [[Kosovo war|war in Kosovo]] during the late 1990s all displaced large waves of migrants who fled these countries, many of whom settled in Greece.<ref name=\"ANT2\" /> Additionally, [[Halabja poison gas attack|use of chemical weapons in Halabja]], Iraq and the [[Gulf War]] in the early 1990s, escalation of violence in Turkey in the mid-90s, and [[Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict|conflict]] between Kurdish people in Northern Iraq and Turkey and the Saddam regime displaced large numbers of people, who also sought refuge in Greece.<ref name=\"PAPA\" />\n\n''Demographics:'' The [[Demographics|demography]] of the region is also of particular interest. Both Greece and Italy, which have aging populations, attract immigration from countries with a younger workforce, such as Albania, other Balkans countries, and Eastern Europe. The younger migrant population's inability to find jobs in their home country, combined with Greece's need for cheap labor and aging workforce, attract many migrants to Greece.<ref name=\"BALD\" />\n\n===Pull factors===\n\n====Financial and political stability====\nAs a member of the EU since 1981, Greece was seen as an oasis of stability in the tumultuous Balkans.<ref name=ANT2 /> Even poorly paid irregular migrant workers in Greece could earn as much as four to six times the wages they could expect to earn at home.<ref name=MW /> Even though they make more money than they can in their home countries, wages are still relatively low; in a study done in northern Greece, the real cost of migrant labor to Greek employers (particularly irregular migrant labor) is approximately 40% below that of the cost of local laborers.<ref name=LAZ2 />\n\n====Nature of economic activity====\nEconomic conditions in Greece are conducive to the development of a cheap labor force. Self-employment in Greece is three times the EU average, reflecting large agricultural sectors, small-scale family businesses, and the existence of a large informal economy.<ref name=BALD /> In fact, the informal economy of Greece makes up approximately 30% of its GDP\u2014the largest informal economy in Europe.<ref name=ANT2 /> This informal economy needs cheap, unskilled labor to survive, since young people in Greece are unwilling to accept employment in these sectors. Young Greeks have low participation in the work force and continue to study at University until they can find high-status jobs. This means many young immigrants can find low quality employment if they accept the kinds of low-status employment that native Greeks reject.<ref name=BALD /> This is particularly true in agricultural and heavy industrial work for migrant men, and housekeeping, cleaning, and care-giving for migrant women.<ref name=BALD />\n\n====Geographic location====\nGreece, at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, is not just a final destination for migrants from Asia and Africa but is seen as a gateway or stepping stone to Western Europe.<ref name=ANT2 /> Greece's large coastline and multiple [[list of islands of Greece|islands]] mean that policing migrants' entry is very difficult. Additionally, Greece's reliance on [[Tourism in Greece|tourism]] means that the borders have never been adequately{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2016}} policed (though this has begun to change, as with the rest of the continent).<ref>''Recent Immigration to Southern Europe'', Iosifides, T. and King, R.</ref> The evidence now indicates that nearly all illegal immigration to the European Union flows through the country's porous borders.

Neighboring Turkey is also involved in the issue since the majority of the illegal immigrants are reaching Greece from that country.<ref name=Divitiis2011>De Divitiis, 2011: 58</ref> Characteristically, Turkish official policy sees the flow of immigrants to Greece as a main factor of conducting foreign policy. The Turkish governments officially adopts the \"Ozal doctrine\", initiated by former Turkish Prime Minister, [[Turgut \u00d6zal]]. The latter  characteristically stated that:<ref name=Divitiis2011/><ref name=Nomikos11>Nomikos, 2010: 11</ref>\n{{quote|We do not need to make war with Greece. We just need to send them a few millions illegal immigrants from Turkey and finish with them.}}\n\nMost of the illegal immigrants are passing the Greek-Turkish borders with the tolerance or even the assistance of the authorities in Turkey regardless the bilateral agreements that have been approved for this matter since 2003. Moreover, the fact that the Turkish authorities are not complying with the terms of the signed agreements is creating several problems during the procedures of surrender of the illegal immigrants in the border areas. Non-cooperation by the Turkish side is also evident, despite the existence of specific proofs in several cases (i.e. Turkish smugglers of illegal immigrants arrested by Greek authorities).<ref name=Nomikos11/>\n\nThe uncontrolled flow of immigrants from Turkey to Greece results, among others, in a number of negative social and political consequences: destabilisation of social cohesion through demographic change, as well as encouragement of the spread of organized crime and terrorist networks.<ref name=Divitiis2011/> For example, a high-level terrorist of [[Al-Qaeda]] who passed the Greek borders from Turkey was arrested in his attempt to receive political asylum in the country.<ref name=Divitiis2011/>\n\n===Flow of illegal immigrants===\nBecause of the scale of the informal economy in Greece, there is a very low demand for skilled migrant labor in Greece, and a high demand for unskilled labor exclusively in the informal sector.<ref name=BALD /> There is a very low number of immigrants with a valid work authorization in the informal sector, but there is estimated to be a very high number of unauthorized immigrant workers in Greece.<ref name=BALD /> In 1992 the [[Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection (Greece)|Ministry of Public Security]] indicated that of the 500,000 foreigners estimated to be in Greece, 280,000 of them were illegal.<ref name=LAZ2 /> As of 2011, there are over an estimated 500,000 irregular migrants in Greece, who either entered the country illegally or entered legally but stayed on in Greece past the expiration of their visas.<ref name=ICD /> Other undocumented workers arrive as 'false tourists' who continue to live and work in Greece after the short-term tourist visas they arrive on expire.<ref name=LAZ2 /> Much of the economic growth in Greece in the late 1990s and early 2000s has been through the underpaid work of illegal immigrants, constituting 29.4% of Greece's GDP.<ref name=BALD /><ref name=LAZ3>Lazaridis, Gabriella, and Eugenia Wickens. \"\"Us\" and the \"Others\": ethnic minorities in Greece.\" Annals of Tourism Research 26.3 (1999): 632-655.</ref> Illegal employment of illegal immigrants is attractive to Greek employers because they don't have to obey to strict working regulations and social security for undocumented workers.<ref name=BALD /> Additionally, some migrants choose the flexibility of the illegal labor market. Immigrants find it easier to find work in this sector compared to the legal market due to stringent immigration policies that make the visa application processes difficult, costly, and in constant need of renewal.<ref name=FAK />\n\nTough immigration policies in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] and agreements with their neighboring African countries to combat illegal immigration have changed the direction of [[African immigration to Europe|African immigration]] flows toward Greece. At the same time, flows from Asia and the Middle East \u2014 mainly Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Bangladesh \u2014 towards Greece appear to have increased as well.<ref name=\"migrationinformation1\"/> In 2010, 132,524 persons were arrested for \"illegal entry or stay\" in Greece, a sharp increase from 95,239 in 2006. Nearly half of those arrested (52,469) were immediately deported, the majority of them being Albanians.<ref name=\"migrationinformation1\"/> The number of Albanian workers in Greece in 1991 was estimated to be around 150,000, with some estimating the number to be as high as 500,000.<ref name=LAZ1 /> Albanians typically fill the unskilled jobs that native workers find undesirable, which are mainly connected with tourism, seasonal agricultural activities, and the domestic sector, such as childcare, household services, and the care of the elderly.<ref name=ICD /><ref name=LAZ3 /> Almost all of the irregular immigrants who come to Greece are employed in the informal sector, come alone without family members, and come with the purpose of finding a job, even when they enter on tourist visas.<ref name=FAK />\n\nOften, in order to cross the border into Greece, illegal immigrants have to pay a [[human smuggling|smuggler]]. The vast majority of arrested migrant smugglers\u201458.4% of those arrested in the first eight months of 2000\u2014are Greek citizens. The [[Albanian mafia]] is the second-largest group of smugglers, involved mostly in the smuggling of other Albanians. The Turks are also prevalent smugglers across the Turkish-Greek border.<ref name=ANT2 /> Trafficking organizations in Albania can charge up to US$4,000 per person they can smuggle across, and it has become a lucrative business for many smugglers.<ref name=LAZ2 /> Illegal immigrants from Poland and other former Soviet bloc countries in particular also use [[chain migration]], in which close links with home villages are maintained and relatives or friends are recruited to work in Greece and recommended to employers; jobs are transferred between immigrants returning to their home countries for a few months' visit and newcomers from their hometowns.<ref name=LAZ1 />\n\nIllegal immigrants in Greece often face exploitative situations with little means of recourse. Article 84 of Law 2286/2005 continues to prohibit Greek public services, legal entities, and local governmental organizations from offering services to foreigners who cannot prove that they have entered and are residing in Greece legally, unless it is an emergency situation or when the person in question is a minor.<ref name=GIP /> This means it is very difficult for migrants without documentation to obtain health and public services from the state, or to bring cases against an abusive employer. The Greek government also deports large numbers of illegal immigrants every year, which means undocumented workers are unlikely to come forward and report hazardous, unfair, or exploitative working conditions for fear of being deported. From 1991 to 1999, 1,820,000 migrants were deported, the majority of them from Albania.<ref name=ANT2 /> There are also a large number of women and children who are taken into Greece for [[sex worker|sex work]] and who are placed in exploitative situations but can not receive help because of their illegal status. There is a large percentage of mainly under-aged adolescent Albanian girls and boys under ten, for instance, who are taken illegally into Greece to work in the [[sex industry]].<ref name=LAZ1 />\n\nThe process of regularization for Greek immigrants is difficult given the steps that need to be taken in accordance with the Greek immigration policy. In 1998, more than 370,000 applied for a temporary 'white card' under a regularization program\u2014less than 60% proceeded to the second stage towards receiving their green cards.<ref name=ICD /> Additionally, over 75% of the applicants in that year were from Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, many of them ethnic Greeks.<ref name=ICD /> Since then there have been attempts to reform the regularization process and Greek policy regarding immigration, but it is still a difficult, expensive, and tedious process for an immigrant to regularize their status, and many choose to remain illegal and risk the consequences because of the greater flexibility of the informal market.<ref name=FAK />\n\n==Governmental policy regarding immigration==\n\nWhen immigrants began flooding into Greece in large numbers for the first time in the 1990s, the Greek government was not properly prepared for the management and control of so many migrants. Until 1991, legislation on immigration dated back to the 1920s.<ref name=KIP /> In 1991 the first Law on Aliens (Law 1975/1991) was enacted, Greece's first attempt to deal with the massive influx of immigration.<ref name=ANT2 /> This law was exclusively concerned with restricting migration into Greece and discouraging the entrance of foreigners into Greece. The only way a foreigner could work in Greece was to obtain a residence and work permit before arrival. Any attempt to enter the country illegally under Law 1975 could be punished with imprisonment ranging from three months to five years. Additionally, migrants were not eligible for any kind of welfare schemes or first aid, apart from in the case of an emergency, unless they have a residence permit.<ref name=KIP /><ref name=FAK /><ref name=LAZ1 /> This law was a failure and did nothing to curb illegal immigration and resulted only in the expulsion of massive numbers of illegal immigrants throughout the 1990s, particularly of Albanian migrants.<ref name=KIP /> Throughout the 1990s, nearly 2 million migrants, the overwhelming majority of which were males, were deported, with nearly 200,000 deported annually on average; over two-thirds of them were Albanian.<ref name=ANT2 /><ref name=FAK />\n\nIt was only in 1997 that two Presidential decrees introduced the first regularization program in Greece. Presidential decrees 358/1997 and 359/1997 were ill-designed, mismanaged, and made it difficult for migrants to be successfully regularized, but they laid the first foundations for an institutional framework in Greece that tried to actually deal with immigration in a way that went beyond deportation.<ref name=GIP /> A New Law on Aliens introduced in 2001 concentrated on short-sighted regulation of migration through restrictive legal migration channels, and a larger regularization program and more comprehensive policy framework to deal with immigration in the long term.<ref name=GIP /> There were some benefits to this law, such as the right to be informed in a language one understood while in detention, and obligatory nine-year education  for migrant children.<ref name=ANT2 /> However, certain aspects of the law, such as the need to renew [[visa (document)|visas]] every year, neglected the needs of local labor markets to fill positions in a relatively short time, and almost completely ignored the fact that many immigrants would still try to migrate illegally.<ref name=GIP /> Lawful residence of migrants who had not already been in Greece before 2001 was very difficult under this law.<ref name=ANT2 /> The immigration law was also still discriminatory regarding citizenship acquisition and made distinctions between co-ethnic returnees and \"foreigners\" or \"aliens\".<ref name=FAAS /> In 2004 the government decided to issue permits of two-year duration, as opposed to one-year, which cut down on time and monetary costs of applying for a visa, but there were still many issues with regularization.<ref name=GIP /> The small number of work permits, their limited duration, and the general policy orientation of the Greek government was not conducive to creating sustainable immigration policy.<ref name=BALD />\n\nA substantial review of Greek law concerning immigrants in 2006 manifested itself in several new laws, most of which became effective in 2007. A single two-year stay and work permit was introduced that could be renewed for another two years, depending on local labor market conditions.<ref name=ICD /> Laws 3386/2005 and 3536/2007 incorporated specific categories of immigrants who have lived in Greece for several years but who have been unable to regularize their residence and employment in Greece for a variety of reasons into the legal status. Special provisions for the protection of [[human trafficking]] victims were also created. These laws also included an Action Plan to successfully incorporate immigrants into Greek society  based on respect of their fundamental human rights.<ref name=GIP /> However, under Law 3386/2005, immigrants who are unable to prove they are legal residences of Greece are still denied access to any public and social services.<ref name=GIP />\n\nIn more recent years, [[Immigration Policy 2.0|EU directives]] and laws regarding immigration have shaped a more open and integration-oriented approach in Greece, and has been the main source of information, policies, and practices for developing the national migration policy. However, issues relating to migrant policy are not a priority on the Greek national agenda, especially since the [[Greek debt crisis|2008 debt crisis]]. Since this is not widely regarded as an important issue, reform will continue to be marginal at best and will not take the necessary steps to make real, lasting changes to migration policy.<ref name=GIP />\n\n==Public reaction to immigration==\n\nIn 1989, Greeks were presented by the [[Eurobarometer]] as the people most tolerant of foreigners in all the EU.<ref name=KIP /> However, political instability and warfare in the Balkans in the early 1990s made the Greeks begin to worry about the conflict nearing their own borders.<ref name=GIP /> Additionally, in the 1990s [[Albanian nationalism]] still laid a claim to parts of Greek territory and the [[Macedonia naming dispute|\"Macedonian question\"]] presumed claims by the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to both Greek territory and national culture.<ref name=KIP /><ref name=GIP /> These political developments revived many feelings of [[Greek nationalism|nationalism]] in Greece, and the influx of immigrants in the 1990s challenged the collective image of Greece as an ethnically homogeneous society.<ref name=KIP /> The Greek nation-state is strongly tied to an ethnically based identity that centers on [[ancient Greeks|common ancestry]], [[Greek language|language]], and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox religion]].<ref name=FAAS /> The rise of immigration in the 1990, then, was seen not just as a source of potential economic upheaval, but as a threat to the cultural and ethnic purity and authenticity of the Greek nation.<ref name=GIP />\n\nSince the influx of immigrants began in the early 1990s, the number of Greeks who felt that the number of immigrants living in Greece was \"too high\" skyrocketed, from 29% in 1991, to 45% in 1992, to 57% in 1993, and 69.2% in 1994.<ref name=KIP /> Approximately 85-90% also believe that immigrants are responsible for increased levels of crime and unemployment.<ref name=KIP /> Greece is presented in the Eurobarometer in 2015 to have somewhat more racist opinions than the EU average (e.g. 67% comfortable working with a Muslim vs 71% EU average), the same study displays the minorities in Greece to feel the least discriminated against in all of Europe.<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/68004</ref> Also, the ratio of unemployment between foreigners in Greece and native born citizens is lower than the EU average [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/dc/Gap_in_long-term_unemployment_between_non-EU-born_and_native-born_populations%2C_2015.png (as reported by eurostat)], indicating that Greece is less discriminating against foreigners in the labor market than EU as a whole.  According to a book by Gabriella Lazaridis, Greeks hold very low opinions and stereotypical ideas about many groups of immigrants, particularly Albanians, [[Muslims]], and Turks, due to historical preconditions.<ref name=LAZ2 /> While this is true for some Greeks, it does not appear to apply to the majority. The Greek media has contributed to these notions by over-exaggerating the illegal activities of foreigners, particularly Albanians and the Albanian mafia. Lazaridis asserts that this has helped to perpetuate the \"dangerous Albanian\" stereotype, which contributes to exclusion of Albanian immigrants, legal or illegal, from economic, social, and spatial spheres of Greek life.<ref name=KIP /><ref name=LAZ2 /><ref name=LAZ3 /> \n\nMany Greeks hold mixed views on immigration to their country; they often complain about the phenomenon, whereas they sympathise with certain individuals who are acquaintances of theirs. <ref name=KIP /> Still, even with a population made up of 7% immigrants\u2014 possibly even more when one includes estimate on the number of undocumented migrants\u2014 some Greeks still believe that their country is extremely homogeneous.<ref name=FAAS /> Lazaridis comments that this can lead to the continued exploitation of migrants and foreigners who are seen as \"others\" and are not afforded the same rights as Greek citizens.<ref name=LAZ2 />\n\n==Nansen Refugee Award==\n\nIn 2016, Greek volunteers were awarded the [[Nansen Refugee Award]] by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR).

As larger numbers of migrants entered Greece in the 1990s,  the [[politics of Greece|Greek government]]'s immigration policy began to be seen as lacking the control and legal framework to manage the situation. While the Greek government has made some changes in immigration policy, [[immigration reform]] remains a low priority.\n\nIn 2015, arrivals of refugees by sea have increased dramatically in Greece mainly due to the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War]].

At the turn of the century, the majority of Greek immigrants migrated to the [[United States]]; from the 1950s to the 1970s, migration flowed towards other [[European countries]], mainly the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], where there was a labor shortage in the rebuilding process after the [[World War II|second world war]].<ref name=KIP /><ref name=ICD>Icduygu, Ahmet. \"Transborder Crime between Turkey and Greece: Human Smuggling and Its Regional Consequences.\" ''Southeast European and Black Sea Studies'' 4.2 (2004): 294\u2013314.

After the collapse of the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|military dictatorship in 1974]], some of the Greek refugees began to resettle in Greece.

At the beginning of the 1990s when these immigration flows started, Greece did not have the legislative framework to practically manage and control immigration.<ref name=GIP /> Until the Greek government began immigration policy reform in 1991, immigration legislation dated back to the 1920s and made it incredibly difficult for migrants to enter Greece legally for work purposes; it was obligatory for a migrant to have a work permit to enter Greece, which they must have obtained from their home [[consulate]] only after having acquired a job in Greece.<ref name=KIP /> In the mid-90s the Greek immigration policy relied mostly on massive [[deportation]] of mainly Albanian immigrants, hoping to discourage immigration to Greece. This policy tool was largely ineffective and the Greek government had to rethink its immigration policy at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<ref name=GIP /> While strides have been made to bring immigration policy in line with [[European Union|EU]] directives, immigration is still not a high priority for the Greek government, even as migrants continue to make up large portions of the Greek population.<ref name=LAZ2>Lazaridis, Gabriella, and Joanna Poyago\u2010Theotoky. \"Undocumented migrants in Greece: Issues of regularization.\" ''International Migration'' 37.4 (2002): 715\u2013740.</ref>\n\n==Migrant demographics==\n\nSince the 1990s, Greece has become an important country for migrants both as a final destination and as a transit stop between countries of origin and other countries in the EU.<ref name=ANT1>Antonopoulos, Georgios A., and [[John Winterdyk|John A.

Traditionally, the participation of Greek women in the labor force has been very low due to a lack of formal employment opportunities,  an overabundance of unpaid activities in small family businesses or agricultural work, and prevailing cultural attitudes in Greece about the domestic role of women.<ref name=BALD /> Between 1971 and 1996, adult female participation in the paid labor force jumped from 31.2% to 47.5%.<ref name=MW /> A rapid expansion of the [[education in Greece|Greek educational system]], coupled with increased prosperity in Greece, lead to an increase in women in the workplace and a subsequent reduction of supply of labor for certain (usually unpaid) work mostly done by women.<ref name=FAK />  However, Greek cultural values regarding women's \"duties\" within the home has not changed as rapidly as female employment has\u2014Greek women are increasingly taking on responsibilities outside the home while their domestic tasks remain largely unabated.<ref name=MW /> This creates a demand for cheap, migrant labor in areas related to household and care work in Greece that is largely filled by female migrants.\n\nThere is a great degree of [[occupational segregation|job segregation]] by sex for migrants in Greece, with mostly migrant women filling the domestic roles left by Greek women.<ref name=LAZ2 /> Women from the Philippines, Albania, and Eastern Europe dominate migrant domestic work in Greece, and indeed make up the majority of immigrants from those countries\u201476% of Bulgarian immigrants, 70% of Albanians, 76% of Romanian, 85% of Poles, and 80% of Filipino immigrants to Greece are female.<ref name=MW /> Greece has the highest [[feminization of migration|female migration]] rate in Europe.<ref name=MW /> Women from more developed countries tend to work in tourism and office work, while those from Asian, African, and former Soviet bloc countries are predominantly employed in household for domestic work, or as caregivers in medical centers.<ref name=FAK /> Filipino women are primarily employed as maids in families, while Albanian women are confined to domestic or cleaning roles.<ref name=LAZ2 /><ref name=FAK />\n\nWhile the majority of all female migrants are economic immigrants looking for good jobs that earn them a much higher salary than they can find in their homeland, female migrants, particularly undocumented ones, are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.<ref name=MW /><ref name=FAK /> The Greek legal system offers very little protection to domestic workers and in some cases may actually increase their insecurity and vulnerability.<ref name=MW /> Additionally, instances of [[human trafficking in Greece|sex trafficking]] are increasingly on the rise, with estimates citing that over 20,000 migrant women are trafficked into Greece every year for the purposes of [[sex industry|sex work]].<ref name=MW />\n\n==Factors influencing migration==\n\n===Push factors===\n''Poverty:'' In the early 1990s, the income per capita in a large number of sending countries, such as Albania, was less than  US $1000. At the same time, job opportunities in their home countries were pretty scarce. 86.6% of Albanians who migrated to Greece in the 1990s did so for economic reasons.<ref name=\"ANT2\" />\n\n''Armed conflicts and unstable political situations:'' Civil and political unrest and armed conflicts in the Balkans region and the Middle East displaced a large number of people to Greece. [[Yugoslav wars|War in the former Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s, [[Georgian civil war|civil war in Georgia]] and other countries in the early 1990s and 2000s, and [[Kosovo war|war in Kosovo]] during the late 1990s all displaced large waves of migrants who fled these countries, many of whom settled in Greece.<ref name=\"ANT2\" /> Additionally, [[Halabja poison gas attack|use of chemical weapons in Halabja]], Iraq and the [[Gulf War]] in the early 1990s, escalation of violence in Turkey in the mid-90s, and [[Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict|conflict]] between Kurdish people in Northern Iraq and Turkey and the Saddam regime displaced large numbers of people, who also sought refuge in Greece.<ref name=\"PAPA\" />\n\n''Demographics:'' The [[Demographics|demography]] of the region is also of particular interest. Both Greece and Italy, which have aging populations, attract immigration from countries with a younger workforce, such as Albania, other Balkans countries, and Eastern Europe. The younger migrant population's inability to find jobs in their home country, combined with Greece's need for cheap labor and aging workforce, attract many migrants to Greece.<ref name=\"BALD\" />\n\n===Pull factors===\n\n====Financial and political stability====\nAs a member of the EU since 1981, Greece was seen as an oasis of stability in the tumultuous Balkans.<ref name=ANT2 /> Even poorly paid irregular migrant workers in Greece could earn as much as four to six times the wages they could expect to earn at home.<ref name=MW /> Even though they make more money than they can in their home countries, wages are still relatively low; in a study done in northern Greece, the real cost of migrant labor to Greek employers (particularly irregular migrant labor) is approximately 40% below that of the cost of local laborers.<ref name=LAZ2 />\n\n====Nature of economic activity====\nEconomic conditions in Greece are conducive to the development of a cheap labor force. Self-employment in Greece is three times the EU average, reflecting large agricultural sectors, small-scale family businesses, and the existence of a large informal economy.<ref name=BALD /> In fact, the informal economy of Greece makes up approximately 30% of its GDP\u2014the largest informal economy in Europe.<ref name=ANT2 /> This informal economy needs cheap, unskilled labor to survive, since young people in Greece are unwilling to accept employment in these sectors. Young Greeks have low participation in the work force and continue to study at University until they can find high-status jobs. This means many young immigrants can find low quality employment if they accept the kinds of low-status employment that native Greeks reject.<ref name=BALD /> This is particularly true in agricultural and heavy industrial work for migrant men, and housekeeping, cleaning, and care-giving for migrant women.<ref name=BALD />\n\n====Geographic location====\nGreece, at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, is not just a final destination for migrants from Asia and Africa but is seen as a gateway or stepping stone to Western Europe.<ref name=ANT2 /> Greece's large coastline and multiple [[list of islands of Greece|islands]] mean that policing migrants' entry is very difficult. Additionally, Greece's reliance on [[Tourism in Greece|tourism]] means that the borders have never been adequately{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2016}} policed (though this has begun to change, as with the rest of the continent).<ref>''Recent Immigration to Southern Europe'', Iosifides, T. and King, R.</ref> The evidence now indicates that nearly all illegal immigration to the European Union flows through the country's porous borders.

Neighboring Turkey is also involved in the issue since the majority of the illegal immigrants are reaching Greece from that country.<ref name=Divitiis2011>De Divitiis, 2011: 58</ref> Characteristically, Turkish official policy sees the flow of immigrants to Greece as a main factor of conducting foreign policy. The Turkish governments officially adopts the \"Ozal doctrine\", initiated by former Turkish Prime Minister, [[Turgut \u00d6zal]]. The latter  characteristically stated that:<ref name=Divitiis2011/><ref name=Nomikos11>Nomikos, 2010: 11</ref>\n{{quote|We do not need to make war with Greece. We just need to send them a few millions illegal immigrants from Turkey and finish with them.}}\n\nMost of the illegal immigrants are passing the Greek-Turkish borders with the tolerance or even the assistance of the authorities in Turkey regardless the bilateral agreements that have been approved for this matter since 2003. Moreover, the fact that the Turkish authorities are not complying with the terms of the signed agreements is creating several problems during the procedures of surrender of the illegal immigrants in the border areas. Non-cooperation by the Turkish side is also evident, despite the existence of specific proofs in several cases (i.e. Turkish smugglers of illegal immigrants arrested by Greek authorities).<ref name=Nomikos11/>\n\nThe uncontrolled flow of immigrants from Turkey to Greece results, among others, in a number of negative social and political consequences: destabilisation of social cohesion through demographic change, as well as encouragement of the spread of organized crime and terrorist networks.<ref name=Divitiis2011/> For example, a high-level terrorist of [[Al-Qaeda]] who passed the Greek borders from Turkey was arrested in his attempt to receive political asylum in the country.<ref name=Divitiis2011/>\n\n===Flow of illegal immigrants===\nBecause of the scale of the informal economy in Greece, there is a very low demand for skilled migrant labor in Greece, and a high demand for unskilled labor exclusively in the informal sector.<ref name=BALD /> There is a very low number of immigrants with a valid work authorization in the informal sector, but there is estimated to be a very high number of unauthorized immigrant workers in Greece.<ref name=BALD /> In 1992 the [[Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection (Greece)|Ministry of Public Security]] indicated that of the 500,000 foreigners estimated to be in Greece, 280,000 of them were illegal.<ref name=LAZ2 /> As of 2011, there are over an estimated 500,000 irregular migrants in Greece, who either entered the country illegally or entered legally but stayed on in Greece past the expiration of their visas.<ref name=ICD /> Other undocumented workers arrive as 'false tourists' who continue to live and work in Greece after the short-term tourist visas they arrive on expire.<ref name=LAZ2 /> Much of the economic growth in Greece in the late 1990s and early 2000s has been through the underpaid work of illegal immigrants, constituting 29.4% of Greece's GDP.<ref name=BALD /><ref name=LAZ3>Lazaridis, Gabriella, and Eugenia Wickens. \"\"Us\" and the \"Others\": ethnic minorities in Greece.\" Annals of Tourism Research 26.3 (1999): 632-655.</ref> Illegal employment of illegal immigrants is attractive to Greek employers because they don't have to obey to strict working regulations and social security for undocumented workers.<ref name=BALD /> Additionally, some migrants choose the flexibility of the illegal labor market. Immigrants find it easier to find work in this sector compared to the legal market due to stringent immigration policies that make the visa application processes difficult, costly, and in constant need of renewal.<ref name=FAK />\n\nTough immigration policies in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] and agreements with their neighboring African countries to combat illegal immigration have changed the direction of [[African immigration to Europe|African immigration]] flows toward Greece. At the same time, flows from Asia and the Middle East \u2014 mainly Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Bangladesh \u2014 towards Greece appear to have increased as well.<ref name=\"migrationinformation1\"/> In 2010, 132,524 persons were arrested for \"illegal entry or stay\" in Greece, a sharp increase from 95,239 in 2006. Nearly half of those arrested (52,469) were immediately deported, the majority of them being Albanians.<ref name=\"migrationinformation1\"/> The number of Albanian workers in Greece in 1991 was estimated to be around 150,000, with some estimating the number to be as high as 500,000.<ref name=LAZ1 /> Albanians typically fill the unskilled jobs that native workers find undesirable, which are mainly connected with tourism, seasonal agricultural activities, and the domestic sector, such as childcare, household services, and the care of the elderly.<ref name=ICD /><ref name=LAZ3 /> Almost all of the irregular immigrants who come to Greece are employed in the informal sector, come alone without family members, and come with the purpose of finding a job, even when they enter on tourist visas.<ref name=FAK />\n\nOften, in order to cross the border into Greece, illegal immigrants have to pay a [[human smuggling|smuggler]]. The vast majority of arrested migrant smugglers\u201458.4% of those arrested in the first eight months of 2000\u2014are Greek citizens. The [[Albanian mafia]] is the second-largest group of smugglers, involved mostly in the smuggling of other Albanians. The Turks are also prevalent smugglers across the Turkish-Greek border.<ref name=ANT2 /> Trafficking organizations in Albania can charge up to US$4,000 per person they can smuggle across, and it has become a lucrative business for many smugglers.<ref name=LAZ2 /> Illegal immigrants from Poland and other former Soviet bloc countries in particular also use [[chain migration]], in which close links with home villages are maintained and relatives or friends are recruited to work in Greece and recommended to employers; jobs are transferred between immigrants returning to their home countries for a few months' visit and newcomers from their hometowns.<ref name=LAZ1 />\n\nIllegal immigrants in Greece often face exploitative situations with little means of recourse. Article 84 of Law 2286/2005 continues to prohibit Greek public services, legal entities, and local governmental organizations from offering services to foreigners who cannot prove that they have entered and are residing in Greece legally, unless it is an emergency situation or when the person in question is a minor.<ref name=GIP /> This means it is very difficult for migrants without documentation to obtain health and public services from the state, or to bring cases against an abusive employer. The Greek government also deports large numbers of illegal immigrants every year, which means undocumented workers are unlikely to come forward and report hazardous, unfair, or exploitative working conditions for fear of being deported. From 1991 to 1999, 1,820,000 migrants were deported, the majority of them from Albania.<ref name=ANT2 /> There are also a large number of women and children who are taken into Greece for [[sex worker|sex work]] and who are placed in exploitative situations but can not receive help because of their illegal status. There is a large percentage of mainly under-aged adolescent Albanian girls and boys under ten, for instance, who are taken illegally into Greece to work in the [[sex industry]].<ref name=LAZ1 />\n\nThe process of regularization for Greek immigrants is difficult given the steps that need to be taken in accordance with the Greek immigration policy. In 1998, more than 370,000 applied for a temporary 'white card' under a regularization program\u2014less than 60% proceeded to the second stage towards receiving their green cards.<ref name=ICD /> Additionally, over 75% of the applicants in that year were from Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, many of them ethnic Greeks.<ref name=ICD /> Since then there have been attempts to reform the regularization process and Greek policy regarding immigration, but it is still a difficult, expensive, and tedious process for an immigrant to regularize their status, and many choose to remain illegal and risk the consequences because of the greater flexibility of the informal market.<ref name=FAK />\n\n==Governmental policy regarding immigration==\n\nWhen immigrants began flooding into Greece in large numbers for the first time in the 1990s, the Greek government was not properly prepared for the management and control of so many migrants. Until 1991, legislation on immigration dated back to the 1920s.<ref name=KIP /> In 1991 the first Law on Aliens (Law 1975/1991) was enacted, Greece's first attempt to deal with the massive influx of immigration.<ref name=ANT2 /> This law was exclusively concerned with restricting migration into Greece and discouraging the entrance of foreigners into Greece. The only way a foreigner could work in Greece was to obtain a residence and work permit before arrival. Any attempt to enter the country illegally under Law 1975 could be punished with imprisonment ranging from three months to five years. Additionally, migrants were not eligible for any kind of welfare schemes or first aid, apart from in the case of an emergency, unless they have a residence permit.<ref name=KIP /><ref name=FAK /><ref name=LAZ1 /> This law was a failure and did nothing to curb illegal immigration and resulted only in the expulsion of massive numbers of illegal immigrants throughout the 1990s, particularly of Albanian migrants.<ref name=KIP /> Throughout the 1990s, nearly 2 million migrants, the overwhelming majority of which were males, were deported, with nearly 200,000 deported annually on average; over two-thirds of them were Albanian.<ref name=ANT2 /><ref name=FAK />\n\nIt was only in 1997 that two Presidential decrees introduced the first regularization program in Greece. Presidential decrees 358/1997 and 359/1997 were ill-designed, mismanaged, and made it difficult for migrants to be successfully regularized, but they laid the first foundations for an institutional framework in Greece that tried to actually deal with immigration in a way that went beyond deportation.<ref name=GIP /> A New Law on Aliens introduced in 2001 concentrated on short-sighted regulation of migration through restrictive legal migration channels, and a larger regularization program and more comprehensive policy framework to deal with immigration in the long term.<ref name=GIP /> There were some benefits to this law, such as the right to be informed in a language one understood while in detention, and obligatory nine-year education  for migrant children.<ref name=ANT2 /> However, certain aspects of the law, such as the need to renew [[visa (document)|visas]] every year, neglected the needs of local labor markets to fill positions in a relatively short time, and almost completely ignored the fact that many immigrants would still try to migrate illegally.<ref name=GIP /> Lawful residence of migrants who had not already been in Greece before 2001 was very difficult under this law.<ref name=ANT2 /> The immigration law was also still discriminatory regarding citizenship acquisition and made distinctions between co-ethnic returnees and \"foreigners\" or \"aliens\".<ref name=FAAS /> In 2004 the government decided to issue permits of two-year duration, as opposed to one-year, which cut down on time and monetary costs of applying for a visa, but there were still many issues with regularization.<ref name=GIP /> The small number of work permits, their limited duration, and the general policy orientation of the Greek government was not conducive to creating sustainable immigration policy.<ref name=BALD />\n\nA substantial review of Greek law concerning immigrants in 2006 manifested itself in several new laws, most of which became effective in 2007. A single two-year stay and work permit was introduced that could be renewed for another two years, depending on local labor market conditions.<ref name=ICD /> Laws 3386/2005 and 3536/2007 incorporated specific categories of immigrants who have lived in Greece for several years but who have been unable to regularize their residence and employment in Greece for a variety of reasons into the legal status. Special provisions for the protection of [[human trafficking]] victims were also created. These laws also included an Action Plan to successfully incorporate immigrants into Greek society  based on respect of their fundamental human rights.<ref name=GIP /> However, under Law 3386/2005, immigrants who are unable to prove they are legal residences of Greece are still denied access to any public and social services.<ref name=GIP />\n\nIn more recent years, [[Immigration Policy 2.0|EU directives]] and laws regarding immigration have shaped a more open and integration-oriented approach in Greece, and has been the main source of information, policies, and practices for developing the national migration policy. However, issues relating to migrant policy are not a priority on the Greek national agenda, especially since the [[Greek debt crisis|2008 debt crisis]]. Since this is not widely regarded as an important issue, reform will continue to be marginal at best and will not take the necessary steps to make real, lasting changes to migration policy.<ref name=GIP />\n\n==Public reaction to immigration==\n\nIn 1989, Greeks were presented by the [[Eurobarometer]] as the people most tolerant of foreigners in all the EU.<ref name=KIP /> However, political instability and warfare in the Balkans in the early 1990s made the Greeks begin to worry about the conflict nearing their own borders.<ref name=GIP /> Additionally, in the 1990s [[Albanian nationalism]] still laid a claim to parts of Greek territory and the [[Macedonia naming dispute|\"Macedonian question\"]] presumed claims by the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to both Greek territory and national culture.<ref name=KIP /><ref name=GIP /> These political developments revived many feelings of [[Greek nationalism|nationalism]] in Greece, and the influx of immigrants in the 1990s challenged the collective image of Greece as an ethnically homogeneous society.<ref name=KIP /> The Greek nation-state is strongly tied to an ethnically based identity that centers on [[ancient Greeks|common ancestry]], [[Greek language|language]], and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox religion]].<ref name=FAAS /> The rise of immigration in the 1990, then, was seen not just as a source of potential economic upheaval, but as a threat to the cultural and ethnic purity and authenticity of the Greek nation.<ref name=GIP />\n\nSince the influx of immigrants began in the early 1990s, the number of Greeks who felt that the number of immigrants living in Greece was \"too high\" skyrocketed, from 29% in 1991, to 45% in 1992, to 57% in 1993, and 69.2% in 1994.<ref name=KIP /> Approximately 85-90% also believe that immigrants are responsible for increased levels of crime and unemployment.<ref name=KIP /> Greece is presented in the Eurobarometer in 2015 to have somewhat more racist opinions than the EU average (e.g. 67% comfortable working with a Muslim vs 71% EU average), the same study displays the minorities in Greece to feel the least discriminated against in all of Europe.<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/68004</ref> Also, the ratio of unemployment between foreigners in Greece and native born citizens is lower than the EU average [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/dc/Gap_in_long-term_unemployment_between_non-EU-born_and_native-born_populations%2C_2015.png (as reported by eurostat)], indicating that Greece is less discriminating against foreigners in the labor market than EU as a whole.  According to a book by Gabriella Lazaridis, Greeks hold very low opinions and stereotypical ideas about many groups of immigrants, particularly Albanians, [[Muslims]], and Turks, due to historical preconditions.<ref name=LAZ2 /> While this is true for some Greeks, it does not appear to apply to the majority. The Greek media has contributed to these notions by over-exaggerating the illegal activities of foreigners, particularly Albanians and the Albanian mafia. Lazaridis asserts that this has helped to perpetuate the \"dangerous Albanian\" stereotype, which contributes to exclusion of Albanian immigrants, legal or illegal, from economic, social, and spatial spheres of Greek life.<ref name=KIP /><ref name=LAZ2 /><ref name=LAZ3 /> \n\nMany Greeks hold mixed views on immigration to their country; they often complain about the phenomenon, whereas they sympathise with certain individuals who are acquaintances of theirs. <ref name=KIP /> Still, even with a population made up of 7% immigrants\u2014 possibly even more when one includes estimate on the number of undocumented migrants\u2014 some Greeks still believe that their country is extremely homogeneous.<ref name=FAAS /> Lazaridis comments that this can lead to the continued exploitation of migrants and foreigners who are seen as \"others\" and are not afforded the same rights as Greek citizens.<ref name=LAZ2 />\n\n==Nansen Refugee Award==\n\nIn 2016, Greek volunteers were awarded the [[Nansen Refugee Award]] by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). Volunteers of \"The Hellenic Rescue Team\" and Efi Latsoudi of \"PIKPA village\" were awarded for their tireless voluntary efforts to aid refugees arriving in Greece during the European refugee crisis.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2016/9/57cdec884/greek-volunteers-share-unhcr-nansen-refugee-award.html Greek Volunteers share UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Albanian immigrants in Greece]]\n* [[Minorities in Greece]]\n* [[Human trafficking in Greece]]\n* [[2012 Paros (Greece) rape]]\n* [[2015 Mediterranean migration crisis]]\n\n;General\n* [[Immigration to Europe]]\n* [[List of countries by immigrant population]]\n* [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by fertility rate]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite web|last=Nomikos|first=John|title=Illegal Immigration and Organized Crime in Greece|url=http://www.rieas.gr/publications/1299-john-m-nomikos-illegal-immigration-and-organized-crime-in-greece-rieas-research-paper-no144-august-2010.html|publisher=Research Institute for European and American Studies|accessdate=19 May 2013|date=August 2010}}\n* {{cite journal|last=De Divitiis|first=Valerio|title=Considerations over Factos Empowering Radicalization in the European Union|journal=Perspectives on immigration and terrorism|year=2011|pages=51\u201361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9zp9R8n_kYC&dq=ozal+doctrine+greece&hl=en&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=19 May 2013|issn=1874-6276}}\n{{Greece topics}}\n{{Immigration to Europe}}\n{{European migrant crisis}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Immigration To Greece}}\n[[Category:Immigration to Greece| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "178.59.250.37", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMigrant demographics)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Greece"}
