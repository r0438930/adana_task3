It currently consists of {{ill|Roman Saenko|uk|\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0430\u0454\u043d\u043a\u043e}} (former member of [[Hate Forest]] and [[Dark Ages (band)|Dark Ages]]), Thurios (former member of [[Astrofaes]]), Krechet, and Vlad. All four also belonged to [[Blood of Kingu]] until it was disbanded. Their lyrics embrace [[Slavic mythology]]. Many of the band's lyrics are derived from the works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets ([[Oleksandr Oles]], [[Oleh Olzhych]], [[Maik Yohansen]] etc.) and especially [[Taras Shevchenko]].\n\nDrudkh have been particularly secretive throughout the course of their career, even for a black metal band, giving no interviews and not releasing the lyrics to several of their albums. The band is not explicitly political in its lyrics and has denied links to fascism or any other political ideology. However, Hate Forest, Saekno's previous band, was more explicitly involved in the NSBM scene, and Drudkh's music has repeatedly referenced the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]], a [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] formation from World War II that committed [[ethnic cleansing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.splicetoday.com/music/fascist-folk|title=Fascist Folk|last=Berlatsky|first=Noah|date=September 10, 2009|website=[[Splice Today]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> From their conception until 2009, Drudkh did not have any official website, but in May 2009, [[Season of Mist]] launched an official [[Myspace]], operated by the label rather than the band.\n\n==History==\nDrudkh have released ten albums, two EPs, three splits, and one anthology collecting material from the band's early splits and EPs. Their early releases were released on CD through the [[England|English]] [[extreme metal]] record label [[Supernal Music]], with the exception of the EP (which was a vinyl release), and, again with the exception of the EP, on vinyl through two [[Finland|Finnish]] black metal labels, [[Northern Heritage]] and Faustian Distribution. More recent release have been through Season of Mist, which has also issued remastered versions of the band's earlier albums as [[digipak]]s.\n\nThe band's first album, ''[[Forgotten Legends]]'', was released on August 18, 2003. The album establishes the band's trademark epic sound; its three tracks and one [[conclusion (music)|outro]] span nearly forty minutes, with the longest track, \"False Dawn\", nearing the sixteen-minute mark. ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' included ''Forgotten Legends'' in its Top 40 Black Metal albums list.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.ign.com/boards/threads/terrorizer-magazines-top-40-black-metal-albums.186480191/\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine's Top 40 Black Metal Albums\n| work = IGN Boards\n| date = October 30, 2009\n| accessdate = November 5, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\n''[[Autumn Aurora]]'' followed on November 28, 2004 (see [[2004 in music]]). While continuing its predecessor's general mood and atmosphere, it distinguishes itself by incorporating [[synthesizer]]s and other such [[keyboard instrument]]s. ''Autumn Aurora'' has frequently been cited as Drudkh's finest album, although some fans give the nod to the later ''[[Blood in Our Wells]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This record had a strong critical success: for example, it was chosen the best album of the year by [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] web-zine.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-714_best_albums_of_2004.aspx\n| title = CoC : Rant : Best Albums of 2004\n| work = [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]\n| date = February 28, 2005\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Autumn Aurora'', Amorth (drums, keyboards) joined the band and replaced Yuriy.\n\n''[[The Swan Road]]'' (''\u041b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445''), released on March 14, 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]), marked a departure in a number of ways. It was well reviewed and is the first Drudkh album to have Ukrainian lyrics, all of which are adapted or taken directly from the work ''[[Haydamaky (poem)|The Haidamakas]]'' ([[1841 in literature|1841]]) by [[Taras Shevchenko]], narrating about the [[Koliyivshchyna|Ukrainian anti-Polish uprising]] of 1768.<ref>{{cite web\n| author = Polarstern, Smierc\n| date = 2010\n| url = http://politosophia.org/page/drudkh-s-anthology-of-time.html \n| title = Drudkh\u2019s anthology of time\n| work = Politosophia\n}}</ref> Its CD booklet included prints of Shevchenko's notebooks, which many non-Ukrainian-speaking fans mistook for song lyrics. The addition of Shevchenko's poetry can also be said to have given Drudkh's music a more pronounced [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalistic leaning]] (a move continued on the next album). The music's atmosphere is also significantly more urgent, with the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix and a vastly increased use of [[blast beat]]s.\n\nOn March 23, 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]), Drudkh released ''Blood in Our Wells'' (''\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f\u0445''), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (including [[Oleksandr Oles]] and [[Lina Kostenko]]) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to [[Stepan Bandera]], leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Musically, the album adds [[progressive rock]] influences and an increased use of traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[guitar solo|soloing]] into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. In part because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film ''[[Mamay (film)|Mamay]]'' (2003), the album is considered more cinematic than its predecessors. Many fans have cited this album as the band's best work to date. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' Top 40 year list, placing at number 35.<ref name=rocklistmusic.co.uk>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/terroris.htm\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine\n| work = Rocklist.net\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''Blood in Our Wells'', Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn October 19, 2006, Drudkh released ''[[Songs of Grief and Solitude]]'' (''\u041f\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0456 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u0456 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456''). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\" is based on a riff from \"Solitude\" on ''Blood in Our Wells'', and \"Archaic Dance\" is based on a riff from \"Glare of 1768\" on ''The Swan Road''). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments. The album received mixed reviews, with some fans criticising the band for reusing old material, and others praising the band's radical reconstruction of its own sound.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn April 16, 2007 (see [[2007 in music]]), Supernal Music released Drudkh's ''[[Anti-Urban]]'', a 45-RPM 10&nbsp;inch coloured vinyl limited to 999 copies containing exclusive tracks available only to Supernal Music customers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Season of Mist]] later re-released it as a [[mini CD]] in 2009 as part of the deluxe box-set edition of ''[[Microcosmos (Drudkh album)|Microcosmos]]'', and it was also included on the band's collection ''Eastern Frontier in Flames''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe band's next release, a full-length black metal album titled ''[[Estrangement (album)|Estrangement]]'' (''\u0412i\u0434\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043di\u0441\u0442\u044c''), was released on August 25, 2007 as a deluxe edition.<ref name=supernalmusic>{{cite web\n| url = http://supernalmusic.livejournal.com/37340.html\n| title = Drudkh (Ukr): 'Estrangement' CD Deluxe\n| work = Supernal Music\n| date = August 30, 2007\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref> The album, which had the working title ''River of Tears'', had been rumored to have a \"[[Burzum]]ic\" feel before its release, and in some ways this was borne out by the album's release; its songs were in many ways significantly more minimalistic than those on ''Blood in Our Wells''. Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos. Notably, the album also featured the band's first prominent use of blast beats since ''The Swan Road''. A spoken introduction in the first track is taken from the 1995 Ukrainian feature film ''{{ill|Assassination.

''Autumn Aurora'' has frequently been cited as Drudkh's finest album, although some fans give the nod to the later ''[[Blood in Our Wells]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This record had a strong critical success: for example, it was chosen the best album of the year by [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] web-zine.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-714_best_albums_of_2004.aspx\n| title = CoC : Rant : Best Albums of 2004\n| work = [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]\n| date = February 28, 2005\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Autumn Aurora'', Amorth (drums, keyboards) joined the band and replaced Yuriy.\n\n''[[The Swan Road]]'' (''\u041b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445''), released on March 14, 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]), marked a departure in a number of ways. It was well reviewed and is the first Drudkh album to have Ukrainian lyrics, all of which are adapted or taken directly from the work ''[[Haydamaky (poem)|The Haidamakas]]'' ([[1841 in literature|1841]]) by [[Taras Shevchenko]], narrating about the [[Koliyivshchyna|Ukrainian anti-Polish uprising]] of 1768.<ref>{{cite web\n| author = Polarstern, Smierc\n| date = 2010\n| url = http://politosophia.org/page/drudkh-s-anthology-of-time.html \n| title = Drudkh\u2019s anthology of time\n| work = Politosophia\n}}</ref> Its CD booklet included prints of Shevchenko's notebooks, which many non-Ukrainian-speaking fans mistook for song lyrics. The addition of Shevchenko's poetry can also be said to have given Drudkh's music a more pronounced [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalistic leaning]] (a move continued on the next album). The music's atmosphere is also significantly more urgent, with the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix and a vastly increased use of [[blast beat]]s.\n\nOn March 23, 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]), Drudkh released ''Blood in Our Wells'' (''\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f\u0445''), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (including [[Oleksandr Oles]] and [[Lina Kostenko]]) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to [[Stepan Bandera]], leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Musically, the album adds [[progressive rock]] influences and an increased use of traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[guitar solo|soloing]] into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. In part because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film ''[[Mamay (film)|Mamay]]'' (2003), the album is considered more cinematic than its predecessors. Many fans have cited this album as the band's best work to date. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' Top 40 year list, placing at number 35.<ref name=rocklistmusic.co.uk>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/terroris.htm\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine\n| work = Rocklist.net\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''Blood in Our Wells'', Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn October 19, 2006, Drudkh released ''[[Songs of Grief and Solitude]]'' (''\u041f\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0456 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u0456 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456''). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\" is based on a riff from \"Solitude\" on ''Blood in Our Wells'', and \"Archaic Dance\" is based on a riff from \"Glare of 1768\" on ''The Swan Road''). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments. The album received mixed reviews, with some fans criticising the band for reusing old material, and others praising the band's radical reconstruction of its own sound.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn April 16, 2007 (see [[2007 in music]]), Supernal Music released Drudkh's ''[[Anti-Urban]]'', a 45-RPM 10&nbsp;inch coloured vinyl limited to 999 copies containing exclusive tracks available only to Supernal Music customers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Season of Mist]] later re-released it as a [[mini CD]] in 2009 as part of the deluxe box-set edition of ''[[Microcosmos (Drudkh album)|Microcosmos]]'', and it was also included on the band's collection ''Eastern Frontier in Flames''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe band's next release, a full-length black metal album titled ''[[Estrangement (album)|Estrangement]]'' (''\u0412i\u0434\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043di\u0441\u0442\u044c''), was released on August 25, 2007 as a deluxe edition.<ref name=supernalmusic>{{cite web\n| url = http://supernalmusic.livejournal.com/37340.html\n| title = Drudkh (Ukr): 'Estrangement' CD Deluxe\n| work = Supernal Music\n| date = August 30, 2007\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref> The album, which had the working title ''River of Tears'', had been rumored to have a \"[[Burzum]]ic\" feel before its release, and in some ways this was borne out by the album's release; its songs were in many ways significantly more minimalistic than those on ''Blood in Our Wells''. Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos. Notably, the album also featured the band's first prominent use of blast beats since ''The Swan Road''. A spoken introduction in the first track is taken from the 1995 Ukrainian feature film ''{{ill|Assassination.
