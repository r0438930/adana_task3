[[Derrick Morgan]] became one of Pama's biggest stars, having a UK chart hit with \"[[Moon Hop]]\". Pama's biggest hit came with [[Max Romeo]]'s \"Wet Dream\", which reached #10 in the UK singles chart (despite lack of airplay, in part due to its risqu\u00e9 lyric), and sold over 250,000 copies.\n\nThe rivalry between Pama and their main UK reggae competitor, [[Trojan Records]], was clear, with Trojan's ''Tighten Up'' series of compilations and Pama's similarly titled ''Straighten Up'' series going head to head. The rivalry had been fueled by Bunny Lee's earlier licensing of Derrick Morgan's \"Seven Letters\" to both Pama and Trojan.\n\nPama introduced a number of subsidiary labels, often associated with individual producers, including Pama Supreme, Supreme, [[Crab Records|Crab]], Bullet, Gas, Nu Beat/New Beat ([[Laurel Aitken]]), Success ([[Rupie Edwards]]), Camel, Escort, Unity (Bunny Lee), and Punch (Lee \"Scratch\" Perry).<ref name=\"Larkin\">Larkin, Colin:\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\", 1998, Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0-7535-0242-9}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the many reggae releases, the label also released few non-reggae albums, including ''Butlins Red Coat Review'', and an album commemorating the investiture of [[The Prince of Wales]].<ref name=\"Larkin\" />\n\nThe Pama label lasted until the mid-1970s, at which point Carl Palmer was the driving force, and concentrated on establishing a UK distribution network for reggae, later resurfacing as [[Jet Star Records|Jet Star]], one of the largest distributors of reggae music.
