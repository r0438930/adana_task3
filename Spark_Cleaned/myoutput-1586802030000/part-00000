The J Records second album ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]'' was released in 2004 and the band embarked upon a worldwide tour to follow. In late 2004 frontman [[Ryan McCombs]] left the group. He would go on to become the new vocalist of [[Drowning Pool]] the following year.\n\nThe band recruited ex- Diesel Machine vocalist [[A Cavalier|AJ Cavalier]] as its new singer and released two more studio albums (True Self, Picture Perfect) through independent labels in 2006 and 2009 respectively. SOiL continued to tour worldwide and met with strong independent success. The band had brief line-up changes until in fall 2011, Soil reunited with Ryan McCombs for a tour commemorating the tenth anniversary of their landmark album, ''Scars''. The line-up is currently completed with fellow original members Tim King (Bass) and Adam Zadel (Guitar), who are the only two members to have stayed with the band from inception until present. The band has sold over two million records worldwide and released its sixth studio album, entitled ''Whole'', on August 20, 2013 (August 16 UK/Europe).\nThe band released a greatest hits album, titled Scream: The Essentials on September 15, 2017\n\n==History==\nSoil was originally formed in 1997 by three of four members of [[death metal]] act [[Oppressor]], joined by guitarist of another death metal act [[Broken Hope]] \u2013 as a side project to their other bands. Ryan McCombs was later recruited for vocal duties.\n\nThe original line-up of the band was Ryan McCombs (vocals), Shaun Glass (Broken Hope), Tom Schofield, Tim King, and Adam Zadel (all three ex-Oppressor). The band got its name from the Entombed song \"Rotten Soil\" by opting to simply drop the \"Rotten\" part and stick with \"Soil\".\n\nSoil's first three releases, ''[[SOiL (EP)|Soil]]'' ([[Extended play|EP]]), ''[[El Chupacabra (album)|El Chupacabra]]'' (EP) and their debut album ''[[Throttle Junkies]]'', failed to break the band into the mainstream. It was around this time that all the members of Soil left their other bands to focus on Soil as their main project.\n\nWith the song \"Halo\" gaining major radio attention, labels began a bidding war for a deal with Soil. The band would ultimately be signed to J Records by music industry legend [[Clive Davis]], responsible for signing such acts as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], who stated that \"you're gonna be my only rock band for now. You're going to be a priority, and I want to break this band.\"<ref name=\"OMH\">{{cite web|url = http://www.musicomh.com/interviews/soil.htm|title = Interview: Soil|publisher = musicOMH|last = Bansal|first = Vik|date = January 2005|accessdate = 26 February 2012}}</ref> Soil finally experienced mainstream success with the [[major label]] debut, ''[[Scars (Soil album)|Scars]]'', released September 11, 2001.<ref name=OMH/> This achievement was aided by the popular singles \"Halo\" and \"Unreal\" which gained the band exposure on [[MTV]]. The success resulted in the band winning [[Metal Edge]] magazine's 2001 Readers' Choice Award for \"Next Big Thing\".<ref>Metal Edge, June 2002</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the band released their second major label album, ''[[Redefine (Soil album)|Redefine]]''. The group toured for a year in support of the album and returned home to begin writing follow up material and finish various live dates.  Shortly after, vocalist [[Ryan McCombs]] announced his departure from the group to be with his family,<ref name=OMH/> forcing the band to cancel scheduled shows. [[New York City|New York]]-based vocalist [[AJ Cavalier]], previously of World In Pain and Diesel Machine, was introduced on November 15, 2004 as McCombs' replacement. On July 20, 2005, McCombs was confirmed to be the new singer for Drowning Pool.\n\nOn September 21, 2005, Soil signed with New York-based [[independent label]] [[DRT Entertainment]]. Their album ''[[True Self]]'' was released on May 2, 2006. The album leaked onto [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] sites on March 4, almost two months before its official release. SOiL embarked upon a very heavy worldwide touring schedule to promote the release. In November 2007, Shaun Glass parted ways with the band, citing personal and musical differences.\n\nOn October 20, 2009 the album ''[[Picture Perfect (Soil album)|Picture Perfect]]'' was released via Bieler Bros Records worldwide, except in Europe, where it was released by AFM Records. ''Picture Perfect'' was produced by Johnny K (Disturbed, Staind), Ulrich Wild (Deftones, Incubus) and Soil, with Dave Fortman (Mudvayne, Evanescence) handling mixing duties. It was promoted with the lead single, \"Like It Is.\" In January 2010, \"The Lesser Man\" was announced as a second single.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, vocalist A.J. Cavalier, and drummer Tom Schofield announced their departure from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728013007/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143229|title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET \u2013 SOIL Singer On 'Indefinite Hiatus' From Band; Drummer Seeking 'New Musical Opportunities'|date=28 July 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 November 2018}}</ref> Vocalist Jordan Lee and drummer Mike Tignino were announced as fill-ins for scheduled live dates.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143442 It's Official: SOIL Recruits 'Fill-In' Singer, Drummer For Upcoming Shows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728051402/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=143442 |date=2010-07-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe band reunited with original vocalist Ryan McCombs for a 12-date co-headlining UK tour with [[Puddle of Mudd]] in October 2011 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of ''Scars''.
