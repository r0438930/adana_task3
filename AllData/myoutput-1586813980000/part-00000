This garment is often called a \"muslin,\" and the process is called \"making a muslin.\" In this context, \"muslin\" has become the generic term for a test or fitting garment, regardless of what it is made from.\n\nMuslin is also often used as a backing or lining for quilts, and thus can often be found in wide widths in the quilting sections of fabric stores.\n\nIn Asia, Muslin is used for making sarees.

It receives paint well and, if treated properly, can be made translucent.\n\nIt also holds dyes well.
