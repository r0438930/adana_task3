Retrieved 6 October 2011.</ref> He established the principle that this river, which runs through the Netherlands, defined a natural boundary between [[Gaul]] and [[Germania magna]]. But the Rhine was not a strong border, and he made it clear that there was a part of Belgic Gaul where many of the local tribes were \"[[Germani cisrhenani]]\", or in other cases, of mixed origin. The approximately 450 years of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule that followed would profoundly change the area that would become the Netherlands. Very often this involved large-scale conflict with the \"free Germans\" over the Rhine.\n\nWhen Caesar arrived, various tribes were located in the area of the Netherlands, residing in the inhabitable higher parts, especially in the east and south. These tribes did not leave behind written records, so all the information known about them during this pre-Roman period is based on what the Romans and Greeks wrote about them. [[Julius Caesar]] himself, in his commentary ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' wrote in detail only about the southern area which he conquered. Two or three tribes who he described as living in what is now the Netherlands were: \n*The [[Menapii]], a Belgic tribe who stretched from the Flemish coast, through the south of the river deltas, and as far as the modern German border. In terms of modern Dutch provinces this means at least the south of Zeeland, at least the north of North Brabant, at least the southeast of Gelderland, and possible the south of South Holland. In later Roman times this territory seems to have been divided or reduced, so that it became mainly contained in what is now western Belgium.\n*The [[Eburones]], the largest of the ''Germani Cisrhenani'' group, whose territory stretched covered a large area between the rivers [[river Maas|Maas]] and Rhine, and also apparently stretched close to the delta, giving them a border with the Menapii. Their territory may have stretched into Gelderland. Caesar claimed to have destroyed the name of the Eburones, but in Roman times Tacitus reports that the Germani Cisrhenani had taken up a new name, the [[Tungri]]. While exact borders are not known the territory of the Eburones, and later the Tungri, (the \"[[Civitas Tungrorum]]\") included all or most of the modern provinces of Dutch Limburg, and North Brabant. The part in North Brabant was apparently within what became known as [[Toxandria]], the home of the Texuandri.\n*The [[Ambivariti]] were apparently a smaller tribe, perhaps part of the Eburones, or Menapii, who Caesar mentions in passing as living west of the Maas, and therefore somewhere in or near North Brabant. (It is possible they lived in what is now Belgium.)\n\nIn the delta itself, Caesar makes a passing comment about the ''Insula Batavorum'' (\"Island of the Batavi\") in the [[Rhine river]], without discussing who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became very important in this region. The island's easternmost point is at a split in the Rhine, one arm being the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] the other the [[Nederrijn|Lower Rhine]]/[[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]] (hence the Latin name <ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=4:chapter=10&highlight=batavi Caes.

Nat. 4.29]</ref>\n*The [[Cananefates]], whom Tacitus says were similar to the Batavians in their ancestry (and so presumably came from Germany). These lived to the west of the Batavi, sharing the same island, in what is today the province of South Holland.\n*The [[Frisii]], who also inhabited the Netherlands north of the delta, and thus covered a major part of the modern Netherlands, not only in modern Friesland, but also in North Holland and at least in parts of all the other northern Dutch provinces today.\n*The [[Chauci]], whose main territory was the north sea coast of Germany, bordering the Frisii on their east. They are thought to be ancestors of the later [[Saxons]], and apparently only held a small part of the modern Netherlands in Roman times.\n*The [[Frisiabones]], who Pliny also counted as a people living in [[Gallia Belgica]], to the south of the delta. They probably therefore lived in the north of North Brabant, perhaps stretching into Gelderland and South Holland.\n*The [[Marsacii]], who Tacitus refers to as neighbours of the Batavi. Pliny also apparently mentioned these as stretching on to the Flemish coast, and they probably inhabited what is today the province of Zeeland.\n*The [[Sturii]], who are not known from any other sources, but are thought to have lived near the Marsacii, therefore in modern Zeeland or South Holland.\n\nAs mentioned above, the northern Netherlands, above the Old Rhine, was dominated by the Frisii, with perhaps a small penetration of Chauci. While this area was not officially part of the empire for any long periods, military conscription and other impositions were made for long periods upon the Frisii. Several smaller tribes are known from the eastern Netherlands, north of the Rhine:\n*The [[Tuihanti]] (or Tubantes) from [[Twenthe]] in Overijssel, had units serving in the Roman army in Britain.\n*The [[Chamavi]], from [[Hamaland]] in northern Gelderland, became one of the first tribes to be named as [[Franks|Frankish]] (see below).\n*The [[Salians]], also Franks, probably originated in [[Salland]] in Overijssel, before they moved into the empire, forced by Saxons in the 4th century, first into Batavia, and then into Toxandria.\n*South of the Chamavi and on the Rhine the Usipetes lived for some time. Caesar reported that them already in his time as newcomers from the east. Eventually they appear to have been forced southeast under pressure from the Frankish Chamavi and [[Chatuarii]].\n\nIn the south of the Netherlands the [[Toxandri|Texuandri]] inhabited most of North Brabant. The modern province of Limburg, with the Maas running through it, appears to have been inhabited by (from north to south) the [[Baetasii]], the [[Catualinum|Catualini]], the [[Sunuci]] and the [[Tungri]].\n\n==Batavian revolt==\n{{Main|Revolt of the Batavi}}\nAbout 38 BC, a pro-Roman faction of the [[Chatti]] (a Germanic tribe located east of the [[Rhine]]) was settled by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] in an area south of the [[Rhine]], now thought to be the [[Betuwe]] area. They took on the name of the people already living there\u2014the [[Batavians]].<ref name=\"livius.org\"/>\n[[Image:Bataafseeed.jpg|thumb|260px|''The Conspiracy of Julius Civilis'', completed in 1661 by [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], the best-known painter of the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. It depicts a [[Batavii|Batavian]] oath to [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], the head of the [[Batavian rebellion]] against the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] in 69]]\n\nThe relationship with the original inhabitants was on the whole quite good; many [[Batavians]] even served in the [[Ala (Roman military)|Roman cavalry]]. Batavian culture was influenced by the Roman one, resulting among other things in Roman-style temples such as the one in [[Elst (Overbetuwe)|Elst]], dedicated to local gods. Also the trade flourished:  the salt used in the Roman empire was won from the North Sea and remains are found across the whole Roman empire.\n\nHowever, this did not prevent the [[Batavian rebellion]] of 69 AD, a very successful [[Revolt of the Batavi|revolt]] under the leadership of Batavian [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]. Forty ''castella'' were burnt down because the Romans violated the rights of the Batavian leaders by taking young Batavians as their [[slaves]].<ref>[https://www.livius.org/ba-bd/batavians/revolt01.html Jona Lendering, \"The Batavian Revolt\"]</ref>\n\nOther Roman soldiers (like those in [[Xanten]] and the auxiliary troops of Batavians and Cananefates from the legions of [[Vitellius]]) joined the revolt, which split the northern part of the Roman army. April 70, [[Vespasianus]] sent a few legions to stop the revolt. Their commander, [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis|Petilius Cerialis]], eventually defeated the Batavians and started negotiations with [[Julius Civilis]] on his home ground, somewhere between the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Meuse River|Maas]] near Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]]) or&mdash;as the Batavians probably called it&mdash;Batavodurum.<ref>''Historiae'' by Tacitus, 1st century AD.

Their attacks happened in a time period with a catastrophic sea invasion of the area.\n\n{{Quote|''Another change was irreversible. During transgression phases, the sea is more aggressive than under normal circumstances. The third century saw the beginning of an era of increased violence from the sea. The canal between Lake Flevo and the Wadden Sea widened and the mud-flats of the north become wetlands. The Frisians and Chauci increased the height of the terps (the mounds on the alluvial plain on which they lived) but in vain. It seems that their country was largely depopulated, and the Frisians disappear from our sources. (It is unlikely that the inhabitants of modern Friesland are related to the ancient Frisians.).....The cause of this devastation (in Frisian lands) is easy to find: raids of a new Germanic tribe, the Franks.<ref>Jona Lendering: Germania inferior (Livius.org)]</ref>}}\n\nFrankish identity emerged at the first half of the 3rd century out of various earlier, smaller [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups, including the [[Salian Franks|Salii]], [[Sicambri]], [[Chamavi]], [[Bructeri]], [[Chatti]],  [[Chattuarii]],  [[Ampsivarii]], [[Tencteri]], [[Ubii]], [[Batavians|Batavi]] and the [[Tungri]], who inhabited the lower and middle Rhine valley between the [[Zuyderzee]] and the river [[Lahn]] and extended eastwards as far as the [[Weser]], but were the most densely settled around the [[IJssel]] and between the [[Lippe River|Lippe]] and the [[Sieg (river)|Sieg]].

Several smaller tribes are known from the eastern Netherlands, north of the Rhine:\n*The [[Tuihanti]] (or Tubantes) from [[Twenthe]] in Overijssel, had units serving in the Roman army in Britain.\n*The [[Chamavi]], from [[Hamaland]] in northern Gelderland, became one of the first tribes to be named as [[Franks|Frankish]] (see below).\n*The [[Salians]], also Franks, probably originated in [[Salland]] in Overijssel, before they moved into the empire, forced by Saxons in the 4th century, first into Batavia, and then into Toxandria.\n*South of the Chamavi and on the Rhine the Usipetes lived for some time. Caesar reported that them already in his time as newcomers from the east. Eventually they appear to have been forced southeast under pressure from the Frankish Chamavi and [[Chatuarii]].\n\nIn the south of the Netherlands the [[Toxandri|Texuandri]] inhabited most of North Brabant. The modern province of Limburg, with the Maas running through it, appears to have been inhabited by (from north to south) the [[Baetasii]], the [[Catualinum|Catualini]], the [[Sunuci]] and the [[Tungri]].\n\n==Batavian revolt==\n{{Main|Revolt of the Batavi}}\nAbout 38 BC, a pro-Roman faction of the [[Chatti]] (a Germanic tribe located east of the [[Rhine]]) was settled by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] in an area south of the [[Rhine]], now thought to be the [[Betuwe]] area. They took on the name of the people already living there\u2014the [[Batavians]].<ref name=\"livius.org\"/>\n[[Image:Bataafseeed.jpg|thumb|260px|''The Conspiracy of Julius Civilis'', completed in 1661 by [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], the best-known painter of the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. It depicts a [[Batavii|Batavian]] oath to [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], the head of the [[Batavian rebellion]] against the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] in 69]]\n\nThe relationship with the original inhabitants was on the whole quite good; many [[Batavians]] even served in the [[Ala (Roman military)|Roman cavalry]]. Batavian culture was influenced by the Roman one, resulting among other things in Roman-style temples such as the one in [[Elst (Overbetuwe)|Elst]], dedicated to local gods. Also the trade flourished:  the salt used in the Roman empire was won from the North Sea and remains are found across the whole Roman empire.\n\nHowever, this did not prevent the [[Batavian rebellion]] of 69 AD, a very successful [[Revolt of the Batavi|revolt]] under the leadership of Batavian [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]. Forty ''castella'' were burnt down because the Romans violated the rights of the Batavian leaders by taking young Batavians as their [[slaves]].<ref>[https://www.livius.org/ba-bd/batavians/revolt01.html Jona Lendering, \"The Batavian Revolt\"]</ref>\n\nOther Roman soldiers (like those in [[Xanten]] and the auxiliary troops of Batavians and Cananefates from the legions of [[Vitellius]]) joined the revolt, which split the northern part of the Roman army. April 70, [[Vespasianus]] sent a few legions to stop the revolt. Their commander, [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis|Petilius Cerialis]], eventually defeated the Batavians and started negotiations with [[Julius Civilis]] on his home ground, somewhere between the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Meuse River|Maas]] near Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]]) or&mdash;as the Batavians probably called it&mdash;Batavodurum.<ref>''Historiae'' by Tacitus, 1st century AD.

Their attacks happened in a time period with a catastrophic sea invasion of the area.\n\n{{Quote|''Another change was irreversible. During transgression phases, the sea is more aggressive than under normal circumstances. The third century saw the beginning of an era of increased violence from the sea. The canal between Lake Flevo and the Wadden Sea widened and the mud-flats of the north become wetlands. The Frisians and Chauci increased the height of the terps (the mounds on the alluvial plain on which they lived) but in vain. It seems that their country was largely depopulated, and the Frisians disappear from our sources. (It is unlikely that the inhabitants of modern Friesland are related to the ancient Frisians.).....The cause of this devastation (in Frisian lands) is easy to find: raids of a new Germanic tribe, the Franks.<ref>Jona Lendering: Germania inferior (Livius.org)]</ref>}}\n\nFrankish identity emerged at the first half of the 3rd century out of various earlier, smaller [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups, including the [[Salian Franks|Salii]], [[Sicambri]], [[Chamavi]], [[Bructeri]], [[Chatti]],  [[Chattuarii]],  [[Ampsivarii]], [[Tencteri]], [[Ubii]], [[Batavians|Batavi]] and the [[Tungri]], who inhabited the lower and middle Rhine valley between the [[Zuyderzee]] and the river [[Lahn]] and extended eastwards as far as the [[Weser]], but were the most densely settled around the [[IJssel]] and between the [[Lippe River|Lippe]] and the [[Sieg (river)|Sieg]].
