The station is owned by [[iHeartMedia]] and broadcasts at 106.5 [[MHz]] at 15.5 kilowatts [[effective radiated power|ERP]] from a non-directional antenna located from the Helderberg Mountains antenna farm in New Scotland.\n\nThough billed as classic rock, WPYX plays a moderate amount of currents which puts it on a fringe alongside mainstream rock. Regardless of what format the station is filed under, WPYX is one of the longest-lasting stations in the Capital District since it began on September 15, 1980.\n\nWPYX broadcasts in the [[HD Radio]] format, with 1970s\u2019 classic rock on its HD2 channel from iHeart branded as, '''Gran Turino Radio'''.\n\nDuring the [[NFL]] season, WPYX also broadcasts [[New York Giants]] football games.\n\n==History==\nThe 106.5 frequency signed on in September 1967 as WDKC, operating as an MOR music station. It was owned by Kopps-Monahan Communications, Inc., owners of Top 40 powerhouse WTRY 980 (today's [[WOFX (AM)|WOFX]]). In 1971, the call letters were changed to WTRY-FM. It continued as an MOR station during the day, but simulcasted WTRY's Top 40 format at night; returning to full-time MOR programming in 1972. In early 1973, the WTRY stations were sold, and WTRY-FM became WHSH, which then went to its first full-time rock format as the format was changed to a Top 40\u2013Oldies hybrid with live DJs. The station was now known as \"Wish\" as well as \"The Albany Stereo Giant\" and \"Your Albany Wish\". Ownership automated the station a year later in 1974, and changed the format to Oldies. During Labor Day weekend, 1975, the format was flipped again, this time to [[beautiful music]], while keeping the \"Wish\" nickname.  The WHSH callsign supposedly meant \"Well Herbert Scott's Here\", referring to Scott Broadcasting's ownership.\n\nBy 1980 there was an obvious hole for a mainstream [[Album-Oriented Rock|AOR]] station in the Albany market and the station flipped to its current format on September 15, 1980, changing the call sign to WPYX and officially became \"PYX 106\". WPYX would remain live and local until April 28, 2009 when they replaced most of their local DJs with out-of-market voice-trackers, which remains the case to this day.\n\nWPYX and WTRY went through several ownership changes which includes Scott Broadcasting of Pennsylvania, television personality [[Merv Griffin]] and Capstar Broadcasting (which was controlled by billionaire mogul [[Tom Hicks]]). In 1999, Capstar merged with another Hicks-owned company, Chancellor Media Corporation, to form AMFM Inc. In 2000, the stations were acquired by [[Clear Channel Communications]] (now known as iHeartMedia) when they merged with AMFM.\n\n==HD Radio operations==\nIn 2005, WPYX upgraded to [[In-band on-channel|IBOC]] [[digital radio]] alongside the rest of Clear Channel's Albany stations. On August 17, 2006, WPYX began airing an HD2 channel with a deep tracks classic rock format, known as ''Vinyl Vineyard'' which was later replaced with a [[classic country]] format in August 2012. The classic country was eventually dropped in favor of an all year non-stop Christmas music channel.<ref>http://www.iheart.com/live/iheartchristmas-classics-6137</ref>  As of September 2018, WPYX's HD2 airs a Christmas Music format called, \"iHeartChristmas Lites\", which airs more recent versions of Christmas songs and Christmas songs that are very popular.\n\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://pyx106.iheart.com/|PYX 106 official website}}\n{{FM station data|WPYX}}\n* {{Google local studios|WPYX|1200+Troy-Schenectady+Rd+Latham+NY+12210}}\n\n{{Albany Radio}}\n{{Classic Rock Radio Stations in New York}}\n{{IHeartMedia}}\n{{New York Giants}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Capital District, New York|PYX]]\n[[Category:Classic rock radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1967]]\n[[Category:IHeartMedia radio stations]]\n[[Category:New York Giants broadcasters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|iHeartChristmas Classics|the novel \"I Heart Christmas\"|Lindsey Kelk}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| image            = WPYX logo.png\n| name             = WPYX\n| city             = [[Albany, New York]]\n| area             = [[Adirondacks]], [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], and upper [[Hudson Valley]]\n| branding         = \"PYX 106\"\n| slogan           = \"Capitaland's Classic Rock\"\n| airdate          = {{start date and age|1967|9}} (as WDKC)\n| frequency        = {{Frequency|106.5|[[MHz]]}} {{HD Radio}}\n| format           = [[Classic rock]] (with [[mainstream rock]] lean)<br />HD2: Classic rock \"Gran Torino Radio\"\n| erp              = 15,500 [[watt]]s\n| haat             = {{Convert|275|m|ft|sp=us}}\n| class            = B\n| facility_id      = 73911\n| coordinates      = {{coord|42.636|N|74.001|W|type:landmark_region:US-NY_source:FCC|display=inline,title}}\n| callsign_meaning = Calls chosen for name (play on \"picks\")\n| former_callsigns = WDKC (1967\u20131971)<br/>WTRY-FM (1971\u20131973)<br/>WHSH (1973\u20131980)\n| affiliations     = [[New York Giants Radio Network]]\n| owner            = [[iHeartMedia]]\n| licensee         = Capstar TX LLC\n| sister_stations  = [[WGY (AM)|WGY]], [[WGY-FM]], [[WRVE]], [[WTRY-FM]], [[WKKF]], [[WOFX (AM)|WOFX]]\n| webcast          = HD1: [https://www.iheart.com/live/pyx-106-albany-1429/ PYX106]<br>HD2: [https://www.iheart.com/live/iheartchristmas-4596/ iHeartChristmas]\n| website          = {{URL|https://pyx106.iheart.com/}}\n}}\n\n'''WPYX''' (\"PYX 106\") is a [[mainstream rock]]-leaning [[classic rock]] radio station licensed to Albany, New York and primarily serving New York's [[Capital Region]], the [[Adirondacks]], and surrounding areas.
