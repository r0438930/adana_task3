For example, [[Alevi]], [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|C\u00e2fer\u00ee]] (mostly [[Azeris]]), and [[Bektashi]] Muslims (mostly [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]]) participate in the financing of the mosques and the salaries of [[Sunni]] imams by paying taxes to the state, while their places of worship, which are not officially recognized, do not receive any state funding. The Presidency of Religious Affairs' budget rose from USD $0.9 billion for the year 2006 to $2.5 billion in 2012.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the role of religion in the state has been a divisive issue, as influential religious factions challenged the complete secularization called for by [[Kemalism]] and the observance of Islamic practices experienced a substantial revival. In the early 2000s (decade), Islamic groups challenged the concept of a secular state with increasing vigor after [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]]'s Islamist-rooted [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) came into power in 2002.\n\nTurkey, through the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923), recognizes the civil, political, and cultural rights of non-Muslim minorities. In practice, Turkey only recognizes [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], and [[Jewish]] religious minorities. [[Alevi]], [[Bektashi]], and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|C\u00e2fer\u00ee]] Muslims among other Muslim sects,<ref name=\"clarke\">The World of the Alevis: Issues of Culture and Identity, Gloria L.

The directorate is criticized by some [[Alevi]] Muslims for not supporting their beliefs and instead favouring only the Sunni faith.\n\nThe [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] (''Patrik'') is the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in Turkey, and also serves as the [[Primus inter pares#Religion|spiritual leader]] of all [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] throughout the world. The [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarch]] is the head of the Armenian Church in Turkey, while the [[Jews in Turkey|Jewish community]] is led by the ''[[Hakham Bashi|Hahambasi]]'', Turkey's [[Chief Rabbi]], based in Istanbul. These groups have also criticized the Presidency of Religious Affairs for only financially supporting Islam in Turkey.\n\n== Historical Christian sites ==\n[[Antioch]] (modern [[Antakya]]), the city where \"the disciples were first called Christians\" according to the biblical [[Book of Acts]], is located in modern Turkey, as are most of the areas visited by [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] during his missions. The [[Epistle to the Galatians]], [[Epistle to the Ephesians]], [[Epistle to the Colossians]], [[First Epistle of Peter]], and [[Book of Revelation]] are addressed to recipients in the territory of modern Turkey. Additionally, all of the first [[Ecumenical Council#First seven ecumenical councils|Seven Ecumenical Councils]] that define Christianity for [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christians took place in the territory that is now Turkey. Many [[titular see]]s exist in Turkey, as Anatolia was historically home to a large Christian population for centuries.\n\n==Freedom of religion==\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in Turkey}}\n[[File:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Mehmed II|Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror]] and [[Patriarch Gennadios II of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Patriarch Gennadios II]].

The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] used to regard the Armenian Church as [[heresy|heretic]] and did not allow it to operate inside the [[Walls of Constantinople]].]]\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and Turkey is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.<ref name=us>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90204.htm|title=Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2007|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2007|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|date=2007|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTurkey has a democratic government and a [[Secularism in Turkey|strong tradition of secularism]]. Nevertheless, the Turkish state's interpretation of secularism has reportedly resulted in religious freedom violations for some of its non-Muslim citizens. The 2009 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report placed Turkey on its watchlist with countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, the Russian Federation, and Venezuela.<ref name=cirf>{{cite web|url=http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|title=Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|work=U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509151708/http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|archivedate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, according to this report, the situation for Jews in Turkey is better than in other majority Muslim countries. Jews report being able to worship freely and their places of worship having the protection of the government when required. Jews also operate their own schools, hospitals, two elderly homes, welfare institutions, as well as a newspaper. Despite this, concerns have arisen in recent years because of [[2003 Istanbul bombings|attacks by extremists on synagogues in 2003]], as well as [[Antisemitism in Turkey|growing anti-Semitism]] in some sectors of the Turkish media and society.\n\n[[Catholic Church|Catholic Christians]] have also occasionally been subjected to violent societal attacks. In February 2006, an Italian Catholic priest was shot to death in his church in [[Trabzon]], reportedly by a youth angered over the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|caricatures of Muhammad in Danish newspapers]]. The government strongly condemned the killing. A 16-year-old boy was subsequently charged with the murder and sentenced to 19 years in prison. In December 2007, a 19-year-old stabbed a Catholic priest outside a church in \u0130zmir; the priest was treated and released the following day. According to newspaper reports, the assailant, who was arrested soon afterwards, admitted that he had been influenced by a recent television program that depicted Christian missionaries as \"infiltrators\" who took advantage of poor people.\n\nThe [[Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul|Armenian Patriarch]], head of the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]], also lacks the status of legal personality (unlike the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], who has a government-recognized role), and there is no seminary in Turkey to educate its clerics since the closure of the last remaining seminar by the state, as only 65,000 Armenian Orthodox people live in Turkey. In 2006, the Armenian Patriarch submitted a proposal to the Minister of Education to enable his community to establish a faculty in the Armenian language at a state university with instruction by the Patriarch. Under current restrictions, only the Sunni Muslim community can legally operate institutions to train new clergy in Turkey for future leadership.\n\nPatriarch [[Bartholomew I]], [[primus inter pares|most senior bishop among equals]] in the traditional hierarchy of Orthodox Christianity, said that he felt \"crucified\" living in Turkey under a government that did not recognize the [[ecumenical]] status of Patriarch and which would like to see his Patriarchate die out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6001717n|title=The Patriarch Bartholomew|date=20 December 2009|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government under Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] criticized [[Bartholomew I]], with deputy prime minister [[B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7|Ar\u0131n\u00e7]] saying that the [[Orthodox Church]] enjoyed their religious rights during the AKP's rule, and foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu|Davuto\u011flu]] saying that he hoped that the Patriarch's remarks had been a \"slip of the tongue\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=347858|title=Government Spokesman Criticizes Greek Patriarch Over Crucifixion Remarks|date=21 December 2009|publisher=Turkishpress.com|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196263-100-gul-backs-ministers-criticism-of-patriarch-bartholomew.html|title=G\u00fcl backs minister's criticism of Patriarch Bartholomew|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> In response to the government's criticism, Bartholomew's lawyer said when the patriarchate was criticizing government, he was referring to the state, not the AKP government in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196532-109-centerbartholomew-crucified-erdogan-suffers-from-hellish-torture1br-i-by-i-brorhan-kemal-cengizcenter.html|title=Bartholomew crucified, Erdo\u011fan suffers from Hellish torture!(1)|date=25 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan said that \"When it comes to the question, 'Are you recognizing [him] as ecumenical?', I wouldn't be annoyed by it [this title].

The directorate is criticized by some [[Alevi]] Muslims for not supporting their beliefs and instead favouring only the Sunni faith.\n\nThe [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] (''Patrik'') is the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in Turkey, and also serves as the [[Primus inter pares#Religion|spiritual leader]] of all [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] throughout the world. The [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarch]] is the head of the Armenian Church in Turkey, while the [[Jews in Turkey|Jewish community]] is led by the ''[[Hakham Bashi|Hahambasi]]'', Turkey's [[Chief Rabbi]], based in Istanbul. These groups have also criticized the Presidency of Religious Affairs for only financially supporting Islam in Turkey.\n\n== Historical Christian sites ==\n[[Antioch]] (modern [[Antakya]]), the city where \"the disciples were first called Christians\" according to the biblical [[Book of Acts]], is located in modern Turkey, as are most of the areas visited by [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] during his missions. The [[Epistle to the Galatians]], [[Epistle to the Ephesians]], [[Epistle to the Colossians]], [[First Epistle of Peter]], and [[Book of Revelation]] are addressed to recipients in the territory of modern Turkey. Additionally, all of the first [[Ecumenical Council#First seven ecumenical councils|Seven Ecumenical Councils]] that define Christianity for [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christians took place in the territory that is now Turkey. Many [[titular see]]s exist in Turkey, as Anatolia was historically home to a large Christian population for centuries.\n\n==Freedom of religion==\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in Turkey}}\n[[File:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Mehmed II|Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror]] and [[Patriarch Gennadios II of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Patriarch Gennadios II]]. Mehmed II not only allowed the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] to remain active in the city after [[fall of Constantinople|its conquest]] by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, he also established the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in 1461, as part of the [[Millet system]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] used to regard the Armenian Church as [[heresy|heretic]] and did not allow it to operate inside the [[Walls of Constantinople]].]]\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and Turkey is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.<ref name=us>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90204.htm|title=Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2007|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2007|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|date=2007|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTurkey has a democratic government and a [[Secularism in Turkey|strong tradition of secularism]]. Nevertheless, the Turkish state's interpretation of secularism has reportedly resulted in religious freedom violations for some of its non-Muslim citizens. The 2009 U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report placed Turkey on its watchlist with countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, the Russian Federation, and Venezuela.<ref name=cirf>{{cite web|url=http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|title=Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|work=U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509151708/http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/uploads/images/7iuy2dQ0h_EA5rA3csHHyA/ci_rf_uscirfar2009.pdf|archivedate=9 May 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, according to this report, the situation for Jews in Turkey is better than in other majority Muslim countries. Jews report being able to worship freely and their places of worship having the protection of the government when required. Jews also operate their own schools, hospitals, two elderly homes, welfare institutions, as well as a newspaper. Despite this, concerns have arisen in recent years because of [[2003 Istanbul bombings|attacks by extremists on synagogues in 2003]], as well as [[Antisemitism in Turkey|growing anti-Semitism]] in some sectors of the Turkish media and society.\n\n[[Catholic Church|Catholic Christians]] have also occasionally been subjected to violent societal attacks. In February 2006, an Italian Catholic priest was shot to death in his church in [[Trabzon]], reportedly by a youth angered over the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|caricatures of Muhammad in Danish newspapers]]. The government strongly condemned the killing. A 16-year-old boy was subsequently charged with the murder and sentenced to 19 years in prison. In December 2007, a 19-year-old stabbed a Catholic priest outside a church in \u0130zmir; the priest was treated and released the following day. According to newspaper reports, the assailant, who was arrested soon afterwards, admitted that he had been influenced by a recent television program that depicted Christian missionaries as \"infiltrators\" who took advantage of poor people.\n\nThe [[Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul|Armenian Patriarch]], head of the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]], also lacks the status of legal personality (unlike the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], who has a government-recognized role), and there is no seminary in Turkey to educate its clerics since the closure of the last remaining seminar by the state, as only 65,000 Armenian Orthodox people live in Turkey. In 2006, the Armenian Patriarch submitted a proposal to the Minister of Education to enable his community to establish a faculty in the Armenian language at a state university with instruction by the Patriarch. Under current restrictions, only the Sunni Muslim community can legally operate institutions to train new clergy in Turkey for future leadership.\n\nPatriarch [[Bartholomew I]], [[primus inter pares|most senior bishop among equals]] in the traditional hierarchy of Orthodox Christianity, said that he felt \"crucified\" living in Turkey under a government that did not recognize the [[ecumenical]] status of Patriarch and which would like to see his Patriarchate die out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6001717n|title=The Patriarch Bartholomew|date=20 December 2009|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government under Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] criticized [[Bartholomew I]], with deputy prime minister [[B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7|Ar\u0131n\u00e7]] saying that the [[Orthodox Church]] enjoyed their religious rights during the AKP's rule, and foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu|Davuto\u011flu]] saying that he hoped that the Patriarch's remarks had been a \"slip of the tongue\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=347858|title=Government Spokesman Criticizes Greek Patriarch Over Crucifixion Remarks|date=21 December 2009|publisher=Turkishpress.com|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196263-100-gul-backs-ministers-criticism-of-patriarch-bartholomew.html|title=G\u00fcl backs minister's criticism of Patriarch Bartholomew|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> In response to the government's criticism, Bartholomew's lawyer said when the patriarchate was criticizing government, he was referring to the state, not the AKP government in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-196532-109-centerbartholomew-crucified-erdogan-suffers-from-hellish-torture1br-i-by-i-brorhan-kemal-cengizcenter.html|title=Bartholomew crucified, Erdo\u011fan suffers from Hellish torture!(1)|date=25 December 2009|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan said that \"When it comes to the question, 'Are you recognizing [him] as ecumenical?', I wouldn't be annoyed by it [this title].

The pro-government newspaper ''Bug\u00fcn'' ran a story stating \"no one has the right to convert this society into a religious one, or the opposite.\" Surveys of the Turkish people also show a great support for maintaining secular lifestyles.

The report's publication generated large-scale controversy amongst conservative Muslim groups in Turkish society. Progressive Islamic theologian [[:tr:Mustafa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk (ilahiyat\u00e7\u0131)|Mustafa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk]] noted the deist trend a year earlier, arguing that the \"very archaic, dogmatic notion of religion\" held by the majority of those claiming to represent Islam was causing \"the new generations [to get] indifferent, even distant, to the Islamic worldview.\" Despite lacking reliable statistical data, numerous anecdotes appear to point in this direction. Although some commentators claim the secularisation is merely a result of Western influence or even a \"conspiracy\", most commentators, even some pro-government ones, have come to conclude that \"the real reason for the loss of faith in Islam is not the West but Turkey itself: It is a reaction to all the corruption, arrogance, narrow-mindedness, bigotry, cruelty and crudeness displayed in the name of Islam.\" Especially when the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] Islamists are in power to enforce Islam upon society, this is making citizens turn their back on it.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/turkey-why-so-many-turks-are-losing-faith-in-islam.html |title=Why so many Turks are losing faith in Islam |author=Mustafa Akyol |work=[[Al-Monitor]] |date=16 April 2018 |accessdate=19 April 2018|author-link=Mustafa Akyol }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Div col}} \n* [[Christianity in Turkey]]\n** [[List of Armenian Patriarchs of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]]\n** [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek (Ecumenical) Patriarchate of Constantinople]]\n** [[Protestantism in Turkey]]\n** [[Catholic Church in Turkey]]\n** [[Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate]]\n* [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Turkey]]\n* [[Cultural Muslim]]\n* [[Islam in Turkey]]\n** [[Alevism]]\n** [[Bektashism]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Judaism in Turkey]]\n* [[Headscarf controversy in Turkey]]\n* [[Mersin Interfaith Cemetery]]\n* [[Religion by country]]\n* [[Tengrism]]\n* [[Yazidis in Turkey]]\n* [[List of mosques#Turkey|List of mosques in Turkey]]\n* [[List of synagogues in Turkey]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Alt\u0131nl\u0131-Maci\u0107, M., & Coleman, T.
