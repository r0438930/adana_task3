The boy is combative and physically retained and the girl unconscious. The police believer the car stolen and the girl abducted. The boy says nothing, his jaw was broken during a scuffle with the police, and his [[toxicology]] screen comes back clean and his altered state the police believe may be from a concussion. [[List of secondary doctors in ER#Ray Barnett|Ray]] notices that the boy is signing, he is deaf, so the restraints are removed.\n\n[[Samantha Taggart|Sam]] starts work at her new job with Elliot and decides waking up in a mansion with a housekeeper is not so bad. When she gets a chauffeur driven car to County the staff's interest is piqued. Luka meets up with Alex in the hospital and finds that Sam's son is equally enamoured with their new lifestyle. Sam assures him that they are doing well but when she returns to their new home and finds Elliot refusing her treatment it looks as though things are not going to be as simple working privately as she'd hoped.\n\nAbby finally gets up the nerve to tell Luka that she wants him to stay, citing that even though they have not decided what they are to each other yet she wants him to be there with her for the pregnancy. She blurts all this out unaware that he has already made his decision. Hearing that he is staying a bashful Abby can not help but smile.\n\n[[Archie Morris|Morris]] is offered a job with a [[pharmaceutical]] company by an attractive woman. The prospect of an expense account has him especially intrigued.\n\nRay Barnett tries to persuade [[Neela Rasgotra|Neela]] to stay at their apartment but Neela says she's already looking around for somewhere else. Neela meets up with [[Michael Gallant|Michael]]'s parents and the trio spend the day in Chicago. Michael's parents bicker the whole time and Neela is often left feeling out of place. Ray gets home with a pizza peace offering but finds Neela just about to walk out of the door. She is going to stay at Abby's place. Ray begs Neela to stay, saying his feelings for her will not get in the way, but her mind is made up and she leaves.\n\n==Guest starring==\n'''''Staff -''''' \n* [[Laura Ceron]] as [[List of secondary nurses in ER#Chuny M\u00e1rquez|Nurse Chuny M\u00e1rquez]]\n* [[Deezer D]] as [[List of secondary nurses in ER#Malik McGrath|Nurse Malik McGrath]]\n* [[Abraham Benrubi]] as Desk Clerk [[Jerry Markovic]]\n* [[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]] as Desk Clerk [[Frank Martin (ER character)|Frank Martin]]\n* [[Lynn A.
