When the power supply to the amplifier is first switched on, [[electronic noise]] in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations started. The noise travels around the loop and is amplified and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] until very quickly it converges on a [[sine wave]] at a single frequency.\n\nFeedback oscillator circuits can be classified according to the type of frequency selective filter they use in the feedback loop:<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />\n\n*In an ''[[RC oscillator]]'' circuit, the filter is a network of [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> RC oscillators are mostly used to generate lower frequencies, for example in the audio range.  Common types of RC oscillator circuits are the [[phase shift oscillator]] and the [[Wien bridge oscillator]].\n{{anchor|LC oscillator}}\n*In an ''LC oscillator'' circuit, the filter is a [[tuned circuit]] (often called a ''tank circuit''; the tuned circuit is a [[resonator]]) consisting of an [[inductor]] (L) and [[capacitor]] (C) connected together.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  Charge flows back and forth between the capacitor's plates through the inductor, so the tuned circuit can store electrical energy oscillating at its [[resonant frequency]]. There are small losses in the tank circuit, but the amplifier compensates for those losses and supplies the power for the output signal. LC oscillators are often used at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> when a tunable frequency source is necessary, such as in [[signal generator]]s, tunable radio [[transmitter]]s and the [[local oscillator]]s in [[radio receiver]]s.  Typical LC oscillator circuits are the [[Hartley oscillator|Hartley]], [[Colpitts oscillator|Colpitts]]<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> and [[Clapp oscillator|Clapp]] circuits.\n[[File:Oscillator comparison.svg|thumb|right|400px|Two common LC oscillator circuits, the Hartley and Colpitts oscillators]]\n\n*In a ''[[crystal oscillator]]'' circuit the filter is a [[piezoelectric]] crystal (commonly a [[quartz crystal]]).<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  The crystal mechanically vibrates as a [[resonator]], and its frequency of vibration determines the oscillation frequency. Crystals have a very high [[Q-factor]] and also better temperature stability than tuned circuits, so crystal oscillators have much better frequency stability than LC or RC oscillators. Crystal oscillators are the most common type of linear oscillator, used to stabilize the frequency of most [[radio transmitter]]s, and to generate the [[clock signal]] in computers and [[quartz clock]]s. Crystal oscillators often use the same circuits as LC oscillators, with the crystal replacing the [[tuned circuit]];<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> the [[Pierce oscillator]] circuit is also commonly used. Quartz crystals are generally limited to frequencies of 30&nbsp;MHz or below.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" />  Other types of resonators, [[dielectric resonator]]s and [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) devices, are used to control higher frequency oscillators, up into the [[microwave]] range.  For example, SAW oscillators are used to generate the radio signal in [[cell phone]]s.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Negative-resistance oscillator===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Negative resistance oscillator.svg\n| width1   = 190\n| image2   = Ganna gjenerators M31102-1.jpg\n| width2   = 162\n| footer   = ''(left)'' Typical block diagram of a negative resistance oscillator.

''(right)'' A negative-resistance microwave oscillator consisting of a [[Gunn diode]] in a [[cavity resonator]].  The negative resistance of the diode excites microwave oscillations in the cavity, which radiate out the aperture into a [[waveguide]].\n}}\n\nIn addition to the feedback oscillators described above, which use [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying active elements such as transistors and operational amplifiers, linear oscillators can also be built using [[port (circuit theory)|one-port]] (two terminal) devices with [[negative resistance]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> such as [[magnetron]] tubes, [[tunnel diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s and [[Gunn diode]]s.  Negative-resistance oscillators are usually used at high frequencies in the [[microwave]] range and above, since at these frequencies feedback oscillators perform poorly due to excessive phase shift in the feedback path.\n\nIn negative-resistance oscillators, a resonant circuit, such as an [[LC circuit]], [[crystal oscillator|crystal]], or [[Resonator#Cavity resonators|cavity resonator]], is connected across a device with [[negative differential resistance]], and a DC bias voltage is applied to supply energy.  A resonant circuit by itself is \"almost\" an oscillator; it can store energy in the form of electronic oscillations if excited, but because it has electrical resistance and other losses the oscillations are [[Harmonic oscillator#Damped harmonic oscillator|damped]] and decay to zero.  The negative resistance of the active device cancels the (positive) internal loss resistance in the resonator, in effect creating a resonator with no damping, which generates spontaneous continuous oscillations at its [[resonant frequency]].\n\nThe negative-resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying devices such as transistors and [[vacuum tube|tubes]] also have negative resistance.<ref name=\"Kung\">{{cite web\n | last = Kung\n | first = Fabian Wai Lee\n | title = Lesson 9: Oscillator Design\n | website = RF/Microwave Circuit Design\n | publisher = Prof. Kung's website, Multimedia University\n | year = 2009\n | url = http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | accessdate = October 17, 2012\n | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6a4ZRWA70?url=http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | archive-date = July 16, 2015\n | url-status = dead\n }}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, pp. 9\u201310, 14</ref><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\">{{cite book\n | last = Ellinger\n | first = Frank\n | title = Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and Technologies, 2nd Ed\n | publisher = Springer\n | year = 2008\n | location = USA\n | pages = 391\u2013394\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0pl9xYD0QNMC&pg=PA391&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-3540693246}}</ref>  At high frequencies, transistors and FETs do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show negative resistance due to internal feedback, causing them to oscillate.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\">{{cite book\n | last =  R\u00e4is\u00e4nen\n | first = Antti V.\n | author2=Arto Lehto\n | title = Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications\n | publisher = Artech House\n | year = 2003\n | location = USA\n | pages = 180\u2013182\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Dgkvf84xoC&pg=PA181\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-1580535427}}</ref><ref name=\"Maas\" /> High-frequency oscillators in general are designed using negative-resistance techniques.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\" />\n\nSome of the many harmonic oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 80%\"|Active devices used in oscillators and approximate maximum frequencies<ref name=\" Raisanen\" />\n|-\n!

The switching device periodically charges and discharges the energy stored in the storage element thus causing abrupt changes in the output waveform.\n\nSquare-wave relaxation oscillators are used to provide the [[clock signal]] for [[sequential logic]] circuits such as timers and [[digital counter|counters]], although crystal oscillators are often preferred for their greater stability. Triangle-wave or sawtooth oscillators are used in the timebase circuits that generate the horizontal deflection signals for [[cathode ray tube]]s in analogue [[oscilloscope]]s and [[television]] sets. They are also used in [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]s (VCOs), [[inverter]]s and [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]], [[dual-slope ADC|dual-slope analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs), and in [[function generator]]s to generate square and triangle waves for testing equipment. In general, relaxation oscillators are used at lower frequencies and have poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.\n\n[[Ring oscillator]]s are built of a ring of active delay stages.  Generally the ring has an odd number of inverting stages, so that there is no single stable state for the internal ring voltages. Instead, a single transition propagates endlessly around the ring.\n\nSome of the more common relaxation oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n*[[Multivibrator]]\n*[[Pearson\u2013Anson effect|Pearson\u2013Anson oscillator]]\n*[[Ring oscillator]]\n*[[Delay-line oscillator]]\n*[[Royer oscillator]]\n\n==Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)==\n{{Main|Voltage-controlled oscillator}}\nAn oscillator can be designed so that the oscillation frequency can be varied over some range by an input voltage or current. These [[voltage controlled oscillator]]s are widely used in [[phase-locked loop]]s, in which the oscillator's frequency can be locked to the frequency of another oscillator. These are ubiquitous in modern communications circuits, used in [[electronic filter|filters]], [[modulator]]s, [[demodulator]]s, and forming the basis of [[frequency synthesizer]] circuits which are used to tune radios and televisions.\n\nRadio frequency VCOs are usually made by adding a [[varactor]] diode to the [[tuned circuit]] or resonator in an oscillator circuit. Changing the DC voltage across the varactor changes its [[capacitance]], which changes the [[resonant frequency]] of the tuned circuit. Voltage controlled relaxation oscillators can be constructed by charging and discharging the energy storage capacitor with a voltage controlled [[current source]]. Increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.\n\n==History==\nThe first practical oscillators were based on [[electric arc]]s, which were used for lighting in the 19th century.

However, the [[triode]] vacuum tube oscillator performed poorly above 300&nbsp;MHz because of interelectrode capacitance.{{citation needed|reason=tune out capacitance; lighthouse tubes; transit time|date=April 2017}}  To reach higher frequencies, new \"transit time\" (velocity modulation) vacuum tubes were developed, in which electrons traveled in \"bunches\" through the tube.  The first of these was the [[Barkhausen\u2013Kurz tube|Barkhausen\u2013Kurz oscillator]] (1920), the first tube to produce power in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] range.  The most important and widely used were the [[klystron]] (R. and S. Varian, 1937) and the cavity [[magnetron]] (J. Randall and H. Boot, 1940).\n\nMathematical conditions for feedback oscillations, now called the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]], were derived by [[Heinrich Georg Barkhausen]] in 1921.

When the power supply to the amplifier is first switched on, [[electronic noise]] in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations started. The noise travels around the loop and is amplified and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] until very quickly it converges on a [[sine wave]] at a single frequency.\n\nFeedback oscillator circuits can be classified according to the type of frequency selective filter they use in the feedback loop:<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />\n\n*In an ''[[RC oscillator]]'' circuit, the filter is a network of [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> RC oscillators are mostly used to generate lower frequencies, for example in the audio range.  Common types of RC oscillator circuits are the [[phase shift oscillator]] and the [[Wien bridge oscillator]].\n{{anchor|LC oscillator}}\n*In an ''LC oscillator'' circuit, the filter is a [[tuned circuit]] (often called a ''tank circuit''; the tuned circuit is a [[resonator]]) consisting of an [[inductor]] (L) and [[capacitor]] (C) connected together.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  Charge flows back and forth between the capacitor's plates through the inductor, so the tuned circuit can store electrical energy oscillating at its [[resonant frequency]]. There are small losses in the tank circuit, but the amplifier compensates for those losses and supplies the power for the output signal. LC oscillators are often used at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> when a tunable frequency source is necessary, such as in [[signal generator]]s, tunable radio [[transmitter]]s and the [[local oscillator]]s in [[radio receiver]]s.  Typical LC oscillator circuits are the [[Hartley oscillator|Hartley]], [[Colpitts oscillator|Colpitts]]<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> and [[Clapp oscillator|Clapp]] circuits.\n[[File:Oscillator comparison.svg|thumb|right|400px|Two common LC oscillator circuits, the Hartley and Colpitts oscillators]]\n\n*In a ''[[crystal oscillator]]'' circuit the filter is a [[piezoelectric]] crystal (commonly a [[quartz crystal]]).<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" />  The crystal mechanically vibrates as a [[resonator]], and its frequency of vibration determines the oscillation frequency. Crystals have a very high [[Q-factor]] and also better temperature stability than tuned circuits, so crystal oscillators have much better frequency stability than LC or RC oscillators. Crystal oscillators are the most common type of linear oscillator, used to stabilize the frequency of most [[radio transmitter]]s, and to generate the [[clock signal]] in computers and [[quartz clock]]s. Crystal oscillators often use the same circuits as LC oscillators, with the crystal replacing the [[tuned circuit]];<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /> the [[Pierce oscillator]] circuit is also commonly used. Quartz crystals are generally limited to frequencies of 30&nbsp;MHz or below.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" />  Other types of resonators, [[dielectric resonator]]s and [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) devices, are used to control higher frequency oscillators, up into the [[microwave]] range.  For example, SAW oscillators are used to generate the radio signal in [[cell phone]]s.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Negative-resistance oscillator===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Negative resistance oscillator.svg\n| width1   = 190\n| image2   = Ganna gjenerators M31102-1.jpg\n| width2   = 162\n| footer   = ''(left)'' Typical block diagram of a negative resistance oscillator.

The negative resistance of the diode excites microwave oscillations in the cavity, which radiate out the aperture into a [[waveguide]].\n}}\n\nIn addition to the feedback oscillators described above, which use [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying active elements such as transistors and operational amplifiers, linear oscillators can also be built using [[port (circuit theory)|one-port]] (two terminal) devices with [[negative resistance]],<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\" /> such as [[magnetron]] tubes, [[tunnel diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s and [[Gunn diode]]s.  Negative-resistance oscillators are usually used at high frequencies in the [[microwave]] range and above, since at these frequencies feedback oscillators perform poorly due to excessive phase shift in the feedback path.\n\nIn negative-resistance oscillators, a resonant circuit, such as an [[LC circuit]], [[crystal oscillator|crystal]], or [[Resonator#Cavity resonators|cavity resonator]], is connected across a device with [[negative differential resistance]], and a DC bias voltage is applied to supply energy.  A resonant circuit by itself is \"almost\" an oscillator; it can store energy in the form of electronic oscillations if excited, but because it has electrical resistance and other losses the oscillations are [[Harmonic oscillator#Damped harmonic oscillator|damped]] and decay to zero.  The negative resistance of the active device cancels the (positive) internal loss resistance in the resonator, in effect creating a resonator with no damping, which generates spontaneous continuous oscillations at its [[resonant frequency]].\n\nThe negative-resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with [[two-port network|two-port]] amplifying devices such as transistors and [[vacuum tube|tubes]] also have negative resistance.<ref name=\"Kung\">{{cite web\n | last = Kung\n | first = Fabian Wai Lee\n | title = Lesson 9: Oscillator Design\n | website = RF/Microwave Circuit Design\n | publisher = Prof. Kung's website, Multimedia University\n | year = 2009\n | url = http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | accessdate = October 17, 2012\n | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6a4ZRWA70?url=http://pesona.mmu.edu.my/~wlkung/ADS/rf/lesson9.pdf\n | archive-date = July 16, 2015\n | url-status = dead\n }}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, pp. 9\u201310, 14</ref><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\">{{cite book\n | last = Ellinger\n | first = Frank\n | title = Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and Technologies, 2nd Ed\n | publisher = Springer\n | year = 2008\n | location = USA\n | pages = 391\u2013394\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0pl9xYD0QNMC&pg=PA391&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-3540693246}}</ref>  At high frequencies, transistors and FETs do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show negative resistance due to internal feedback, causing them to oscillate.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\">{{cite book\n | last =  R\u00e4is\u00e4nen\n | first = Antti V.\n | author2=Arto Lehto\n | title = Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications\n | publisher = Artech House\n | year = 2003\n | location = USA\n | pages = 180\u2013182\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Dgkvf84xoC&pg=PA181\n | doi = \n | id = \n | isbn = 978-1580535427}}</ref><ref name=\"Maas\" /> High-frequency oscillators in general are designed using negative-resistance techniques.<ref name=\"Kung\" /><ref name=\" Raisanen\" /><ref name=\"Ellinger\" />\n\nSome of the many harmonic oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 80%\"|Active devices used in oscillators and approximate maximum frequencies<ref name=\" Raisanen\" />\n|-\n!

The switching device periodically charges and discharges the energy stored in the storage element thus causing abrupt changes in the output waveform.\n\nSquare-wave relaxation oscillators are used to provide the [[clock signal]] for [[sequential logic]] circuits such as timers and [[digital counter|counters]], although crystal oscillators are often preferred for their greater stability. Triangle-wave or sawtooth oscillators are used in the timebase circuits that generate the horizontal deflection signals for [[cathode ray tube]]s in analogue [[oscilloscope]]s and [[television]] sets. They are also used in [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]s (VCOs), [[inverter]]s and [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]], [[dual-slope ADC|dual-slope analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs), and in [[function generator]]s to generate square and triangle waves for testing equipment. In general, relaxation oscillators are used at lower frequencies and have poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.\n\n[[Ring oscillator]]s are built of a ring of active delay stages.  Generally the ring has an odd number of inverting stages, so that there is no single stable state for the internal ring voltages. Instead, a single transition propagates endlessly around the ring.\n\nSome of the more common relaxation oscillator circuits are listed below:\n\n*[[Multivibrator]]\n*[[Pearson\u2013Anson effect|Pearson\u2013Anson oscillator]]\n*[[Ring oscillator]]\n*[[Delay-line oscillator]]\n*[[Royer oscillator]]\n\n==Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)==\n{{Main|Voltage-controlled oscillator}}\nAn oscillator can be designed so that the oscillation frequency can be varied over some range by an input voltage or current. These [[voltage controlled oscillator]]s are widely used in [[phase-locked loop]]s, in which the oscillator's frequency can be locked to the frequency of another oscillator. These are ubiquitous in modern communications circuits, used in [[electronic filter|filters]], [[modulator]]s, [[demodulator]]s, and forming the basis of [[frequency synthesizer]] circuits which are used to tune radios and televisions.\n\nRadio frequency VCOs are usually made by adding a [[varactor]] diode to the [[tuned circuit]] or resonator in an oscillator circuit. Changing the DC voltage across the varactor changes its [[capacitance]], which changes the [[resonant frequency]] of the tuned circuit. Voltage controlled relaxation oscillators can be constructed by charging and discharging the energy storage capacitor with a voltage controlled [[current source]]. Increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.\n\n==History==\nThe first practical oscillators were based on [[electric arc]]s, which were used for lighting in the 19th century.

However, the [[triode]] vacuum tube oscillator performed poorly above 300&nbsp;MHz because of interelectrode capacitance.{{citation needed|reason=tune out capacitance; lighthouse tubes; transit time|date=April 2017}}  To reach higher frequencies, new \"transit time\" (velocity modulation) vacuum tubes were developed, in which electrons traveled in \"bunches\" through the tube.  The first of these was the [[Barkhausen\u2013Kurz tube|Barkhausen\u2013Kurz oscillator]] (1920), the first tube to produce power in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] range.  The most important and widely used were the [[klystron]] (R. and S. Varian, 1937) and the cavity [[magnetron]] (J. Randall and H. Boot, 1940).\n\nMathematical conditions for feedback oscillations, now called the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]], were derived by [[Heinrich Georg Barkhausen]] in 1921.  The first analysis of a nonlinear electronic oscillator model, the [[Van der Pol oscillator]], was done by [[Balthasar van der Pol]] in 1927.<ref name=\"Van der Pol\">{{cite journal\n | last = Van der Pol\n | first = Balthazar\n | title = On relaxation-oscillations\n | journal = The London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine\n | volume = 2\n | issue = 7\n | pages = 978\u2013992\n | year = 1927\n | issn = \n | doi = 10.1080/14786442608564127\n | id = \n }}</ref> He showed that the stability of the oscillations ([[limit cycle]]s) in actual oscillators was due to the [[linear circuit|nonlinearity]] of the amplifying device.
