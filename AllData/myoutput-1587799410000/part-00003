DJ K.i.D. is credited on six of the 13 tracks on\u00a0''Blame It on Baby''. The album incorporates work from several producers who answered DJ K.i.D.'s call for beats on [[Instagram]]. The DJ recalled the great response he received: \"I sent out that message online, and 5,000 people hit me [...] My DMs are on smash\".\nThe \"fizzy and forceful\" beat for \"Jump\", for instance, came from producer Rocco Did It Again, who reached out to K.i.D. because he admired \"[[Intro (DaBaby song)|Intro]]\", a song from DaBaby's previous album ''[[Kirk (album)|Kirk]]''. K.i.D. explained the production behind the song: \"Rocco had a looped [[hi-hat]] on there that I cleaned up a little bit. The [[Roland TR-808|808]] he had was sounding a little weird on the speakers, so I added mine\".\u00a0\nSimilarly, two German musicians, Mario Petersen and L.N.K., are responsible for the skeleton beat of \"Drop\". The inspiration for the beat came from the producers wanting \"to make something R&B-sounding, so we were working with a guitar loop and a [[Chopped and screwed|vocal chop]]\". L.N.K. further elaborated, \"We thought, 'Who could we send it to?'\u00a0[[Summer Walker]] or\u00a0[[Roddy Ricch]]\u00a0came up. So we sent it to [[London on da Track|London [on da Track]]], because we knew he works with those people\". London, instead, sent the song to DaBaby, and it ended up becoming a \"shimmering, melancholy\" collaboration with\u00a0[[A Boogie wit da Hoodie]]. Marcello Pagin, who manages Petersen and L.N.K. explained the concept of sharing instrumentals: \"For a lot of U.S. producers, getting sounds and sample ideas is a source of inspiration to get a lot of records done\". Another German musician, Nils Noehden, sent a \"chirpy\" [[riff]] to producer [[Wheezy (record producer)|Wheezy]] who eventually turned it into \"Talk About It\". The production work on \"Rockstar\", \"the immediate fan-favorite from\u00a0''Blame It on Baby''\",\u00a0was solely helmed by SethInTheKitchen, a beatmaker acquainted with DaBaby since the rapper was a local talent in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. \"Rockstar\" merges \"delicate acoustic guitar with a thundering bass line and a deft verse from Roddy Ricch\".\u00a0The tracks \"Sad Shit\" and \"Drop\" sees DaBaby singing \u2013 an apparent response at cynic's' insistence on DaBaby having a one-dimensional [[Rapping#Flow|flow]]. The vocal run on \"Sad Shit\" was not initially present on the song. DJ K.i.D. explained it was \"really a mistake that we did somewhere else. I caught it and held on to it and then placed it at the beginning of that track\".\n\nMuch of the album's verses were recorded in hotel rooms or venue rooms, but also on the road and sometimes even before DaBaby had to perform a show. DJ K.i.D. explained the recording process between him and DaBaby: \"Usually I play some loops, and he'll start rapping to the melody. I'll lay down a clap, hi-hats, probably a [[bass drum|kick]], sequence it to the point where it's a good enough loop, let him rap over it. There will be times where we'll be recording a verse and then I've gotta run on stage and do the opening set\". Out of the songs that were recorded for the album, only two did not make the cut.<ref name=\"The Making\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/making-of-dababy-blame-it-on-baby-985717|title=How DaBaby Made 'Blame It on Baby'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Leight|first=Elias|date=April 20, 2020|archivedate=April 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422194838/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/making-of-dababy-blame-it-on-baby-985717}}</ref> \n \nRegarding the album's content as a whole, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Elias Leight noted: {{quote|\"The album mainly sticks to the succinct, punishing formula DaBaby has perfected on his last four releases: roughly a dozen tracks, most of them less than three minutes long, full of emphatic, slugging rapping and vicious yet melodic bass lines\".|author=|title=|source=}}<ref name=\"The Making\" />\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/blame-it-on-baby-mw0003377677|title=Blame It on Baby - DaBaby|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Thomas|first=Fred|date=April 24, 2020|accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]''\n| rev2score = 4/10<ref name=\"Clashrev\">{{cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/dababy-blame-it-on-baby|title=DaBaby - Blame It On Baby|last=Johnson|first=Shakeena|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|date=April 17, 2020|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3score = B\u2013<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/music-reviews/dababy-blame-it-on-baby-review/|title=DaBaby charts a new path forward on Blame It on Baby|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Hockley-Smith |first=Sam|date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev4score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/dababy-blame-it-on-baby-review-2649683|title=DaBaby \u2013 'Blame It On Baby' review: rap's latest hot property further propels his momentum|work=[[NME]]|last=Moore|first=Sam|date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev5score = 6.8/10<ref name=\"PF\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dababy-blame-it-on-baby/|title=DaBaby Blame It on Baby|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Blum|first=Dani|date=April 21, 2020|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev6score = {{rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"RSreview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/dababy-blame-it-on-baby-review-986908/|title=DaBaby Plays the Blame Game on 'Blame It On Baby'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Holmes|first=Charles|date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 61/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/blame-it-on-baby/dababy/critic-reviews|title=''Blame It on Baby'' by DaBaby|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\nOn the review aggregate website [[Metacritic]], ''Blame It on Baby'' received a score of 61, based on six reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\nIn a positive review, Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"DaBaby's detractors might not be defeated with 'Blame It On Baby', but this latest project succeeds by further propelling the rapper's soaring momentum even while in lockdown.

He noted \"Nasty\", \"Pick Up\", and \"Talk About It\" as highlights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djbooth.net/features/2020-04-17-dababy-blame-it-on-baby-album-review-new-music|title=Read Our 1 Listen Review of DaBaby's 'BLAME IT ON BABY' Album|website=DJBooth|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sam Hockley-Smith wrote the following: \"For the most part, ''Blame It on Baby'' is classic DaBaby. Minimal bass stabs and toybox plinks and whirrs accent joyful s--- talking. Songs generally clock in under three minutes. He sounds like he's having a lot of fun, which is all the album needs to be. But as the industry dictates, doing one thing well enough to get popular is not enough to stay popular, so there are also songs on here that paint him as lovelorn and heartbroken. It's not a great fit, not because he can't pull it off lyrically, but because it doesn't really sound like he even believes himself.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> \n\nWriting for ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'', Shakeena Johnson gave the album a mixed review, stating that while ''Blame it on Baby'' is \"offering 13 tracks of Hennessy-infused rhyming, drums on drums on drums and a nasty Kidz Bop styled beat to tie it all together, the album is sadly a fresh reminder that DaBaby is hip-hop's biggest one-trick pony.\" Johnson continued by saying that \"While I applaud him for going against the grain of most artists who are holding off of dropping new music during these quarantining times, the album doesn't quite match up to his potential or skillset. It hurts to admit it, but DaBaby has let us down with this one.\"<ref name=\"Clashrev\"/> Charles Holmes of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized DaBaby for not successfully delivering \"something new\" with the album, stating that \"For every song that sees him [DaBaby] trying to do something new, there's one that features the same flow, adlibs, and antics that got him here \u2013 albeit with a new edge \u2013 all to diminishing returns.\"<ref name=\"RSreview\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dani Blum also criticized the album's alikeness to previous releases from DaBaby, writing that \"half the album is stacked with the same regurgitated phrases and flows from earlier projects, stale the third time around; for the rest, DaBaby follows formulas other than his own.\" However, Blum praised the song \"Blame It on Baby\", stating that \"the album's payoff arrives on the title track, a two-minute opus that stitches together four beat switches and contorts DaBaby's flow over and over. It builds, it thrills, it makes you feel like you can run through a wall \u2013 everything a DaBaby song can and should do, when he asks it of himself.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nFollowing its release, the album catapulted to the top of the US [[Apple Music]] songs chart, occupying nine of the top ten spots, led by the track \"Rockstar\", featuring [[Roddy Ricch]].

DJ K.i.D. is credited on six of the 13 tracks on\u00a0''Blame It on Baby''. The album incorporates work from several producers who answered DJ K.i.D.'s call for beats on [[Instagram]]. The DJ recalled the great response he received: \"I sent out that message online, and 5,000 people hit me [...] My DMs are on smash\".\nThe \"fizzy and forceful\" beat for \"Jump\", for instance, came from producer Rocco Did It Again, who reached out to K.i.D. because he admired \"[[Intro (DaBaby song)|Intro]]\", a song from DaBaby's previous album ''[[Kirk (album)|Kirk]]''. K.i.D. explained the production behind the song: \"Rocco had a looped [[hi-hat]] on there that I cleaned up a little bit. The [[Roland TR-808|808]] he had was sounding a little weird on the speakers, so I added mine\".\u00a0\nSimilarly, two German musicians, Mario Petersen and L.N.K., are responsible for the skeleton beat of \"Drop\". The inspiration for the beat came from the producers wanting \"to make something R&B-sounding, so we were working with a guitar loop and a [[Chopped and screwed|vocal chop]]\". L.N.K. further elaborated, \"We thought, 'Who could we send it to?'\u00a0[[Summer Walker]] or\u00a0[[Roddy Ricch]]\u00a0came up. So we sent it to [[London on da Track|London [on da Track]]], because we knew he works with those people\". London, instead, sent the song to DaBaby, and it ended up becoming a \"shimmering, melancholy\" collaboration with\u00a0[[A Boogie wit da Hoodie]]. Marcello Pagin, who manages Petersen and L.N.K. explained the concept of sharing instrumentals: \"For a lot of U.S. producers, getting sounds and sample ideas is a source of inspiration to get a lot of records done\". Another German musician, Nils Noehden, sent a \"chirpy\" [[riff]] to producer [[Wheezy (record producer)|Wheezy]] who eventually turned it into \"Talk About It\". The production work on \"Rockstar\", \"the immediate fan-favorite from\u00a0''Blame It on Baby''\",\u00a0was solely helmed by SethInTheKitchen, a beatmaker acquainted with DaBaby since the rapper was a local talent in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. \"Rockstar\" merges \"delicate acoustic guitar with a thundering bass line and a deft verse from Roddy Ricch\".\u00a0The tracks \"Sad Shit\" and \"Drop\" sees DaBaby singing \u2013 an apparent response at cynic's' insistence on DaBaby having a one-dimensional [[Rapping#Flow|flow]]. The vocal run on \"Sad Shit\" was not initially present on the song. DJ K.i.D. explained it was \"really a mistake that we did somewhere else. I caught it and held on to it and then placed it at the beginning of that track\".\n\nMuch of the album's verses were recorded in hotel rooms or venue rooms, but also on the road and sometimes even before DaBaby had to perform a show. DJ K.i.D. explained the recording process between him and DaBaby: \"Usually I play some loops, and he'll start rapping to the melody. I'll lay down a clap, hi-hats, probably a [[bass drum|kick]], sequence it to the point where it's a good enough loop, let him rap over it. There will be times where we'll be recording a verse and then I've gotta run on stage and do the opening set\". Out of the songs that were recorded for the album, only two did not make the cut.<ref name=\"The Making\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/making-of-dababy-blame-it-on-baby-985717|title=How DaBaby Made 'Blame It on Baby'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Leight|first=Elias|date=April 20, 2020|archivedate=April 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422194838/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/making-of-dababy-blame-it-on-baby-985717}}</ref> \n \nRegarding the album's content as a whole, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Elias Leight noted: {{quote|\"The album mainly sticks to the succinct, punishing formula DaBaby has perfected on his last four releases: roughly a dozen tracks, most of them less than three minutes long, full of emphatic, slugging rapping and vicious yet melodic bass lines\".|author=|title=|source=}}<ref name=\"The Making\" />\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/blame-it-on-baby-mw0003377677|title=Blame It on Baby - DaBaby|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Thomas|first=Fred|date=April 24, 2020|accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]''\n| rev2score = 4/10<ref name=\"Clashrev\">{{cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/dababy-blame-it-on-baby|title=DaBaby - Blame It On Baby|last=Johnson|first=Shakeena|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|date=April 17, 2020|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3score = B\u2013<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/music-reviews/dababy-blame-it-on-baby-review/|title=DaBaby charts a new path forward on Blame It on Baby|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Hockley-Smith |first=Sam|date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev4score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/dababy-blame-it-on-baby-review-2649683|title=DaBaby \u2013 'Blame It On Baby' review: rap's latest hot property further propels his momentum|work=[[NME]]|last=Moore|first=Sam|date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev5score = 6.8/10<ref name=\"PF\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dababy-blame-it-on-baby/|title=DaBaby Blame It on Baby|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Blum|first=Dani|date=April 21, 2020|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev6score = {{rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"RSreview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/dababy-blame-it-on-baby-review-986908/|title=DaBaby Plays the Blame Game on 'Blame It On Baby'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Holmes|first=Charles|date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 61/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/blame-it-on-baby/dababy/critic-reviews|title=''Blame It on Baby'' by DaBaby|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\nOn the review aggregate website [[Metacritic]], ''Blame It on Baby'' received a score of 61, based on six reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\nIn a positive review, Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"DaBaby's detractors might not be defeated with 'Blame It On Baby', but this latest project succeeds by further propelling the rapper's soaring momentum even while in lockdown.

He noted \"Nasty\", \"Pick Up\", and \"Talk About It\" as highlights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djbooth.net/features/2020-04-17-dababy-blame-it-on-baby-album-review-new-music|title=Read Our 1 Listen Review of DaBaby's 'BLAME IT ON BABY' Album|website=DJBooth|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sam Hockley-Smith wrote the following: \"For the most part, ''Blame It on Baby'' is classic DaBaby. Minimal bass stabs and toybox plinks and whirrs accent joyful s--- talking. Songs generally clock in under three minutes. He sounds like he's having a lot of fun, which is all the album needs to be. But as the industry dictates, doing one thing well enough to get popular is not enough to stay popular, so there are also songs on here that paint him as lovelorn and heartbroken. It's not a great fit, not because he can't pull it off lyrically, but because it doesn't really sound like he even believes himself.\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> \n\nWriting for ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'', Shakeena Johnson gave the album a mixed review, stating that while ''Blame it on Baby'' is \"offering 13 tracks of Hennessy-infused rhyming, drums on drums on drums and a nasty Kidz Bop styled beat to tie it all together, the album is sadly a fresh reminder that DaBaby is hip-hop's biggest one-trick pony.\" Johnson continued by saying that \"While I applaud him for going against the grain of most artists who are holding off of dropping new music during these quarantining times, the album doesn't quite match up to his potential or skillset. It hurts to admit it, but DaBaby has let us down with this one.\"<ref name=\"Clashrev\"/> Charles Holmes of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized DaBaby for not successfully delivering \"something new\" with the album, stating that \"For every song that sees him [DaBaby] trying to do something new, there's one that features the same flow, adlibs, and antics that got him here \u2013 albeit with a new edge \u2013 all to diminishing returns.\"<ref name=\"RSreview\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dani Blum also criticized the album's alikeness to previous releases from DaBaby, writing that \"half the album is stacked with the same regurgitated phrases and flows from earlier projects, stale the third time around; for the rest, DaBaby follows formulas other than his own.\" However, Blum praised the song \"Blame It on Baby\", stating that \"the album's payoff arrives on the title track, a two-minute opus that stitches together four beat switches and contorts DaBaby's flow over and over. It builds, it thrills, it makes you feel like you can run through a wall \u2013 everything a DaBaby song can and should do, when he asks it of himself.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nFollowing its release, the album catapulted to the top of the US [[Apple Music]] songs chart, occupying nine of the top ten spots, led by the track \"Rockstar\", featuring [[Roddy Ricch]].
