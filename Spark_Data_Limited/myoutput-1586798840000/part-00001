It was released on 10 April 2020 by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the opening scene, Jack is trying to muster up the courage to kiss Dina, his sister Hayley's American roommate, before he leaves to return home to London. He had come to Rome to visit his sister Hayley for the weekend, and Dina had also come to visit Hayley. Before he can kiss Dina, Greg, Jack's dorm roommate from university, bumps into them. Realising that Jack is also headed towards the airport, Greg offers him a ride and Jack is unable to kiss Dina or even say a proper goodbye. Saying an awkward goodbye, both men leave with Jack upset.\n\nThree years later, Jack is at his sister Hayley's wedding. Bryan, an aspiring actor and the maid of honor, is more concerned about being called the maid of honor, getting introduced to Italian film director Vitelli and not being seated next to Rebecca, rather than helping out the bride. He is late for the wedding ceremony because he decides to get a haircut to better prepare himself for his meeting with Vitelli. Hayley has chosen to not seat Bryan with Vitelli as she has seated all the English people on the English table, which also includes Amanda, Jack's \"nightmare of an ex-girlfriend\".\n\nAmanda has come to the wedding with her boyfriend Chaz, with whom she has clear commitment issues (he proposed six months earlier and she has not responded yet). Other friends of Hayley's include clingy Rebecca and socially awkward Sidney. Rebecca, upon meeting Chaz, accidentally mistakes him for a cabaret act and mentions that Amanda called Chaz a \"dickhead\". Sidney has worn a kilt to the wedding, despite not being Scottish, and becomes easily uncomfortable in it.\n\nAs Jack and Hayley's parents are dead, Hayley has asked Jack to walk her down the aisle. Just as they are about to, Hayley tells Jack that Dina has come to the wedding and is single. After the wedding, Sidney and approaches Dina, which leads to an uncomfortable conversation between the two and ends with Sidney leaving to get some champgane for the both of them, despite Dina not wanting any. Meanwhile, Jack and Bryan are talking about how Bryan will create a good first impression on Vitelli, when Bryan learns that he has to make a maid-of-honor speech. Rebecca joins the conversation, and while she continues to compliment him, Jack sees Dina for the first time in three years. Both of them talk and they confess to one another that they used to ask Hayley about the other.\n\nMarc, Hayley's school classmate, arrives at the wedding venue high on cocaine and plans to ruin the wedding. Hayley confronts Marc and asks him to leave. Their talk is interrupted by Roberto, Hayley's husband, and he ends up having Marc stay for the celebrations.\n\nHayley asks Jack to drug Marc with her sleeping drops, but some children mess around and rearrange the seating order.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Claflin]] as Jack\n* [[Olivia Munn]] as Dina \n* [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] as Hayley\n* [[Joel Fry (actor)|Joel Fry]] as Bryan\n* [[Tim Key]] as Sidney\n* [[Aisling Bea]] as Rebecca\n* [[Jack Farthing]] as Marc\n* [[Allan Mustafa (actor)|Allan Mustafa]] as Chaz\n* [[Freida Pinto]] as Amanda\n* [[Paolo Mazzarelli]] as Vitelli\n* Tiziano Caputo as Roberto\n\n==Production==\nThe film was announced in April 2019, with [[Sam Claflin]], [[Olivia Munn]], [[Freida Pinto]] and [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] cast.
