She has been called \"one of the greatest avant-garde women artists of the early 20th century\" and a \"pioneer\" in modern Indian art. Drawn to painting from an early age, Sher-Gil started getting formal lessons in the art, at the age of eight. She first gained recognition at the age of 19, for her [[oil painting]] titled ''Young Girls'' (1932).\n\nSher-Gil traveled throughout her life to various countries including Turkey, France, and India, deriving heavily from precolonial Indian art styles and its current culture. Sher-Gil is considered an important painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands on a level with that of the pioneers from the [[Bengali Renaissance|Bengal Renaissance]]. She was also an avid reader and a pianist. Sher-Gil's paintings are among the most expensive by Indian women painters today, although few acknowledged her work when she was alive.

She has been called \"one of the greatest avant-garde women artists of the early 20th century\" and a \"pioneer\" in modern Indian art. Drawn to painting from an early age, Sher-Gil started getting formal lessons in the art, at the age of eight. She first gained recognition at the age of 19, for her [[oil painting]] titled ''Young Girls'' (1932).\n\nSher-Gil traveled throughout her life to various countries including Turkey, France, and India, deriving heavily from precolonial Indian art styles and its current culture. Sher-Gil is considered an important painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands on a level with that of the pioneers from the [[Bengali Renaissance|Bengal Renaissance]]. She was also an avid reader and a pianist. Sher-Gil's paintings are among the most expensive by Indian women painters today, although few acknowledged her work when she was alive.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\n[[File:Amrita with Indira 1922.jpg|thumb|150px|left| Amrita with her sister Indira, 1922]]\n\nAmrita Sher-Gil was born on 30 January 1913<ref name=GreatMinds>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000312/spectrum/main2.htm#3 Great Minds], The Tribune, 12 March 2000.</ref> in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Budapest Diary|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?267032|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=Outlook|date=20 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529110336/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?267032|archive-date=29 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> to Umrao Singh Sher-Gil Majithia, a  [[Jat sikh|sikh]] aristocrat and a scholar in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], and Marie Antoniette Gottesmann, a [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian-Jewish]] opera singer who came from an affluent bourgeois family.<ref name=\"The Indian Frida Kahlo\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/10087130/The-Indian-Frida-Kahlo.html|title=The Indian Frida Kahlo|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"christies.com\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.christies.com/features/Amrita-Sher-Gil-6132-1.aspx|title=Revolution personified {{!}} Christie's'|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> Her parents first met in 1912, while Marie Antoinette was visiting Lahore.<ref name=\"The Indian Frida Kahlo\"/> Her mother came to India as a companion of [[Princess Bamba Sutherland]], the granddaughter of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]].<ref name=\"spectrum\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090920/spectrum/main3.htm|title=The Princess who died unknown|last=Kang|first=Kanwarjit Singh|date=20 September 2009|work=The Sunday Tribune|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=Hamari Amrita|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?230674|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=Outlook|date=27 March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206165148/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?230674|archive-date=6 February 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Sher-Gil was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister was Indira Sundaram (n\u00e9e Sher-Gil), born in March 1914), mother of the contemporary artist [[Vivan Sundaram]].
