E-government offers new opportunities for more direct and convenient citizen access to government, and for government provision of services directly to citizens.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

Some non-Internet forms include [[telephone]], [[fax]], [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]], [[Short message service|SMS]] text messaging, [[Multimedia Messaging System|MMS]], wireless networks and services, [[Bluetooth]], [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], tracking systems, [[RFID]], [[biometric]] identification, road traffic management and regulatory enforcement, [[identity cards]], [[smart cards]] and other [[near field communication]] applications; polling station technology (where non-online [[e-voting]] is being considered), TV and radio-based delivery of government services (e.g., [[Control System Middleware for operator functioning (CSMW)|CSMW]]), email, [[online community]] facilities, [[newsgroup]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[online chat]], and [[instant messenger|instant messaging]] technologies.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n===Disadvantages===\nThe main disadvantages concerning e-government are the lack of equality in public access to computers and the internet (the \"[[digital divide]]\", a reference to the fact that people who have low incomes, who are [[homeless]] and/or who live in remote regions may have little or no access to the Internet), reliability of information on the web, and issues that could influence and bias public opinions. There are many considerations and potential implications of implementing and designing e-government, including [[disintermediation]] of the government and its citizens, impacts on economic, social, and political factors, vulnerability to [[cyber attack]]s, and disturbances to the ''status quo'' in these areas.<ref name=\"information137\">{{Cite book| last1 = Atkinson | first1 = Robert D. | last2 = Castro | first2 = Daniel | title = Digital Quality of Life | publisher = The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation | pages = 137\u2013145 | year = 2008 | url=http://www.itif.org/files/DQOL-14.pdf }}</ref> See also [[Electronic leviathan]].\n\nThe political nature of public sector forms are also cited as disadvantages to e-government systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/governance/key-issues/e-government/challenges-for-e-government#.WE-RiJMrJAY|title=Challenges for e-government|last=Collodi|first=Jason|date=|website=eldis.org/|publisher=Institute of Development Studies|access-date=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Trust ===\nTrust in e-governance is very highly dependent on its performance and execution, which can be measured through the effectiveness of current actions.

Once e-government technologies become more sophisticated, citizens will be likely be encouraged to interact electronically with the government for more transactions, as e-services are much less costly than [[bricks and mortar]] service offices (physical buildings) staffed by [[civil servant]]s. This could potentially lead to a decrease in privacy for civilians as the government obtains more and more information about their activities. Without safeguards, government agencies might share information on citizens. In a worst-case scenario, with so much information being passed electronically between government and civilians, a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]-like system could develop. When the government has easy access to countless information on its citizens, personal [[privacy]] is lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/48629.html?wlc=1235202183 |title=AT&T Sued for Role in Aiding US Government Surveillance |publisher=TechNewsWorld |author=Lyman, Jay |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/08/analysis-new-la.html |title=Analysis: New Law Gives Government Six Months to Turn Internet and Phone Systems into Permanent Spying Architecture |journal=Wired |author=Singel, Ryan |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>\n\n====Cost====\nAlthough \"a prodigious amount of money has been spent\"<ref>The good, the bad and the inevitable | The Economist http://www.economist.com/node/10638105</ref> on the development and implementation of e-government, some say{{Who|date=February 2014}} it has yielded only a mediocre result.

E-government allows for government transparency. Government transparency is important because it allows the public to be informed about what the government is working on as well as the policies they are trying to implement.\nSimple tasks may be easier to perform through electronic government access. Many changes, such as marital status or address changes can be a long process and take a lot of paperwork for citizens. E-government allows these tasks to be performed efficiently with more convenience to individuals.\nE-government is an easy way for the public to be more involved in political campaigns. It could increase voter awareness, which could lead to an increase in citizen participation in elections.\nIt is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to spend time, energy and money to get it.\n\nE-government helps simplify processes and makes government information more easily accessible for public sector agencies and citizens. For example, the [[Indiana]] Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings.<ref>[http://www.in.gov/bmv/ Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles]. In.gov (2009-06-16). Retrieved on 2012-06-25.</ref> [[Indiana]] became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology.

Through the Internet's [[Web 2.0]] interactive features, people from all over the country can provide input to politicians or public servants and make their voices heard. [[Blog]]ging and interactive surveys allow politicians or public servants to see the views of the people on any issue. [[Chat room]]s can place citizens in real-time contact with elected officials or their office staff or provide them with the means to interact directly with public servants, allowing voters to have a direct impact and influence in their government. These technologies can create a more transparent government, allowing voters to immediately see how and why their representatives in the capital are voting the way they are. This helps voters decide whom to vote for in the future or how to help the public servants become more productive.\n\nA government could theoretically move more towards a true [[democracy]] with the proper application of e-government.

Many e-government services are available to citizens with computers and Internet access 24 hours a day and seven days a week, in contrast to [[bricks and mortar]] government offices, which tend to be only open during [[business hour]]s (notable exceptions are [[police station]]s and [[hospital]]s, which are usually open 24 hours a day so that staff can deal with emergencies).\n\nImproved accounting and record keeping can be noted through computerization, and information and forms can be easily accessed by citizens with computers and Internet access, which may enable quicker processing time for applications and find information. On the administrative side, access to help find or retrieve files and linked information can now be stored in electronic databases versus hard copies (paper copies) stored in various locations.

In the development of the public sector or private sector portals and platforms, a system is created that benefits all constituents. Citizens needing to renew their vehicle registration have a convenient way to accomplish it while already engaged in meeting the regulatory inspection requirement. On behalf of a government partner, the business provides what has traditionally, and solely, managed by the government and can use this service to generate profit or attract new customers. Government agencies are relieved of the cost and complexity of having to process the transactions.<ref>Government Technology\u2019s Public CIO Thought Leadership Profile [http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf \"Expanding eGovernment, Every Day\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326054720/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf |date=2010-03-26 }} open-access online paper 2006.</ref>\n\nTo develop these public sector portals or platforms, governments have the choice to internally develop and manage, outsource, or sign a self-funding contract. The self-funding model creates portals that pay for themselves through convenience fees for certain e-government transactions, known as self-funding portals.\n\n[[Social networking service]]s and websites are an emerging area for e-democracy. The social networking entry point is within the citizens\u2019 environment and the engagement is on the citizens\u2019 terms. Proponents of e-government perceive the government's use of social networking as a medium to help the government act more like the public it serves. Examples can be found at almost every state government portal through [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]] widgets.\n\nGovernment and its agents also have the opportunity to follow citizens to monitor satisfaction with services they receive. Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns.

NITB was formed as a result of a merger between Pakistan Computer Bureau (PCB) and Electronic Government Directorate (EGD). \n<br />\nThe key functions identified by the NITB are:<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040331032631/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/ e-Government Pakistan].

While it clearly pursued efficiency gains and improved transparency, it also hoped to deliver \"efficient and cost-effective public services to citizens of Pakistan.\" The suite primarily included five modules or applications across all the ministries. Description of each module listed are: \n* Internal Communication Module\n* HR Management Module\n* Inventory & Procurement Management Module\n* Project Management Module\n* Finance Budget Module\nNITB released a high-level diagram that describes the process of transforming Federal Government agencies and ministries to e-Office environments.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003173827/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |archive-date=2016-10-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCriticism: NITB's rollout of the e-Office suite across almost all federal agencies is not only overly ambitious but also likely to fail. It seems to put together a lot of lofty organizational efficiency goals with a set of delivery or citizen-facing targets. In fact, most of the services NITB has provided have been largely conceptual and not sufficient concrete. The process outlined in the adoption process diagram seems devoid of any user-centric design or value proposition formulation. Instead of creating lots of MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and taking advantage of an iterative and validated learning the process, the e-Office Suite seems to incorporate all the features and functions that various ministries and divisions may need or use. It seems to focus more on the needs of the bureaucrats and government agencies rather than the needs of the end-user (citizens of Pakistan) and what services would they need that a ministry or division can provide.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nSri Lanka have taken some initiative actions to provide the benefits of e-government to the citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.lk |title=Government of Sri Lanka Official Web Portal |publisher=Gov.lk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gic.gov.lk/ |title=Government Information Center |publisher=Gic.gov.lk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>\n\n====Thailand====\nTo implement the principles of e-government, the Ministry of Information and Telecommunication Technologies of Thailand developed a plan for creating a modern e-services system during 2009-2014.<ref>https://www.egov.go.th/th/profile/808/</ref>\n\nThe next stage was the five-year project of the digital government, which began in 2016 and will be completed in 2021.

Some non-Internet forms include [[telephone]], [[fax]], [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]], [[Short message service|SMS]] text messaging, [[Multimedia Messaging System|MMS]], wireless networks and services, [[Bluetooth]], [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], tracking systems, [[RFID]], [[biometric]] identification, road traffic management and regulatory enforcement, [[identity cards]], [[smart cards]] and other [[near field communication]] applications; polling station technology (where non-online [[e-voting]] is being considered), TV and radio-based delivery of government services (e.g., [[Control System Middleware for operator functioning (CSMW)|CSMW]]), email, [[online community]] facilities, [[newsgroup]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[online chat]], and [[instant messenger|instant messaging]] technologies.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n===Disadvantages===\nThe main disadvantages concerning e-government are the lack of equality in public access to computers and the internet (the \"[[digital divide]]\", a reference to the fact that people who have low incomes, who are [[homeless]] and/or who live in remote regions may have little or no access to the Internet), reliability of information on the web, and issues that could influence and bias public opinions. There are many considerations and potential implications of implementing and designing e-government, including [[disintermediation]] of the government and its citizens, impacts on economic, social, and political factors, vulnerability to [[cyber attack]]s, and disturbances to the ''status quo'' in these areas.<ref name=\"information137\">{{Cite book| last1 = Atkinson | first1 = Robert D. | last2 = Castro | first2 = Daniel | title = Digital Quality of Life | publisher = The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation | pages = 137\u2013145 | year = 2008 | url=http://www.itif.org/files/DQOL-14.pdf }}</ref> See also [[Electronic leviathan]].\n\nThe political nature of public sector forms are also cited as disadvantages to e-government systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/governance/key-issues/e-government/challenges-for-e-government#.WE-RiJMrJAY|title=Challenges for e-government|last=Collodi|first=Jason|date=|website=eldis.org/|publisher=Institute of Development Studies|access-date=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Trust ===\nTrust in e-governance is very highly dependent on its performance and execution, which can be measured through the effectiveness of current actions.

Once e-government technologies become more sophisticated, citizens will be likely be encouraged to interact electronically with the government for more transactions, as e-services are much less costly than [[bricks and mortar]] service offices (physical buildings) staffed by [[civil servant]]s. This could potentially lead to a decrease in privacy for civilians as the government obtains more and more information about their activities. Without safeguards, government agencies might share information on citizens. In a worst-case scenario, with so much information being passed electronically between government and civilians, a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]-like system could develop.

Even the governments themselves do not always keep track of the information they insert and delete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Sep112002id104796.htm |title=Has Terrorism Curtailed E-Government? |publisher=Medill News Service |author=Chiger, Stephen |date=2002-09-11 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904235925/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Sep112002id104796.htm |archivedate=2008-09-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Advantages===\n\nThe ultimate goal of the e-government is to be able to offer an increased portfolio of public services to citizens in an efficient and cost-effective manner. E-government allows for government transparency. Government transparency is important because it allows the public to be informed about what the government is working on as well as the policies they are trying to implement.\nSimple tasks may be easier to perform through electronic government access. Many changes, such as marital status or address changes can be a long process and take a lot of paperwork for citizens. E-government allows these tasks to be performed efficiently with more convenience to individuals.\nE-government is an easy way for the public to be more involved in political campaigns. It could increase voter awareness, which could lead to an increase in citizen participation in elections.\nIt is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to spend time, energy and money to get it.\n\nE-government helps simplify processes and makes government information more easily accessible for public sector agencies and citizens. For example, the [[Indiana]] Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings.<ref>[http://www.in.gov/bmv/ Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles]. In.gov (2009-06-16). Retrieved on 2012-06-25.</ref> [[Indiana]] became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology. In addition to its simplicity, [[e-democracy]] services can reduce costs. [[Alabama]] Department of Conservation & Natural Resources, [[Wal-Mart]] and NIC<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicusa.com |title=nicusa.com |publisher=nicusa.com |accessdate=2013-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120194559/http://www.nicusa.com/ |archive-date=2008-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> developed an online hunting and fishing license service utilizing an existing computer to automate the licensing process. More than 140,000 licenses were purchased at [[Wal-Mart]] stores during the first hunting season and the agency estimates it will save $200,000 annually from service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_GovTech-Aug05.pdf |title=Picking Up the Tab |publisher=Government Technology |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2009-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821131811/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_GovTech-Aug05.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe anticipated benefits of e-government include efficiency, improved services, better accessibility of public services, sustainable community development and more transparency and accountability.<ref name=\"information137\"/>\n\n====Democratization====\n{{Main|E-democracy}}\nOne goal of some e-government initiatives is greater citizen participation. Through the Internet's [[Web 2.0]] interactive features, people from all over the country can provide input to politicians or public servants and make their voices heard. [[Blog]]ging and interactive surveys allow politicians or public servants to see the views of the people on any issue. [[Chat room]]s can place citizens in real-time contact with elected officials or their office staff or provide them with the means to interact directly with public servants, allowing voters to have a direct impact and influence in their government. These technologies can create a more transparent government, allowing voters to immediately see how and why their representatives in the capital are voting the way they are. This helps voters decide whom to vote for in the future or how to help the public servants become more productive.\n\nA government could theoretically move more towards a true [[democracy]] with the proper application of e-government. [[Open government|Government transparency]] will give insight to the public on how decisions are made and hold elected officials or public servants accountable for their actions. The public could become a direct and prominent influence in government legislature to some degree.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/ericjsinrod/2004-06-30-sinrod_x.htm |title=A look at the pros and cons of e-government |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |author=Sinrod, Eric J. |date=2004-06-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/417520 |title=How Web 2.0 Will Transform Local Government |publisher=Digital Communities |author=Schrier, Bill |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2008-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023020229/http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/417520 |archivedate=2008-10-23 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdt.org/egov/handbook/transparency.shtml |title=Transparency |publisher=Center for Democracy & Technology |accessdate=2009-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315105326/http://cdt.org/egov/handbook/transparency.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zenergyglobal.com/lib/facilitating-effective-online-participation-in-e-government-Thorpe.pdf |title=Facilitating effective online participation in e-government |publisher=E-government in [[New Zealand]] |author=Thorpe, Stephen J. |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2009-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520221620/http://www.zenergyglobal.com/lib/facilitating-effective-online-participation-in-e-government-Thorpe.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-20 }}</ref>\n\n====Environmental bonuses====\n{{Main|Paperless office}}\nProponents of e-government argue that online government services would lessen the need for hard copy paper forms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yourpenntrafford.com/penntraffordstar/article/so-how-much-paper-does-our-local-government-use |title=So, how much paper does our local government use? |publisher=Penn-Trafford Star |author=Dezayas, Heidi |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Due to recent pressures from [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] groups, the media, and the public, some governments and organizations have turned to the Internet to reduce paper use.

Many e-government services are available to citizens with computers and Internet access 24 hours a day and seven days a week, in contrast to [[bricks and mortar]] government offices, which tend to be only open during [[business hour]]s (notable exceptions are [[police station]]s and [[hospital]]s, which are usually open 24 hours a day so that staff can deal with emergencies).\n\nImproved accounting and record keeping can be noted through computerization, and information and forms can be easily accessed by citizens with computers and Internet access, which may enable quicker processing time for applications and find information. On the administrative side, access to help find or retrieve files and linked information can now be stored in electronic databases versus hard copies (paper copies) stored in various locations. Individuals with disabilities or conditions that affect their mobility no longer have to be mobile to be active in government and can access public services in the comfort of their own homes<ref>Satyanarayana, J.

In the development of the public sector or private sector portals and platforms, a system is created that benefits all constituents. Citizens needing to renew their vehicle registration have a convenient way to accomplish it while already engaged in meeting the regulatory inspection requirement. On behalf of a government partner, the business provides what has traditionally, and solely, managed by the government and can use this service to generate profit or attract new customers. Government agencies are relieved of the cost and complexity of having to process the transactions.<ref>Government Technology\u2019s Public CIO Thought Leadership Profile [http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf \"Expanding eGovernment, Every Day\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326054720/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf |date=2010-03-26 }} open-access online paper 2006.</ref>\n\nTo develop these public sector portals or platforms, governments have the choice to internally develop and manage, outsource, or sign a self-funding contract. The self-funding model creates portals that pay for themselves through convenience fees for certain e-government transactions, known as self-funding portals.\n\n[[Social networking service]]s and websites are an emerging area for e-democracy. The social networking entry point is within the citizens\u2019 environment and the engagement is on the citizens\u2019 terms. Proponents of e-government perceive the government's use of social networking as a medium to help the government act more like the public it serves. Examples can be found at almost every state government portal through [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]] widgets.\n\nGovernment and its agents also have the opportunity to follow citizens to monitor satisfaction with services they receive. Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Government is also beginning to [[Twitter]]. In the state of [[Rhode Island]], Treasurer [[Frank T.

While it clearly pursued efficiency gains and improved transparency, it also hoped to deliver \"efficient and cost-effective public services to citizens of Pakistan.\" The suite primarily included five modules or applications across all the ministries. Description of each module listed are: \n* Internal Communication Module\n* HR Management Module\n* Inventory & Procurement Management Module\n* Project Management Module\n* Finance Budget Module\nNITB released a high-level diagram that describes the process of transforming Federal Government agencies and ministries to e-Office environments.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003173827/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |archive-date=2016-10-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCriticism: NITB's rollout of the e-Office suite across almost all federal agencies is not only overly ambitious but also likely to fail. It seems to put together a lot of lofty organizational efficiency goals with a set of delivery or citizen-facing targets. In fact, most of the services NITB has provided have been largely conceptual and not sufficient concrete. The process outlined in the adoption process diagram seems devoid of any user-centric design or value proposition formulation. Instead of creating lots of MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and taking advantage of an iterative and validated learning the process, the e-Office Suite seems to incorporate all the features and functions that various ministries and divisions may need or use. It seems to focus more on the needs of the bureaucrats and government agencies rather than the needs of the end-user (citizens of Pakistan) and what services would they need that a ministry or division can provide.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nSri Lanka have taken some initiative actions to provide the benefits of e-government to the citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.lk |title=Government of Sri Lanka Official Web Portal |publisher=Gov.lk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gic.gov.lk/ |title=Government Information Center |publisher=Gic.gov.lk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>\n\n====Thailand====\nTo implement the principles of e-government, the Ministry of Information and Telecommunication Technologies of Thailand developed a plan for creating a modern e-services system during 2009-2014.<ref>https://www.egov.go.th/th/profile/808/</ref>\n\nThe next stage was the five-year project of the digital government, which began in 2016 and will be completed in 2021.
