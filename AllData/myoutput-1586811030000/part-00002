She is the second wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[heir apparent]] to the British throne. Instead of using the title [[Princess of Wales]], she uses the title [[Duchess of Cornwall]], her husband's secondary designation. In Scotland, she is known as the [[Duchess of Rothesay]].\n\nCamilla is the eldest child of Major [[Bruce Shand]] and his wife [[Rosalind Cubitt]], the daughter of [[Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe]]. She was raised in [[East Sussex]] and [[South Kensington]] in England, and was educated in England, Switzerland, and France. In 1973, Camilla married [[British Army]] officer [[Andrew Parker Bowles]], with whom she has two children. They divorced in 1995.\n\nCamilla was periodically romantically involved with the Prince of Wales both before and during their first marriages. The relationship became highly publicised in the media and attracted worldwide scrutiny.<ref group=fn>''Charles and Camilla: Portrait of a Love Affair'' by biographer [[Gyles Brandreth]] depicts Charles and Camilla's relationship as controversial due to its longevity, and throughout the book shows the media's interest and representation to the public.</ref> In 2005, it culminated in a [[civil marriage]] at [[Windsor Guildhall]], which was followed by a televised [[Anglican]] blessing at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].\n\nAs Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla assists the Prince of Wales on his official duties. She is also the patron, president and a member of numerous charities and organisations. Since 1994, she has taken action on [[osteoporosis]], earning honours and awards. She has also raised awareness in areas including rape and sexual abuse, literacy, animal welfare and poverty.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Morgan|title=Camilla: the woman behind the image|url=http://www.nzwomansweekly.co.nz/front-page-carousel/camilla-the-woman-behind-the-image|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=[[New Zealand Woman's Weekly]]|date=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Camilla: The relaxed and friendly face of the monarchy|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/camilla-the-relaxed-and-friendly-face-of-the-monarchy-31096366.html|accessdate=7 August 2015|newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=28 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Childhood and young adulthood==\nCamilla Rosemary Shand was born at [[King's College Hospital]], London, on 17 July 1947.<ref>Graham, p. 9</ref><ref group=fn>Some sources report that she was born in [[Plumpton, East Sussex|Plumpton]], but it seems that this is a confusion of her childhood home with her birthplace.</ref> She grew up in The Laines<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1238285|desc=The Laines|access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref> \u2013 an 18th-century [[country house]] in [[Plumpton, East Sussex]]<ref name=\"Brand\">Brandreth, p. 104</ref> \u2013 and a three-storey house in [[South Kensington]], her family's second home.<ref name=\"pony\"/> Her parents were [[British Army]] officer turned businessman Major [[Bruce Shand]] (1917\u20132006) and his wife, [[Rosalind Shand|Rosalind]] (''[[Maiden and married names|n\u00e9e]]'' Cubitt; 1921\u20131994).

{{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|GCVOf|CSM|PC}} (born '''Camilla Rosemary Shand''', later '''Parker Bowles'''; 17 July 1947) is a member of the [[British royal family]]. She is the second wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[heir apparent]] to the British throne. Instead of using the title [[Princess of Wales]], she uses the title [[Duchess of Cornwall]], her husband's secondary designation. In Scotland, she is known as the [[Duchess of Rothesay]].\n\nCamilla is the eldest child of Major [[Bruce Shand]] and his wife [[Rosalind Cubitt]], the daughter of [[Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe]]. She was raised in [[East Sussex]] and [[South Kensington]] in England, and was educated in England, Switzerland, and France. In 1973, Camilla married [[British Army]] officer [[Andrew Parker Bowles]], with whom she has two children. They divorced in 1995.\n\nCamilla was periodically romantically involved with the Prince of Wales both before and during their first marriages. The relationship became highly publicised in the media and attracted worldwide scrutiny.<ref group=fn>''Charles and Camilla: Portrait of a Love Affair'' by biographer [[Gyles Brandreth]] depicts Charles and Camilla's relationship as controversial due to its longevity, and throughout the book shows the media's interest and representation to the public.</ref> In 2005, it culminated in a [[civil marriage]] at [[Windsor Guildhall]], which was followed by a televised [[Anglican]] blessing at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].\n\nAs Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla assists the Prince of Wales on his official duties. She is also the patron, president and a member of numerous charities and organisations. Since 1994, she has taken action on [[osteoporosis]], earning honours and awards. She has also raised awareness in areas including rape and sexual abuse, literacy, animal welfare and poverty.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Morgan|title=Camilla: the woman behind the image|url=http://www.nzwomansweekly.co.nz/front-page-carousel/camilla-the-woman-behind-the-image|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=[[New Zealand Woman's Weekly]]|date=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Camilla: The relaxed and friendly face of the monarchy|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/camilla-the-relaxed-and-friendly-face-of-the-monarchy-31096366.html|accessdate=7 August 2015|newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=28 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Childhood and young adulthood==\nCamilla Rosemary Shand was born at [[King's College Hospital]], London, on 17 July 1947.<ref>Graham, p. 9</ref><ref group=fn>Some sources report that she was born in [[Plumpton, East Sussex|Plumpton]], but it seems that this is a confusion of her childhood home with her birthplace.</ref> She grew up in The Laines<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1238285|desc=The Laines|access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref> \u2013 an 18th-century [[country house]] in [[Plumpton, East Sussex]]<ref name=\"Brand\">Brandreth, p. 104</ref> \u2013 and a three-storey house in [[South Kensington]], her family's second home.<ref name=\"pony\"/> Her parents were [[British Army]] officer turned businessman Major [[Bruce Shand]] (1917\u20132006) and his wife, [[Rosalind Shand|Rosalind]] (''[[Maiden and married names|n\u00e9e]]'' Cubitt; 1921\u20131994).
