The museum was formally established in 1976 by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) as the '''Museum of Modern Art of Latin America'''. Artists represented in the AMA's permanent collection include [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]], [[Candido Portinari]], [[Pedro Figari]], [[Fernando de Szyszlo]], [[Amelia Pel\u00e1ez]], and [[Alejandro Obreg\u00f3n]].\n\n[[File:Interior, Art Museum of the Americas - 3.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Interior courtyard of the museum]]\n\nThe art collection of the OAS was initiated under the organization's Visual Arts Unit, beginning with the first donated artwork by the Brazilian [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realist]] artist Portinari, in 1949. In the following decade the [[Permanent Council of the Organization of American States|Permanent Council]] of the OAS determined to establish an acquisitions fund, in order to build up a permanent collection of artworks by significant contemporary artists from the member states of the OAS. A number of works were also purchased from or donated directly by artists, after the temporary exhibitions periodically held at the OAS gallery.\n\nThe Art Museum of the Americas itself was established in 1976 by OAS Permanent Council resolution, on the occasion of the [[United States Bicentennial]]. The museum opened in what was formerly the official residence of the [[Secretary General of the Organization of American States|OAS Secretary General]], a [[Spanish Colonial style|Spanish Colonial-style]] structure designed in 1912 by the architect [[Paul Cret]].\n\nInitially the permanent collection held some 250 artworks, expanding over the next quarter-century to over 2000 items of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[art installation|installations]], [[photography]], and [[drawing]], from the early 20th century and onwards. In addition to its permanent collection of mainly [[Caribbean art|Caribbean]] and [[Latin American art]], AM'''A''' hosts temporary and special exhibitions from across the region, and provides educational seminars and lectures from invited speakers.\n\nThe Art Museum of the Americas has also expanded its programs to include evening events, such as Art After Dark, with cutting edge music, video, performance, and installation art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/things-do-see/calendar/event/art-after-dark-2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326060707/http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/things-do-see/calendar/event/art-after-dark-2011 |archivedate=2012-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Permanent collection==\nThe history of the permanent collection of the Art Museum of the Americas has roots in the former Visual Arts Unit of the Organization of American States. Under this unit, the first donation of art was received in 1949, a gift of painting by Brazilian artist Candido Portinari. In 1957 the OAS Permanent Council conferred institutional backing to the collection by establishing a modest Purchase Fund to support the acquisition of art for a collection that was to reflect the contemporary art of the member nations of the OAS to form an enduring cultural resource. Purchases made by the Visual Arts Unit were strongly linked to and influenced by the direction of its exhibition program, and a significant number of works were acquired directly from the artists on the occasion of a temporary exhibit at the OAS Gallery. In many cases, an OAS exhibition represented the artist's first individual exhibit outside of his/her country of origin.\n\nWhen the museum officially opened in 1976, the collection numbered 250 works. Today, the collection has grown to close to 2000 objects in varying media including painting, sculpture, installations, prints, drawings and photographs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artmuseumoftheamericas.org/collection/cpg15x/thumbnails.php?album=1 |title=Museum Collection }}</ref>\n\nArtists represented in the Art Museum of the Americas' permanent collection include:\n* [[Carlos Cruz-D\u00edez]]\n* [[Pedro Figari]]\n* [[Leonel Gonzalez]]\n* [[Enrique Grau]]\n* [[Humberto Ivaldi]]\n* [[Roberto Matta]]\n* [[Carlos M\u00e9rida]]\n* [[Yolanda Mohalyi]]\n* [[Armando Morales]]\n* [[Alejandro Obreg\u00f3n]]\n* [[Amelia Pel\u00e1ez]]\n* [[Emilio Pettoruti]]\n* [[Candido Portinari]]\n* [[Emilio S\u00e1nchez (artist)]]\n* [[Antonio Segu\u00ed]]\n* [[Fernando de Szyszlo]]\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda]]\n* [[Rafael Soriano (painter)]]\n\n==About AMA==\nAMA | Art Museum of the Americas is the oldest museum of modern and contemporary Latin American and Caribbean art in the United States.

Today the collection has more than two thousand works complementing and documenting this regional focus.\n\nMuch of the importance of this art collection is in its specialization on works that proved instrumental in the launching, particularly in the United States, of the careers of many who are now regarded as masters of mid-century Latin American and Caribbean art. The collection represents numerous significant artistic trends that have developed in Latin America, including new figuration, geometric abstraction and lyrical, conceptual art, optical and kinetic art, among other movements.\n\nAMA continues to organize exhibitions and programs for young and emerging artists, providing a space for cultural expression, creativity, and dialogue while highlighting issues central to its parent organization (democracy, equitable development, human rights, justice and innovation) through the arts. This mission is strengthened through cutting-edge programming emphasizing art of a high technical caliber that simultaneously furthers dialogue on current relevant social and political matters.\n\n==AMA's permanent collection catalog==\n[http://museum.oas.org/files/Art%20of%20the%20Americas%20-SmallRes.pdf Art of the Americas: Collection of the Art Museum of the Americas of the Organization of American States] is a rigorous and comprehensive look at the historical and cultural legacy of the AMA | Art Museum of the Americas and the OAS (Organization of American States).

However, it was not until the 30s that the PAU vitalized itself as a promotional epicenter for Latin American art under the leadership of Concha Romero James, director of the Division of Intellectual Cooperation. Romero\u2019s unit embarked on long-term projects such as creating an archive of art documents and initiating a temporary exhibitions program.\n\nBeginning in 1948, Cuban art critic Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Sicre continued and accentuated the work of his predecessor, advancing initiatives such as: the active publication of materials on Latin American art, technical assistance to both public and private institutions and individuals interested in the field of the arts, creating a program of exhibitions of young and emerging artists of the Americas, and the establishment of a collection and museum of Latin American and Caribbean art.
