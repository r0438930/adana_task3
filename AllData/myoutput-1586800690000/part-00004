Steve McLaughlin, executive of [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]], east of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] {{convert|140|mi}} north of New York City, asked Cuomo to issue an order banning all non-essential travel upstate from the city, after city residents booked all available local lodging. Seven of 51 cases the county had as of April 2 were city residents, and the county feared it did not have sufficient healthcare infrastructure to handle a large outbreak; McLaughlin issued an order requiring any recent arrivals from the city to quarantine themselves for 14 days, during which law enforcement will check on them regularly.<ref name=\"Guardian refugees article\">{{cite news|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|title=New Yorkers fleeing city face fear and hostility from upstate neighbors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/new-yorkers-fleeing-city-conronavirus-fear-hostility-upstate-neighbors|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 2, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]], in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] just south of Albany, posted on its website a letter asking people to refrain from traveling there, especially from New York City or [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. \"There is no hospital in Greene County\", wrote the chairman of the county legislature. \"This limits our ability to serve a large number of people requiring higher levels of care for COVID-19 patients and other illnesses.\" The legislatures of neighboring [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware]] and [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]] counties made similar requests.<ref>{{cite press release|last=Linger|first=Patrick S.|date=March 20, 2020|title=A Message to Our Visitors, Weekenders and Second Homeowners|url=https://www.greenegovernment.com/scoop/greene-county-press-release-covid-19-march-20th-2020|location=[[Catskill, New York]]|publisher=[[Greene County, New York|Greene County]]|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn [[the Hamptons]], on the eastern end of Long Island's [[South Fork, Suffolk County, New York|South Fork]], a longtime summer destination for city residents, rental rates have quadrupled as the population has nearly doubled.
