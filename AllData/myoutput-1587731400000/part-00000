It was unusual in that it housed both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) and [[internment|civilian internees]]. The camp, which operated from March 1942 until the liberation of the camp in September 1945, was housed in buildings that were originally [[British Indian Army]] barracks. The original area was extended by the Japanese, until it covered about 50 acres (20 hectares).<ref>Firkins 115</ref> The camp population fluctuated, due to movement of prisoners between camps in Borneo, and as a result of the deaths of the prisoners. It had a maximum population of some 3,000 prisoners.<ref name=\"Keith 76\">Keith 76</ref>\n\nLife in the camp was harsh, with POWs and internees alike forced to endure [[famine|food shortage]]s, disease and sickness for which scant medicine was made available, [[unfree labour|forced labour]], brutal treatment, and lack of adequate clothing and living quarters. Of the approximately 2,000 British POWs held there, over two-thirds died during or as a result of their captivity.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 636\">Ooi 1998, 636</ref> The construction and operation of a secret radio for over 2\u00bd years, from February 1943 until the liberation of the camp, was a morale booster and allowed the prisoners to follow the progress of the war. Discovery would have resulted in certain death for those involved.\n\nFollowing the unconditional [[surrender of Japan]] on 15 August 1945, the camp was liberated on 11 September 1945 by the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]]. On liberation, the camp population was 2,024, of whom 1,392 were POWs, 395 were male civilian internees and 237 were civilian women and children. Amongst official Japanese papers found at the camp following its liberation were two \"death orders\". Both described the proposed method of [[execution]] of every POW and internee in the camp. The first order, scheduled for enactment on 17 or 18 August, was not carried out; the second was scheduled to take place on 15 September. The timely liberation of the camp may have prevented the murder of over 2,000 men, women and children.\n\nIn July 1948, a teachers' training college moved to the site, where it continues to this day, the oldest such establishment in Malaysia.\n\n==Location and organisation==\nKuching lies some {{convert|35|km|mi}} up the [[Sarawak River]] from the sea;<ref>Keith 75</ref> the camp was situated some {{convert|5|km|mi}} to the southeast of Kuching.<ref>Ooi 1998, 8</ref>\n\nThe barracks were built by the Sarawak Government in early 1941, when Britain, in agreement with the Rajah of Sarawak, sent the 2nd Battalion, [[Punjab Regiment (India)|15th Punjab Regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]] (2/15th Punjab Regiment) to defend Sarawak in case of attack by the Japanese. The camp, known from its inception as Batu Lintang, was near completion for occupation by May 1941.<ref>Kirby 1969, Appendix 30; Lim 1995, 19; Lim 2005, 34</ref>\n\nThe Japanese first [[Battle of Borneo (1941-42)|invaded the island of Borneo]] in mid December 1941, landing on the west coast near [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]];<ref>Ooi 1998, 6\u20137</ref> invasion was completed by 23 January 1942 when they landed at [[Balikpapan]] on the east coast.<ref>Wigmore 179</ref>\n\nThe first Allied prisoners held in the camp were about 340 British and Indian soldiers who were interned there in mid-March 1942. In time, it held both Allied POWs and Allied civilian internees. Local Sarawakians including [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] were not interned in the camp, although some were imprisoned in Kuching gaol.<ref>Three Chinese men from North Borneo, all staff at the Chinese Consulate at Sandakan, and their families were held in the camp: Mr Huan Lai Cho (the Chinese Consul), his wife and two children; Mr Ting Yuan Li and his wife and child, and Mr Philip Yang; a total of eight Chinese people interned in the camp.</ref>   Allied civilian prisoners came almost exclusively from different territories on Borneo: from [[North Borneo]] (now Sabah), from [[Brunei]], from the [[Straits Settlements]] island of [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]], and from [[Sarawak]], all of which were under British control, and from Dutch Borneo (now [[Kalimantan]]).  In contrast, the POWs were brought to Batu Lintang from places such as mainland Malaya and Java as well as from Borneo. Many spent time at transit or temporary camps, such as the one at [[Berhala Island, Sabah|Berhala Island, North Borneo]], prior to their transfer to Batu Lintang.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 286\">Ooi 1998, 286</ref> The camp officially opened on 15 August 1942, at which time a commemoration stone was erected at the camp.<ref>Keith 180; Australian War Memorial (AWM) photograph 120332</ref>\n\n[[File:Awm116924.jpg|thumb|left|The camp commander, Lt.-Col.

Suga killed himself five days later.]]\n\nThe camp commandant was Lieutenant-Colonel (Lt.-Col.) [[Tatsuji Suga]]. Suga was the commandant of all [[prisoner-of-war camp|POW]] and internees\u2019 camps in Borneo; there were [[List of Japanese POW camps during World War II|others]] at [[Jesselton]] (later Kota Kinabalu), [[Sandakan]] and briefly on [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]] island<ref>Wigmore 595 note 9</ref> and also at [[Tarakan, East Kalimantan|Tarakan]], [[Banjarmasin]] and [[Kandangan]]; Suga was often absent from Batu Lintang as a result. His second-in-command was Lieutenant (later Captain) Nagata; some sources say Negata or Nekata. Most of the camp guards were [[Koreans]], with a few [[Taiwanese people|Formosans]] (Taiwanese).<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 286\"/> There was a range of administrative buildings, quartermaster\u2019s stores, guard houses, guards\u2019 quarters and a camp hospital. Throughout its operation, all the camps at Batu Lintang, including the internee ones, were conducted under prisoner-of-war rules.<ref name=\"Keith 83\">Keith 83</ref>\n\nThe entire camp was surrounded by a {{convert|8|km|mi}} perimeter barbed wire fence. The internees were segregated into categories and assigned separate compounds, each of which was also surrounded by barbed wire fencing. There were 8\u201310 compounds,<ref name=\"Kirby 1969, Appendix 30\">Kirby 1969, Appendix 30</ref> although their make-up varied through the period of operation of the camp.<ref>At the beginning the British officers shared with the British Other Ranks, but were later separated into two compounds; at one point the Indonesian soldiers and the Dutch officers were sharing a compound, whilst at another they were in separate compounds; the Indian POWs were kept in different locations over the period of the operation of the camp. (Ooi 1998, 139, 317)</ref> The make-up was determined by the arrival and departure of different groups of prisoners as Batu Lintang camp was also used as a transit camp: at one point some of the [[Australia]]n and British soldiers who were later to die on the [[Sandakan Death Marches]] were held at the camp.<ref>Ooi 1998, 320\u20131, 384\u20135; Wigmore 596</ref> Contact between the inhabitants of the different compounds was forbidden and transgressors were severely punished.\n\nThe main groups of POWs were British [[officer (military)|officer]]s, Australian officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs), [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) officers, British [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]], British Indian Army (2nd/15th Punjab Regiment) personnel, [[Netherlands East Indies]] (Indonesian) KNIL soldiers. The British and Australian personnel had mostly been sent from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]], after [[Battle of Singapore|the Allied surrender there]], whereas the KNIL soldiers and the Punjab Regiment had [[Battle of Borneo (1941-42)|defended Borneo]]. The civilian internees were mostly Dutch [[Holy Orders|Roman Catholic priest]]s, British civilians (including children), and British and Dutch Catholic [[nun]]s.\n\nEach compound had its own \"camp master\" (or \"camp mistress\", in the case of the women's compound). The camp master was responsible for liaising between the internees and the Japanese authorities. Each compound contained a number of long barrack buildings, usually {{convert|25|-|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, each of which housed 30\u2013100 people. A barrack master was appointed for each building. The camp and barrack masters were appointed by Colonel Suga.\n\nIn addition, the Dutch other ranks and about 50 British soldiers were stationed in a separate compound at the Kampong Batu Tujoh airfield (also known as Bukit Stabah), near Kuching.<ref>Ooi 1998, 317, 399\u2013400</ref>\n\nThe camp included areas that had once been a [[rubber tree]] plantation, and some of the trees remained inside the compounds, providing a limited amount of shade.\n\n==Compounds==\n[[File:Awm118640.jpg|thumb|right|One of the barracks in the Australian officers' camp. This building housed about 60 officers.]]\n\nLiving conditions within the compounds were cramped. Each person was allotted a very small space within a barrack building within which to sleep, keep the few personal possessions they had with them, and also to eat, as there was no communal area within the barracks.\n\n;British officers and NCOs: This was described as \"''perhaps the most commodious''\" compound, with a fair amount of workable land.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 317\">Ooi 1998, 317</ref> At first the officers were with the British other ranks, but they were separated out into this compound on 5 February 1943. Including the three huts, the compound was 2\u00bd&nbsp;acres (1&nbsp;ha) in area with 1\u00bd&nbsp;acres (0.6&nbsp;ha) of cultivable land. The Officer in Charge and overall British Military Authority was Lt.-Col. M. C. Russell, until his death on 5 June 1943; Lt.-Col T. C. Whimster took over the role thereafter. The compound held 134 men in September 1944.<ref>Ooi 1998, 351</ref>\n\n;Australian officers and NCOs: On liberation, 178 Australian officers and NCOs were held at Batu Lintang,<ref>Kirby 1969 Appendix 30; ''pace'' Wigmore (1957) 599 who gives the figure as 169 (149 officers and 20 other ranks)</ref> in a compound which was without sufficient land for cultivation.

Walsh.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 317\"/> The Australian other ranks were held in a camp at [[Sandakan]].\n\n;Dutch officers and NCOs: This was without sufficient land for cultivation. The Officer in Charge was Lt.-Col. Mars.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 317\"/>\n\n;British other ranks: British soldiers were \"''kept in grossly over-crowded barracks, with inadequate kitchen, lighting, water and sanitary services.''\" They had no land for cultivation.<ref>Lim 2005, 266\u20137</ref> Initially the compound held 1,500 POWs, with additional soldiers arriving thereafter taking the total to around 2,000, but by the end of the war the figure had been reduced to about 750. The Officer in Charge was [[Regimental Sergeant Major|RSM]] (later 2nd Lt) S. T. Sunderland.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 317\"/>\n\n;British Indian Army other ranks: Soldiers from 2nd/15th Punjab Regiment were interned at Batu Lintang.

E. Morris mistakenly states that Tuxford's wife was in the camp. She was a native woman and so was not interned. Julie was interned with Tuxford's mother and his sister (ie with her grandmother and aunt).</ref> other sources state that Dutch boys over the age of ten were sent to the men's compound rather than being placed with the women, as the Japanese considered them men at that age. The total number of male children held in the men's camp is uncertain.\n\n;Female civilian internees (including nuns) and children: This compound was located at the western part of the camp, slightly removed from the other compounds. The internees were mostly Dutch and British, with a few Eurasian and Chinese women, and four American women, including [[Agnes Newton Keith]]. Their quarters were described by an internee as \"''new and fair''\" and \"''they had a reason[able] area for cultivation.''\" The camp mistress was initially Mother Bernardine, an English Roman Catholic nun, but when she became ill Mrs. Dorie Adams, wife of the master of the men\u2019s camp, took over the role.<ref>Keith 79\u201380</ref> The women were housed in five very small barracks<ref name=\"Keith 76\"/> and each person was allotted a space of 6 feet by 4 feet (1.8m by 1.2m) in which to live and store his or her possessions.<ref>Ooi 1998, 321</ref> A chapel was constructed at one end of one of the huts.<ref>Ooi 1998, 327</ref>\n\n:In March 1944, the women\u2019s compound comprised 280 people: 160 nuns, 85 secular women and 34 children.<ref>Keith 76, 146</ref> By September 1944 the population had declined to 271;<ref>Ooi 1998, 327, 331</ref> at liberation there were 237 women and children in the compound.<ref name=\"Long 563\">Long 563</ref> Of the nuns, the large majority were Dutch Roman Catholic sisters, with a few English sisters. Initially there were 29 children in the compound, but by April 1943 there were 34.

Food shortages, diseases and sickness, death, [[unfree labour|forced labor]], harsh treatment, and deplorable living quarters were daily occurrences in camp.''\"<ref>Ooi 1998, 287</ref> The civilian internees were treated less harshly than the POWs; of those POWs, the other ranks were subjected to far worse treatment than the officers.<ref>Ooi 1998, 288</ref>\n\n===Work===\n[[File:Notes issued by the Japanese Government during the occupation of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei, used in Batu Lintang camp, Sarawak (1942\u20131945, obverse).jpg|thumb|right|\"Banana money\", the currency introduced by the Japanese administration in the areas of Borneo that had previously been under British control. Denominations shown: 5 cents, 10 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, 10 dollars]]\n\nThe male civilian internees' regulations (prepared by the internees themselves) stated that \"''Any persons who are not performing some useful work in war-time are failing in their moral obligation. Internees should therefore do their best to do such work as ... agriculture, farming, and stock-breeding, in order to increase the supply of foodstuffs to the camp.''\"<ref>Ooi 1998, 309</ref>  Some male civilian internees chose to cultivate land around their compound in order to become self-supporting; however, the other work imposed on them meant that they never cultivated the land to its full effect. Some refused to carry out this work, even though it was for the common good.<ref>Ooi 1998, 313</ref> Work included wood-gathering parties, latrine duties, working as cookhouse staff and medical orderlies.<ref>Ooi 1998, 349, 386</ref> Sundays were a rest day, but these were later cut to one in every three weeks.<ref>Ooi 1998, 373</ref>\n\nPOWs and male civilian internees were forced to work as stevedores and in timber yards at Kuching harbour on the [[Sarawak River]]<ref name=\"Kirby 1969, Appendix 30\"/> and from October 1942, on the extension of the two runways at the Batu Tujoh landing ground to the south of Kuching, where a small sub-camp was constructed.<ref>Ooi 1998, 363, 403\u20135</ref> Another sub-camp was made at Dahan, where the Japanese re-opened an old [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] mine, and used POWs to construct access roads. Such work was prohibited by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|1907 Hague Convention]], to which Japan was a signatory. Although it was against international law to force the prisoners to work on projects with a military objective, they were informed that refusal to work on these projects would result in their execution.<ref>Ooi 1998, 288, 298, 312</ref>  Other forced labour included refuelling the [[A6M Zero|Zero fighters]] that used the runways; however, this happened only once as the men [[sabotage]]d the operation by adding urine and water to the fuel.<ref>Ooi 1998, 412\u20133</ref>\n\nThe work party men were paid in what the prisoners called \"camp dollars\", the printed paper currency introduced by the Japanese administration. This currency was known colloquially as \"banana money\" because of the banana trees pictured on the 10 dollar notes.<ref>Keith 171</ref>  At one point the rate was 25 cents a day for officers and NCOs and 10 cents a day for other ranks.<ref>Ooi 1998, 365</ref> As time went on, the working parties became smaller, as there was a lack of available men due to sickness and death.\n\nThe women were at first allowed to undertake domestic tasks around their compound; later they were forced to undertake work for the Japanese such as mending uniforms, for which they were also paid in camp dollars.<ref>Ooi 1998, 324</ref> In the later part of the war, when the food shortages had become critical, all internees, male and female, were also used as agricultural labourers on the land around the camp, to produce food for their Japanese captors.<ref>Evans 1999, 90; Ooi 1998, 288</ref> The prisoners referred to themselves as \"white [[coolies]]\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 368\">Ooi 1998, 368</ref>\n\nOnly 30 men were fit enough to attend the final work parties in 1945; the rest were either too ill, or already dead.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 636\"/>\n\n===Food===\n[[File:AwmOG3516.jpg|thumb|left|After liberation, ex-POWs throw away the pig trough in which the daily ration of boiled rice for 1200 men was served. The ration only half filled the trough, and was mixed with sweet potato tops.]]\n\nRations were always meagre but decreased in both quantity and quality as the war progressed. The women and children drew the same rations as the men. The Japanese controlled all food supplies, releasing only what was needed for the day.<ref>Ooi 1998, 329, 359</ref> At the beginning, the rations comprised rice and local vegetables (such as ''[[Ipomoea aquatica|kangkung]]''), with every 10 days or so some pork (such as offal, or a head, or some poor-meat bearing part of the animal). The daily rice ration in late 1943 was 11 ounces (312&nbsp;grams) a day;<ref>Ooi 1998, 350</ref> by the end of the war the rice ration was about 4 ounces (113&nbsp;grams) per man daily.<ref>Walker 648</ref> In September 1944, children were recorded as receiving {{convert|50|ml|floz}} of milk a day.<ref>Ooi 1998, 327\u20138</ref>\n\nA [[black market]] emerged in which the main merchants were a Dutch-Indonesian couple, who obtained goods from a Japanese guard and sold them for a profit to those with cash or tradable goods.<ref>Firkins 118</ref>\n\nAt the times of greatest hardship the internees were so hungry that they were reduced to eating snakes, rubber nuts (which were believed to be poisonous), snails and frogs, and rats, cats and dogs if they could be caught.<ref>Ooi 1998, 352, 353, 408</ref> On special occasions an extra ration would be introduced. In the British POW compounds 58 chickens were provided for 1,000 men for Christmas 1942;<ref>Ooi 1998, 369</ref> the next Christmas the women received a single turkey to share between 271 women and children.<ref>Ooi 1998, 331</ref> At Christmas 1944, their last in captivity, the internees received a single egg each.<ref>Ooi 1998, 352</ref>\n\nOnly one [[Red Cross]] supply of parcels was received by the prisoners between March 1942 and September 1945. This arrived in March 1944 and worked out at one sixth of a parcel per person: a single tin of food.<ref>Keith 146-7</ref> Prisoners occasionally were able to buy or barter chicks which they raised on worms and beetles and rice sweepings from the quartermaster's store floor (other edible food scraps being too precious to use).<ref>Ooi 1998, 388</ref> If female these provided much-needed eggs.\n\n===Health===\nA camp hospital was set up and run by a Japanese medical officer, Dr. Yamamoto. The prisoners believed that his policy was \"''live and let die''\",<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 366\">Ooi 1998, 366</ref> and the hospital became \"''a filthy germ-ridden death hole''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 317\"/> Lionel E. Morris, a sapper with the British Army [[Royal Engineers]], wrote that Yamamoto \"''never attended to ... sick or diseased men''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 380\">Ooi 1998, 380</ref> Yamamoto issued an order that no rations were to be issued to men in the hospital. The prisoners pooled their food and the sick were provided for even though it meant all others went short.<ref>Ooi 1998, 441</ref> Care of all prisoners was left to the camp doctors, such as Colonel King and Captain Bailey in the POWs' compounds and Dr. Gibson in the women\u2019s compound.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 380\"/>\n\n[[File:Awm118565.jpg|thumb|right|The camp hospital and mortuary. In the right foreground is a stack of coffins. These had hinged bottoms for re-use.]]\n\nThe hospital comprised three huts in January 1943 and housed both POWs and civilians. The standard of accommodation was very low and crowded, and facilities were virtually non-existent. A hut was later built for tuberculosis patients.<ref>Walker 646-7</ref> In early September 1945 the camp hospital comprised about 30 beds under the care of Lt.-Col. E. M. Sheppard.<ref name=\"Long 563\"/>\n\nLittle medicine was available to the internees from the Japanese: they provided small amounts of quinine and aspirins. Morris recounts how Yamamoto would quite often beat sick men until they fell down, especially if they approached him for drugs.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 380\"/> Few Red Cross supplies were available and most medication was bought or bartered from the outside world or from the guards themselves. No anaesthesia was available for operations.<ref>Ooi 1998, 390</ref> The main source of medical supplies in early 1943 was a pro-Allied [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] family who lived nearby and were assisting in the provision of materials for the construction of a radio.<ref>Ooi 1998, 462\u2013465</ref>\n\n====Disease====\nThe mortality rate amongst the British soldiers was extremely high: \u2154 of the population of POWs died in the camp.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 636\"/> It was suggested that this high rate was because most had come direct from Europe and were not acclimatised and had no idea about the importance of tropical hygiene. [[Tropical ulcers]]\u2014which are often [[diphtheria]] appearing as a secondary infection of a skin disease\u2014were a common medical complaint, along with [[dysentery]], [[malaria]], [[beri-beri]], [[dengue]], [[scabies]], and septic bites and sores. 600 men out of 1000 were unfit for work in January 1943 owing to beri beri and skin conditions.<ref>Walker 646</ref> Deaths from dysentery increased towards the end of the period of captivity. A British NCO, E. R. Pepler, commented that \"''[m]en wasted away from their normal weight of over ten stone [140 ''lb''/64 ''kg''] to three or four stones [42\u201356 ''lb''/19-25 ''kg''] ... As the time passed on to 1945, the deaths in our camp [from dysentery] were taking place at two or three every day''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 389</ref>\n\n====Malnutrition====\n[[File:Awm120404.jpg|thumb|left|Captain Anderson, a severely emaciated British officer, in Kuching Civil Hospital five days after his liberation from Batu Lintang camp. With him is Major [[A. M. Hutson]], an Australian medical officer.]]\n\nMalnutrition caused most of the invalidity and was a major factor in the high mortality rate in the camp, ascribed as the chief cause of death in 600 deaths in the camp. It was considered by the relieving forces that the Japanese were pursuing a policy of deliberate starvation.<ref>In a letter dated 14 September 1945, an Australian officer with the liberating force described the conditions in the camp, and stated that \"Judging by the quantity of food available in Kuching when the Relief Force arrived and by the adequate supplies which were then in stock in the Japanese storehouses, it is considered that the PW food ration could easily have been maintained at a level which would have kept the PW alive and reasonably healthy. However, a policy of slow starvation was carried out instead.\" National Archives WO 325/52</ref> The basic diet only contained 1.5 ounces (44&nbsp;grams) of protein and had a calorific value of 1600.<ref>Walker 646, 648</ref> J.

Noakes, a male civilian internee wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"''In common with many others I experienced the pain of food deficiency disease and by May 1944 it was difficult to work and nights were a torture. My eyes failed rapidly and it became impossible to read or to distinguish objects clearly. The death rate for the whole camp jumped at an alarming rate and we began to realise that we must now begin a real fight for existence.''\"<ref>Ooi 1998, 318</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy November 1944 the suffering caused by malnutrition was profound, as recorded by Hilda E. Bates, a female civilian internee who was a nurse based in Jesselton prior to the war:\n\n<blockquote>\"''We are having a particularly hungry period and [I] can quite truthfully say that our mouths water, and that we 'slaver' as dogs do before meals. Some of us find it advisable to rise slowly after lying down, as due to malnutrition, any rapid movement is apt to cause dizziness or even a black-out ... one morning recently I awoke and discovered to my horror that my sight had become very dim. Later I realised this was due to vitamin deficiency in our poor diet.''\"<ref>Ooi 1998, 332</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the end of their third year of internment, most women suffered from [[amenorrhoea]] due to malnutrition.<ref name=\"Keith 83\"/>\n\nIn May 1945 Hilda Bates met some of the male civilian internees at the funeral of a friend: <blockquote>\"''I was horrified to see their condition. Some had formerly been strong men of twelve to fourteen stone ''[168\u2013196 lb/76-89 kg]'' in weight, but were now reduced to mere shadows of themselves, and weighed less than eight stone ''[112 lb/51 kg]''. .. [In] the soldiers camp ... many of the men were just skeletons, \u2014 crawling about, as few were able to stand upright. Even our toddlers received the same rations as these poor [souls], and the children are still hungry, so what must have been the suffering of those men, many of whom are hardly more than boys?''\"<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 337\">Ooi 1998, 337</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 30 August 1945, after Suga had officially informed the prisoners of the Japanese surrender but before the liberation of the camp, Hilda Bates visited the sick POWs:\n\n<blockquote>\"''I was horrified to see the condition of some of the men. I was pretty well hardened to sickness, dirt and disease, but never had I seen anything like this in all my years of nursing. Pictures of hospitals during the [[Crimean War]] showed terrible conditions, but even those could not compare with the dreadful sights I met on this visit. Shells of men lay on the floor sunken-eyed and helpless; some were swollen with hunger, [[oedema]] and ber-beri, others in the last stages of dysentery, lay unconscious and dying. They had no pillows or clothes, few cups, fewer bowls, or even medical supplies. [...] There were three hundred desperately sick men, many unable to help themselves, or to carry food to their mouths. Throughout our internment, we women had begged to be allowed to nurse the soldiers, but the Japanese refused our offer, saying this would be indecent''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 625</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn his release, L. E. Morris, who was one of the \"healthy\" prisoners, weighed five stone, three pounds ({{convert|73|lb|kg|abbr=on}}).<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 636\"/>\n\n====Brutality====\nBrutality by the guards was another factor that damaged the health of many of the prisoners. Hilda Bates described the guards' treatment of the male prisoners: \"''Their favourite methods of punishment are either kicking below the waist with their heavy army boots, face slapping or striking the head with a rifle butt''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 337\"/> Failure to bow properly to a guard was a common cause of a beating. Hilda Bates wrote of \"''One male internee [who] was paralysed for a week following Japanese brutality, simply because he had not made his bow in what the Japs considered a proper manner''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 338</ref> E. R. Pepler recorded that \"''a favourite punishment was to make the offender stand in the blazing sun with his arms above his head holding a log of wood. If the prisoner or his arms sagged, he was punched or kicked. This treatment usually lasted until the prisoner completely collapsed''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 391\">Ooi 1998, 391</ref>\n\nPrisoners suspected of more serious misdemeanours were taken by the Japanese military police, the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', for interrogation at the former Sarawak Police headquarters in Kuching. [[Torture]] was a common method of extracting information.<ref>Ooi 1998, 422\u2013437, 452</ref>\n\nAfter the Japanese defeat, an Australian war crimes investigation team worked in Kuching from the liberation until January 1946. Of around 120 guards, more than 70 had a crime or crimes ascribed to them.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 667\">Ooi 1998, 667</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Awm118637.jpg|thumb|right|Private J. M. Curry, who was cook at the Australian Officers' camp, wearing the loincloth issued to him by the Japanese, his sole clothing issue in two years.]]\n\nClothing wore out quickly: the tropical climate meant that clothes had to be washed every day, and the rigours of labouring in them meant that they soon became torn, worn and threadbare. An enterprising male internee, J. R. Baxter, entered the camp with two pairs of shorts; as they wore out he constructed a new pair from them by glueing together the constituent parts with [[latex]] from the rubber trees growing in the camp.<ref>Evans 1999, 90</ref> The Japanese did not provide replacement clothing for the prisoners when their clothes wore out.<ref>Ooi 1998, 393\u20134</ref> After a period male internees and POWs were issued with a loincloth and perishable rubber shoes, which soon degraded and meant in effect that most prisoners went barefoot.<ref>Ooi 1998, 376</ref> The women fared a little better, often bartering possessions for material: clothes were fashioned out of whatever material was to hand, such as sheets and breakfast cloths.<ref>Ooi 1998, 328</ref>  Many of the women kept their best clothes unworn in readiness for their expected eventual liberation, while their other clothes became more and more shabby.\n\nPrior to their liberation, supplies were dropped by the Australians. Hilda Bates recorded: \"''The soldiers received shorts, shoes, and blankets with instructions not to appear naked in future!''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 624\">Ooi 1998, 624</ref>\n\n===Purchasing, bartering and smuggling===\nPrisoners were able to buy a small range of provisions from their captors at Japanese prices, which escalated as the war went on.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 315\">Ooi 1998, 315</ref> [[Black market]]eering was sometimes tolerated by the guards, as they themselves were involved in the buying or exchanging of goods, and at other times punished severely. Although contact with the outside world was forbidden, there were plenty of opportunities to communicate with the locals. Firewood-gathering gangs in the jungle were able to make contact and arrange purchases when the guards were not paying attention;<ref>Ooi 1998, 314</ref> at other times these transactions were permitted with the permission of and in the presence of a lenient Japanese guard.<ref>Ooi 1998, 360, 392</ref> Gold, in the form of rings and jewellery, and British [[Pound sterling|pounds]] were in demand by the Japanese guards. Such was the desperation of the prisoners towards the end of their [[internment]] that two soldiers disinterred a recently buried body in order to retrieve the dead man's wedding ring.<ref>Ooi 1998, 522\u2013524</ref>\n\nSmuggling became an integral part of camp life, and despite frequent searches, foodstuffs in particular were smuggled into the camp (for example, dried fish was nailed to the underside of wooden bins, and the inside of a hat was a favourite hiding place).<ref>Ooi 1998, 395</ref>  Occasional dangerous night-time forays to outside the camp netted foodstuffs such as a chicken or eggs or fruit.<ref>Ooi 1998, 357</ref>\n\nThe Japanese currency (the \"camp dollars\") was used by the prisoners illicitly to purchase supplies from the locals.<ref>Ooi 1998, 392</ref>\n\n===Social life===\n[[File:Batu lintang postcards.jpg|thumb|left|Postcards sent home to England by a civilian internee couple, 5 May 1943]]\n\nLe Gros Clark, as men's camp master, issued regular official bulletins to his compound regarding meetings with Suga and other Japanese officers.<ref name=\"Firkins 119\">Firkins 119</ref> Communication between the various compounds and with the outside world was forbidden. Married male internees were refused permission to see their wives and children on [[Christmas Day]], 1943.<ref name=\"Firkins 119\"/> Occasional, irregular meetings were allowed between married couples.\n\nPre-printed postcards to be sent home with stock phrases such as \"I am well\" and \"We have plenty of food\" were issued occasionally;<ref>Ooi 1998, 418</ref> Agnes Keith records that these were issued three times a year but in May 1945 it was decided that a certain percentage of the camp had to include a [[propaganda]] sentence in addition to the 25 permitted words of free text. She wrote:<blockquote>\"''I decided that [the sentences] were all so obvious that my people would know they were propaganda. I sent the following card:''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"''Seven communications sent. Seven received. Health moderate. George'' [Keith's son] ''well, energetic, roughneck, reminds me my brother. Fed-up with war. Hopes deferred. Borneo is a beautiful place for living, a dreamland where the scenery is beautiful, little birds sing, very delicious fruits grow, we are very happy here. Agnes, Harry,'' [Keith's husband] ''George''\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"''My aunt told me later that she had never felt as downhearted about my fate as when she received that card. She said that obviously I had lost my mind.''\"</blockquote>\n\nSacks of undelivered mail both to and from the prisoners were discovered in the camp on liberation.<ref>Keith 175-6</ref>\n\n[[Bee (gathering)|Working bee]]s were held at Christmas time to make gifts for the children: worn-out clothing was cut up and sleeves, collars, and hems were cut from clothing still in use to provide materials for soft toys.<ref>Firkins 118\u2013119</ref> More robust toys, such as scooters, carts, swords, and guns were made from materials such as barbed wire and the wood of rubber trees in and around the compounds. The nuns provided food and gifts for each child. The Japanese officers also gave sweets and biscuits to the children at Christmas. A concert was organised for Christmas 1942, as well as inter-compound games;<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 315\"/> another less lavish Christmas concert took place in 1943, and a concert party was briefly established before disbanding due to the illness and death of its members.<ref>Ooi 1998, 373, 393</ref>\n\nLt. [[Frank Bell (educator)|Frank \"Tinker\" Bell]] was largely responsible for conceiving and organising what became known by the prisoners as the \"Kuching University\". This operated in the British officers' compound. Under Japanese regulations prisoners were forbidden to teach, to learn, to compile or possess notes on any subject whatever, or to meet in groups for discussion. The penalty for disobedience was imprisonment or death. Despite this the university, led by Bell, established classes in seven modern languages, as well as subjects as diverse as history, public speaking, navigation, pig-farming, civics and poultry keeping. Bell and his fellow educators organised courses, compiled text books, led classes, and awarded diplomas.<ref>Bell 1991; Ooi 1998, 349, 369</ref> Classes were often held in the evenings when dusk or darkness gave some protection against surprise by their captors. Paper for writing exercises and for compiling textbooks was always at a premium: books were fashioned out of paper from soap wrappers, newspaper, the backs of letters and envelopes, and cigarette paper. These were bound into books and often covered with sarong material.\n\nOther informal clubs, mainly comprising discussion groups, were established in the other compounds. They covered topics such as chess and draughts (checkers), book-keeping, sailing, and French conversation lessons. A central library for all the camp was run from the British Officers' compound, with books donated by the internees and some from the civilian library in Kuching town.<ref>Bell, 62;Ooi 1998, 349</ref>\n\n==Cemetery==\n[[File:Awm116974.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the cemetery at Batu Lintang camp.]]\n\nInitially the dead were buried in the cemetery at Kuching. The high death rate meant that this was soon filled, however, and in November 1942 a new cemetery area was created next to the camp at an area to the south-east known as \"Boot Hill\". The cemetery was within sight of the camp.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 366\"/> At first the dead were buried in coffins, but soon the number of fatalities and the shortage of timber meant that shrouds made from rice sacks or blankets were used instead.  The bodies were carried to the grave in a wooden coffin with a hinged bottom, which allowed re-use.<ref>Ooi 1998, 335, 367, 389, AWM photographs 118566 and 118567</ref>\n\nHilda Bates wrote in June 1945: \"''I am horrified at the increased number of graves in the burial ground. Deaths are now so frequent, that a party of grave diggers is now permanently employed, and given extra rations in order that they will have the strength to dig''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 339</ref>\n\nAfter liberation the bodies were exhumed from the cemetery and sent to Labuan for reburial in a central military cemetery there. A large number of the graves of prisoners from Batu Lintang now at Labuan are unidentified: after the Japanese surrender Suga destroyed many camp records. The cemetery in Labuan is cared for by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].\n\n==The radio (the \"Old Lady\") and generator (\"Ginnie\")==\nInformation on the outside world was gathered from a variety of sources, such as from co-workers of the Batu Lintang work parties at Kuching docks.<ref>Ooi 1998, 363</ref> An invaluable boost to the prisoners' morale was provided by a secret radio, from which they were able to learn about the progress of the war.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 391\"/> This had been constructed from scavenged and bartered parts. A generator was later constructed to power the radio.\n\nThe construction of the radio was ordered by Russell. He and some 1150 other POWs had arrived at Batu Lintang on 13 October 1942 from [[Tanjung Priok]] camp in [[Java]], where a small group of men had worked on constructing a radio.<ref>Ooi 1998, 314, 439</ref> His proposal was initially met with a distinct lack of enthusiasm, as discovery would result in certain death. One of these men was G. W. Pringle, a member of the British military police. He wrote \"Do these madmen ever seriously consider these idiotic plans before putting men's lives in danger?\"<ref>Ooi 1998, 439\u2013440</ref>\n\n[[File:AwmOG3526.jpg|thumb|left|Leonard Beckett with the radio (the \"Old Lady\") and the generator (\"Ginnie\")]]\n\nIt was known that [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] people in Sarawak were pro-Allied, and so contact was made with the Ongs, the leading Chinese family in Kuching, who lived about a mile from the camp, to see if they could assist in providing parts.<ref>Ooi 1998, 440; {{cite web|title=Mrs Harris and Ginnie |publisher=AII POW-MIA InterNetwork |url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter25/in240705ginnie.html |accessdate=2007-04-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103132156/http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter25/in240705ginnie.html |archivedate=2006-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first night-time attempt, by G. W. Pringle, was a failure as he could not find his way through the dense jungle to the house. A reconnoitre mission was required. To achieve this, Russell suggested to Dr Yamamoto that as the area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes (with the resultant risk of malaria, which would affect Japanese and prisoner alike), the jungle should be cleared and sprayed. Pringle took part on this working party and was able to plot his route. He subsequently made contact and Ong Tiang Swee, [[Kapitan China]] of Sarawak and the patriarch of the Ong family, agreed to help. Ong instructed his grandson, Kee Hui to help Pringle obtain the needed parts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs Harris and Ginnie |publisher=AII POW-MIA InterNetwork |url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter25/in240705ginnie.html |accessdate=2007-04-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103132156/http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter25/in240705ginnie.html |archivedate=2006-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This was at massive risk to the family's own safety as they too would have been executed if discovered. Their only condition was that they should be provided with the news gathered from the radio, in order to boost the morale of the Chinese community under occupation in Kuching. They provided some radio parts, the acquisition of which must have been a considerable task as all radio equipment had been confiscated by the Japanese.<ref>Ooi 1998, 442\u2013454</ref>\n\nThe radio was built and operated in the British other ranks' compound. The maker of the radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by a core group of three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and a soldering iron. In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]] motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.<ref>Ooi 1998, 358, 441, 457, 516\u20137 and 549</ref>\n\nThe radio was concealed during its construction in a large stewing-pot; once completed its hiding place was in a biscuit tin buried under the bakehouse fire in the British other ranks' compound.<ref>Ooi 1998, 395, 457, 517, 522</ref> It was operated in the stores where it had a temporary hiding place in a false-bottomed table.<ref>Ooi 1998, 396</ref> Elaborate security proceedings to protect the radio were put in place, including a network of look-outs.<ref>Ooi 1998, 397, 457</ref>\n\nThe radio at first ran off torch batteries: these soon ran out and so Beckett constructed a power unit to run off the camp electricity supply.<ref>Ooi 1998, 517, 549</ref> Access to the camp powerhouse was gained by one of the POWs who had been a professional [[cat burglar]] before the war.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 368\"/>\n\nThe radio was first used on the night of 24 February 1943, as radio reception was better in the evening. Some of the news was bewildering to the prisoners: \"''Who is this [[Bernard Montgomery|General Montgomery]]? He seems to be the man we ought to have had in charge from the very beginning. A real live wire''\", wrote Pringle.<ref>Ooi 1998, 460\u20131, 517</ref>\n\nThe existence of the radio, referred to by many code-names but chiefly as the \"Old Lady\" and \"Mrs Harris\",<ref>Ooi 1998, 627; Keith 182</ref> was to be a closely guarded secret, for fear of alerting the Japanese to its existence through loose talk. The commanding officers of the camp and those who had constructed and operated it were known as the \"Board of Directors\", and were the only ones who knew the precise contents of the radio news received.<ref>Ooi 1998, 570</ref> A way of disseminating information was organised: it was arranged for rumours to be spread which contained a considerable amount of truth.<ref>Ooi 1998, 458</ref> Le Gros Clark, the head of the male internees, directed the dissemination of news amongst the male internees;<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 549\">Ooi 1998, 549</ref>  it was decided not to provide information to the women's compound. News was also passed to the Chinese once a week, carried through the jungle by Pringle. On the first exchange, without being asked, the Chinese thoughtfully provided medical supplies; thereafter they regularly provided much-needed medicines, money, and vegetable seeds.<ref>Ooi 1998, 461\u2013464</ref> The leaked news rumours had the desired effect and a more cheerful atmosphere was noted in the camp.<ref>Ooi 1998, 463</ref> The women's compound somehow learned of the existence of the radio and the camp mistress, Dorie Adams, asked that they should be provided with news; to counter worries about security she suggested that the Roman Catholic priest who celebrated mass with the R.C. nuns should deliver the news as part of his service, which was always given in Latin.<ref>Ooi 1998, 471\u20132</ref>\n\nIn early March 1943 the provision of electric power for the lighting in the internees' compounds was halted.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 549\"/> This was a serious blow as the radio was run off the power supply. Batteries were unavailable and so the only solution, again the idea of Russell, was to construct a generator. His idea again met with some initial scepticism: \"Now I know he has gone mad\", wrote Pringle.<ref>Ooi 1998, 494</ref> Pringle\u2019s colleagues were more enthusiastic. Beckett was sure he could build the generator and British [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|RAOC]] personnel were certain they could supply the necessary components, though they thought it would take three months to make the tools needed.<ref>Ooi 1998, 1998, 495</ref> To disguise the noise of the work the enterprise was described as a \"watch repairing factory\" to the Japanese, who offered the use of various tools and other equipment.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 498\">Ooi 1998, 498</ref> In March 1943, after the execution of some prisoners at the Sandakan POW camp for operating a radio, the Japanese stepped up their searches at Batu Lintang.<ref>Ooi 1998, 398</ref> Many items essential for the construction of the generator such as magnets, wire, and scrap iron were not easily available, but the involvement of \"Freddie\", one of the prisoners who was a self-confessed thief (and most likely the same man who sorted the power supply: records are unclear) meant that material and equipment was soon obtained.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 498\"/>\n\n[[File:Awm116951.jpg|thumb|right|Leonard Beckett showing the radio to Brigadier T. C. Eastick and A. W. Walsh on 11 September 1945]]\n\nThe generator needed to turn at 3,000 revolutions a minute, and so the fittest of the men involved in its construction was chosen to turn the wheel. He was given extra food rations to prepare him for the task.<ref>Ooi 1998, 504</ref> The first trial of the generator was a success, and again, Pringle recorded how news reports told of unknown figures: \"''Events appeared to have been moving with unseemly haste during our enforced breaks from the news broadcasts. [We] listened to names we had never heard of. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]]? [[Joseph Stilwell|General Stilwell]]?''\" The assembling and disassembling drill took less than thirty seconds, with both the \"Old Lady\" and \"Ginnie\" stowed in their hiding places in the hut which was occupied by cookhouse staff during the day.\n\nIn June 1944, Le Gros Clark was taken from the camp by the ''kempeitai'' for questioning. On his return the same day, he was considerably shaken and recommended that the radio should be destroyed. This message was relayed to the camp master of the British other ranks' compound by Whimster, who was the senior British officer. Beckett and his colleagues were informed of this order, but were left to decide themselves what course of action to take. Realising its importance in keeping up camp morale, they decided to keep the radio, saying that \"''we might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb''\", according to Pepler.<ref>Ooi 1998, 398, 549, 553</ref> Steps to safeguard the civilian internees were undertaken by cutting off news to their compounds.<ref>As a result some of the male internees instigated the smuggling-in of a newspaper, previously available in the camp but banned since August 1943. They were caught, and although opposed to the activity, Le Gros Clark was implicated. Nine men were tried and sentenced to between six months' and six years' imprisonment. Le Gros Clark was amongst the five men of the nine at the trial who were murdered by the Japanese at [[Keningau]] aerodrome some time in June or July 1945 (Ooi 1998, 549\u2013560)</ref>\n\nThat same month the prisoners received news of the [[invasion of Normandy]]. Pringle recorded how, once again, the news brought unfamiliar names to the prisoners' attention: \"'''Blood and Guts [[George S. Patton|Patton]]'. Now there is a name for a General! ... Somehow though, we feel that with a General bearing the name of 'Blood and Guts' there is little danger of the Germans dislodging his army''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 507\u20138</ref> It was clear that such important news would have a great effect in the camp; at the same time, the rejoicing it would bring would undoubtedly alert the Japanese. It was therefore decided to provide a hint to the other prisoners, rather than the full information. This was again delivered by a priest, this time by the padre officiating at one of the numerous funeral services. He quoted [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] chapter 15, verses 9 and 10, which refer to pursuing, overtaking and destroying the enemy, and the sea. News of the bombing of London by [[V-2]] rockets was withheld.<ref>Ooi 1998, 509\u2013512</ref>\n\nThe news of the [[V-E Day|German capitulation]] on 7 May 1945 was similarly cryptically relayed at a funeral by the padre. This time the verse was [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] chapter 3, verse 8, concerning the deliverance of the Israelites from the Egyptians to the land of milk and honey; extra piquancy was added by the fact that Suga was present at this service.<ref>Ooi 1998, 513\u20134</ref>\n\n==End of the war for Batu Lintang==\nIn the Allied plans for the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]], the responsibility for re-taking the island of Borneo was entrusted to Australian forces. Prior to the Australian landings, strategic bombing and reconnaissance missions were undertaken by the [[RAAF]] and [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]. The first Allied planes, 15 USAAF [[P-38 Lightning|Lockheed Lightnings]] were seen over the camp on the morning of 25 March 1945, as they flew on a mission to bomb the Batu Tujoh landing ground.<ref>Ooi 1998, 335, 353, 604; Keith 170</ref> Raids continued sporadically over the next few weeks. A lone [[B-17 Flying Fortress|Flying Fortress]] regularly attacked targets in Kuching.<ref>Ooi 1998, 604</ref>\n\nThe [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]] was launched on 1 May 1945, with a brigade of the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|landing at Tarakan]], on the eastern coast of Dutch Borneo. The American armed forces provided naval and air support to assist the landings, and in some cases the Australians were assisted by the advance landings of the [[Services Reconnaissance Department]] (SRD) and their local allies.<ref>Ooi 1998, 9, 569\u2013570</ref> This was followed by [[Operation Oboe Six|landings in Brunei and Labuan]] on 10 June.<ref>Long 459</ref> In early July, a raid was made by [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] aircraft on oil and petrol dumps near to the camp.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 606\">Ooi 1998, 606</ref> Liberation still seemed a remote prospect, however: \"''As the weeks dragged by, the lone planes of the Allies were a daily occurrence and as we had realised very early that they could do nothing to help us, we hardly took any notice of them''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 606\"/>\n\nThe [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] in Japan at [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945 followed by that of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] on 9 August precipitated the abrupt end of the war. On 15 August 1945, Japan announced its official [[Surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender]] to the Allied Powers. The POWs learned of the surrender early in the morning of 15 August, in a broadcast by Radio Chungking received by the secret radio.<ref>Ooi 1998, 607\u20138, 614\u20136. The official surrender broadcast, a pre-recorded speech by [[Emperor Hirohito]], the [[Imperial Rescript on Surrender]], was made at noon on 15 August. However, the Japanese Suzuki government had indicated the surrender on August 14, by notifying the Allied forces that it accepted the [[Potsdam Agreement]].

Celebratory meals were prepared, with precious supplies and livestock used up. The Japanese guards were unaware of their country's surrender, and as the day coincided with an official camp holiday, marking the opening of the camp on 15 August three years previously, they were satisfied that the celebrations were related to the break from the working parties.<ref>Ooi 1998, 607</ref> The women learned shortly afterwards, when the married women had their scheduled meeting with their husbands.<ref>Ooi 1998, 622</ref>\n\n[[File:AwmP00987.006.jpg|thumb|left|Prisoners waving to the RAAF [[Beaufighter]] aircraft which flew over to drop leaflets announcing Japan\u2019s surrender]]\n\nUnder [[General Order \u2116 1|General Order No. 1]], issued on 16 August by [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]], as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the Japanese were required to provide information on the location of all camps and were responsible for the safety of prisoners and internees, for providing them with adequate food, shelter, clothes and medical care until their care could pass to the Allied powers, and for handing over each store together with its equipment, stores, arms and ammunition and records to the senior Allied officer in each camp. Since it was known that in many areas prisoners and internees were suffering from starvation and neglect, it was of the first importance that they were contacted and recovered as soon as possible.<ref>Kirby 1969, 246</ref>\n\nDespite the surrender, the Japanese would remain in control of the camp until 11 September. During this period, there were no work parties and the prisoners did not suffer any beatings.<ref>Ooi 1998, 610, 616</ref> \"It became apparent during the next few days that the Japanese soldiers knew something had happened but were not sure what it was\", wrote Pepler.<ref>Ooi 1998, 608.

Signed by Major-General [[George Wootten]], General Officer Commanding, 9th Division, they informed the prisoners of the surrender of Japan, and stated \"''I know that you will realise that on account of your location, it will be difficult to get aid to you immediately, but you can rest assured that we will do everything within our power to release and care for you as soon as possible''\".<ref>Keith 182</ref>\n\nOn 24 August, Suga officially announced to the camp that Japan had surrendered.<ref>Bell 113; Ooi 1998, 618; Keith 182. Although sources vary, the most likely date appears to be 24 August</ref> On 29 August letters were dropped on the camp, instructing the Japanese commander to make contact with the Australian commanders. The letter contained a code of panel signals which enabled Suga to indicate that he agreed to the dropping of supplies for the prisoners and that he would meet Australian representatives later.<ref>Bell 115-6; ''pace'' Long 562</ref> These panels were placed on the roof of one of the buildings and can be seen in the photograph at the start of the article (above).\n\n[[File:Awm115437.jpg|thumb|right|Preparing to drop a storpedo into the camp, 30 August 1945. \"''On the six foot torpedo was printed the word BREAD ...

A female internee, Hilda Bates, wrote: \"''At 11.30 a.m. today a sea-plane dropped twenty parachutes with packages attached. One fell outside our hut and was labelled 'bread'. Others contained flour, tinned rabbit, and other meat. The goods were collected by the Japs under the supervision of Australian Officers who distributed them to the groups of internees.

The next day, Brigadier [[Thomas Eastick]], commander of Kuching Force\u2014a detachment from the 9th Division\u2014flew to the mouth of the Sarawak River in a [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]] where three Japanese officers, including Suga, came aboard for talks.<ref name=\"Long 563\"/> The task of Kuching Force was to accept the surrender of and impound the Japanese forces in the Kuching area, release and evacuate Allied prisoners and internees, and establish military control.<ref>Long 562-3; AWM photographs OG3454 and OG3455</ref> At the meeting, Suga presented Eastick with complete nominal rolls of all compounds in the camp.<ref>Firkins 133</ref>\n\nOn 7 September, Walsh was permitted by the Japanese to fly to the headquarters of the 9th Division on Labuan island, to collect surgical and medical supplies for the camp. He returned with two Australian medical officers, Major A. W. M. Hutson and Lt.-Col. N. H. Morgan.<ref>Long 563; AWM photograph 115799</ref> Pepler recorded how \"''Dr Yamamoto came in for one hell of a time from these two Medical Officers when they saw the state of the majority of our camp.

Out of the two thousand of us who entered that camp, only seven hundred and fifty survived and of these well over six hundred were chronic sick''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 609\u2013610</ref>\n\n===Death orders===\nImmediately prior to the surrender of Japan, rumours abounded in the camp that the Japanese intended to execute all the prisoners rather than allow them to be freed by the approaching Allied forces;<ref>Ooi 1998, 611\u2013614</ref> when Dr Yamamoto informed some prisoners that they were to be moved to a new camp they naturally feared the worst, especially when he promised the unlikely idyll of a camp \"''equipped with the best medical equipment obtainable ... there would be no working parties and food would be plentiful ... the sick men would be especially well cared for''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 612\u2013614.

The orders were not carried out, presumably as a result of the unconditional surrender of Japan on 15 August. A \"death march\", similar to those at [[Sandakan Death Marches|Sandakan]] and elsewhere, was to have been undertaken by those male prisoners physically able to undertake it; other prisoners were to be executed by various methods in the camp:\n\n*'''1''' All POWs and male internees to be marched to a camp at milestone 21 and [[bayonet]]ed there\n*'''2''' All sick unable to walk to be treated similarly in the Square at Kuching [in the square at the camp rather than in Kuching town]\n*'''3''' All women and children to be burnt in their barracks<ref>Ooi 1998, 628</ref>\n\nRevised orders for the execution on 15 September 1945 of all the internees were also found, this time in the Administration Office at Batu Lintang:\n\n*'''Group 1''' Women internees, children and nuns \u2013 to be given poisoned rice\n*'''Group 2''' Internee men and Catholic Fathers to be shot and burnt\n*'''Group 3''' POWs to be marched into the jungle, shot and burnt\n*'''Group 4''' Sick and weak left at Batu Lintang main camp to be bayoneted and the entire camp to be destroyed by fire<ref>Ooi 1998, 648; Keith 183, 206</ref>\n\nThe camp was liberated on 11 September 1945, four days before the revised proposed execution date of over 2,000 men, women and children.\n\n==Liberation of the camp==\n[[File:Awm116933.jpg|thumb|left|Eastick addressing part of the parade at the surrender ceremony at the camp, 11 September 1945]]\n\nOn 8\u20139 September, the [[Royal Australian Navy]] corvette {{HMAS|Kapunda||6}}, with Eastick and staff officers on board, sailed for Kuching, along with {{USS|Doyle C.

At 14:35 on 11 September, Eastick accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces in the Kuching area from their commander, Major-General [[Hiyoe Yamamura]], on board HMAS ''Kapunda''.<ref>Long 563; AWM photographs 041062-041071, 116168-116175</ref> Later that day the Australian occupying force landed.<ref name=\"Long 563\"/>\n\nThe 9th Division troops arrived at Batu Lintang camp that afternoon, accompanied by a few American naval officers.<ref>Ooi 1998, 626</ref> There was no resistance from the Japanese troops. The prisoners and internees had been forewarned that there would be no delay in taking the surrender, and quickly gathered at 17:00 in the main square of the camp to witness Eastick accept the sword of Suga.<ref>Ooi 1998, 619, 626</ref> The Japanese finally learned of the existence of the radio in a dramatic fashion:\n\n<blockquote>\"''The Australian Commander, Major General'' [sic] ''Eastick ... mounted the rostrum and after accepting the sword of surrender from Suga was about to dismiss him when a shout, rising simultaneously from the throats of the Board of Directors of the 'Old Lady' and 'Ginnie' stopped the proceedings. 'Hold on, we have something to show you.' Carrying the radio and generator Len [Beckett] proudly showed them to the General and turning to Suga, asked, 'Well, what do you think about it Suga?' Now I know the full meaning of the saying 'If looks could kill.' Len would have died a horrible death''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 620; quotation from the papers of G. W. Pringle</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe following day, Suga, together with Captain Nagata and Dr Yamamoto, were flown to the Australian base on Labuan, to await their trials as [[war criminals]]. Suga committed suicide there on 16 September. Nagata and Yamamoto were later tried, found guilty and executed.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 667\"/>\n\nPhotographers and cameramen accompanied the liberating force, and the events, and those of the following days, were well-documented.<ref>Ooi 1998, 610, 627</ref> On liberation, the camp contained 2,024 inmates: 1,392 prisoners (including 882 British, 178 Australian and 45 Indian); and 632 internees.<ref>Long 562; Kirby 1969, Appendix 30</ref> The most ill prisoners were taken to Kuching Civil Hospital, which had been entirely refitted by the Australians since serving as the Japanese military hospital.<ref>Ooi 1998, 620, 628</ref>\n\nOn 12 September, a thanksgiving service was held in the camp, led by two Australian chaplains from the liberating force and Bishop [[Francis Hollis|Francis S.

Ex-prisoners were transported by ship (including ''[[MS Wanganella|Wanganella]]'', an Australian hospital ship) and in eight Douglas Dakotas and two Catalinas, to the 9th Division's \"Released Prisoners of War and Internees Reception Camp\", and the 2/1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station (CCS) on Labuan, before continuing their journeys homeward.<ref>Long 563; Wigmore 634</ref>\n\nThe captured Japanese soldiers were then held at Batu Lintang camp. There they were visited by J. B. Archer, an ex-internee, who noted \"There were about eight thousand of them ... it was difficult not to feel aggrieved at the good treatment they were receiving compared to what we had received at their hands. A lunch of fried rice, fish, vegetable and dried fruit was shown to me. This, I was told, was just an ordinary sample.\"<ref>Archer 1997,56</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nBy June\u2013July 1946, the bodies in the cemetery at Batu Lintang had been exhumed and reburied in the military cemetery on Labuan island.<ref>Ooi 1998, 672</ref> In 1947, a grant was approved for the establishment of a teachers' training college on the site. It exists as such to the present day, the oldest in Malaysia. Of the numerous huts that had housed the prisoners, only 21 were considered fit for use in 1947; after refurbishment the college moved in July 1948 from its temporary home in Kuching to the site at Batu Lintang.<ref>Lim 1995, 81,98</ref> The huts have gradually been replaced over the years, although a few remnants of the site's former life remain. These include a single hut (albeit with a galvanised roof rather than the attap (palm leaf) one of the war), the old gate posts, the gate bunker and stump of the Japanese flag pole. There is also a small museum on the site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sandakan ANZAC Tour 2002|publisher=COFEPOW|url=http://www.cofepow.org.uk/pages/stories_sandakan_anzac.htm|accessdate=2007-03-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408115804/http://www.cofepow.org.uk/pages/stories_sandakan_anzac.htm|archivedate=8 April 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''[[Three Came Home]]'', an account of female internee [[Agnes Newton Keith]]'s time in the camp, was published in 1947.

It was unusual in that it housed both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) and [[internment|civilian internees]]. The camp, which operated from March 1942 until the liberation of the camp in September 1945, was housed in buildings that were originally [[British Indian Army]] barracks. The original area was extended by the Japanese, until it covered about 50 acres (20 hectares).<ref>Firkins 115</ref> The camp population fluctuated, due to movement of prisoners between camps in Borneo, and as a result of the deaths of the prisoners. It had a maximum population of some 3,000 prisoners.<ref name=\"Keith 76\">Keith 76</ref>\n\nLife in the camp was harsh, with POWs and internees alike forced to endure [[famine|food shortage]]s, disease and sickness for which scant medicine was made available, [[unfree labour|forced labour]], brutal treatment, and lack of adequate clothing and living quarters. Of the approximately 2,000 British POWs held there, over two-thirds died during or as a result of their captivity.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 636\">Ooi 1998, 636</ref> The construction and operation of a secret radio for over 2\u00bd years, from February 1943 until the liberation of the camp, was a morale booster and allowed the prisoners to follow the progress of the war. Discovery would have resulted in certain death for those involved.\n\nFollowing the unconditional [[surrender of Japan]] on 15 August 1945, the camp was liberated on 11 September 1945 by the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]]. On liberation, the camp population was 2,024, of whom 1,392 were POWs, 395 were male civilian internees and 237 were civilian women and children. Amongst official Japanese papers found at the camp following its liberation were two \"death orders\". Both described the proposed method of [[execution]] of every POW and internee in the camp. The first order, scheduled for enactment on 17 or 18 August, was not carried out; the second was scheduled to take place on 15 September. The timely liberation of the camp may have prevented the murder of over 2,000 men, women and children.\n\nIn July 1948, a teachers' training college moved to the site, where it continues to this day, the oldest such establishment in Malaysia.\n\n==Location and organisation==\nKuching lies some {{convert|35|km|mi}} up the [[Sarawak River]] from the sea;<ref>Keith 75</ref> the camp was situated some {{convert|5|km|mi}} to the southeast of Kuching.<ref>Ooi 1998, 8</ref>\n\nThe barracks were built by the Sarawak Government in early 1941, when Britain, in agreement with the Rajah of Sarawak, sent the 2nd Battalion, [[Punjab Regiment (India)|15th Punjab Regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]] (2/15th Punjab Regiment) to defend Sarawak in case of attack by the Japanese. The camp, known from its inception as Batu Lintang, was near completion for occupation by May 1941.<ref>Kirby 1969, Appendix 30; Lim 1995, 19; Lim 2005, 34</ref>\n\nThe Japanese first [[Battle of Borneo (1941-42)|invaded the island of Borneo]] in mid December 1941, landing on the west coast near [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]];<ref>Ooi 1998, 6\u20137</ref> invasion was completed by 23 January 1942 when they landed at [[Balikpapan]] on the east coast.<ref>Wigmore 179</ref>\n\nThe first Allied prisoners held in the camp were about 340 British and Indian soldiers who were interned there in mid-March 1942. In time, it held both Allied POWs and Allied civilian internees. Local Sarawakians including [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] were not interned in the camp, although some were imprisoned in Kuching gaol.<ref>Three Chinese men from North Borneo, all staff at the Chinese Consulate at Sandakan, and their families were held in the camp: Mr Huan Lai Cho (the Chinese Consul), his wife and two children; Mr Ting Yuan Li and his wife and child, and Mr Philip Yang; a total of eight Chinese people interned in the camp.</ref>   Allied civilian prisoners came almost exclusively from different territories on Borneo: from [[North Borneo]] (now Sabah), from [[Brunei]], from the [[Straits Settlements]] island of [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]], and from [[Sarawak]], all of which were under British control, and from Dutch Borneo (now [[Kalimantan]]).  In contrast, the POWs were brought to Batu Lintang from places such as mainland Malaya and Java as well as from Borneo. Many spent time at transit or temporary camps, such as the one at [[Berhala Island, Sabah|Berhala Island, North Borneo]], prior to their transfer to Batu Lintang.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 286\">Ooi 1998, 286</ref> The camp officially opened on 15 August 1942, at which time a commemoration stone was erected at the camp.<ref>Keith 180; Australian War Memorial (AWM) photograph 120332</ref>\n\n[[File:Awm116924.jpg|thumb|left|The camp commander, Lt.-Col.

Suga killed himself five days later.]]\n\nThe camp commandant was Lieutenant-Colonel (Lt.-Col.) [[Tatsuji Suga]]. Suga was the commandant of all [[prisoner-of-war camp|POW]] and internees\u2019 camps in Borneo; there were [[List of Japanese POW camps during World War II|others]] at [[Jesselton]] (later Kota Kinabalu), [[Sandakan]] and briefly on [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]] island<ref>Wigmore 595 note 9</ref> and also at [[Tarakan, East Kalimantan|Tarakan]], [[Banjarmasin]] and [[Kandangan]]; Suga was often absent from Batu Lintang as a result. His second-in-command was Lieutenant (later Captain) Nagata; some sources say Negata or Nekata. Most of the camp guards were [[Koreans]], with a few [[Taiwanese people|Formosans]] (Taiwanese).<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 286\"/> There was a range of administrative buildings, quartermaster\u2019s stores, guard houses, guards\u2019 quarters and a camp hospital. Throughout its operation, all the camps at Batu Lintang, including the internee ones, were conducted under prisoner-of-war rules.<ref name=\"Keith 83\">Keith 83</ref>\n\nThe entire camp was surrounded by a {{convert|8|km|mi}} perimeter barbed wire fence. The internees were segregated into categories and assigned separate compounds, each of which was also surrounded by barbed wire fencing. There were 8\u201310 compounds,<ref name=\"Kirby 1969, Appendix 30\">Kirby 1969, Appendix 30</ref> although their make-up varied through the period of operation of the camp.<ref>At the beginning the British officers shared with the British Other Ranks, but were later separated into two compounds; at one point the Indonesian soldiers and the Dutch officers were sharing a compound, whilst at another they were in separate compounds; the Indian POWs were kept in different locations over the period of the operation of the camp. (Ooi 1998, 139, 317)</ref> The make-up was determined by the arrival and departure of different groups of prisoners as Batu Lintang camp was also used as a transit camp: at one point some of the [[Australia]]n and British soldiers who were later to die on the [[Sandakan Death Marches]] were held at the camp.<ref>Ooi 1998, 320\u20131, 384\u20135; Wigmore 596</ref> Contact between the inhabitants of the different compounds was forbidden and transgressors were severely punished.\n\nThe main groups of POWs were British [[officer (military)|officer]]s, Australian officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs), [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) officers, British [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]], British Indian Army (2nd/15th Punjab Regiment) personnel, [[Netherlands East Indies]] (Indonesian) KNIL soldiers. The British and Australian personnel had mostly been sent from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]], after [[Battle of Singapore|the Allied surrender there]], whereas the KNIL soldiers and the Punjab Regiment had [[Battle of Borneo (1941-42)|defended Borneo]]. The civilian internees were mostly Dutch [[Holy Orders|Roman Catholic priest]]s, British civilians (including children), and British and Dutch Catholic [[nun]]s.\n\nEach compound had its own \"camp master\" (or \"camp mistress\", in the case of the women's compound). The camp master was responsible for liaising between the internees and the Japanese authorities. Each compound contained a number of long barrack buildings, usually {{convert|25|-|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, each of which housed 30\u2013100 people. A barrack master was appointed for each building. The camp and barrack masters were appointed by Colonel Suga.\n\nIn addition, the Dutch other ranks and about 50 British soldiers were stationed in a separate compound at the Kampong Batu Tujoh airfield (also known as Bukit Stabah), near Kuching.<ref>Ooi 1998, 317, 399\u2013400</ref>\n\nThe camp included areas that had once been a [[rubber tree]] plantation, and some of the trees remained inside the compounds, providing a limited amount of shade.\n\n==Compounds==\n[[File:Awm118640.jpg|thumb|right|One of the barracks in the Australian officers' camp. This building housed about 60 officers.]]\n\nLiving conditions within the compounds were cramped. Each person was allotted a very small space within a barrack building within which to sleep, keep the few personal possessions they had with them, and also to eat, as there was no communal area within the barracks.\n\n;British officers and NCOs: This was described as \"''perhaps the most commodious''\" compound, with a fair amount of workable land.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 317\">Ooi 1998, 317</ref> At first the officers were with the British other ranks, but they were separated out into this compound on 5 February 1943. Including the three huts, the compound was 2\u00bd&nbsp;acres (1&nbsp;ha) in area with 1\u00bd&nbsp;acres (0.6&nbsp;ha) of cultivable land. The Officer in Charge and overall British Military Authority was Lt.-Col. M. C. Russell, until his death on 5 June 1943; Lt.-Col T. C. Whimster took over the role thereafter.

The total number of male children held in the men's camp is uncertain.\n\n;Female civilian internees (including nuns) and children: This compound was located at the western part of the camp, slightly removed from the other compounds. The internees were mostly Dutch and British, with a few Eurasian and Chinese women, and four American women, including [[Agnes Newton Keith]]. Their quarters were described by an internee as \"''new and fair''\" and \"''they had a reason[able] area for cultivation.''\" The camp mistress was initially Mother Bernardine, an English Roman Catholic nun, but when she became ill Mrs. Dorie Adams, wife of the master of the men\u2019s camp, took over the role.<ref>Keith 79\u201380</ref> The women were housed in five very small barracks<ref name=\"Keith 76\"/> and each person was allotted a space of 6 feet by 4 feet (1.8m by 1.2m) in which to live and store his or her possessions.<ref>Ooi 1998, 321</ref> A chapel was constructed at one end of one of the huts.<ref>Ooi 1998, 327</ref>\n\n:In March 1944, the women\u2019s compound comprised 280 people: 160 nuns, 85 secular women and 34 children.<ref>Keith 76, 146</ref> By September 1944 the population had declined to 271;<ref>Ooi 1998, 327, 331</ref> at liberation there were 237 women and children in the compound.<ref name=\"Long 563\">Long 563</ref> Of the nuns, the large majority were Dutch Roman Catholic sisters, with a few English sisters.

Some refused to carry out this work, even though it was for the common good.<ref>Ooi 1998, 313</ref> Work included wood-gathering parties, latrine duties, working as cookhouse staff and medical orderlies.<ref>Ooi 1998, 349, 386</ref> Sundays were a rest day, but these were later cut to one in every three weeks.<ref>Ooi 1998, 373</ref>\n\nPOWs and male civilian internees were forced to work as stevedores and in timber yards at Kuching harbour on the [[Sarawak River]]<ref name=\"Kirby 1969, Appendix 30\"/> and from October 1942, on the extension of the two runways at the Batu Tujoh landing ground to the south of Kuching, where a small sub-camp was constructed.<ref>Ooi 1998, 363, 403\u20135</ref> Another sub-camp was made at Dahan, where the Japanese re-opened an old [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] mine, and used POWs to construct access roads. Such work was prohibited by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|1907 Hague Convention]], to which Japan was a signatory. Although it was against international law to force the prisoners to work on projects with a military objective, they were informed that refusal to work on these projects would result in their execution.<ref>Ooi 1998, 288, 298, 312</ref>  Other forced labour included refuelling the [[A6M Zero|Zero fighters]] that used the runways; however, this happened only once as the men [[sabotage]]d the operation by adding urine and water to the fuel.<ref>Ooi 1998, 412\u20133</ref>\n\nThe work party men were paid in what the prisoners called \"camp dollars\", the printed paper currency introduced by the Japanese administration. This currency was known colloquially as \"banana money\" because of the banana trees pictured on the 10 dollar notes.<ref>Keith 171</ref>  At one point the rate was 25 cents a day for officers and NCOs and 10 cents a day for other ranks.<ref>Ooi 1998, 365</ref> As time went on, the working parties became smaller, as there was a lack of available men due to sickness and death.\n\nThe women were at first allowed to undertake domestic tasks around their compound; later they were forced to undertake work for the Japanese such as mending uniforms, for which they were also paid in camp dollars.<ref>Ooi 1998, 324</ref> In the later part of the war, when the food shortages had become critical, all internees, male and female, were also used as agricultural labourers on the land around the camp, to produce food for their Japanese captors.<ref>Evans 1999, 90; Ooi 1998, 288</ref> The prisoners referred to themselves as \"white [[coolies]]\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 368\">Ooi 1998, 368</ref>\n\nOnly 30 men were fit enough to attend the final work parties in 1945; the rest were either too ill, or already dead.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 636\"/>\n\n===Food===\n[[File:AwmOG3516.jpg|thumb|left|After liberation, ex-POWs throw away the pig trough in which the daily ration of boiled rice for 1200 men was served. The ration only half filled the trough, and was mixed with sweet potato tops.]]\n\nRations were always meagre but decreased in both quantity and quality as the war progressed. The women and children drew the same rations as the men. The Japanese controlled all food supplies, releasing only what was needed for the day.<ref>Ooi 1998, 329, 359</ref> At the beginning, the rations comprised rice and local vegetables (such as ''[[Ipomoea aquatica|kangkung]]''), with every 10 days or so some pork (such as offal, or a head, or some poor-meat bearing part of the animal). The daily rice ration in late 1943 was 11 ounces (312&nbsp;grams) a day;<ref>Ooi 1998, 350</ref> by the end of the war the rice ration was about 4 ounces (113&nbsp;grams) per man daily.<ref>Walker 648</ref> In September 1944, children were recorded as receiving {{convert|50|ml|floz}} of milk a day.<ref>Ooi 1998, 327\u20138</ref>\n\nA [[black market]] emerged in which the main merchants were a Dutch-Indonesian couple, who obtained goods from a Japanese guard and sold them for a profit to those with cash or tradable goods.<ref>Firkins 118</ref>\n\nAt the times of greatest hardship the internees were so hungry that they were reduced to eating snakes, rubber nuts (which were believed to be poisonous), snails and frogs, and rats, cats and dogs if they could be caught.<ref>Ooi 1998, 352, 353, 408</ref> On special occasions an extra ration would be introduced. In the British POW compounds 58 chickens were provided for 1,000 men for Christmas 1942;<ref>Ooi 1998, 369</ref> the next Christmas the women received a single turkey to share between 271 women and children.<ref>Ooi 1998, 331</ref> At Christmas 1944, their last in captivity, the internees received a single egg each.<ref>Ooi 1998, 352</ref>\n\nOnly one [[Red Cross]] supply of parcels was received by the prisoners between March 1942 and September 1945. This arrived in March 1944 and worked out at one sixth of a parcel per person: a single tin of food.<ref>Keith 146-7</ref> Prisoners occasionally were able to buy or barter chicks which they raised on worms and beetles and rice sweepings from the quartermaster's store floor (other edible food scraps being too precious to use).<ref>Ooi 1998, 388</ref> If female these provided much-needed eggs.\n\n===Health===\nA camp hospital was set up and run by a Japanese medical officer, Dr. Yamamoto. The prisoners believed that his policy was \"''live and let die''\",<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 366\">Ooi 1998, 366</ref> and the hospital became \"''a filthy germ-ridden death hole''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 317\"/> Lionel E. Morris, a sapper with the British Army [[Royal Engineers]], wrote that Yamamoto \"''never attended to ... sick or diseased men''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 380\">Ooi 1998, 380</ref> Yamamoto issued an order that no rations were to be issued to men in the hospital. The prisoners pooled their food and the sick were provided for even though it meant all others went short.<ref>Ooi 1998, 441</ref> Care of all prisoners was left to the camp doctors, such as Colonel King and Captain Bailey in the POWs' compounds and Dr. Gibson in the women\u2019s compound.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 380\"/>\n\n[[File:Awm118565.jpg|thumb|right|The camp hospital and mortuary. In the right foreground is a stack of coffins. These had hinged bottoms for re-use.]]\n\nThe hospital comprised three huts in January 1943 and housed both POWs and civilians. The standard of accommodation was very low and crowded, and facilities were virtually non-existent. A hut was later built for tuberculosis patients.<ref>Walker 646-7</ref> In early September 1945 the camp hospital comprised about 30 beds under the care of Lt.-Col. E. M. Sheppard.<ref name=\"Long 563\"/>\n\nLittle medicine was available to the internees from the Japanese: they provided small amounts of quinine and aspirins. Morris recounts how Yamamoto would quite often beat sick men until they fell down, especially if they approached him for drugs.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 380\"/> Few Red Cross supplies were available and most medication was bought or bartered from the outside world or from the guards themselves. No anaesthesia was available for operations.<ref>Ooi 1998, 390</ref> The main source of medical supplies in early 1943 was a pro-Allied [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] family who lived nearby and were assisting in the provision of materials for the construction of a radio.<ref>Ooi 1998, 462\u2013465</ref>\n\n====Disease====\nThe mortality rate amongst the British soldiers was extremely high: \u2154 of the population of POWs died in the camp.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 636\"/> It was suggested that this high rate was because most had come direct from Europe and were not acclimatised and had no idea about the importance of tropical hygiene. [[Tropical ulcers]]\u2014which are often [[diphtheria]] appearing as a secondary infection of a skin disease\u2014were a common medical complaint, along with [[dysentery]], [[malaria]], [[beri-beri]], [[dengue]], [[scabies]], and septic bites and sores. 600 men out of 1000 were unfit for work in January 1943 owing to beri beri and skin conditions.<ref>Walker 646</ref> Deaths from dysentery increased towards the end of the period of captivity. A British NCO, E. R. Pepler, commented that \"''[m]en wasted away from their normal weight of over ten stone [140 ''lb''/64 ''kg''] to three or four stones [42\u201356 ''lb''/19-25 ''kg''] ... As the time passed on to 1945, the deaths in our camp [from dysentery] were taking place at two or three every day''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 389</ref>\n\n====Malnutrition====\n[[File:Awm120404.jpg|thumb|left|Captain Anderson, a severely emaciated British officer, in Kuching Civil Hospital five days after his liberation from Batu Lintang camp. With him is Major [[A. M. Hutson]], an Australian medical officer.]]\n\nMalnutrition caused most of the invalidity and was a major factor in the high mortality rate in the camp, ascribed as the chief cause of death in 600 deaths in the camp. It was considered by the relieving forces that the Japanese were pursuing a policy of deliberate starvation.<ref>In a letter dated 14 September 1945, an Australian officer with the liberating force described the conditions in the camp, and stated that \"Judging by the quantity of food available in Kuching when the Relief Force arrived and by the adequate supplies which were then in stock in the Japanese storehouses, it is considered that the PW food ration could easily have been maintained at a level which would have kept the PW alive and reasonably healthy. However, a policy of slow starvation was carried out instead.\" National Archives WO 325/52</ref> The basic diet only contained 1.5 ounces (44&nbsp;grams) of protein and had a calorific value of 1600.<ref>Walker 646, 648</ref> J. L. Noakes, a male civilian internee wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"''In common with many others I experienced the pain of food deficiency disease and by May 1944 it was difficult to work and nights were a torture. My eyes failed rapidly and it became impossible to read or to distinguish objects clearly. The death rate for the whole camp jumped at an alarming rate and we began to realise that we must now begin a real fight for existence.''\"<ref>Ooi 1998, 318</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy November 1944 the suffering caused by malnutrition was profound, as recorded by Hilda E. Bates, a female civilian internee who was a nurse based in Jesselton prior to the war:\n\n<blockquote>\"''We are having a particularly hungry period and [I] can quite truthfully say that our mouths water, and that we 'slaver' as dogs do before meals. Some of us find it advisable to rise slowly after lying down, as due to malnutrition, any rapid movement is apt to cause dizziness or even a black-out ... one morning recently I awoke and discovered to my horror that my sight had become very dim. Later I realised this was due to vitamin deficiency in our poor diet.''\"<ref>Ooi 1998, 332</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the end of their third year of internment, most women suffered from [[amenorrhoea]] due to malnutrition.<ref name=\"Keith 83\"/>\n\nIn May 1945 Hilda Bates met some of the male civilian internees at the funeral of a friend: <blockquote>\"''I was horrified to see their condition. Some had formerly been strong men of twelve to fourteen stone ''[168\u2013196 lb/76-89 kg]'' in weight, but were now reduced to mere shadows of themselves, and weighed less than eight stone ''[112 lb/51 kg]''. .. [In] the soldiers camp ... many of the men were just skeletons, \u2014 crawling about, as few were able to stand upright. Even our toddlers received the same rations as these poor [souls], and the children are still hungry, so what must have been the suffering of those men, many of whom are hardly more than boys?''\"<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 337\">Ooi 1998, 337</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 30 August 1945, after Suga had officially informed the prisoners of the Japanese surrender but before the liberation of the camp, Hilda Bates visited the sick POWs:\n\n<blockquote>\"''I was horrified to see the condition of some of the men. I was pretty well hardened to sickness, dirt and disease, but never had I seen anything like this in all my years of nursing. Pictures of hospitals during the [[Crimean War]] showed terrible conditions, but even those could not compare with the dreadful sights I met on this visit. Shells of men lay on the floor sunken-eyed and helpless; some were swollen with hunger, [[oedema]] and ber-beri, others in the last stages of dysentery, lay unconscious and dying. They had no pillows or clothes, few cups, fewer bowls, or even medical supplies. [...] There were three hundred desperately sick men, many unable to help themselves, or to carry food to their mouths. Throughout our internment, we women had begged to be allowed to nurse the soldiers, but the Japanese refused our offer, saying this would be indecent''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 625</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn his release, L. E. Morris, who was one of the \"healthy\" prisoners, weighed five stone, three pounds ({{convert|73|lb|kg|abbr=on}}).<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 636\"/>\n\n====Brutality====\nBrutality by the guards was another factor that damaged the health of many of the prisoners. Hilda Bates described the guards' treatment of the male prisoners: \"''Their favourite methods of punishment are either kicking below the waist with their heavy army boots, face slapping or striking the head with a rifle butt''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 337\"/> Failure to bow properly to a guard was a common cause of a beating. Hilda Bates wrote of \"''One male internee [who] was paralysed for a week following Japanese brutality, simply because he had not made his bow in what the Japs considered a proper manner''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 338</ref> E. R. Pepler recorded that \"''a favourite punishment was to make the offender stand in the blazing sun with his arms above his head holding a log of wood. If the prisoner or his arms sagged, he was punched or kicked. This treatment usually lasted until the prisoner completely collapsed''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 391\">Ooi 1998, 391</ref>\n\nPrisoners suspected of more serious misdemeanours were taken by the Japanese military police, the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', for interrogation at the former Sarawak Police headquarters in Kuching. [[Torture]] was a common method of extracting information.<ref>Ooi 1998, 422\u2013437, 452</ref>\n\nAfter the Japanese defeat, an Australian war crimes investigation team worked in Kuching from the liberation until January 1946. Of around 120 guards, more than 70 had a crime or crimes ascribed to them.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 667\">Ooi 1998, 667</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Awm118637.jpg|thumb|right|Private J. M. Curry, who was cook at the Australian Officers' camp, wearing the loincloth issued to him by the Japanese, his sole clothing issue in two years.]]\n\nClothing wore out quickly: the tropical climate meant that clothes had to be washed every day, and the rigours of labouring in them meant that they soon became torn, worn and threadbare. An enterprising male internee, J. R. Baxter, entered the camp with two pairs of shorts; as they wore out he constructed a new pair from them by glueing together the constituent parts with [[latex]] from the rubber trees growing in the camp.<ref>Evans 1999, 90</ref> The Japanese did not provide replacement clothing for the prisoners when their clothes wore out.<ref>Ooi 1998, 393\u20134</ref> After a period male internees and POWs were issued with a loincloth and perishable rubber shoes, which soon degraded and meant in effect that most prisoners went barefoot.<ref>Ooi 1998, 376</ref> The women fared a little better, often bartering possessions for material: clothes were fashioned out of whatever material was to hand, such as sheets and breakfast cloths.<ref>Ooi 1998, 328</ref>  Many of the women kept their best clothes unworn in readiness for their expected eventual liberation, while their other clothes became more and more shabby.\n\nPrior to their liberation, supplies were dropped by the Australians. Hilda Bates recorded: \"''The soldiers received shorts, shoes, and blankets with instructions not to appear naked in future!''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 624\">Ooi 1998, 624</ref>\n\n===Purchasing, bartering and smuggling===\nPrisoners were able to buy a small range of provisions from their captors at Japanese prices, which escalated as the war went on.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 315\">Ooi 1998, 315</ref> [[Black market]]eering was sometimes tolerated by the guards, as they themselves were involved in the buying or exchanging of goods, and at other times punished severely. Although contact with the outside world was forbidden, there were plenty of opportunities to communicate with the locals. Firewood-gathering gangs in the jungle were able to make contact and arrange purchases when the guards were not paying attention;<ref>Ooi 1998, 314</ref> at other times these transactions were permitted with the permission of and in the presence of a lenient Japanese guard.<ref>Ooi 1998, 360, 392</ref> Gold, in the form of rings and jewellery, and British [[Pound sterling|pounds]] were in demand by the Japanese guards. Such was the desperation of the prisoners towards the end of their [[internment]] that two soldiers disinterred a recently buried body in order to retrieve the dead man's wedding ring.<ref>Ooi 1998, 522\u2013524</ref>\n\nSmuggling became an integral part of camp life, and despite frequent searches, foodstuffs in particular were smuggled into the camp (for example, dried fish was nailed to the underside of wooden bins, and the inside of a hat was a favourite hiding place).<ref>Ooi 1998, 395</ref>  Occasional dangerous night-time forays to outside the camp netted foodstuffs such as a chicken or eggs or fruit.<ref>Ooi 1998, 357</ref>\n\nThe Japanese currency (the \"camp dollars\") was used by the prisoners illicitly to purchase supplies from the locals.<ref>Ooi 1998, 392</ref>\n\n===Social life===\n[[File:Batu lintang postcards.jpg|thumb|left|Postcards sent home to England by a civilian internee couple, 5 May 1943]]\n\nLe Gros Clark, as men's camp master, issued regular official bulletins to his compound regarding meetings with Suga and other Japanese officers.<ref name=\"Firkins 119\">Firkins 119</ref> Communication between the various compounds and with the outside world was forbidden. Married male internees were refused permission to see their wives and children on [[Christmas Day]], 1943.<ref name=\"Firkins 119\"/> Occasional, irregular meetings were allowed between married couples.\n\nPre-printed postcards to be sent home with stock phrases such as \"I am well\" and \"We have plenty of food\" were issued occasionally;<ref>Ooi 1998, 418</ref> Agnes Keith records that these were issued three times a year but in May 1945 it was decided that a certain percentage of the camp had to include a [[propaganda]] sentence in addition to the 25 permitted words of free text. She wrote:<blockquote>\"''I decided that [the sentences] were all so obvious that my people would know they were propaganda. I sent the following card:''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"''Seven communications sent. Seven received. Health moderate. George'' [Keith's son] ''well, energetic, roughneck, reminds me my brother. Fed-up with war. Hopes deferred. Borneo is a beautiful place for living, a dreamland where the scenery is beautiful, little birds sing, very delicious fruits grow, we are very happy here. Agnes, Harry,'' [Keith's husband] ''George''\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"''My aunt told me later that she had never felt as downhearted about my fate as when she received that card. She said that obviously I had lost my mind.''\"</blockquote>\n\nSacks of undelivered mail both to and from the prisoners were discovered in the camp on liberation.<ref>Keith 175-6</ref>\n\n[[Bee (gathering)|Working bee]]s were held at Christmas time to make gifts for the children: worn-out clothing was cut up and sleeves, collars, and hems were cut from clothing still in use to provide materials for soft toys.<ref>Firkins 118\u2013119</ref> More robust toys, such as scooters, carts, swords, and guns were made from materials such as barbed wire and the wood of rubber trees in and around the compounds. The nuns provided food and gifts for each child. The Japanese officers also gave sweets and biscuits to the children at Christmas. A concert was organised for Christmas 1942, as well as inter-compound games;<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 315\"/> another less lavish Christmas concert took place in 1943, and a concert party was briefly established before disbanding due to the illness and death of its members.<ref>Ooi 1998, 373, 393</ref>\n\nLt. [[Frank Bell (educator)|Frank \"Tinker\" Bell]] was largely responsible for conceiving and organising what became known by the prisoners as the \"Kuching University\". This operated in the British officers' compound. Under Japanese regulations prisoners were forbidden to teach, to learn, to compile or possess notes on any subject whatever, or to meet in groups for discussion. The penalty for disobedience was imprisonment or death. Despite this the university, led by Bell, established classes in seven modern languages, as well as subjects as diverse as history, public speaking, navigation, pig-farming, civics and poultry keeping. Bell and his fellow educators organised courses, compiled text books, led classes, and awarded diplomas.<ref>Bell 1991; Ooi 1998, 349, 369</ref> Classes were often held in the evenings when dusk or darkness gave some protection against surprise by their captors. Paper for writing exercises and for compiling textbooks was always at a premium: books were fashioned out of paper from soap wrappers, newspaper, the backs of letters and envelopes, and cigarette paper. These were bound into books and often covered with sarong material.\n\nOther informal clubs, mainly comprising discussion groups, were established in the other compounds. They covered topics such as chess and draughts (checkers), book-keeping, sailing, and French conversation lessons. A central library for all the camp was run from the British Officers' compound, with books donated by the internees and some from the civilian library in Kuching town.<ref>Bell, 62;Ooi 1998, 349</ref>\n\n==Cemetery==\n[[File:Awm116974.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the cemetery at Batu Lintang camp.]]\n\nInitially the dead were buried in the cemetery at Kuching. The high death rate meant that this was soon filled, however, and in November 1942 a new cemetery area was created next to the camp at an area to the south-east known as \"Boot Hill\". The cemetery was within sight of the camp.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 366\"/> At first the dead were buried in coffins, but soon the number of fatalities and the shortage of timber meant that shrouds made from rice sacks or blankets were used instead.  The bodies were carried to the grave in a wooden coffin with a hinged bottom, which allowed re-use.<ref>Ooi 1998, 335, 367, 389, AWM photographs 118566 and 118567</ref>\n\nHilda Bates wrote in June 1945: \"''I am horrified at the increased number of graves in the burial ground. Deaths are now so frequent, that a party of grave diggers is now permanently employed, and given extra rations in order that they will have the strength to dig''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 339</ref>\n\nAfter liberation the bodies were exhumed from the cemetery and sent to Labuan for reburial in a central military cemetery there. A large number of the graves of prisoners from Batu Lintang now at Labuan are unidentified: after the Japanese surrender Suga destroyed many camp records. The cemetery in Labuan is cared for by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].\n\n==The radio (the \"Old Lady\") and generator (\"Ginnie\")==\nInformation on the outside world was gathered from a variety of sources, such as from co-workers of the Batu Lintang work parties at Kuching docks.<ref>Ooi 1998, 363</ref> An invaluable boost to the prisoners' morale was provided by a secret radio, from which they were able to learn about the progress of the war.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 391\"/> This had been constructed from scavenged and bartered parts. A generator was later constructed to power the radio.\n\nThe construction of the radio was ordered by Russell. He and some 1150 other POWs had arrived at Batu Lintang on 13 October 1942 from [[Tanjung Priok]] camp in [[Java]], where a small group of men had worked on constructing a radio.<ref>Ooi 1998, 314, 439</ref> His proposal was initially met with a distinct lack of enthusiasm, as discovery would result in certain death. One of these men was G. W. Pringle, a member of the British military police. He wrote \"Do these madmen ever seriously consider these idiotic plans before putting men's lives in danger?\"<ref>Ooi 1998, 439\u2013440</ref>\n\n[[File:AwmOG3526.jpg|thumb|left|Leonard Beckett with the radio (the \"Old Lady\") and the generator (\"Ginnie\")]]\n\nIt was known that [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] people in Sarawak were pro-Allied, and so contact was made with the Ongs, the leading Chinese family in Kuching, who lived about a mile from the camp, to see if they could assist in providing parts.<ref>Ooi 1998, 440; {{cite web|title=Mrs Harris and Ginnie |publisher=AII POW-MIA InterNetwork |url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter25/in240705ginnie.html |accessdate=2007-04-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103132156/http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter25/in240705ginnie.html |archivedate=2006-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first night-time attempt, by G. W. Pringle, was a failure as he could not find his way through the dense jungle to the house. A reconnoitre mission was required. To achieve this, Russell suggested to Dr Yamamoto that as the area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes (with the resultant risk of malaria, which would affect Japanese and prisoner alike), the jungle should be cleared and sprayed. Pringle took part on this working party and was able to plot his route. He subsequently made contact and Ong Tiang Swee, [[Kapitan China]] of Sarawak and the patriarch of the Ong family, agreed to help. Ong instructed his grandson, Kee Hui to help Pringle obtain the needed parts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs Harris and Ginnie |publisher=AII POW-MIA InterNetwork |url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter25/in240705ginnie.html |accessdate=2007-04-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103132156/http://www.aiipowmia.com/inter25/in240705ginnie.html |archivedate=2006-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This was at massive risk to the family's own safety as they too would have been executed if discovered. Their only condition was that they should be provided with the news gathered from the radio, in order to boost the morale of the Chinese community under occupation in Kuching. They provided some radio parts, the acquisition of which must have been a considerable task as all radio equipment had been confiscated by the Japanese.<ref>Ooi 1998, 442\u2013454</ref>\n\nThe radio was built and operated in the British other ranks' compound. The maker of the radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by a core group of three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and a soldering iron. In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]] motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.<ref>Ooi 1998, 358, 441, 457, 516\u20137 and 549</ref>\n\nThe radio was concealed during its construction in a large stewing-pot; once completed its hiding place was in a biscuit tin buried under the bakehouse fire in the British other ranks' compound.<ref>Ooi 1998, 395, 457, 517, 522</ref> It was operated in the stores where it had a temporary hiding place in a false-bottomed table.<ref>Ooi 1998, 396</ref> Elaborate security proceedings to protect the radio were put in place, including a network of look-outs.<ref>Ooi 1998, 397, 457</ref>\n\nThe radio at first ran off torch batteries: these soon ran out and so Beckett constructed a power unit to run off the camp electricity supply.<ref>Ooi 1998, 517, 549</ref> Access to the camp powerhouse was gained by one of the POWs who had been a professional [[cat burglar]] before the war.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 368\"/>\n\nThe radio was first used on the night of 24 February 1943, as radio reception was better in the evening. Some of the news was bewildering to the prisoners: \"''Who is this [[Bernard Montgomery|General Montgomery]]? He seems to be the man we ought to have had in charge from the very beginning. A real live wire''\", wrote Pringle.<ref>Ooi 1998, 460\u20131, 517</ref>\n\nThe existence of the radio, referred to by many code-names but chiefly as the \"Old Lady\" and \"Mrs Harris\",<ref>Ooi 1998, 627; Keith 182</ref> was to be a closely guarded secret, for fear of alerting the Japanese to its existence through loose talk. The commanding officers of the camp and those who had constructed and operated it were known as the \"Board of Directors\", and were the only ones who knew the precise contents of the radio news received.<ref>Ooi 1998, 570</ref> A way of disseminating information was organised: it was arranged for rumours to be spread which contained a considerable amount of truth.<ref>Ooi 1998, 458</ref> Le Gros Clark, the head of the male internees, directed the dissemination of news amongst the male internees;<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 549\">Ooi 1998, 549</ref>  it was decided not to provide information to the women's compound. News was also passed to the Chinese once a week, carried through the jungle by Pringle. On the first exchange, without being asked, the Chinese thoughtfully provided medical supplies; thereafter they regularly provided much-needed medicines, money, and vegetable seeds.<ref>Ooi 1998, 461\u2013464</ref> The leaked news rumours had the desired effect and a more cheerful atmosphere was noted in the camp.<ref>Ooi 1998, 463</ref> The women's compound somehow learned of the existence of the radio and the camp mistress, Dorie Adams, asked that they should be provided with news; to counter worries about security she suggested that the Roman Catholic priest who celebrated mass with the R.C. nuns should deliver the news as part of his service, which was always given in Latin.<ref>Ooi 1998, 471\u20132</ref>\n\nIn early March 1943 the provision of electric power for the lighting in the internees' compounds was halted.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 549\"/> This was a serious blow as the radio was run off the power supply. Batteries were unavailable and so the only solution, again the idea of Russell, was to construct a generator. His idea again met with some initial scepticism: \"Now I know he has gone mad\", wrote Pringle.<ref>Ooi 1998, 494</ref> Pringle\u2019s colleagues were more enthusiastic. Beckett was sure he could build the generator and British [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|RAOC]] personnel were certain they could supply the necessary components, though they thought it would take three months to make the tools needed.<ref>Ooi 1998, 1998, 495</ref> To disguise the noise of the work the enterprise was described as a \"watch repairing factory\" to the Japanese, who offered the use of various tools and other equipment.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 498\">Ooi 1998, 498</ref> In March 1943, after the execution of some prisoners at the Sandakan POW camp for operating a radio, the Japanese stepped up their searches at Batu Lintang.<ref>Ooi 1998, 398</ref> Many items essential for the construction of the generator such as magnets, wire, and scrap iron were not easily available, but the involvement of \"Freddie\", one of the prisoners who was a self-confessed thief (and most likely the same man who sorted the power supply: records are unclear) meant that material and equipment was soon obtained.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 498\"/>\n\n[[File:Awm116951.jpg|thumb|right|Leonard Beckett showing the radio to Brigadier T. C. Eastick and A. W. Walsh on 11 September 1945]]\n\nThe generator needed to turn at 3,000 revolutions a minute, and so the fittest of the men involved in its construction was chosen to turn the wheel. He was given extra food rations to prepare him for the task.<ref>Ooi 1998, 504</ref> The first trial of the generator was a success, and again, Pringle recorded how news reports told of unknown figures: \"''Events appeared to have been moving with unseemly haste during our enforced breaks from the news broadcasts. [We] listened to names we had never heard of. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]]? [[Joseph Stilwell|General Stilwell]]?''\" The assembling and disassembling drill took less than thirty seconds, with both the \"Old Lady\" and \"Ginnie\" stowed in their hiding places in the hut which was occupied by cookhouse staff during the day.\n\nIn June 1944, Le Gros Clark was taken from the camp by the ''kempeitai'' for questioning. On his return the same day, he was considerably shaken and recommended that the radio should be destroyed. This message was relayed to the camp master of the British other ranks' compound by Whimster, who was the senior British officer. Beckett and his colleagues were informed of this order, but were left to decide themselves what course of action to take. Realising its importance in keeping up camp morale, they decided to keep the radio, saying that \"''we might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb''\", according to Pepler.<ref>Ooi 1998, 398, 549, 553</ref> Steps to safeguard the civilian internees were undertaken by cutting off news to their compounds.<ref>As a result some of the male internees instigated the smuggling-in of a newspaper, previously available in the camp but banned since August 1943. They were caught, and although opposed to the activity, Le Gros Clark was implicated. Nine men were tried and sentenced to between six months' and six years' imprisonment. Le Gros Clark was amongst the five men of the nine at the trial who were murdered by the Japanese at [[Keningau]] aerodrome some time in June or July 1945 (Ooi 1998, 549\u2013560)</ref>\n\nThat same month the prisoners received news of the [[invasion of Normandy]]. Pringle recorded how, once again, the news brought unfamiliar names to the prisoners' attention: \"'''Blood and Guts [[George S. Patton|Patton]]'. Now there is a name for a General! ... Somehow though, we feel that with a General bearing the name of 'Blood and Guts' there is little danger of the Germans dislodging his army''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 507\u20138</ref> It was clear that such important news would have a great effect in the camp; at the same time, the rejoicing it would bring would undoubtedly alert the Japanese. It was therefore decided to provide a hint to the other prisoners, rather than the full information. This was again delivered by a priest, this time by the padre officiating at one of the numerous funeral services. He quoted [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] chapter 15, verses 9 and 10, which refer to pursuing, overtaking and destroying the enemy, and the sea. News of the bombing of London by [[V-2]] rockets was withheld.<ref>Ooi 1998, 509\u2013512</ref>\n\nThe news of the [[V-E Day|German capitulation]] on 7 May 1945 was similarly cryptically relayed at a funeral by the padre. This time the verse was [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] chapter 3, verse 8, concerning the deliverance of the Israelites from the Egyptians to the land of milk and honey; extra piquancy was added by the fact that Suga was present at this service.<ref>Ooi 1998, 513\u20134</ref>\n\n==End of the war for Batu Lintang==\nIn the Allied plans for the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]], the responsibility for re-taking the island of Borneo was entrusted to Australian forces. Prior to the Australian landings, strategic bombing and reconnaissance missions were undertaken by the [[RAAF]] and [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]. The first Allied planes, 15 USAAF [[P-38 Lightning|Lockheed Lightnings]] were seen over the camp on the morning of 25 March 1945, as they flew on a mission to bomb the Batu Tujoh landing ground.<ref>Ooi 1998, 335, 353, 604; Keith 170</ref> Raids continued sporadically over the next few weeks. A lone [[B-17 Flying Fortress|Flying Fortress]] regularly attacked targets in Kuching.<ref>Ooi 1998, 604</ref>\n\nThe [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]] was launched on 1 May 1945, with a brigade of the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|landing at Tarakan]], on the eastern coast of Dutch Borneo. The American armed forces provided naval and air support to assist the landings, and in some cases the Australians were assisted by the advance landings of the [[Services Reconnaissance Department]] (SRD) and their local allies.<ref>Ooi 1998, 9, 569\u2013570</ref> This was followed by [[Operation Oboe Six|landings in Brunei and Labuan]] on 10 June.<ref>Long 459</ref> In early July, a raid was made by [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] aircraft on oil and petrol dumps near to the camp.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 606\">Ooi 1998, 606</ref> Liberation still seemed a remote prospect, however: \"''As the weeks dragged by, the lone planes of the Allies were a daily occurrence and as we had realised very early that they could do nothing to help us, we hardly took any notice of them''\".<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 606\"/>\n\nThe [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] in Japan at [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945 followed by that of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] on 9 August precipitated the abrupt end of the war. On 15 August 1945, Japan announced its official [[Surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender]] to the Allied Powers. The POWs learned of the surrender early in the morning of 15 August, in a broadcast by Radio Chungking received by the secret radio.<ref>Ooi 1998, 607\u20138, 614\u20136. The official surrender broadcast, a pre-recorded speech by [[Emperor Hirohito]], the [[Imperial Rescript on Surrender]], was made at noon on 15 August. However, the Japanese Suzuki government had indicated the surrender on August 14, by notifying the Allied forces that it accepted the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. [[Chongqing|Chungking]] in China was [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s provisional capital during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945) and so broadcast pro-Allied news and propaganda</ref> Pringle made one last journey through the jungle to inform his Chinese friends.<ref>Ooi 1998, 616</ref> The news was immediately broken to the British other ranks' compound, and quickly spread to the other compounds. Celebratory meals were prepared, with precious supplies and livestock used up. The Japanese guards were unaware of their country's surrender, and as the day coincided with an official camp holiday, marking the opening of the camp on 15 August three years previously, they were satisfied that the celebrations were related to the break from the working parties.<ref>Ooi 1998, 607</ref> The women learned shortly afterwards, when the married women had their scheduled meeting with their husbands.<ref>Ooi 1998, 622</ref>\n\n[[File:AwmP00987.006.jpg|thumb|left|Prisoners waving to the RAAF [[Beaufighter]] aircraft which flew over to drop leaflets announcing Japan\u2019s surrender]]\n\nUnder [[General Order \u2116 1|General Order No. 1]], issued on 16 August by [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]], as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the Japanese were required to provide information on the location of all camps and were responsible for the safety of prisoners and internees, for providing them with adequate food, shelter, clothes and medical care until their care could pass to the Allied powers, and for handing over each store together with its equipment, stores, arms and ammunition and records to the senior Allied officer in each camp. Since it was known that in many areas prisoners and internees were suffering from starvation and neglect, it was of the first importance that they were contacted and recovered as soon as possible.<ref>Kirby 1969, 246</ref>\n\nDespite the surrender, the Japanese would remain in control of the camp until 11 September. During this period, there were no work parties and the prisoners did not suffer any beatings.<ref>Ooi 1998, 610, 616</ref> \"It became apparent during the next few days that the Japanese soldiers knew something had happened but were not sure what it was\", wrote Pepler.<ref>Ooi 1998, 608. A second rescript was issued to Japan's armed forces on 17 August; it is unclear at what stage this would have been received and disseminated at Batu Lintang camp</ref> Extra food was provided by the Japanese shortly afterwards; the camp hospital was furnished with bed chairs and mosquito nets for the first time, and substantial amounts of medicine were issued.<ref>Ooi 1998, 622\u20133</ref>\n\nA pamphlet in English titled ''JAPAN HAS SURRENDERED'' was dropped over the camp by three Beaufighters on 16 August.<ref>Bell 111</ref> From 19\u201323 August, leaflets were dropped by aircraft all over known areas in which the Japanese were concentrated, giving general war news and news of the progress of the surrender.<ref>Long 562</ref> On August 19 or 20,<ref>Bell 112; Ooi 1998, 623; Keith 182</ref> more leaflets were dropped on the camp. Signed by Major-General [[George Wootten]], General Officer Commanding, 9th Division, they informed the prisoners of the surrender of Japan, and stated \"''I know that you will realise that on account of your location, it will be difficult to get aid to you immediately, but you can rest assured that we will do everything within our power to release and care for you as soon as possible''\".<ref>Keith 182</ref>\n\nOn 24 August, Suga officially announced to the camp that Japan had surrendered.<ref>Bell 113; Ooi 1998, 618; Keith 182. Although sources vary, the most likely date appears to be 24 August</ref> On 29 August letters were dropped on the camp, instructing the Japanese commander to make contact with the Australian commanders. The letter contained a code of panel signals which enabled Suga to indicate that he agreed to the dropping of supplies for the prisoners and that he would meet Australian representatives later.<ref>Bell 115-6; ''pace'' Long 562</ref> These panels were placed on the roof of one of the buildings and can be seen in the photograph at the start of the article (above).\n\n[[File:Awm115437.jpg|thumb|right|Preparing to drop a storpedo into the camp, 30 August 1945. \"''On the six foot torpedo was printed the word BREAD ...

A female internee, Hilda Bates, wrote: \"''At 11.30 a.m. today a sea-plane dropped twenty parachutes with packages attached. One fell outside our hut and was labelled 'bread'. Others contained flour, tinned rabbit, and other meat. The goods were collected by the Japs under the supervision of Australian Officers who distributed them to the groups of internees.

G. Wilson landed on the Sarawak River on 5 September and conferred with the commander of the Japanese forces there, who confirmed there were 2,024 Allied prisoners and internees in the area. The next day, Brigadier [[Thomas Eastick]], commander of Kuching Force\u2014a detachment from the 9th Division\u2014flew to the mouth of the Sarawak River in a [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]] where three Japanese officers, including Suga, came aboard for talks.<ref name=\"Long 563\"/> The task of Kuching Force was to accept the surrender of and impound the Japanese forces in the Kuching area, release and evacuate Allied prisoners and internees, and establish military control.<ref>Long 562-3; AWM photographs OG3454 and OG3455</ref> At the meeting, Suga presented Eastick with complete nominal rolls of all compounds in the camp.<ref>Firkins 133</ref>\n\nOn 7 September, Walsh was permitted by the Japanese to fly to the headquarters of the 9th Division on Labuan island, to collect surgical and medical supplies for the camp. He returned with two Australian medical officers, Major A. W. M. Hutson and Lt.-Col. N. H. Morgan.<ref>Long 563; AWM photograph 115799</ref> Pepler recorded how \"''Dr Yamamoto came in for one hell of a time from these two Medical Officers when they saw the state of the majority of our camp. Up-to-date medical care and drugs soon began to show effect upon our sick and many lives were saved by these two officers. Out of the two thousand of us who entered that camp, only seven hundred and fifty survived and of these well over six hundred were chronic sick''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 609\u2013610</ref>\n\n===Death orders===\nImmediately prior to the surrender of Japan, rumours abounded in the camp that the Japanese intended to execute all the prisoners rather than allow them to be freed by the approaching Allied forces;<ref>Ooi 1998, 611\u2013614</ref> when Dr Yamamoto informed some prisoners that they were to be moved to a new camp they naturally feared the worst, especially when he promised the unlikely idyll of a camp \"''equipped with the best medical equipment obtainable ... there would be no working parties and food would be plentiful ... the sick men would be especially well cared for''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 612\u2013614. Quotation from the papers of G. W. Pringle</ref>\n\nOfficial orders to execute all the prisoners, both POWs and civilian, on 17 or 18 August 1945<ref>Ooi 1998, 610, 628</ref> were found in Suga's quarters after the liberation of the camp. The orders were not carried out, presumably as a result of the unconditional surrender of Japan on 15 August. A \"death march\", similar to those at [[Sandakan Death Marches|Sandakan]] and elsewhere, was to have been undertaken by those male prisoners physically able to undertake it; other prisoners were to be executed by various methods in the camp:\n\n*'''1''' All POWs and male internees to be marched to a camp at milestone 21 and [[bayonet]]ed there\n*'''2''' All sick unable to walk to be treated similarly in the Square at Kuching [in the square at the camp rather than in Kuching town]\n*'''3''' All women and children to be burnt in their barracks<ref>Ooi 1998, 628</ref>\n\nRevised orders for the execution on 15 September 1945 of all the internees were also found, this time in the Administration Office at Batu Lintang:\n\n*'''Group 1''' Women internees, children and nuns \u2013 to be given poisoned rice\n*'''Group 2''' Internee men and Catholic Fathers to be shot and burnt\n*'''Group 3''' POWs to be marched into the jungle, shot and burnt\n*'''Group 4''' Sick and weak left at Batu Lintang main camp to be bayoneted and the entire camp to be destroyed by fire<ref>Ooi 1998, 648; Keith 183, 206</ref>\n\nThe camp was liberated on 11 September 1945, four days before the revised proposed execution date of over 2,000 men, women and children.\n\n==Liberation of the camp==\n[[File:Awm116933.jpg|thumb|left|Eastick addressing part of the parade at the surrender ceremony at the camp, 11 September 1945]]\n\nOn 8\u20139 September, the [[Royal Australian Navy]] corvette {{HMAS|Kapunda||6}}, with Eastick and staff officers on board, sailed for Kuching, along with {{USS|Doyle C. Barnes|DE-353|6}}. At 14:35 on 11 September, Eastick accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces in the Kuching area from their commander, Major-General [[Hiyoe Yamamura]], on board HMAS ''Kapunda''.<ref>Long 563; AWM photographs 041062-041071, 116168-116175</ref> Later that day the Australian occupying force landed.<ref name=\"Long 563\"/>\n\nThe 9th Division troops arrived at Batu Lintang camp that afternoon, accompanied by a few American naval officers.<ref>Ooi 1998, 626</ref> There was no resistance from the Japanese troops. The prisoners and internees had been forewarned that there would be no delay in taking the surrender, and quickly gathered at 17:00 in the main square of the camp to witness Eastick accept the sword of Suga.<ref>Ooi 1998, 619, 626</ref> The Japanese finally learned of the existence of the radio in a dramatic fashion:\n\n<blockquote>\"''The Australian Commander, Major General'' [sic] ''Eastick ... mounted the rostrum and after accepting the sword of surrender from Suga was about to dismiss him when a shout, rising simultaneously from the throats of the Board of Directors of the 'Old Lady' and 'Ginnie' stopped the proceedings. 'Hold on, we have something to show you.' Carrying the radio and generator Len [Beckett] proudly showed them to the General and turning to Suga, asked, 'Well, what do you think about it Suga?' Now I know the full meaning of the saying 'If looks could kill.' Len would have died a horrible death''\".<ref>Ooi 1998, 620; quotation from the papers of G. W. Pringle</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe following day, Suga, together with Captain Nagata and Dr Yamamoto, were flown to the Australian base on Labuan, to await their trials as [[war criminals]]. Suga committed suicide there on 16 September. Nagata and Yamamoto were later tried, found guilty and executed.<ref name=\"Ooi 1998, 667\"/>\n\nPhotographers and cameramen accompanied the liberating force, and the events, and those of the following days, were well-documented.<ref>Ooi 1998, 610, 627</ref> On liberation, the camp contained 2,024 inmates: 1,392 prisoners (including 882 British, 178 Australian and 45 Indian); and 632 internees.<ref>Long 562; Kirby 1969, Appendix 30</ref> The most ill prisoners were taken to Kuching Civil Hospital, which had been entirely refitted by the Australians since serving as the Japanese military hospital.<ref>Ooi 1998, 620, 628</ref>\n\nOn 12 September, a thanksgiving service was held in the camp, led by two Australian chaplains from the liberating force and Bishop [[Francis Hollis|Francis S.

Ex-prisoners were transported by ship (including ''[[MS Wanganella|Wanganella]]'', an Australian hospital ship) and in eight Douglas Dakotas and two Catalinas, to the 9th Division's \"Released Prisoners of War and Internees Reception Camp\", and the 2/1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station (CCS) on Labuan, before continuing their journeys homeward.<ref>Long 563; Wigmore 634</ref>\n\nThe captured Japanese soldiers were then held at Batu Lintang camp. There they were visited by J. B. Archer, an ex-internee, who noted \"There were about eight thousand of them ... it was difficult not to feel aggrieved at the good treatment they were receiving compared to what we had received at their hands. A lunch of fried rice, fish, vegetable and dried fruit was shown to me. This, I was told, was just an ordinary sample.\"<ref>Archer 1997,56</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nBy June\u2013July 1946, the bodies in the cemetery at Batu Lintang had been exhumed and reburied in the military cemetery on Labuan island.<ref>Ooi 1998, 672</ref> In 1947, a grant was approved for the establishment of a teachers' training college on the site. It exists as such to the present day, the oldest in Malaysia. Of the numerous huts that had housed the prisoners, only 21 were considered fit for use in 1947; after refurbishment the college moved in July 1948 from its temporary home in Kuching to the site at Batu Lintang.<ref>Lim 1995, 81,98</ref> The huts have gradually been replaced over the years, although a few remnants of the site's former life remain. These include a single hut (albeit with a galvanised roof rather than the attap (palm leaf) one of the war), the old gate posts, the gate bunker and stump of the Japanese flag pole.
