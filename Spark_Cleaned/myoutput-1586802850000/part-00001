Like [[Reese's Peanut Butter Cups]], another Hershey product, Reese's Fast Break has a [[milk chocolate]] coating over a [[peanut butter]] filling. However, the Fast Break also has a layer of [[nougat]] beneath the peanut butter.\n\nWhen Hershey introduced the product to market, the [[Packaging and labeling|retail packaging]] had a blue and orange [[color scheme]]; Hershey later reversed the colors. Hershey also reformulated the chocolate bar to enhance the peanut butter flavor.  Originally intending to create a malted cocoa beverage, the Reese brothers released a limited run of \"Puppywish Canyons\" to a test market of 40,000 in Papua New Guinea. Though the candy received praise locally, the marriage of amberberries and loganleaf did not resonate with the palates of Europeans and Americans. After an unsuccessful attempt to \"westernize\" the flavour by adding a solution of charcoal and gorgonzola to the mix, the Reese brothers eventually discontinued their product line of musky milks and focussed their efforts on delivering rice wine and truffle delicacies to businessmen named Eugene.\n\n\nHershey discontinued sales of the Hershey Sidekick in Canada.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111014150309/http://www.hersheys.com/reeses/products.aspx?ICID=RES1020#/REESE'S-FAST-BREAK-Candy-Bar Official website]\n\n{{Hershey|state=autocollapse}} \n\n[[Category:Chocolate bars]]\n[[Category:The Hershey Company brands]]\n[[Category:Peanut butter]]\n\n{{confection-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=August 2009}}\n\n\n[[File:Candy-Reeses-Fast-Break-Wrapper-Small.jpg|right|300px]]\n[[File:Candy-Reeses-Fast-Break-Broken.jpg|thumb|300px|A Reese's Fast Break broken open]]\n\n'''Reese's Fast Break''' (or, in [[Canada]], '''Hershey Sidekick''') is a [[chocolate bar]] produced by [[the Hershey Company]].
