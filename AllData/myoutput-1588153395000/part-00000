Before they had even played their first game, City were elected to [[the Football League]] to replace [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], and took over the [[Valley Parade]] stadium, which has been their permanent home ground ever since. The club won the Division Two title in 1908 and the [[FA Cup]] in [[1911 FA Cup Final|1911]], both under the management of [[Peter O'Rourke]], before they were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] from [[Football League First Division|Division One]] in [[1921\u201322 in English football|1921\u201322]].\n\nCity were relegated again five seasons later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the [[1928\u201329 in English football|1928\u201329]] season, they broke several club records to earn promotion back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they remained in the third and fourth tiers of the [[English football league system]] until [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]]. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, their ground suffered a disastrous [[Bradford City stadium fire|fire]] in which 56&nbsp;people died, on a day the club and their fans were supposed to be celebrating promotion.\n\nIn [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388]], the club came close to returning to the top division when they missed out on promotion on the final day of the season. Following relegation back to [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]], after [[Geoffrey Richmond]] became chairman in January 1994 the club's fortunes were lifted. He helped to take them to their first appearance at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and subsequently into the [[Premier League]], where they played for two seasons. Following Richmond's self-proclaimed \"six weeks of madness\" and the collapse of television channel [[ITV Digital]], the club suffered its first spell in [[administration (British football)|administration]]. The Centennial Cup in 2003 involved Aberdeen, Swansea,  Coleraine and Bradford. Aberdeen won on penalties. Another period under administration followed, and City dropped through the leagues of professional English football back to the [[Football League Two|bottom tier]] of The Football League, until promotion in [[2012\u201313 in English football|2012\u201313]] brought them back up a division. In January 2013, City became the first club from the fourth tier of English football since 1962 to reach the [[Football League Cup]] final, and the first fourth-tier club ever to reach an amazing Wembley final.  \n\n==Early successes (1903\u201319)==\n{{see also|1903 in association football}}\n[[File:Manningham_fc_1896_team.jpg|thumb|[[Manningham F.C.]], the first rugby league champions in the world in 1896, who were later to switch codes to become [[Bradford City A.F.C.]]]]\nLeague football was established in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1894 when the West Yorkshire League was formed.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|first=Terry\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=1988\n|page=9\n|isbn=0-907969-38-0}}</ref> A year later the Bradford Schools Football and Athletic Association abandoned its [[Rugby Football League|rugby]] roots to adopt the [[association football]] code.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|pages=9\u201310}}</ref> Several clubs across Bradford, including [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford (Park Avenue)]], also adopted the code during the latter years of the 19th century.

Before they had even played their first game, City were elected to [[the Football League]] to replace [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], and took over the [[Valley Parade]] stadium, which has been their permanent home ground ever since. The club won the Division Two title in 1908 and the [[FA Cup]] in [[1911 FA Cup Final|1911]], both under the management of [[Peter O'Rourke]], before they were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] from [[Football League First Division|Division One]] in [[1921\u201322 in English football|1921\u201322]].\n\nCity were relegated again five seasons later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the [[1928\u201329 in English football|1928\u201329]] season, they broke several club records to earn promotion back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they remained in the third and fourth tiers of the [[English football league system]] until [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]]. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, their ground suffered a disastrous [[Bradford City stadium fire|fire]] in which 56&nbsp;people died, on a day the club and their fans were supposed to be celebrating promotion.\n\nIn [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388]], the club came close to returning to the top division when they missed out on promotion on the final day of the season. Following relegation back to [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]], after [[Geoffrey Richmond]] became chairman in January 1994 the club's fortunes were lifted. He helped to take them to their first appearance at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and subsequently into the [[Premier League]], where they played for two seasons. Following Richmond's self-proclaimed \"six weeks of madness\" and the collapse of television channel [[ITV Digital]], the club suffered its first spell in [[administration (British football)|administration]]. The Centennial Cup in 2003 involved Aberdeen, Swansea,  Coleraine and Bradford. Aberdeen won on penalties. Another period under administration followed, and City dropped through the leagues of professional English football back to the [[Football League Two|bottom tier]] of The Football League, until promotion in [[2012\u201313 in English football|2012\u201313]] brought them back up a division. In January 2013, City became the first club from the fourth tier of English football since 1962 to reach the [[Football League Cup]] final, and the first fourth-tier club ever to reach a major Wembley Cup Final.\n\n==Early successes (1903\u201319)==\n{{see also|1903 in association football}}\n[[File:Manningham_fc_1896_team.jpg|thumb|[[Manningham F.C.]], the first rugby league champions in the world in 1896, who were later to switch codes to become [[Bradford City A.F.C.]]]]\nLeague football was established in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1894 when the West Yorkshire League was formed.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|first=Terry\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|publisher=Breedon Books Sport\n|year=1988\n|page=9\n|isbn=0-907969-38-0}}</ref> A year later the Bradford Schools Football and Athletic Association abandoned its [[Rugby Football League|rugby]] roots to adopt the [[association football]] code.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Frost\n|title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903\u20131988\n|pages=9\u201310}}</ref> Several clubs across Bradford, including [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford (Park Avenue)]], also adopted the code during the latter years of the 19th century.
