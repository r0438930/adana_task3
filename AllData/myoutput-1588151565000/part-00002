In 1901 the club gained permission from Eastbourne Council to use Gildredge Park<ref name=\"hist\" /> in the Old Town as their home ground. Although not enclosed, the entrance was a voluntary donation of one penny. The pitch was given the nickname of 'The Switchback' due to the undulating playing surface.\n\n===Lynchmere 1921\u20131947===\nThe team, now named for the third time as Eastbourne Royal Engineers Old Comrades, moved to the Lynchmere Ground<ref name=\"hist\" /> opposite Tutts Barn Lane. The first game played was the East Sussex Cup Final against the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], also said to be the first ever outside broadcast sporting event in the country when the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] brought wireless equipment to relay news of the event back to their base in [[Maresfield]]. Materials from the [[Eastbourne Aviation Company]] and [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] to enclose the pitch was completed by the help of volunteers, ready for the start of the 1921\u201322 Sussex County League season. The pitch was said to have a pronounced slope.\nBy 1928, the club left the Sussex County League and joined the [[Spartan League]] and at this time the ground had a wooden grandstand and another enclosed structure built ready for their first game versus [[Colchester Town F.C.|Colchester Town]], now called [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]. Returning to the Sussex County league in 1935, the ground was hired out to a circus in the 1936 close season making the pitch unplayable until the end of October.\n\nBy the end of [[World War 2]], Lynchmere had a new owner and future tenancy was uncertain.<ref name=\"hist\" /> The ground was used by the Army in the war and was kept in good condition, although the seating was removed and the buildings badly damaged the club tried to claim compensation from the War Office. Which was refused as the ground was not officially commandeered and the club had no money. The 1946\u201347 season was to be the last at the Lynchmere, the last game played was 11 January 1947 against [[Haywards Heath Town F.C.|Haywards Heath]]. An \"artic winter\" intervened and the ground was sold for development. The site is now occupied by Thomas a Beckett School.\n\n===Shinewater Lane 1990\u20132003===\nThe Shinewater Playing field in [[Langney]], Eastbourne was currently being used by Stone Cross Cricket Club who were looking for another team to share the ground at the same time the Shinewater Association Club were looking to form a team.<ref name=\"hist\" /> In 1990 Shinewater Association Football Club moved in and entered the [[East Sussex Football League]]. Facilities were very basic, players changing in a small wooden pavilion.\nThe pavilion caught fire in 1992 and the Cricket Club relocated to [[The Saffrons]] cricket pitch, taking the insurance money with them. Shinewater Association received a grant from the Football Foundation to build a new clubhouse which was opened by the Mayor during the 1992\u201393 football season, although planning permission was granted - it was noted that building regulations had not been followed and \u00a311,000 of remedial work need to be done. The money for this was paid out by the cricket club who moved back in.<ref name=\"hist\" />\nIn 1997 the pitch was fully enclosed to meet ground grading for the [[Sussex County League]] Division Two as well as dugouts and a breeze block and steel cover. Vandalism and pitch drainage problems where a common concern with Shinewater Lane in later years. Permission was later sought to install floodlights which was declined as parking would cause a problem during evening games. The last game for Shinewater Association was against Eastbourne United just as the two clubs signed a merger and moved to The Oval.\n\nIn later years [[Langney Wanderers F.C.|Langney Wanderers]] used Shinewater Lane before relocating to [[Priory Lane]].\n\n===The Oval 1947\u2013present===\n{{Main|Princes Park, Eastbourne}}\n[[File:The Oval, Princes Park - geograph.org.uk - 176315.jpg|thumb|The Oval in 2006, remains of the running track can be seen]]\n[[File:Eastbourne United v Hassocks (8123498935).jpg|thumb|The grandstand in 2007 before demolition]]\nThe club have played at the Oval on Channel View Road since 1947. The area was originally known as the Gilbert Recreation Ground and now called [[Princes Park, Eastbourne|Princes Park]], which was owned by the local council, who invited Eastbourne Old Comrades to play there.. The council at the time were developing it into a sports arena with an athletics track and a grass cycle track surrounding the grass pitch. Plans were made in 1951 to build a stand and a terrace, which was opened in September 1955 when Eastbourne United hosted a game against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].\n\nFloodlights were first installed in 1958 and inaugurated with a match versus [[Eastbourne Town F.C.|Eastbourne F.C.]] in front of a gate of 4,100. More floodlights were supplemented in 1966 when Eastbourne United were playing in the [[Athenian League]]; these were installed at a cost of \u00a35,500 and were officially turned on 25 October 1967 with a friendly game with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. A third set of floodlights was officially opened on 18 February 1980 by former manager [[Ron Greenwood]] with another friendly game with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].\n\nThe great storm in 1987 destroyed one of the covered terraces; this was not repaired as the council's insurance did not cover storm damage. The local athletics club left the site in 2003 to a new facility to the north of the town. Today the perimeter fencing now surrounds the pitch; this was bought from nearby [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]]'s ground at [[Priory Lane]] when they improved their facilities. The new fencing has allowed spectators to watch the game nearer to the pitch than they used to. A few years later the terraced stand was demolished, awaiting plans for a new structure to be built.\n\nThe ground had a \u00a3100,000 investment over the 2011\u201312 season, to bring it up to Sussex County League standards and is now equipped with new perimeter fencing, concrete walkways and a 113-seater stand.<ref>{{cite

In 1901 the club gained permission from Eastbourne Council to use Gildredge Park<ref name=\"hist\" /> in the Old Town as their home ground. Although not enclosed, the entrance was a voluntary donation of one penny. The pitch was given the nickname of 'The Switchback' due to the undulating playing surface.\n\n===Lynchmere 1921\u20131947===\nThe team, now named for the third time as Eastbourne Royal Engineers Old Comrades, moved to the Lynchmere Ground<ref name=\"hist\" /> opposite Tutts Barn Lane. The first game played was the East Sussex Cup Final against the [[Royal Corps of Signals]], also said to be the first ever outside broadcast sporting event in the country when the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] brought wireless equipment to relay news of the event back to their base in [[Maresfield]]. Materials from the [[Eastbourne Aviation Company]] and [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] to enclose the pitch was completed by the help of volunteers, ready for the start of the 1921\u201322 Sussex County League season. The pitch was said to have a pronounced slope.\nBy 1928, the club left the Sussex County League and joined the [[Spartan League]] and at this time the ground had a wooden grandstand and another enclosed structure built ready for their first game versus [[Colchester Town F.C.|Colchester Town]], now called [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]. Returning to the Sussex County league in 1935, the ground was hired out to a circus in the 1936 close season making the pitch unplayable until the end of October.\n\nBy the end of [[World War 2]], Lynchmere had a new owner and future tenancy was uncertain.<ref name=\"hist\" /> The ground was used by the Army in the war and was kept in good condition, although the seating was removed and the buildings badly damaged the club tried to claim compensation from the War Office. Which was refused as the ground was not officially commandeered and the club had no money. The 1946\u201347 season was to be the last at the Lynchmere, the last game played was 11 January 1947 against [[Haywards Heath Town F.C.|Haywards Heath]]. An \"artic winter\" intervened and the ground was sold for development. The site is now occupied by Thomas a Beckett School.\n\n===Shinewater Lane 1990\u20132003===\nThe Shinewater Playing field in [[Langney]], Eastbourne was currently being used by Stone Cross Cricket Club who were looking for another team to share the ground at the same time the Shinewater Association Club were looking to form a team.<ref name=\"hist\" /> In 1990 Shinewater Association Football Club moved in and entered the [[East Sussex Football League]]. Facilities were very basic, players changing in a small wooden pavilion.\nThe pavilion caught fire in 1992 and the Cricket Club relocated to [[The Saffrons]] cricket pitch, taking the insurance money with them. Shinewater Association received a grant from the Football Foundation to build a new clubhouse which was opened by the Mayor during the 1992\u201393 football season, although planning permission was granted - it was noted that building regulations had not been followed and \u00a311,000 of remedial work need to be done. The money for this was paid out by the cricket club who moved back in.<ref name=\"hist\" />\nIn 1997 the pitch was fully enclosed to meet ground grading for the [[Sussex County League]] Division Two as well as dugouts and a breeze block and steel cover. Vandalism and pitch drainage problems where a common concern with Shinewater Lane in later years. Permission was later sought to install floodlights which was declined as parking would cause a problem during evening games. The last game for Shinewater Association was against Eastbourne United just as the two clubs signed a merger and moved to The Oval.\n\nIn later years [[Langney Wanderers F.C.|Langney Wanderers]] used Shinewater Lane before relocating to [[Priory Lane]].\n\n===The Oval 1947\u2013present===\n{{Main|Princes Park, Eastbourne}}\n[[File:The Oval, Princes Park - geograph.org.uk - 176315.jpg|thumb|The Oval in 2006, remains of the running track can be seen]]\n[[File:Eastbourne United v Hassocks (8123498935).jpg|thumb|The grandstand in 2007 before demolition]]\nThe club have played at the Oval on Channel View Road since 1947. The area was originally known as the Gilbert Recreation Ground and now called [[Princes Park, Eastbourne|Princes Park]], which was owned by the local council, who invited Eastbourne Old Comrades to play there.. The council at the time were developing it into a sports arena with an athletics track and a grass cycle track surrounding the grass pitch. Plans were made in 1951 to build a stand and a terrace, which was opened in September 1955 when Eastbourne United hosted a game against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].\n\nFloodlights were first installed in 1958 and inaugurated with a match versus [[Eastbourne Town F.C.|Eastbourne F.C.]] in front of a gate of 4,100. More floodlights were supplemented in 1966 when Eastbourne United were playing in the [[Athenian League]]; these were installed at a cost of \u00a35,500 and were officially turned on 25 October 1967 with a friendly game with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. A third set of floodlights was officially opened on 18 February 1980 by former manager [[Ron Greenwood]] with another friendly game with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].\n\nThe great storm in 1987 destroyed one of the covered terraces; this was not repaired as the council's insurance did not cover storm damage. The local athletics club left the site in 2003 to a new facility to the north of the town. Today the perimeter fencing now surrounds the pitch; this was bought from nearby [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]]'s ground at [[Priory Lane]] when they improved their facilities. The new fencing has allowed spectators to watch the game nearer to the pitch than they used to. A few years later the terraced stand was demolished, awaiting plans for a new structure to be built.\n\nThe ground had a \u00a3100,000 investment over the 2011\u201312 season, to bring it up to Sussex County League standards and is now equipped with new perimeter fencing, concrete walkways and a 113-seater stand.<ref>{{cite
