However, one major hindrance to his goal is their barrio's location-it is separated from the town by a river, making it difficult for the kids to attend school. This pushes Ryan to build a raft he calls \"Balsa Basa\" where he can teach kids. Despite his pure intentions, many cast doubts on his plans, with some parents worrying for the safety of their children. His own father even discourages him and tells him to stop his ambition.
