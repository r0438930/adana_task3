Bryan; August 11, 1836 \u2013 December 22, 1919) was an American poet.  Her publishing career began in the mid-1850s and lasted into the twentieth century.  She published hundreds of poems in widely-circulating newspapers, magazines, and anthologies as well as in eighteen volumes of poems, two of which she co-authored with her husband, the poet John James Piatt (also known as \u201cJ.J.\u201d).<ref>Paula Bernat Bennett, ed., ''Palace-Burner: The Selected Poetry of Sarah Piatt'' (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001), xvii-xviii; xxiv-xxv; \u201cSarah Morgan Bryan Piatt (1836-1919),\u201d Faith Barrett and Christanne Miller, eds., ''\u201cWords for the Hour\u201d: A New Anthology of American Civil War Poetry'' (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005), 331; Karen L.

Her mother was related to the Stocktons, Simpsons and other early Kentucky settlers.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=840}}{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} Her paternal grandfather, Morgan Bryan, was one of the pioneer settlers of that state, a proprietor of \"Bryan's Station,\" and a brother-in-law of [[Daniel Boone]], whom the Bryans accompanied from [[North Carolina]] into Kentucky.{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=840}}\n\nWhen she was three, the family{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=328}} moved near [[Versailles, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}}<ref>Michaels 1999, p. 9-10.</ref> Her mother died a few years later, when Piatt was eight years old. The loss had a profound impact on her life and outlook, as evident in her poetry.{{sfn|Radcliffe College|1971|p=63}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}} She then lived on various Kentucky plantations with relatives, accompanied by her mother's nurse, an African American slave.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} For a time, she lived with her grandmother, and then later went to live with her father at the home of his new wife.{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=328}} Eventually, Piatt's father placed her and a younger sister in the care of their aunt, Mrs. Annie Boone, who lived in [[New Castle, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\n\nIn New Castle, Piatt attended Henry Female College, graduating in 1854.<ref>Bennett, Introduction, 2001, p. xxiii</ref>{{sfn|Ridpath|1906|p=289}} She became an avid reader, and was especially fond of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Lord Byron]], [[Thomas Moore]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Felicia Hemans]], and [[Robert Browning]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}{{sfn|Renker|2016|p=236}} While a student, Piatt began publishing her poetry in the local newspaper.{{sfn|Larson|2011|p=189}}\n\n==Career==\nWhen [[George D. Prentice]], writer, poet, and editor of the ''[[Louisville Journal]],'' encountered Piatt's poetry, he immediately recognized her talent and skill. In 1855 he wrote to her: \"I now say emphatically to you again . . . that, if you are entirely true to yourself, and if your life be spared, you will, in the maturity of your powers, be the first poet of your sex in the United States. I say this not as what I think, but what I know.\"{{sfn|The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review, Volume 3|1891|p=401}} Prentice became Piatt's mentor and advocate, publishing many of her poems in his newspaper.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}} She also began sending her work to <i>The [[New York Ledger]]</i>, a popular and important periodical with a national circulation.<ref>''The Early Poems of Sarah Morgan Bryan (Piatt) in the New York Ledger, 1857-1860'' Professor Elizabeth Renker, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>\n\nOn June 18, 1861, she married aspiring poet John James Piatt (also known as \"J.J.\"), whom she had met through Prentice.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} The couple relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]] where J.J. had accepted a clerk position in the U.S. Treasury.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} During this period they published a collection featuring both of their poetry, <i>The Nests at Washington</i> (1864). This was J.J.'s second book (following the 1861 <i>Poems by Two Friends</i> with William Dean Howells) and Sarah's first.{{sfn|Ridpath|Ridpath Library of Universal Literature, Volume 18|1899|p=n.p.}}\n\nIn July 1867, they moved to [[Ohio]], where J.J. worked for [[Cincinnati]] newspapers. They made their home on a part of the old estate of [[William Henry Harrison]] in [[North Bend, Ohio]], a few miles south of [[Cincinnati]], on the [[Ohio River]]. The family shuttled back and forth to Washington D.C. on a few occasions,{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} such as when J.J. worked for the postal service. From 1870-1876, Piatt and the children joined J.J. in Washington D.C. in the winters where he was serving as librarian of the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}} During this time, Sarah's poems also appeared in the Washington, D.C. weekly newspaper <i>The Capital</i>, founded by Donn Piatt, her cousin by marriage.<ref>''The Capital, 1871-1880 (Sarah Piatt Recovery Project), The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/90925, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>\n\nHer first independent collection of poetry, ''A Woman's Poems'', appeared anonymously in 1871. This came to be her best known work, made famous by Bayard Taylor's book, ''The Echo Club''.{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}} The volume was followed several more, including ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles'' (1874); ''That New World'' (1876); ''Poems in Company with Children'' (1877); and ''Dramatic Persons and Moods'' (1878). During this period, Piatt also contributed to many prominent American magazines, such as ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]].''{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\n\nIn 1882, the Piatts moved to Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) Ireland, as J.J. had accepted the position of [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of the U.S. to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], a job he held for eleven years.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} While abroad, Sarah wrote many poems inspired by her time in Ireland. She continued publishing poetry collections, including ''An Irish Garland'' ([[Edinburgh]], 1884), a volume of her ''Selected Poems'' ([[London]], 1885), ''In Primrose Time: a New Irish Garland'' (London, 1886), ''The Witch in the Glass, and Other Poems'' (London, 1889), and ''An Irish Wild-Flower'' (London, 1891), all of which were issued simultaneously in the U.S.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=570}} Sarah and J.J. also published another volume featuring both of their work, ''The Children Out-of-Doors: a Book of Verses'' (Edinburgh, 1884).\n\n==Personal life==\n\nPiatt was the mother of Marian (b 1862); Victor (1864); Donn (1867); Fred (1869); Guy (1871); Louis (1875); and Cecil (1878) as well as at least one infant child and possibly others in infancy or through miscarriage. Victor died in a tragic fireworks accident in 1874, and Louis drowned in a boating accident in 1884 while the Piatts were living in Ireland.{{sfn|Michaels|1999|p=11-12}}\n\nAfter J.J.'s death in 1917, Piatt removed to her son Cecil's home in [[Caldwell, New Jersey|Caldwell]], [[New Jersey]], where she died of [[pneumonia]] on December 22, 1919.{{sfn|Stevenson|1922|p=3893}}{{sfn|McHenry|1980|p=327}} She and J.J. are buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}}\n\n==Themes and reception==\nChildren were a common theme in Piatt's poems.{{sfn|Frank|2007|p=134}}\n\nHer biographer, in [[Richard Henry Stoddard]]'s ''Poets' Homes'', stated:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}} {{quote|text=\"It is since her marriage, in June, 1861,\" says Mrs.  \"that her more individual characteristics of style have manifested themselves, especially the dramatic element, so delicate, subtle and strong, which asserts her intellectual kinship with Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\"}}\n\nWrites [[William Dean Howells]]:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}} {{quote|text=\"In the rush of these hopeless tears, this heart-broken scorn of comfort, this unreconcilable patience of grief, is the drama of the race's affliction; in the utter desolation of one woman's sorrow, the universal anguish of mortality is expressed. It is not pessimism; it does not assume to be any sort of philosophy or system; it is simply the bitter truth, to a phrase, of human experience through which all men must pass, and the reader need not be told that such poems were lived before they were written.\"}}\n\nAnother admirer of Piatt's verse, in a critical survey of the literature of Ohio, (1903) said of the author and her work:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}{{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt is a woman of original and exceptional genius \u2014 a poet whose name shines in American literature, 'Like some great jewel full of fire.' She is unrivaled, in her province of song, by any living writer of her sex, whether native to this country or of foreign birth. . . . She is inimitable in her own vivid, bold, and suggestive invention and manner. Whatever she writes has meaning \u2014 and the significance is often deep \u2014 sometimes strange and elusive \u2014 never commonplace. . . . Mrs. Piatt's rare artistic skill has been admired by many who appreciate the technical difficulties of the poetic craft.\"}}\n\nEqually emphatic is the praise accorded by a contemporary English critic, who, in an article contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|London Saturday Review]]'', commenting on the volume of select verse entitled ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles, and Other Poems,'' said:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}  {{quote|text=\"Of all the concourse of women singers Mrs. Piatt is the most racy and, in a word, the most American. . . . The new selections of her poems should be most welcome to all who seek in American poetry something more than a pale reflex of the British commodity. . . . Her poems, with all their whim and inconstancy of mood, are charmingly sincere, artless, piquant, and full of quaint surprise.\"}}\n\nIn like commendatory strain, another English critic, reviewing the same book in the ''Pictorial World'' (London), pronounced her verse, \"not easy to equal, much less to surpass, on either side of the Atlantic,\" and characterized her poetical achievement in the following words:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=185}} {{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt studies no model, and takes no pattern for her work; she simply expresses herself; hence her verse is just the transparent mantle of her individuality. The natural refinement, the ready sympathy, the tender sentiment, the quiet grace of a thoroughly womanly woman reveal themselves quite unconsciously in every poem; and the musical quality of the verse increases the impression that the reader is listening to the heartutterances of one of the Imogens or Mirandas to be met with now seldom outside the radiant land where Shakespeare's imagination reigns supreme. . . . Mrs. Piatt will, we doubt not, as her poems become known to English readers, become popular, or, we should rather say, dear to a wide circle mainly composed of members of her own sex, for she supplies the adequate expression for women whose hearts are tender and true like her own.\"}}\n\n==Selected works==\n* '' A Woman's Poems.'' 1871\n* ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles.'' 1874\n* ''That New World, & Other Poems.'' 1877\n* ''Poems in Company with Children.

Bryan; August 11, 1836 \u2013 December 22, 1919) was an American poet.  Her publishing career began in the mid-1850s and lasted into the twentieth century.  She published hundreds of poems in widely-circulating newspapers, magazines, and anthologies as well as in eighteen volumes of poems, two of which she co-authored with her husband, the poet John James Piatt (also known as \u201cJ.J.\u201d).<ref>Paula Bernat Bennett, ed., ''Palace-Burner: The Selected Poetry of Sarah Piatt'' (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001), xvii-xviii; xxiv-xxv; \u201cSarah Morgan Bryan Piatt (1836-1919),\u201d Faith Barrett and Christanne Miller, eds., ''\u201cWords for the Hour\u201d: A New Anthology of American Civil War Poetry'' (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005), 331; Karen L.

The loss had a profound impact on her life and outlook, as evident in her poetry. {{sfn|Radcliffe College|1971|p=63}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\nShe then lived on various Kentucky plantations with relatives, accompanied by her mother's nurse, an African American slave.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} For a time, she lived with her grandmother, and then later went to live with her father at the home of his new wife.{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=328}} Eventually, Piatt's father placed her and a younger sister in the care of their aunt, Mrs. Annie Boone, who lived in [[New Castle, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\n\nIn New Castle, Piatt attended Henry Female College, graduating in 1854.<ref>Bennett, Introduction, 2001, p. xxiii</ref>{{sfn|Ridpath|1906|p=289}} She became an avid reader, and was especially fond of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and [[Lord Byron]], [[Thomas Moore]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Felicia Hemans]], and [[Robert Browning]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}{{sfn|Renker|2016|p=236}} While a student, Piatt began publishing her poetry in the local newspaper.{{sfn|Larson|2011|p=189}}\n\n==Career==\nWhen [[George D. Prentice]], writer, poet, and editor of the ''[[Louisville Journal]],'' encountered Piatt's poetry, he immediately recognized her talent and skill. In 1855 he wrote to her: \"I now say emphatically to you again . . . that, if you are entirely true to yourself, and if your life be spared, you will, in the maturity of your powers, be the first poet of your sex in the United States. I say this not as what I think, but what I know.\"{{sfn|The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review, Volume 3|1891|p=401}} Prentice became Piatt's mentor and advocate, publishing many of her poems in his newspaper.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}} She also began sending her work to <i>The [[New York Ledger]]</i>, a popular and important periodical with a national circulation.<ref>''The Early Poems of Sarah Morgan Bryan (Piatt) in the New York Ledger, 1857-1860'' Professor Elizabeth Renker, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>\n\nOn June 18, 1861, she married aspiring poet John James Piatt (also known as \"J.J.\"), whom she had met through Prentice.{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} The couple relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]] where J.J. had accepted a clerk position in the U.S. Treasury.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} During this period they published a collection featuring both of their poetry, <i>The Nests at Washington</i> (1864). This was J.J.'s second book (following the 1861 <i>Poems by Two Friends</i> with William Dean Howells) and Sarah's first.{{sfn|Ridpath|Ridpath Library of Universal Literature, Volume 18|1899|p=n.p.}}\n\nIn July 1867, they moved to [[Ohio]], where J.J. worked for [[Cincinnati]] newspapers. They made their home on a part of the old estate of [[William Henry Harrison]] in [[North Bend, Ohio]], a few miles south of [[Cincinnati]], on the [[Ohio River]]. The family shuttled back and forth to Washington D.C. on a few occasions,{{sfn|Barrett|Miller|2005|p=331}} such as when J.J. worked for the postal service. From 1870-1876, Piatt and the children joined J.J. in Washington D.C. in the winters where he was serving as librarian of the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}} During this time, Sarah's poems also appeared in the Washington, D.C. weekly newspaper <i>The Capital</i>, founded by Donn Piatt, her cousin by marriage.<ref>''The Capital, 1871-1880 (Sarah Piatt Recovery Project), The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/90925, accessed 27 March 2020''</ref>\n\nHer first independent collection of poetry, ''A Woman's Poems'', appeared anonymously in 1871. This came to be her best known work, made famous by Bayard Taylor's book, ''The Echo Club''.{{sfn|Townsend|Townsend|1913|p=303}} The volume was followed several more, including ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles'' (1874); ''That New World'' (1876); ''Poems in Company with Children'' (1877); and ''Dramatic Persons and Moods'' (1878). During this period, Piatt also contributed to many prominent American magazines, such as ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]].''{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=569}}\n\nIn 1882, the Piatts moved to Queenstown (now [[Cobh]]) Ireland, as J.J. had accepted the position of [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of the U.S. to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], a job he held for eleven years.{{sfn|Lauter|Alberti|Yarborough|2009|p=741}} While abroad, Sarah wrote many poems inspired by her time in Ireland. She continued publishing poetry collections, including ''An Irish Garland'' ([[Edinburgh]], 1884), a volume of her ''Selected Poems'' ([[London]], 1885), ''In Primrose Time: a New Irish Garland'' (London, 1886), ''The Witch in the Glass, and Other Poems'' (London, 1889), and ''An Irish Wild-Flower'' (London, 1891), all of which were issued simultaneously in the U.S. {{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=570}} Sarah and J.J. also published another volume featuring both of their work, ''The Children Out-of-Doors: a Book of Verses'' (Edinburgh, 1884).\n\n==Personal life==\n\nPiatt was the mother of Marian (b 1862); Victor (1864); Donn (1867); Fred (1869); Guy (1871); Louis (1875); and Cecil (1878) as well as at least one infant child and possibly others in infancy or through miscarriage. Victor died in a tragic fireworks accident in 1874, and Louis drowned in a boating accident in 1884 while the Piatts were living in Ireland.  {{sfn|Michaels|1999|p=11-12}}\n\nAfter J.J.'s death in 1917, Piatt removed to her son Cecil's home in [[Caldwell, New Jersey|Caldwell]], [[New Jersey]], where she died of [[pneumonia]] on December 22, 1919.{{sfn|Stevenson|1922|p=3893}}{{sfn|McHenry|1980|p=327}} She and J.J. are buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].{{sfn|James|James|Boyer|1971|p=64}}\n\n==Themes and reception==\nChildren were a common theme in Piatt's poems.{{sfn|Frank|2007|p=134}}\n\nHer biographer, in [[Richard Henry Stoddard]]'s ''Poets' Homes'', stated:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=183}} {{quote|text=\"It is since her marriage, in June, 1861,\" says Mrs.  \"that her more individual characteristics of style have manifested themselves, especially the dramatic element, so delicate, subtle and strong, which asserts her intellectual kinship with Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\"}}\n\nWrites [[William Dean Howells]]:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}} {{quote|text=\"In the rush of these hopeless tears, this heart-broken scorn of comfort, this unreconcilable patience of grief, is the drama of the race's affliction; in the utter desolation of one woman's sorrow, the universal anguish of mortality is expressed. It is not pessimism; it does not assume to be any sort of philosophy or system; it is simply the bitter truth, to a phrase, of human experience through which all men must pass, and the reader need not be told that such poems were lived before they were written.\"}}\n\nAnother admirer of Piatt's verse, in a critical survey of the literature of Ohio, (1903) said of the author and her work:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}{{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt is a woman of original and exceptional genius \u2014 a poet whose name shines in American literature, 'Like some great jewel full of fire.' She is unrivaled, in her province of song, by any living writer of her sex, whether native to this country or of foreign birth. . . . She is inimitable in her own vivid, bold, and suggestive invention and manner. Whatever she writes has meaning \u2014 and the significance is often deep \u2014 sometimes strange and elusive \u2014 never commonplace. . . . Mrs. Piatt's rare artistic skill has been admired by many who appreciate the technical difficulties of the poetic craft.\"}}\n\nEqually emphatic is the praise accorded by a contemporary English critic, who, in an article contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|London Saturday Review]]'', commenting on the volume of select verse entitled ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles, and Other Poems,'' said:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=184}}  {{quote|text=\"Of all the concourse of women singers Mrs. Piatt is the most racy and, in a word, the most American. . . . The new selections of her poems should be most welcome to all who seek in American poetry something more than a pale reflex of the British commodity. . . . Her poems, with all their whim and inconstancy of mood, are charmingly sincere, artless, piquant, and full of quaint surprise.\"}}\n\nIn like commendatory strain, another English critic, reviewing the same book in the ''Pictorial World'' (London), pronounced her verse, \"not easy to equal, much less to surpass, on either side of the Atlantic,\" and characterized her poetical achievement in the following words:\u2014{{sfn|Venable|1909|p=185}} {{quote|text=\"Mrs. Piatt studies no model, and takes no pattern for her work; she simply expresses herself; hence her verse is just the transparent mantle of her individuality. The natural refinement, the ready sympathy, the tender sentiment, the quiet grace of a thoroughly womanly woman reveal themselves quite unconsciously in every poem; and the musical quality of the verse increases the impression that the reader is listening to the heartutterances of one of the Imogens or Mirandas to be met with now seldom outside the radiant land where Shakespeare's imagination reigns supreme. . . . Mrs. Piatt will, we doubt not, as her poems become known to English readers, become popular, or, we should rather say, dear to a wide circle mainly composed of members of her own sex, for she supplies the adequate expression for women whose hearts are tender and true like her own.\"}}\n\n==Selected works==\n* '' A Woman's Poems.'' 1871\n* ''A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles.'' 1874\n* ''That New World, & Other Poems.'' 1877\n* ''Poems in Company with Children.
