A range of diseases can cause cachexia, most commonly [[cancer]], [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure,]] [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[AIDS]]. Systemic inflammation from these conditions can cause detrimental changes to metabolism and body composition. In contrast to weight loss from inadequate caloric intake, cachexia causes mostly muscle loss instead of fat loss. Diagnosis of cachexia can be difficult due to the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria. Cachexia can improve with treatment of the underlying illness but other treatment approaches have limited benefit. Cachexia is associated with increased mortality and poor quality of life.\n\nThe term is from [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''kakos'', \"bad\", and \u1f15\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ''hexis'', \"condition\".\n\n==Causes==\nCachexia can be caused by diverse medical conditions, but is most often associated with end-stage [[cancer]], known as ''cancer cachexia''. About 50% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia. Those with upper gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers have the highest frequency of developing a cachexic symptom. Prevalence of cachexia rises in more advanced stages and is estimated to affect 80% of terminal cancer patients.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fearon KC, Moses AG | title = Cancer cachexia | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 73\u201381 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12163211 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00235-8 }}</ref> \n\n[[Congestive heart failure]], [[AIDS]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,]] and [[chronic kidney disease]] are other conditions that often cause cachexia.<ref name=Ebner-2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebner N, Springer J, Kalantar-Zadeh K, Lainscak M, Doehner W, Anker SD, von Haehling S | title = Mechanism and novel therapeutic approaches to wasting in chronic disease | journal = Maturitas | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 199\u2013206 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23664695 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.03.014 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/3420540 }}</ref> Cachexia can also be the result of advanced stages of [[cystic fibrosis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[motor neuron disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[dementia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[multiple system atrophy]], [[mercury poisoning]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[celiac disease]] as well as other systemic diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meresse B, Ripoche J, Heyman M, Cerf-Bensussan N | title = Celiac disease: from oral tolerance to intestinal inflammation, autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis | journal = Mucosal Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8\u201323 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19079330 | doi = 10.1038/mi.2008.75 }}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Morley JE, Thomas DR, Wilson MM | title = Cachexia: pathophysiology and clinical relevance | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 735\u201343 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16600922 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/83.4.735 }}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\nThe exact mechanism in which these diseases cause cachexia is poorly understood, and likely is multifactorial with multiple disease pathways involved. [[Inflammatory cytokine|Inflammatory cytokines]] appear to play a central role including [[TNF-alpha]] (which is also nicknamed 'cachexin' or 'cachectin'), [[Interferon|interferon gamma]]<!-- not needed (IFN\u03b3),--> and [[interleukin 6]]<!-- not needed (IL-6)-->. [[TNF-alpha]] has been shown to have direct catabolic effect on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through the [[ubiquitin proteasome pathway]]. This mechanism involves the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] leading to upregulation of the transcription factor [[NF-\u03baB]]. NF-\u03baB is a known regulator of the genes that encode cytokines and cytokine receptors. The increased production of cytokines induces proteolysis and breakdown of [[myofibrillar]] proteins.<ref name=Kumar/> Systemic inflammation also causes reduced protein synthesis through inhibition of the Akt/[[mTOR]] pathway.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Argil\u00e9s|first=Josep M.|last2=Campos|first2=Nefertiti|last3=Lopez-Pedrosa|first3=Jos\u00e9 M.|last4=Rueda|first4=Ricardo|last5=Rodriguez-Ma\u00f1as|first5=Leocadio|date=2016|title=Skeletal Muscle Regulates Metabolism via Interorgan Crosstalk: Roles in Health and Disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Directors Association|volume=17|issue=9|pages=789\u2013796|doi=10.1016/j.jamda.2016.04.019|issn=1538-9375|pmid=27324808}}</ref>\n\nAlthough many different tissues and cell types may be responsible for the increase in circulating cytokines, evidence indicates tumors themselves are an important source of factors that may promote cachexia in cancer.

However, laboratory metrics and cut-off values are not standardized across different diagnostic criteria. [[Acute phase reactant|Acute phase reactants]] (IL-6, IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-8, interferon-g) are sometimes measured but correlate poorly with outcomes. There are no [[biomarkers]] to identify people with cancer who may develop cachexia.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nIn the effort to better classify cachexia severity, several scoring systems have been proposed including the Cachexia Staging Score (CSS) and Cachexia Score (CASCO). The CSS takes into account weight loss, subjective reporting of muscle function, performance status, appetite loss, and laboratory changes to categorize patients into non-cachexia, pre-cachexia, cachexia and refractory cachexia. The Cachexia SCOre (CASCO) is another validated score that includes evaluation of body weight loss and composition, inflammation, metabolic disturbances, immunosuppression, physical performance, anorexia, and quality of life.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nEvaluation of changes in body composition is limited by the difficulty in measuring muscle mass and health in a non-invasive and cost-effective way.

A range of diseases can cause cachexia, most commonly [[cancer]], [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure,]] [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[AIDS]]. Systemic inflammation from these conditions can cause detrimental changes to metabolism and body composition. In contrast to weight loss from inadequate caloric intake, cachexia causes mostly muscle loss instead of fat loss. Diagnosis of cachexia can be difficult due to the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria. Cachexia can improve with treatment of the underlying illness but other treatment approaches have limited benefit. Cachexia is associated with increased mortality and poor quality of life.\n\nThe term is from [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''kakos'', \"bad\", and \u1f15\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ''hexis'', \"condition\".\n\n==Causes==\nCachexia can be caused by diverse medical conditions, but is most often associated with end-stage [[cancer]], known as ''cancer cachexia''. About 50% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia. Those with upper gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers have the highest frequency of developing a cachexic symptom. Prevalence of cachexia rises in more advanced stages and is estimated to affect 80% of terminal cancer patients.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fearon KC, Moses AG | title = Cancer cachexia | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 73\u201381 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12163211 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00235-8 }}</ref> \n\n[[Congestive heart failure]], [[AIDS]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,]] and [[chronic kidney disease]] are other conditions that often cause cachexia.<ref name=Ebner-2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebner N, Springer J, Kalantar-Zadeh K, Lainscak M, Doehner W, Anker SD, von Haehling S | title = Mechanism and novel therapeutic approaches to wasting in chronic disease | journal = Maturitas | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 199\u2013206 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23664695 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.03.014 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/3420540 }}</ref> Cachexia can also be the result of advanced stages of [[cystic fibrosis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[motor neuron disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[dementia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[multiple system atrophy]], [[mercury poisoning]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[celiac disease]] as well as other systemic diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meresse B, Ripoche J, Heyman M, Cerf-Bensussan N | title = Celiac disease: from oral tolerance to intestinal inflammation, autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis | journal = Mucosal Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8\u201323 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19079330 | doi = 10.1038/mi.2008.75 }}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Morley JE, Thomas DR, Wilson MM | title = Cachexia: pathophysiology and clinical relevance | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 735\u201343 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16600922 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/83.4.735 }}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\nThe exact mechanism in which these diseases cause cachexia is poorly understood, and likely is multifactorial with multiple disease pathways involved. [[Inflammatory cytokine|Inflammatory cytokines]] appear to play a central role including [[TNF-alpha]] (which is also nicknamed 'cachexin' or 'cachectin'), [[Interferon|interferon gamma]]<!-- not needed (IFN\u03b3),--> and [[interleukin 6]]<!-- not needed (IL-6)-->. [[TNF-alpha]] has been shown to have direct catabolic effect on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through the [[ubiquitin proteasome pathway]]. This mechanism involves the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] leading to upregulation of the transcription factor [[NF-\u03baB]]. NF-\u03baB is a known regulator of the genes that encode cytokines and cytokine receptors. The increased production of cytokines induces proteolysis and breakdown of [[myofibrillar]] proteins.<ref name=Kumar/> Systemic inflammation also causes reduced protein synthesis through inhibition of the Akt/[[mTOR]] pathway.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Argil\u00e9s|first=Josep M.|last2=Campos|first2=Nefertiti|last3=Lopez-Pedrosa|first3=Jos\u00e9 M.|last4=Rueda|first4=Ricardo|last5=Rodriguez-Ma\u00f1as|first5=Leocadio|date=2016|title=Skeletal Muscle Regulates Metabolism via Interorgan Crosstalk: Roles in Health and Disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Directors Association|volume=17|issue=9|pages=789\u2013796|doi=10.1016/j.jamda.2016.04.019|issn=1538-9375|pmid=27324808}}</ref>\n\nAlthough many different tissues and cell types may be responsible for the increase in circulating cytokines, evidence indicates tumors themselves are an important source of factors that may promote cachexia in cancer.

However, laboratory metrics and cut-off values are not standardized across different diagnostic criteria. [[Acute phase reactant|Acute phase reactants]] (IL-6, IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-8, interferon-g) are sometimes measured but correlate poorly with outcomes. There are no [[biomarkers]] to identify people with cancer who may develop cachexia.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nIn the effort to better classify cachexia severity, several scoring systems have been proposed including the Cachexia Staging Score (CSS) and Cachexia Score (CASCO). The CSS takes into account weight loss, subjective reporting of muscle function, performance status, appetite loss, and laboratory changes to categorize patients into non-cachexia, pre-cachexia, cachexia and refractory cachexia. The Cachexia SCOre (CASCO) is another validated score that includes evaluation of body weight loss and composition, inflammation, metabolic disturbances, immunosuppression, physical performance, anorexia, and quality of life.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nEvaluation of changes in body composition is limited by the difficulty in measuring muscle mass and health in a non-invasive and cost-effective way.
