The lyrics posit that a man who does not have his own car is a \"scrub\" (also known as a \"buster\") and is undesirable as a romantic or sexual partner. [[LaFace Records]] and [[Arista Records]] released it as the album's [[lead single]] on February 2, 1999. The song was written by [[Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs]] alongside former [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]] members, [[Kandi Burruss]] and [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle]]. The [[single version]] containing self-written rap by [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]] was not included on the album ''FanMail'', and later appeared in a slightly shorter edit on ''[[Now and Forever: The Hits]]'' and ''[[20 (TLC album)|20]]''. \"No Scrubs\" was the first time [[Rozonda Thomas|Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas]] took the sole [[lead vocals]] on any TLC single. The album version of the song won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n\"No Scrubs\" met with international success. It became TLC's third number-one single and eighth top 10 single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also earned them their second Grammy Award nomination for [[Record of the Year]]. \"No Scrubs\" is one of TLC's [[signature song]]s and was the second-biggest Hot 100 single of 1999 in the U.S., only behind [[Cher]]'s \"[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]\", according to ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end charts. On the decade end chart for 1990\u201399, \"No Scrubs\" was ranked at number 33. The single was certified Platinum in the UK and Platinum in New Zealand.\n\n==Background==\nThe song was initially written by [[Kandi Burruss]] on an old envelope while sitting in her car, in which she \"freestyled the entire song while just driving down a highway: the verse, hook, pre-chorus, the whole thing.\"<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The song was initially meant for Burruss and [[Tameka Cottle]] to record together, however [[Dallas Austin]] decided to give the song to [[TLC (group)|TLC]] as their first single for ''[[FanMail]]'', with [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] singing the lead vocals.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> Austin further emphasized that the song was a breakthrough for Chilli, as he felt that \"It was a great way to expose her; being a secondary vocalist was not just her purpose.\"<ref name=\"FanMail20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499567/tlc-fanmail-interview-20th-anniversary-dallas-austin|title=TLC's 'FanMail' Turns 20: A Track-By-Track Retrospective With the Girl Group and Behind-the-Scenes Collaborators|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Gracie|first=Bianca|date=February 22, 2019|access-date=October 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223013401/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499567/tlc-fanmail-interview-20th-anniversary-dallas-austin|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\"No Scrubs\" is described by ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' as \"a scathing critique on men at the bottom of the dating pool\".<ref name=\"VibeFanMail\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2019/02/tlc-fanmail-anniversary-digital-era-intimacy|title=20 Years Of TLC's 'FanMail': A Futurist Prelude To Digital Era Intimacy|last=Whaley|first=Nateleg\u00e9|website=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=February 23, 2019|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2014, Cottle described the process of creating the song with Burruss:<ref name=\"RollingStone2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tameka-tiny-harris-on-michael-jacksons-xscape-connection-244108/|title=Tameka 'Tiny' Harris on Michael Jackson's Xscape Connection|last=Murray|first=Nick|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=May 1, 2014|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref><blockquote>I wanna talk about a screw-up, a guy that's a screw-up that doesn't have their own business in order.

The lyrics posit that a man who does not have his own car is a \"scrub\" (also known as a \"buster\") and is undesirable as a romantic or sexual partner. [[LaFace Records]] and [[Arista Records]] released it as the album's [[lead single]] on February 2, 1999. The song was written by [[Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs]] alongside former [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]] members, [[Kandi Burruss]] and [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle]]. The [[single version]] containing self-written rap by [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]] was not included on the album ''FanMail'', and later appeared in a slightly shorter edit on ''[[Now and Forever: The Hits]]'' and ''[[20 (TLC album)|20]]''. \"No Scrubs\" was the first time [[Rozonda Thomas|Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas]] took the sole [[lead vocals]] on any TLC single. The album version of the song won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n\"No Scrubs\" met with international success. It became TLC's third number-one single and eighth top 10 single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also earned them their second Grammy Award nomination for [[Record of the Year]]. \"No Scrubs\" is one of TLC's [[signature song]]s and was the second-biggest Hot 100 single of 1999 in the U.S., only behind [[Cher]]'s \"[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]\", according to ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end charts. On the decade end chart for 1990\u201399, \"No Scrubs\" was ranked at number 33. The single was certified Platinum in the UK and Platinum in New Zealand.\n\n==Background==\nThe song was initially written by [[Kandi Burruss]] on an old envelope while sitting in her car, in which she \"freestyled the entire song while just driving down a highway: the verse, hook, pre-chorus, the whole thing.\"<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The song was initially meant for Burruss and [[Tameka Cottle]] to record together, however [[Dallas Austin]] decided to give the song to [[TLC (group)|TLC]] as their first single for ''[[FanMail]]'', with [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] singing the lead vocals.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> Austin further emphasized that the song was a breakthrough for Chilli, as he felt that \"It was a great way to expose her; being a secondary vocalist was not just her purpose.\"<ref name=\"FanMail20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499567/tlc-fanmail-interview-20th-anniversary-dallas-austin|title=TLC's 'FanMail' Turns 20: A Track-By-Track Retrospective With the Girl Group and Behind-the-Scenes Collaborators|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Gracie|first=Bianca|date=February 22, 2019|access-date=October 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223013401/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499567/tlc-fanmail-interview-20th-anniversary-dallas-austin|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\"No Scrubs\" is described by ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' as \"a scathing critique on men at the bottom of the dating pool\".<ref name=\"VibeFanMail\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2019/02/tlc-fanmail-anniversary-digital-era-intimacy|title=20 Years Of TLC's 'FanMail': A Futurist Prelude To Digital Era Intimacy|last=Whaley|first=Nateleg\u00e9|website=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=February 23, 2019|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2014, Cottle described the process of creating the song with Burruss:<ref name=\"RollingStone2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tameka-tiny-harris-on-michael-jacksons-xscape-connection-244108/|title=Tameka 'Tiny' Harris on Michael Jackson's Xscape Connection|last=Murray|first=Nick|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=May 1, 2014|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref><blockquote>I wanna talk about a screw-up, a guy that's a screw-up that doesn't have their own business in order.

[[Tionne Watkins|T-Boz]] described how the group went all out during production of the video, with her being specifically excited about \"wearing the all-white outfit\", while [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] initially felt apprehensive about going on the swing, constantly practicing before the shoot until she did not want to get off afterwards.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The scene at the end of the video showing the three fighting each other and being silly was a result of the tube moving and the group attempting to fight against the moving set, with Chilli and Left Eye hitting each other by accident.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> American [[drag queen]] [[RuPaul]] also appeared off-camera to see them.<ref name=\"FanMail20\"/> The video is stylistically similar to [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Janet Jackson]]'s music video, \"[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]\", as well as the [[Busta Rhymes]] and Janet Jackson music video, \"[[What's It Gonna Be?!]]\", which was also directed by Williams.<ref name=\"VibeNoScrubs\"/>\n\n===Synopsis===\nThe video features the women in three different colored space-suits: white, black, silver, and Left Eye in blue.
