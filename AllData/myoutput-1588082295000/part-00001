He served from 1965 to 1971 as a Republican member of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] and from 1971 to 1981 as a member of the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] representing the state's [[Pennsylvania Senate, District 50|50th district]]. He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until he committed suicide during a press conference.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted \nfor accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury, and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987.\n\nOn January 22, 1987, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters, by shooting himself with a [[.357 Magnum]] revolver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1638F930A15752C0A961948260|title=Official calls in press and kills himself|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=January 23, 1987|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}</ref> Dwyer's [[suicide]] was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.\n\nThroughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted, and that his conviction resulted from political persecution. In 2010, the prosecution's main witness, [[William Trickett Smith]], maintained that his testimony at Dwyer's 1986 trial\u2014in which he stated that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted this offer\u2014was truthful, and that he had committed perjury at his own 1985 trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe; moreover, Smith stated in October 1984\u2014the year before his own trial\u2014that he offered Dwyer a bribe, which Dwyer accepted <ref name=\"Honest Man\">{{Cite web|url = http://dwyermovie.com/|title = Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer (documentary movie)|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Eighty Four Films|last = |first =}}</ref><ref name=\"Latrobe\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42456853/latrobe_bulletin/|title=New evidence challenges Dwyer|last=Morris|first=David|date=February 18, 1987|work=Latrobe Bulletin|access-date=January 17, 2020|url-status=live|pages=4}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, former U.S. Attorney James West, who prosecuted Dwyer, affirmed Dwyer's guilt<ref>http://www.dwyermovie.com/press</ref>, stating that \"the evidence against Dwyer was overwhelming and indisputable.\"<ref>https://www.pennlive.com/editorials/2010/10/filmmaker_on_dwyer_guilty_as_c.html</ref>.

Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21-page prepared text later described as a \"rambling polemic about the criminal justice system\".<ref name=\"PennLiveNewFilm\" /> It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him.<ref name=\"philly-archives1987-01-24\" /> Dwyer stated that Attorney West purposely had Dwyer's trial not in Harrisburg but in Williamsport, since in Williamsport the jury pool was the most uneducated in the state of Pennsylvania.<ref>[https://www.dropbox.com/s/sao4iw2mrb76693/Dwyer_Final_Statements.pdf?dl=0 Dropbox - Dwyer_Final_Statements.pdf - Simplify your life<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Dwyer spoke out against the death penalty and expressed regret for voting in favor of it while he was in the Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, \"Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet.\"<ref name=\"philly-archives1987-01-23\" />\n\nGiven the inflammatory nature of portions of Dwyer's text, press secretary Horshock had considered interrupting him outright to stop him but concluded that he would hold his own press conference after Dwyer's. \"I had to make it known that I was not aware of the content of the statement. I didn't want it to be thought that I wrote that for him.\"<ref name=\"PittsburghPress\" />\n\nUpon reaching the final page of his statement, which had not been distributed to the press nor press secretary Horshock in advance, Dwyer paused. \"...and I'm on the last page now, and I don't have enough to pass out, but Duke [Horshock], I'll leave this here, and you can make copies for the people; there's a few extra copies here right now.\"<ref>Video containing audio of final words ([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6686827830708949101 link])</ref> Dwyer continued,\n\n{{quote|I thank the good Lord for giving me 47 years of exciting challenges, stimulating experiences, many happy occasions and most of all[,] the finest wife and children any man could ever desire.\n\nNow my life has changed for no apparent reason. People who call and write are exasperated and feel helpless. They know I am innocent and want to help, but in this nation, the worlds [''sic''] greatest democracy, there is nothing they can do to prevent me from being punished for a crime they know I did not commit. Some who have called have said that I am a modern day [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]].\n\nJudge Muir is also noted for his medieval sentences. I face a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison and a $305,000 fine for being innocent. Judge Muir has already told the press that he felt \"invigorated\" when we were found guilty and that he plans to imprison me as a \"deterrant\" to other public officials. But it wouldn't be a deterrant [''sic''] because every public official who knows me knows that I am innocent. It wouldn't be legitimate punishment because I've done nothing wrong. Since I'm a victim of political persecution, my prison would simply be an American [[Gulag]].\n\nI ask those that believe in me to continue to extend friendship and prayer to my family, to work untiringly for the creation of a true justice system here in the United States, and to press on with the efforts to vindicate me, so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me.\n\nWe were confident that right and truth would prevail and I would be acquitted and we would devote the rest of our lives working to create a justice system here in the United States. The guilty verdict has strengthened that resolve. But as we've discussed our plans to expose the warts of our legal system[,] people have said, 'Why bother? No one cares, you'll look foolish, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'', the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], and others have been publicizing cases like yours for years and it doesn't bother anyone.'}}\n\nAt this point, Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows:\n\n{{quote|I've repeatedly said that I'm not going to resign as State Treasurer. After many hours of thought and meditation I've made a decision that should not be an example to anyone because it is unique to my situation. Last May I told you that after the trial, I would give you the story of the decade. To those of you who are shallow, the events of this morning will be that story.

Group W's news cameraman William L. \"Bill\" Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to air the audio with a freeze-frame of the gun in Dwyer's mouth.

He served from 1965 to 1971 as a Republican member of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] and from 1971 to 1981 as a member of the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] representing the state's [[Pennsylvania Senate, District 50|50th district]]. He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until he committed suicide during a press conference.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted \nfor accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury, and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987.\n\nOn January 22, 1987, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters, by shooting himself with a [[.357 Magnum]] revolver.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1638F930A15752C0A961948260|title=Official calls in press and kills himself|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=January 23, 1987|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}</ref> Dwyer's [[suicide]] was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.\n\nThroughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted, and that his conviction resulted from political persecution. In 2010, the prosecution's main witness, [[William Trickett Smith]], maintained that his testimony at Dwyer's 1986 trial\u2014in which he stated that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted this offer\u2014was truthful, and that he had committed perjury at his own 1985 trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe; moreover, Smith stated in October 1984\u2014the year before his own trial\u2014that he offered Dwyer a bribe, which Dwyer accepted <ref name=\"Honest Man\">{{Cite web|url = http://dwyermovie.com/|title = Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer (documentary movie)|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Eighty Four Films|last = |first =}}</ref><ref name=\"Latrobe\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42456853/latrobe_bulletin/|title=New evidence challenges Dwyer|last=Morris|first=David|date=February 18, 1987|work=Latrobe Bulletin|access-date=January 17, 2020|url-status=live|pages=4}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:R.

This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, \"Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet.\"<ref name=\"philly-archives1987-01-23\" />\n\nGiven the inflammatory nature of portions of Dwyer's text, press secretary Horshock had considered interrupting him outright to stop him but concluded that he would hold his own press conference after Dwyer's. \"I had to make it known that I was not aware of the content of the statement. I didn't want it to be thought that I wrote that for him.\"<ref name=\"PittsburghPress\" />\n\nUpon reaching the final page of his statement, which had not been distributed to the press nor press secretary Horshock in advance, Dwyer paused. \"...and I'm on the last page now, and I don't have enough to pass out, but Duke [Horshock], I'll leave this here, and you can make copies for the people; there's a few extra copies here right now.\"<ref>Video containing audio of final words ([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6686827830708949101 link])</ref> Dwyer continued,\n\n{{quote|I thank the good Lord for giving me 47 years of exciting challenges, stimulating experiences, many happy occasions and most of all[,] the finest wife and children any man could ever desire.\n\nNow my life has changed for no apparent reason. People who call and write are exasperated and feel helpless. They know I am innocent and want to help, but in this nation, the worlds [''sic''] greatest democracy, there is nothing they can do to prevent me from being punished for a crime they know I did not commit. Some who have called have said that I am a modern day [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]].\n\nJudge Muir is also noted for his medieval sentences. I face a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison and a $305,000 fine for being innocent. Judge Muir has already told the press that he felt \"invigorated\" when we were found guilty and that he plans to imprison me as a \"deterrant\" to other public officials. But it wouldn't be a deterrant [''sic''] because every public official who knows me knows that I am innocent. It wouldn't be legitimate punishment because I've done nothing wrong. Since I'm a victim of political persecution, my prison would simply be an American [[Gulag]].\n\nI ask those that believe in me to continue to extend friendship and prayer to my family, to work untiringly for the creation of a true justice system here in the United States, and to press on with the efforts to vindicate me, so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me.\n\nWe were confident that right and truth would prevail and I would be acquitted and we would devote the rest of our lives working to create a justice system here in the United States. The guilty verdict has strengthened that resolve. But as we've discussed our plans to expose the warts of our legal system[,] people have said, 'Why bother? No one cares, you'll look foolish, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'', the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], and others have been publicizing cases like yours for years and it doesn't bother anyone.'}}\n\nAt this point, Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows:\n\n{{quote|I've repeatedly said that I'm not going to resign as State Treasurer. After many hours of thought and meditation I've made a decision that should not be an example to anyone because it is unique to my situation. Last May I told you that after the trial, I would give you the story of the decade. To those of you who are shallow, the events of this morning will be that story. But to those of you with depth and concern the real story will be what I hope and pray results from this morning\u2013in the coming months and years[,] the development of a true justice system here in the United States.

Please tell my story on every radio and television station and in every newspaper and magazine in the U.S. Please leave immediately if you have a weak stomach or mind since I don't want to cause physical or mental distress.
