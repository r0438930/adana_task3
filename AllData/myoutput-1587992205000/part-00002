Brooks\u2019 screenplay is wryly funny about human behaviour, keenly observing the awkward ways anxious people rub up against each other. Roxburgh and Mitchell give well-tuned comic performances and veteran actor Terry Norris steals scenes as the elderly private detective who joins the couple on their search.

Brooks knows that life is weirder than movies make out, but not her movies. She rebuts the conventional wisdom about a story needing a hero's journey.
