competitor and [[stunt performer]] who has won championships and [[X Games]] gold medals in several events, including [[AMA Supercross Championship|supercross]], [[motocross]], [[freestyle motocross]], and [[rallying|rally racing]]. He runs a show called ''[[Nitro Circus]]'', and previously competed in the [[NASCAR]] [[Nationwide Series]] for [[Roush Fenway Racing]] the [[Global RallyCross Championship]] for [[Subaru Rally Team USA]], and the [[Monster Jam]] circuit, in his own ''Pastrana 199'' truck.\n\nHe last competed in NASCAR in the [[Camping World Truck Series]], driving the No. 45 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] for [[Niece Motorsports]].\n\nPastrana replicated three of legendary daredevil [[Evel Knievel]]'s most famous jumps without injury in record-breaking fashion while in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/travis-pastrana-jumped-over-the-fountain-at-caesars-palace-and-broke-an-evel-knievel-record/</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nPastrana was born on October 8, 1983.

Pastrana also raced in the 2000 [[Motocross des Nations]]. He moved up to the 250cc class in 2002. His stand-up style, ability to spot jump combinations and great speed through the whoops make him easy to spot on the track. Although Pastrana has never won a 250cc race, his kindness to the fans and love of the sport still make him one of the most popular riders of all time. The Freestyle stunt riding started at a young age. At 13 years old Pastrana was already performing stunts during motocross racing, keeping the fans enthused and, later in life, leading to his career in [[freestyle motocross]].<!--POV?--> Pastrana has always raced and competed on Suzuki motorcycles, and remains fiercely loyal to the brand. He races with Team Cernic's Suzuki. All of his motorcycles and rally cars carry the number 199. He even sponsored a [[Monster Jam]] truck called [[Pastrana 199]] and ''Nitro Circus'', after the show on MTV. On October 3, 2014, Pastrana competed in the first ever Red Bull Straight Rhythm competition, riding in the Open Class on a Suzuki RM-Z 450 with a Honda CR500 engine swap. He dubbed the bike the RM-Zilla. However, Pastrana was eliminated early on in the bracket and [[James Stewart Jr.]] took the win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motorsportstalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/20/watch-james-stewart-travis-pastrana-compete-at-red-bull-straight-rhythm-nbc-4-p-m-et/|title=WATCH: James Stewart, Travis Pastrana compete at Red Bull Straight Rhythm (NBC, 4 p.m. ET)|last=Smith|first=Shawn|date=December 20, 2014|website=motorsportstalk.nbcsports.com|publisher=NBC Sports|access-date=|accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Team Puerto Rico ==\nRobert Pastrana, Travis' father, is of Puerto Rican descent,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/cg2-arc-cd1c0479-0bb8-5da9-a974-890a685b3d8f-20120823-story.html|title=Pastrana family matriarch dies|last=Writer|first=ALEX JACKSON, Staff|work=capitalgazette.com|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}</ref> which made Travis directly eligible to represent [[Puerto Rico]] in international competition.<ref name=\"Puerto Rican\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/febrero/28/deportes1442332.html|title=Travis Pastrana estar\u00e1 en el supercross del Saprissa|author=Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez C.|date=February 28, 2008|newspaper=La Naci\u00f3n|language=Spanish|trans-title=Travis Pastrana will be in the Saprissa supercross.

He also scores the highest-ever Freestyle run score of 99.00 points.\n* 2000&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won the gold medal for the second time, and attempted his first-ever backflip on a motorcycle but broke his foot.\n* 2001&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won his third gold, still the only person to win the event.\n* 2002&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana was out with an injury. Mike Metzger became the first rider other than Pastrana to win Freestyle.\n* 2003&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana claimed his fourth gold and became the second rider ever to complete a 360 in competition.\n* 2004&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana crashed while trying a 50&nbsp;ft (15m) 360, sustaining a concussion, but was able to compete the next day and won a silver medal. Nate Adams took the gold becoming the first rider to beat Pastrana. Before this event, he had won a bronze medal in Best Trick, performing a One-Handed 360, a Superman Seat Grab, and an Indian Air Back flip.\n* 2005&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won his fifth gold medal in Freestyle and also attempted the first-ever Backflip Barspin on a motorcycle, however the bike failed and he resorted to a regular bike and performed a Backflip Saran Wrap to take a silver medal in Best Trick.\n* 2006&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana became the third athlete to win three gold medals at a single X Games event. He won golds in MotoX Best Trick, MotoX Freestyle, and Rally Car Racing. Pastrana also performed the first Double Backflip in competition, scoring a 98.60, the highest score in the Best Trick competition at X Games.\n* 2007&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana took bronze in Rally after sliding into the other driver's area while inside the Home Depot Center. He was disqualified but retained his medal. He also competed in the first MotoX Racing event at X Games, but did not achieve a medal after two false starts in the heat race and last-chance qualifier.\n* 2008&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana took gold in Rally and competed in the Speed & Style event, but did not place.\n* 2009&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana attempted a rodeo 720 at X Games 15 in the Moto X Best Trick Event. He crashed on his first attempt and withdrew from his second after experiencing blurred vision. He placed 4th for his efforts.  He took silver in Rally after being defeated by rookie and former [[IndyCar]]/[[Indy 500]] champion [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]. On November 8, Pastrana landed the famous Rodeo 720, and filmed it in his newest movie, ''Nitro Circus&nbsp;\u2013 Country Fried''. Once he landed the trick, he named it the TP7, due to the fact that he was 20 degrees short of 720.\n* 2010&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won Moto X Freestyle, landing yet another Double Backflip, the first one done at an X Games Freestyle. Pastrana also won Moto X Speed & Style, beating silver medalist Nate Adams by a landslide. Pastrana had problems with his Rally Car during competition, costing him gold at Rally Car Racing and a chance to compete in the new event, Super Rally.\n* 2011&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana launched \"Pastranathon\"; which included Best Trick, a race at [[Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis|Lucas Oil Raceway]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Nationwide Series]], and RallyCross at [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles. However, Pastranathon seemed to be done when, in XGames Best Trick, Pastrana attempted the Rodeo 720, also known as the TP7, and failed, landing on his right leg. He broke his foot and ankle, and was taken to a local hospital. Pastrana was thought to be done, and backed out of the NASCAR race. His team worked diligently to get Pastrana in the RallyCross event. A special hand-controlled device was made for the steering wheel, and Pastrana had to relearn to drive the car using the new controls. Pastrana won a qualifying event, then finished 4th in the final after a crash on the last lap.\n* 2012&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana participated in another RallyCross event. For this, he sent a challenge video to [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], who was at that time the eight-time-consecutive [[World Rally Championship]] champion, asking him to race against him in the event. His invitation worked well; Loeb not only participated, but his team made a new vehicle specifically for the event. Pastrana's effort ended up only to be in vain when he was forced to retire by an accident caused by Andy Scott in the very first heat of the race. Pastrana could only watch Loeb \u2013 who dominated the whole race and got his first gold medal \u2013 in the sideways during the remainder of the event, and never actually raced against him as he had planned for.\n* 2015&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana made his [[Stadium Super Trucks]] debut at [[X Games Austin 2015]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/events/2015/austin/article/12927656/x-games-austin-preview-road-truck-racing|title=Off-Road Truck Racing: Teen Drivers|work=[[X Games]]|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref> Pastrana finished last in his heat race, and was forced to run the last-chance qualifier, finishing second and advancing to the final race; he finished ninth in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/events/2015/austin/results/400766423/off-road-truck-racing|title=Off Road Truck Racing|work=[[X Games]]|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Rallying==\n[[File:Alexrally.JPG|thumb|Pastrana's [[Subaru Impreza WRX STI]].]]\n\nIn 2003, Pastrana opened a [[rallying]] career in the [[Race of Champions]], and began driving for the [[Subaru]]-backed Vermont SportsCar rally team in 2004. Starting in 2006, Pastrana was signed by Subaru to lead their new Subru Rally TeaUSA, being paired once again with veteran co-driver [[Christian Edstrom]]. On August 5, 2006 Pastrana won the gold medal in the first rally car competition at the X Games, edging out rally legend [[Colin McRae]]  by 0.53 seconds after McRae rolled his car through the last jump.\n\nPastrana and Edstrom clinched the 2006 [[Rally America]] National Series overall and open class championship on October 22, 2006 during day one of the Lake Superior Performance Rally. The team finished out the 2006 series with another first-place victory at the Wild West Rally in Olympia, Washington on December 31, 2006.\n\nOn December 16, 2006 Pastrana competed at the [[2006 Race of Champions]] at the [[Stade de France]] in Paris. He represented the United States in the Nations' Cup by himself, after injuries forced teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] and his replacement [[Scott Speed]] to withdraw.\n\nFebruary 19, 2007 brought news that Pastrana's longtime co-driver Edstrom had announced a sabbatical to concentrate on his career and family. Although former McRae co-driver [[Derek Ringer]] competed with Pastrana for the 100 Acre Wood Rally in Salem, Missouri and Rally America, he did not announce a permanent co-driver.\n\n[[File:Travis Pastrana - 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally.jpg|thumb|Pastrana driving a classic Ford Escort Mk1 at the 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages.]]\nIn September 2008, Pastrana took part in the ''Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally'', a round of the [[Scottish Rally Championship]] centred in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in Scotland. Derek Ringer was his co-driver and they entered in a historic [[Ford Escort RS1600]]. He was one of a number of celebrity drivers to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007.\n\nOn August 29, 2009 Pastrana claimed the overall victory at [[Ojibwe Forests Rally]], his fifth of the 2009 [[Rally America]] season.

The truck was owned by Live Nation/FELD Motorsports and sponsored by Pastrana. The truck was originally driven by Paul Cohen, then later driven by Chad Tingler, Courtney Jolly and Cam McQueen. Pastrana made his monster truck debut on October 18, 2006 in the Pastrana 199 monster truck at the 2006 [[Monster Jam]]. Also, on an episode of ''Nitro Circus'', Pastrana attempted to backflip the ''Nitro Circus''-themed monster truck. Though unsuccessful, he walked away without injury.

Pastrana himself competed in the freestyle competition of the event debuting the \"Nitro Circus\" truck, finishing in a three-way tie for 5th place in a field of 24 trucks. On February 27, 2010 in Jacksonville, Florida, Cam McQueen successfully executed a backflip in the Nitro Circus monster truck during the freestyle competition, making Nitro Circus the first to do so in competition.

competitor and [[stunt performer]] who has won championships and [[X Games]] gold medals in several events, including [[AMA Supercross Championship|supercross]], [[motocross]], [[freestyle motocross]], and [[rallying|rally racing]]. He runs a show called ''[[Nitro Circus]]'', and previously competed in the [[NASCAR]] [[Nationwide Series]] for [[Roush Fenway Racing]] the [[Global RallyCross Championship]] for [[Subaru Rally Team USA]], and the [[Monster Jam]] circuit, in his own ''Pastrana 199'' truck.\n\nHe last competed in NASCAR in the [[Camping World Truck Series]], driving the No. 45 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] for [[Niece Motorsports]].\n\nPastrana replicated three of legendary daredevil [[Evel Knievel]]'s most famous jumps without injury in record-breaking fashion while in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/travis-pastrana-jumped-over-the-fountain-at-caesars-palace-and-broke-an-evel-knievel-record/</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nPastrana was born on October 8, 1983.

Pastrana also raced in the 2000 [[Motocross des Nations]]. He moved up to the 250cc class in 2002. His stand-up style, ability to spot jump combinations and great speed through the whoops make him easy to spot on the track. Although Pastrana has never won a 250cc race, his kindness to the fans and love of the sport still make him one of the most popular riders of all time. The Freestyle stunt riding started at a young age. At 13 years old Pastrana was already performing stunts during motocross racing, keeping the fans enthused and, later in life, leading to his career in [[freestyle motocross]].<!--POV?--> Pastrana has always raced and competed on Suzuki motorcycles, and remains fiercely loyal to the brand. He races with Team Cernic's Suzuki. All of his motorcycles and rally cars carry the number 199. He even sponsored a [[Monster Jam]] truck called [[Pastrana 199]] and ''Nitro Circus'', after the show on MTV. On October 3, 2014, Pastrana competed in the first ever Red Bull Straight Rhythm competition, riding in the Open Class on a Suzuki RM-Z 450 with a Honda CR500 engine swap. He dubbed the bike the RM-Zilla.

He also scores the highest-ever Freestyle run score of 99.00 points.\n* 2000&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won the gold medal for the second time, and attempted his first-ever backflip on a motorcycle but broke his foot.\n* 2001&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won his third gold, still the only person to win the event.\n* 2002&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana was out with an injury. Mike Metzger became the first rider other than Pastrana to win Freestyle.\n* 2003&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana claimed his fourth gold and became the second rider ever to complete a 360 in competition.\n* 2004&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana crashed while trying a 50&nbsp;ft (15m) 360, sustaining a concussion, but was able to compete the next day and won a silver medal. Nate Adams took the gold becoming the first rider to beat Pastrana. Before this event, he had won a bronze medal in Best Trick, performing a One-Handed 360, a Superman Seat Grab, and an Indian Air Back flip.\n* 2005&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won his fifth gold medal in Freestyle and also attempted the first-ever Backflip Barspin on a motorcycle, however the bike failed and he resorted to a regular bike and performed a Backflip Saran Wrap to take a silver medal in Best Trick.\n* 2006&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana became the third athlete to win three gold medals at a single X Games event. He won golds in MotoX Best Trick, MotoX Freestyle, and Rally Car Racing. Pastrana also performed the first Double Backflip in competition, scoring a 98.60, the highest score in the Best Trick competition at X Games.\n* 2007&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana took bronze in Rally after sliding into the other driver's area while inside the Home Depot Center. He was disqualified but retained his medal. He also competed in the first MotoX Racing event at X Games, but did not achieve a medal after two false starts in the heat race and last-chance qualifier.\n* 2008&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana took gold in Rally and competed in the Speed & Style event, but did not place.\n* 2009&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana attempted a rodeo 720 at X Games 15 in the Moto X Best Trick Event. He crashed on his first attempt and withdrew from his second after experiencing blurred vision. He placed 4th for his efforts.  He took silver in Rally after being defeated by rookie and former [[IndyCar]]/[[Indy 500]] champion [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]. On November 8, Pastrana landed the famous Rodeo 720, and filmed it in his newest movie, ''Nitro Circus&nbsp;\u2013 Country Fried''. Once he landed the trick, he named it the TP7, due to the fact that he was 20 degrees short of 720.\n* 2010&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won Moto X Freestyle, landing yet another Double Backflip, the first one done at an X Games Freestyle. Pastrana also won Moto X Speed & Style, beating silver medalist Nate Adams by a landslide. Pastrana had problems with his Rally Car during competition, costing him gold at Rally Car Racing and a chance to compete in the new event, Super Rally.\n* 2011&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana launched \"Pastranathon\"; which included Best Trick, a race at [[Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis|Lucas Oil Raceway]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Nationwide Series]], and RallyCross at [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles. However, Pastranathon seemed to be done when, in XGames Best Trick, Pastrana attempted the Rodeo 720, also known as the TP7, and failed, landing on his right leg. He broke his foot and ankle, and was taken to a local hospital. Pastrana was thought to be done, and backed out of the NASCAR race. His team worked diligently to get Pastrana in the RallyCross event. A special hand-controlled device was made for the steering wheel, and Pastrana had to relearn to drive the car using the new controls. Pastrana won a qualifying event, then finished 4th in the final after a crash on the last lap.\n* 2012&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana participated in another RallyCross event. For this, he sent a challenge video to [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], who was at that time the eight-time-consecutive [[World Rally Championship]] champion, asking him to race against him in the event. His invitation worked well; Loeb not only participated, but his team made a new vehicle specifically for the event. Pastrana's effort ended up only to be in vain when he was forced to retire by an accident caused by Andy Scott in the very first heat of the race. Pastrana could only watch Loeb \u2013 who dominated the whole race and got his first gold medal \u2013 in the sideways during the remainder of the event, and never actually raced against him as he had planned for.\n* 2015&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana made his [[Stadium Super Trucks]] debut at [[X Games Austin 2015]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/events/2015/austin/article/12927656/x-games-austin-preview-road-truck-racing|title=Off-Road Truck Racing: Teen Drivers|work=[[X Games]]|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref> Pastrana finished last in his heat race, and was forced to run the last-chance qualifier, finishing second and advancing to the final race; he finished ninth in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/events/2015/austin/results/400766423/off-road-truck-racing|title=Off Road Truck Racing|work=[[X Games]]|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Rallying==\n[[File:Alexrally.JPG|thumb|Pastrana's [[Subaru Impreza WRX STI]].]]\n\nIn 2003, Pastrana opened a [[rallying]] career in the [[Race of Champions]], and began driving for the [[Subaru]]-backed Vermont SportsCar rally team in 2004. Starting in 2006, Pastrana was signed by Subaru to lead their new Subaru Rally Team USA, being paired once again with veteran co-driver [[Christian Edstrom]]. On August 5, 2006 Pastrana won the gold medal in the first rally car competition at the X Games, edging out rally legend [[Colin McRae]]  by 0.53 seconds after McRae rolled his car through the last jump.\n\nPastrana and Edstrom clinched the 2006 [[Rally America]] National Series overall and open class championship on October 22, 2006 during day one of the Lake Superior Performance Rally. The team finished out the 2006 series with another first-place victory at the Wild West Rally in Olympia, Washington on December 31, 2006.\n\nOn December 16, 2006 Pastrana competed at the [[2006 Race of Champions]] at the [[Stade de France]] in Paris. He represented the United States in the Nations' Cup by himself, after injuries forced teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] and his replacement [[Scott Speed]] to withdraw.\n\nFebruary 19, 2007 brought news that Pastrana's longtime co-driver Edstrom had announced a sabbatical to concentrate on his career and family. Although former McRae co-driver [[Derek Ringer]] competed with Pastrana for the 100 Acre Wood Rally in Salem, Missouri and Rally America, he did not announce a permanent co-driver.\n\n[[File:Travis Pastrana - 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally.jpg|thumb|Pastrana driving a classic Ford Escort Mk1 at the 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages.]]\nIn September 2008, Pastrana took part in the ''Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally'', a round of the [[Scottish Rally Championship]] centred in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in Scotland. Derek Ringer was his co-driver and they entered in a historic [[Ford Escort RS1600]]. He was one of a number of celebrity drivers to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007.\n\nOn August 29, 2009 Pastrana claimed the overall victory at [[Ojibwe Forests Rally]], his fifth of the 2009 [[Rally America]] season.

The truck was owned by Live Nation/FELD Motorsports and sponsored by Pastrana. The truck was originally driven by Paul Cohen, then later driven by Chad Tingler, Courtney Jolly and Cam McQueen. Pastrana made his monster truck debut on October 18, 2006 in the Pastrana 199 monster truck at the 2006 [[Monster Jam]]. Also, on an episode of ''Nitro Circus'', Pastrana attempted to backflip the ''Nitro Circus''-themed monster truck. Though unsuccessful, he walked away without injury.

During the 2009 World Finals the \"Pastrana 199\" truck changed its name to \"Nitro Circus\". Pastrana himself competed in the freestyle competition of the event debuting the \"Nitro Circus\" truck, finishing in a three-way tie for 5th place in a field of 24 trucks. On February 27, 2010 in Jacksonville, Florida, Cam McQueen successfully executed a backflip in the Nitro Circus monster truck during the freestyle competition, making Nitro Circus the first to do so in competition.
