Noise-induced and age-related hearing loss are the most common forms of hearing loss seen in adult patients and they often co-exist in the same patients. In collaboration with [[M. Charles Liberman]] and other researchers, Kujawa has examined the vulnerability of the synapses that connect hair cells in the cochlea to auditory nerve fibers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cant-hear-in-noisy-places-its-a-real-medical-condition-1474909624|title=Can\u2019t Hear in Noisy Places?
