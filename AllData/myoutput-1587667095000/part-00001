Railroad|Petaluma & Santa Rosa Railroad Station]]]] Santa Rosa was founded in 1833 and named after [[Saint Rose of Lima]].  Before the arrival of Europeans, the Santa Rosa Plain was home to a strong and populous tribe of [[Pomo]] natives known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the area closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day [[Spring Lake Regional Park]]. Upon the arrival of Europeans, the Pomos were decimated by [[smallpox]] brought from Europe. By 1900 the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA90 |page=90 |title=Sacred Sonoma: Sacred Sites and Alignments in Sonoma County, California |edition=Revised |first=Beth |last=Winegarner |publisher=Lulu |year=2007 |isbn=9781430320678}}</ref>\n\nThe first known permanent European settlement of Santa Rosa was the homestead of the Carrillo family, in-laws to [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], who settled the [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] [[pueblo]] and [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of [[Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez de Carrillo]] built an adobe house on their [[Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa]] land grant, just east of what later became downtown Santa Rosa. Allegedly, however, by the 1820s, before the Carrillos built their adobe in the 1830s, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Mexican settlers from nearby Sonoma and other settlements to the south raised [[livestock]] in the area and slaughtered animals at the fork of the [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and [[Matanzas Creek]], near the intersection of modern-day Santa Rosa Avenue and Sonoma Avenue. This is supposedly the origin of the name of Matanzas Creek as, because of its use as a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called La Matanza.\n\n[[File:Bird's eye view of Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, Cal., 1876. LOC 76693083.jpg|thumb|Panoramic map of Santa Rosa from 1871]]\nBy the 1850s, a [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]] post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a [[public square]] in the center, a pattern which largely remains as the street pattern for downtown Santa Rosa to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.\n\nIn 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city and in 1868 the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it officially the third incorporated city in Sonoma County, after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and [[Healdsburg]], incorporated in 1867.\n\nThe [[U.S. Census]] records, among others, show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily early on, despite initially lagging behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. According to the U.S. Census, in 1870 Santa Rosa was the eighth largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. According to a 1905 article in the ''[[Press Democrat]]'' newspaper reporting on the \"Battle of the Trains\", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.\n\nThe [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.\n\nFamed director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] filmed his thriller ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist due to major reconstruction following the strong earthquakes in October 1969. However, some, like the rough-stone [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]] depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower), still survive.  A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present day Old Courthouse square); the [[S. H. Kress & Co.|KRESS]] building on Fourth Street is also visible. However, the courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers' 2001 film ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' is set in Santa Rosa c. 1949.\n\n===Since World War II===\n[[File:Santa Rosa, Empire Building (2012).jpg|thumb|upright|Old Courthouse Square is the heart of downtown Santa Rosa. This is the Empire Building, completed in 1910 and a Sonoma County landmark. It was seen in ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].]]\nSanta Rosa grew following World War II because it was the location for [[Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa]], the remnants of which are now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]].\n\nThe population increased by 2/3 between 1950 and 1970, an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20 years. Some of the increase was from immigration, and some from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.\n\nIn 1958 the United States Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization designated Santa Rosa as one of its eight regional headquarters, with jurisdiction over Region 7, which included [[American Samoa]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]. Santa Rosa continued as a major center for [[United States civil defense|civil defense]] activity (under the Office of Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Preparedness) until 1979 when the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) was created in its place, ending the civil defense's 69-year history.<ref name=\"OEP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/396.html|title=Records of the office of Emergency Preparedness|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref>\n\nWhen the City Council adopted the city's first modern General Plan in 1991, the population was about 113,000. In the 21 years following 1970, Santa Rosa grew by about 3,000 residents a year\u2014triple the average growth during the previous twenty years.\n\n''Santa Rosa 2010'', the 1991 General Plan, called for a population of 175,000 in 2010. The Council expanded the city's urban boundary to include all the land then planned for future annexation, and declared it would be Santa Rosa's \"ultimate\" boundary. The rapid growth that was being criticized as [[urban sprawl]] became routine [[infill]] development.\n\nAt the first five-year update of the plan, in 1996, the Council extended the planning period by ten years, renaming it ''Vision 2020'' (updated to ''Santa Rosa 2020'', and then again to ''Santa Rosa 2030 Vision''), and added more land and population. Now the City projects a population of 195,000 in 2020.\n\nSanta Rosa [[annexation|annexed]] the community of [[Roseland, California|Roseland]] in November 2017.<ref name=\"annex\">{{cite web|url=https://www.srcity.org/371/Roseland-Area-Annexation|title=Roseland Area Annexation|accessdate=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===2017 firestorm===\n[[File:Fountaingrove_Round_Barn.jpg|thumb|upright|The former [[Nagasawa Kanaye#Fountaingrove|historic Fountaingrove Round Barn]], previously found at the southwestern base of Fountaingrove, was lost to fire.]]\n{{main|October 2017 Northern California wildfires|Tubbs Fire}}\nBeginning on the night of October 8, 2017, five percent of the city's homes were destroyed in the [[Tubbs Fire]], a 45,000-acre [[wildfire]] that claimed the lives of at least 19 people in Sonoma County.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sudek|first1=Julia Prodis|title=Santa Rosa fire: How a sudden firestorm devastated a city|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/09/santa-rosa-fire-how-a-sudden-firestorm-obliterated-a-city/|accessdate=October 9, 2017|work=The Mercury News|publisher=Digital First Media|date=October 9, 2017}}</ref> Named after its origin near Tubbs Lane and Highway 128 in nearby Napa County, the fire became a major section of the most destructive and third deadliest firestorm in California history.<ref name=\"calfire-top20\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/downloads/fact_sheets/Top20_Destruction.pdf|title=Top 20 Most Destructive California Wildfires|website=CAL FIRE|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/npr-news/firefighters-gain-ground-california-wildfires|title=Firefighters Gain Ground On California Wildfires|date=2017-10-16|work=Kansas Public Radio|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Tubbs-Fire-could-be-worst-in-California-history-12276628.php|title=It's now the deadliest wildfire disaster in California history|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref> Most homes in the Coffey Park, [[Larkfield-Wikiup, California|Larkfield-Wikiup]], and [[Fountain Grove, California|Fountain Grove]] neighborhoods were destroyed.\n\nA notable exception to the destruction in the area was the protection of more than 1000 animals at the renowned [[Safari West]] Wildlife Preserve northeast of Santa Rosa.

They were the strongest quakes to affect the city since 1906. The epicenters were about two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of Santa Rosa.\n\n===Nature and wildlife===\nDue to its population, much of Santa Rosa's remaining undisturbed area is on its urban fringe. However, the principal wildlife corridors of [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and its tributaries flow right through the heart of the town. [[Great blue herons]], [[great egret]]s, [[snowy egret]]s and [[black-crowned night heron|black-crowned herons]] nest in the trees of the median strip on West Ninth Street as well as along Santa Rosa Creek and downtown. [[Deer]] often are spotted roaming the neighborhoods nearer the eastern hills, as deep into town as Franklin Avenue and the McDonald area; rafters of [[wild turkeys]] are relatively common in some areas; and [[cougar|mountain lions]] are occasionally observed within city limits. [[Raccoon]]s and [[Virginia opossum|opossum]]s are a common sight throughout the city, while [[fox]]es, and [[rabbit]]s may be regularly seen in the more rural areas. In addition, the city borders and then wraps around the northern end of Trione Annadel State Park, which itself extends into the Sonoma Mountains and Sonoma Valley. [[Trione Annadel State Park]] also adjoins Spring Lake County Park and Howarth Park, forming one contiguous park system that enables visitors to venture into wild native habitats.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Rrsqrazorback.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Restaurants and other retail stores occupy several historic buildings in Santa Rosa's Railroad Square district in the downtown area, including these along Fourth Street.]]\nSanta Rosa can be seen as divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] runs roughly north\u2013south through the city, and divides it into east and west sides.

With the highest concentration of historic commercial buildings in Santa Rosa, this portion of downtown is popular with both tourists and locals.\n* Historic residential neighborhoods. Although most of Santa Rosa's commercial buildings were destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, almost all of its numerous houses survived and most have survived to this day. As a result, Santa Rosa has a number of old neighborhoods in and around downtown, several historically designated. These contain numerous old homes, including many [[Victorians]]. Most of these are on quiet, often tree-lined streets. An example of one of these houses would be the [[McDonald Mansion]], near downtown.\n* The annual [[Luther Burbank Rose Parade and Festival]]\n* California Indian Museum and Cultural Center\n* The [[Pacific Coast Air Museum]] is located on the southeast corner of the [[Charles M.

It is a 65-member all-volunteer orchestra that has presented hundreds of free and low-cost concerts throughout Sonoma County over the past 15 years. The orchestra is made up of professional-level local musicians who volunteer their time.\n\nSummer Repertory Theater (SRT) is a complete and extensive practicum in all aspects of stage production. The program combines professional directing, design, and production staff with outstanding students in acting, design, technical theater, dance, music, and management. The ensemble mounts five productions, which are performed in full rotating Repertory six days a week beginning in mid-June. Company members put theory to the test and learn to work in a professional system.\n\nThe 92-year-old [[Santa Rosa Symphony]], an award-winning regional orchestra, performs at the Green Music Center in [[Rohnert Park]], a new venue with traditional \"shoebox\" acoustics. The Symphony's Institute for Music Education supports four youth ensembles and provides classical music education to students across Sonoma County, serving 30,000 elementary students per year.

Railroad|Petaluma & Santa Rosa Railroad Station]]]] Santa Rosa was founded in 1833 and named after [[Saint Rose of Lima]].  Before the arrival of Europeans, the Santa Rosa Plain was home to a strong and populous tribe of [[Pomo]] natives known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the area closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day [[Spring Lake Regional Park]]. Upon the arrival of Europeans, the Pomos were decimated by [[smallpox]] brought from Europe. By 1900 the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA90 |page=90 |title=Sacred Sonoma: Sacred Sites and Alignments in Sonoma County, California |edition=Revised |first=Beth |last=Winegarner |publisher=Lulu |year=2007 |isbn=9781430320678}}</ref>\n\nThe first known permanent European settlement of Santa Rosa was the homestead of the Carrillo family, in-laws to [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], who settled the [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] [[pueblo]] and [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of [[Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez de Carrillo]] built an adobe house on their [[Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa]] land grant, just east of what later became downtown Santa Rosa. Allegedly, however, by the 1820s, before the Carrillos built their adobe in the 1830s, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Mexican settlers from nearby Sonoma and other settlements to the south raised [[livestock]] in the area and slaughtered animals at the fork of the [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and [[Matanzas Creek]], near the intersection of modern-day Santa Rosa Avenue and Sonoma Avenue. This is supposedly the origin of the name of Matanzas Creek as, because of its use as a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called La Matanza.\n\n[[File:Bird's eye view of Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, Cal., 1876. LOC 76693083.jpg|thumb|Panoramic map of Santa Rosa from 1871]]\nBy the 1850s, a [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]] post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a [[public square]] in the center, a pattern which largely remains as the street pattern for downtown Santa Rosa to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.\n\nIn 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city and in 1868 the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it officially the third incorporated city in Sonoma County, after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and [[Healdsburg]], incorporated in 1867.\n\nThe [[U.S. Census]] records, among others, show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily early on, despite initially lagging behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. According to the U.S. Census, in 1870 Santa Rosa was the eighth largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. According to a 1905 article in the ''[[Press Democrat]]'' newspaper reporting on the \"Battle of the Trains\", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.\n\nThe [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.\n\nFamed director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] filmed his thriller ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist due to major reconstruction following the strong earthquakes in October 1969. However, some, like the rough-stone [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]] depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower), still survive.  A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present day Old Courthouse square); the [[S. H. Kress & Co.|KRESS]] building on Fourth Street is also visible. However, the courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers' 2001 film ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' is set in Santa Rosa c. 1949.\n\n===Since World War II===\n[[File:Santa Rosa, Empire Building (2012).jpg|thumb|upright|Old Courthouse Square is the heart of downtown Santa Rosa. This is the Empire Building, completed in 1910 and a Sonoma County landmark. It was seen in ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].]]\nSanta Rosa grew following World War II because it was the location for [[Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa]], the remnants of which are now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]].\n\nThe population increased by 2/3 between 1950 and 1970, an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20 years. Some of the increase was from immigration, and some from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.\n\nIn 1958 the United States Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization designated Santa Rosa as one of its eight regional headquarters, with jurisdiction over Region 7, which included [[American Samoa]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]. Santa Rosa continued as a major center for [[United States civil defense|civil defense]] activity (under the Office of Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Preparedness) until 1979 when the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) was created in its place, ending the civil defense's 69-year history.<ref name=\"OEP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/396.html|title=Records of the office of Emergency Preparedness|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref>\n\nWhen the City Council adopted the city's first modern General Plan in 1991, the population was about 113,000. In the 21 years following 1970, Santa Rosa grew by about 3,000 residents a year\u2014triple the average growth during the previous twenty years.\n\n''Santa Rosa 2010'', the 1991 General Plan, called for a population of 175,000 in 2010. The Council expanded the city's urban boundary to include all the land then planned for future annexation, and declared it would be Santa Rosa's \"ultimate\" boundary. The rapid growth that was being criticized as [[urban sprawl]] became routine [[infill]] development.\n\nAt the first five-year update of the plan, in 1996, the Council extended the planning period by ten years, renaming it ''Vision 2020'' (updated to ''Santa Rosa 2020'', and then again to ''Santa Rosa 2030 Vision''), and added more land and population. Now the City projects a population of 195,000 in 2020.\n\nSanta Rosa [[annexation|annexed]] the community of [[Roseland, California|Roseland]] in November 2017.<ref name=\"annex\">{{cite web|url=https://www.srcity.org/371/Roseland-Area-Annexation|title=Roseland Area Annexation|accessdate=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===2017 firestorm===\n[[File:Fountaingrove_Round_Barn.jpg|thumb|upright|The former [[Nagasawa Kanaye#Fountaingrove|historic Fountaingrove Round Barn]], previously found at the southwestern base of Fountaingrove, was lost to fire.]]\n{{main|October 2017 Northern California wildfires|Tubbs Fire}}\nBeginning on the night of October 8, 2017, five percent of the city's homes were destroyed in the [[Tubbs Fire]], a 45,000-acre [[wildfire]] that claimed the lives of at least 19 people in Sonoma County.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sudek|first1=Julia Prodis|title=Santa Rosa fire: How a sudden firestorm devastated a city|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/09/santa-rosa-fire-how-a-sudden-firestorm-obliterated-a-city/|accessdate=October 9, 2017|work=The Mercury News|publisher=Digital First Media|date=October 9, 2017}}</ref> Named after its origin near Tubbs Lane and Highway 128 in nearby Napa County, the fire became a major section of the most destructive and third deadliest firestorm in California history.<ref name=\"calfire-top20\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/downloads/fact_sheets/Top20_Destruction.pdf|title=Top 20 Most Destructive California Wildfires|website=CAL FIRE|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/npr-news/firefighters-gain-ground-california-wildfires|title=Firefighters Gain Ground On California Wildfires|date=2017-10-16|work=Kansas Public Radio|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Tubbs-Fire-could-be-worst-in-California-history-12276628.php|title=It's now the deadliest wildfire disaster in California history|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref> Most homes in the Coffey Park, Larkfield-Wikiup, and [[Fountain Grove, California|Fountain Grove]] neighborhoods were destroyed.\n\nA notable exception to the destruction in the area was the protection of more than 1000 animals at the renowned [[Safari West]] Wildlife Preserve northeast of Santa Rosa.

They were the strongest quakes to affect the city since 1906. The epicenters were about two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of Santa Rosa.\n\n===Nature and wildlife===\nDue to its population, much of Santa Rosa's remaining undisturbed area is on its urban fringe. However, the principal wildlife corridors of [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and its tributaries flow right through the heart of the town. [[Great blue herons]], [[great egret]]s, [[snowy egret]]s and [[black-crowned night heron|black-crowned herons]] nest in the trees of the median strip on West Ninth Street as well as along Santa Rosa Creek and downtown. [[Deer]] often are spotted roaming the neighborhoods nearer the eastern hills, as deep into town as Franklin Avenue and the McDonald area; rafters of [[wild turkeys]] are relatively common in some areas; and [[cougar|mountain lions]] are occasionally observed within city limits. [[Raccoon]]s and [[Virginia opossum|opossum]]s are a common sight throughout the city, while [[fox]]es, and [[rabbit]]s may be regularly seen in the more rural areas. In addition, the city borders and then wraps around the northern end of Trione Annadel State Park, which itself extends into the Sonoma Mountains and Sonoma Valley. [[Trione Annadel State Park]] also adjoins Spring Lake County Park and Howarth Park, forming one contiguous park system that enables visitors to venture into wild native habitats.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Rrsqrazorback.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Restaurants and other retail stores occupy several historic buildings in Santa Rosa's Railroad Square district in the downtown area, including these along Fourth Street.]]\nSanta Rosa can be seen as divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest.

Although most of Santa Rosa's commercial buildings were destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, almost all of its numerous houses survived and most have survived to this day. As a result, Santa Rosa has a number of old neighborhoods in and around downtown, several historically designated. These contain numerous old homes, including many [[Victorians]].

It is a 65-member all-volunteer orchestra that has presented hundreds of free and low-cost concerts throughout Sonoma County over the past 15 years. The orchestra is made up of professional-level local musicians who volunteer their time.\n\nSummer Repertory Theater (SRT) is a complete and extensive practicum in all aspects of stage production. The program combines professional directing, design, and production staff with outstanding students in acting, design, technical theater, dance, music, and management. The ensemble mounts five productions, which are performed in full rotating Repertory six days a week beginning in mid-June. Company members put theory to the test and learn to work in a professional system.\n\nThe 92-year-old [[Santa Rosa Symphony]], an award-winning regional orchestra, performs at the Green Music Center in [[Rohnert Park]], a new venue with traditional \"shoebox\" acoustics. The Symphony's Institute for Music Education supports four youth ensembles and provides classical music education to students across Sonoma County, serving 30,000 elementary students per year.
