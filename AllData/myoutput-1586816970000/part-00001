First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the [[Berthier rifle|Berthier]] and [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel]] series of [[service rifle]]s, it saw service long past the [[World War II]] period. It was manufactured from late 1937 onward by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Only 250,000 MAS-36 rifles were available to equip the French [[infantry]] during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:MAS36 crop.jpg|thumb|Pre World War II produced MAS-36]]\n\nThe MAS-36 is a short carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern rimless [[7.5\u00d754mm French]] cartridge; a shortened version of the [[7.5\u00d757mm MAS|7.5\u00d757mm MAS mod. 1924]] cartridge that had been introduced in 1924 (then modified in 1929), for France's [[FM 24/29 light machine gun]]. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles like the two rear locking lugs of the British [[Lee-Enfield|SMLE]] rifle (easy to clean and resistant to dirt), the ''dog leg'' shaped bolt handle of the British [[Pattern 1914 Enfield|P14]]/U.S. [[M1917 Enfield]] rifle that places the bolt knob at a favorable ergonomic position in relation to the trigger and [[peep sight]], and the five-round box magazine (claw extractor) of the German [[Gewehr 98]] which stored 5 rounds in a staggered column and fed by 5-round [[stripper clips]]), to produce an \"ugly, roughly made, but immensely strong and reliable\" service rifle.<ref>Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, Harper Collins Publishers, 2005, page 238</ref>\n\nThere are just five user removable parts: a Lebel-type cruciform bayonet inserted into a guard tube under the barrel (taken out by the stopper and turned by snap-fastening the stopper in the tube to fix), the bolt body, the bolt rear cap, the firing pin and the spring of the firing pin. The metal parts of the rifle were black baked in an oven.\n\nThe MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an \"awkward fashion\" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand. Some have since been found bent backwards into a facing-downwards position like that of many other bolt-action rifles.<ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, Kruse Publications, 2000, page 182</ref> The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual [[Safety (firearms)|safety]].<ref name=\"ESAA\">{{cite book\n  | last = Bishop | first = Chris\n  | title = The Encyclopedia of Small Arms and Artillery\n  | publisher = Grange Books\n  | year = 2006\n  | isbn = 978-1-84013-910-5\n  | page = 47\n}}</ref>\n\nThe rifle was designed with an [[iron sight]] line consisting of a rear a tangent-type aperture sight element that was calibrated for 7.5\u00d754mm French mle1929 C ammunition for {{convert|100|-|1200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments. The original front sighting element was milled and consisted of a front post that was protected by two open 'ears'.\nThere were 25 rear aperture elements available for the sight line to optimize it horizontally and laterally  in 2.32 [[Minute and second of arc|MOA]] increments during assembly at the arsenal. These arsenal mounted rear aperture elements shifted to point of aim {{convert|13.5|or|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} left or right or up or down at a range of {{convert|200|m|yd|0}}.\nIt is worth noting that the front stock fittings are a major component of setting the sights on a MAS-36. To discourage disassembling the front stock non-standard screws with a spanner head were used on the barrel band and nose caps. Only armorers were issued with the appropriate screw drivers to remove the front stock. If removed the front stock will probably face quite a bit of trial and error in getting the screws set back to their exact positions again.\n\nIt was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike [[bayonet]], reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. The initial implementation of this bayonet design has a distinct (although, uncommonly<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> encountered) disadvantage: with a bayonet stored in one rifle and the other empty, the top of the stored bayonet could be locked into the empty bayonet tube of the second rifle. This obscures the release button on the bayonet and results in permanently (at least up to destructive disassembly) mated rifles. In post-war use the French updated the bayonet storage design by drilling a hole in the bayonet, which allowed the locking catch to be depressed through an already-dilled hole in the bayonet cap.<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset to the right side of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upright.\n\n==Background==\nThe MAS-36 was intended as an economical simple bolt action rifle to serve with rear echelon, colonial and reserve troops alongside and meant to share machining and pave the way for a new standard [[semi-automatic rifle]] before the next big conflict. The first French [[semi-automatic rifle]] evolved from the prototype MAS-38/39. A limited number of MAS-40 semi-automatic rifles entered trail service in March 1940. The [[Battle of France]] and following German occupation of France prevented large scale introduction of semi-automatic service rifles amongst French front line troops. During the 1950s the French military adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49 rifle]] as their standard service rifle.\n\nThough intended to replace the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel Model 1886]] and Berthier rifles as well as [[Berthier carbine]]s, budget constraints limited MAS-36 production, and it served along with the former rifles in many French army and colonial units.  During World War II, the MAS-36 was used alongside the Lebel 1886 and Berthiers during the Battle of France. After the [[Battle of France]], the Germans took over a large number of MAS-36s, which were given the designation ''Gewehr 242(f)'' and put into service with their own garrison units based in occupied France and later the [[Volkssturm]].<ref name=\"ESAA\" />\n\n==Further development==\nPost World War II produced rifles feature production simplifications like stamped nose caps with a hooded front sight element, stamped magazine floor plates, a stamped front sling attachment featuring a ring, a protective measure to prevent dirt ingress in the trigger area and a side-mounted cam track and button to dial and lock the selected firing range on the rear sight element. The hooded front sight element reduced [[glare (vision)|glare]] under unfavorable light conditions and added extra protection for the post. The bolt of post World War II produced rifles can not be closed on an empty chamber, indicating the rifle needs to be reloaded. Later post war batches feature [[phosphate conversion coating|phosphating]]/[[Parkerizing]] introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment against rust. The \"second model\" is the most produced version with its derivative, the MAS 36/51.\n\n==Postwar usage==\n[[File:Crs larzac2.jpg|thumb|In service with the French Police [[Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9]] during the [[fight for the Larzac]] in 1978.]]\nThe MAS-36 was extensively used by French Army and colonial defense forces during France's postwar counter-insurgency operations in the [[First Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]],<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-12-13-texte-integral}}</ref> as well as in the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first=Chris|title=20th Century Military Uniforms |year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|page=85}}</ref> During the Suez Crisis, French paratroop marksmen of the ''2\u00e8me RPC'' (''R\u00e9giment de Parachutistes Coloniaux''), employed telescope-sighted MAS-36 rifles to eliminate enemy snipers.<ref>Leuliette, Pierre, ''St. Michael and the Dragon: Memoirs of a Paratrooper'', Houghton Mifflin (1964)</ref>  The MAS-36 remained in service into the early 1960s as an infantry rifle, often serving with indigenous colonial units. It was officially a substitute-standard rifle after France adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49]] rifle series in 1949, though its bolt design lives on in a dedicated sniper version of the rifle, the [[FR F1]] (now chambered in [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]) and its successor the [[FR F2 sniper rifle]].\n\n[[Gabon]] and [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] continued to use the MAS-36 post independence; In 1968 and 1969 they supplied [[Biafra]] with MAS-36 rifles during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. [[Haiti]] presented Biafra with 300 rifles as a gift late in the conflict.<ref name=\"Jowett\">{{cite book|last=Jowett|first=Philip|title=Modern African Wars (5): The Nigerian-Biafran War 1967-70|date=2016|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1472816092}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, civilian hunting rifle versions were made by MAS and by the gunsmith Jean Fournier. These half-stocked rifles were chambered for the [[7\u00d754mm Fournier]] (common, 7.5x54mm necked down to 7mm), [[7\u00d757mm Mauser]] (very rare), [[8\u00d760mm S]] (less common), and [[10.75\u00d768mm]] (rare). Hunting rifles in the two latter calibers had integral muzzle brakes. Also imported into the United States were a few military surplus MAS-36 rifles, converted to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO from 7.5\u00d754mm. These rifles were modified to chamber the NATO round and also had an [[SKS]] type trigger safety fitted to them.\n\nIn [[Comoros]], the French had a decent amount of MAS-36 rifles in storage during WWII and the [[Post-war]] era. When Comoros became in independent nation in 1975, the rifles were given to the new [[Military of the Comoros|Comoros Army]]. The MAS-36 was widely used during many of the coups and attempted coups that took place on the island nation from 1975 to 1989. After a reformation of the Comoros Army in 1990, the MAS-36 was replaced with newer weapons such as the [[AK-47]].<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>\n\nIn 1941, Britain and [[Free France]] occupied Syria, bringing thousands of MAS-36 rifles with them. When French forces departed from Syria in 1946, the rifles were given to the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] in order to arm their own [[Syrian Army|army]] and militias, as the Syrian government at the time was perceived as pro-western. The MAS-36 was widely used by Syrian forces in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. The Israeli victory and later, a coup in Syria led to Syria's loyalty shifting towards the [[Soviet Union]] instead of western countries. After purchasing large quantities of Soviet weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, the MAS-36 became obsolete with thousands of units being sent into government storage facilities. In 2011 during the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Syrian opposition]] forces captured thousands of the stored rifles. With nearly all of the rifles being still operational, the [[Free Syrian Army]] widely used the MAS-36 from 2011 to 2015. From 2015 onward, the Free Syrian Army is decreasing the use of the MAS-36 due to scarcity of the rifle's needed 7.5mm ammunition.<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>\n\n===FR F1 and FR F2 sniper rifles===\nThe French [[FR F1]] and [[FR F2]] sniper rifles utilize the same basic bolt design as the MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy inhibiting flex in these sniper rifles.\n\n==Variants==\n* '''MAS 36 CR39''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a folding hollow aluminum stock designed for use by airborne forces.\n* '''MAS 36 LG48''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and 48&nbsp;mm [[rifle grenade]] [[Grenade launcher#Muzzle-fired grenades|launcher]] used in the First Indochina War.\n* '''MAS 36/51''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[NATO]] standard rifle grenade launcher.\n* '''Fusil mod\u00e8le FR-G2''' - A highly modified MAS-36 rifle action equipped with a match barrel with harmonic compensator and telescopic sight for use by designated marksmen, used as a stopgap while the FR F1 rifles were being rebuilt into the FR F2.\n\n==Users==\n[[File:Combattants sahraouis du Front Polisario.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Polisario Front]] with a MAS-36 in 1980.]]\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the [[Berthier rifle|Berthier]] and [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel]] series of [[service rifle]]s, it saw service long past the [[World War II]] period. It was manufactured from late 1937 onward by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Only 250,000 MAS-36 rifles were available to equip the French [[infantry]] during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:MAS36 crop.jpg|thumb|Pre World War II produced MAS-36]]\n\nThe MAS-36 is a short carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern rimless [[7.5\u00d754mm French]] cartridge; a shortened version of the [[7.5\u00d757mm MAS|7.5\u00d757mm MAS mod. 1924]] cartridge that had been introduced in 1924 (then modified in 1929), for France's [[FM 24/29 light machine gun]]. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles like the two rear locking lugs of the British [[Lee-Enfield|SMLE]] rifle (easy to clean and resistant to dirt), the ''dog leg'' shaped bolt handle of the British [[Pattern 1914 Enfield|P14]]/U.S. [[M1917 Enfield]] rifle that places the bolt knob at a favorable ergonomic position in relation to the trigger and [[peep sight]], and the five-round box magazine (claw extractor) of the German [[Gewehr 98]] which stored 5 rounds in a staggered column and fed by 5-round [[stripper clips]]), to produce an \"ugly, roughly made, but immensely strong and reliable\" service rifle.<ref>Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, Harper Collins Publishers, 2005, page 238</ref>\n\nThere are just five user removable parts: a Lebel-type cruciform bayonet inserted into a guard tube under the barrel (taken out by the stopper and turned by snap-fastening the stopper in the tube to fix), the bolt body, the bolt rear cap, the firing pin and the spring of the firing pin. The metal parts of the rifle were black baked in an oven.\n\nThe MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an \"awkward fashion\" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand. Some have since been found bent backwards into a facing-downwards position like that of many other bolt-action rifles.<ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, Kruse Publications, 2000, page 182</ref> The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual [[Safety (firearms)|safety]].<ref name=\"ESAA\">{{cite book\n  | last = Bishop | first = Chris\n  | title = The Encyclopedia of Small Arms and Artillery\n  | publisher = Grange Books\n  | year = 2006\n  | isbn = 978-1-84013-910-5\n  | page = 47\n}}</ref>\n\nThe rifle was designed with an [[iron sight]] line consisting of a rear a tangent-type aperture sight element that was calibrated for 7.5\u00d754mm French mle1929 C ammunition for {{convert|100|-|1200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments. The original front sighting element was milled and consisted of a front post that was protected by two open 'ears'.\nThere were 25 rear aperture elements available for the sight line to optimize it horizontally and laterally  in 2.32 [[Minute and second of arc|MOA]] increments during assembly at the arsenal. These arsenal mounted rear aperture elements shifted to point of aim {{convert|13.5|or|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} left or right or up or down at a range of {{convert|200|m|yd|0}}.\nIt is worth noting that the front stock fittings are a major component of setting the sights on a MAS-36. To discourage disassembling the front stock non-standard screws with a spanner head were used on the barrel band and nose caps. Only armorers were issued with the appropriate screw drivers to remove the front stock. If removed the front stock will probably face quite a bit of trial and error in getting the screws set back to their exact positions again.\n\nIt was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike [[bayonet]], reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. The initial implementation of this bayonet design has a distinct (although, uncommonly<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> encountered) disadvantage: with a bayonet stored in one rifle and the other empty, the top of the stored bayonet could be locked into the empty bayonet tube of the second rifle. This obscures the release button on the bayonet and results in permanently (at least up to destructive disassembly) mated rifles. In post-war use the French updated the bayonet storage design by drilling a hole in the bayonet, which allowed the locking catch to be depressed through an already-dilled hole in the bayonet cap.<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset to the right side of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upright.\n\n==Background==\nThe MAS-36 was intended as an economical simple bolt action rifle to serve with rear echelon, colonial and reserve troops alongside and meant to share machining and pave the way for a new standard [[semi-automatic rifle]] before the next big conflict. The first French [[semi-automatic rifle]] evolved from the prototype MAS-38/39. A limited number of MAS-40 semi-automatic rifles entered trail service in March 1940. The [[Battle of France]] and following German occupation of France prevented large scale introduction of semi-automatic service rifles amongst French front line troops. During the 1950s the French military adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49 rifle]] as their standard service rifle.\n\nThough intended to replace the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel Model 1886]] and Berthier rifles as well as [[Berthier carbine]]s, budget constraints limited MAS-36 production, and it served along with the former rifles in many French army and colonial units.  During World War II, the MAS-36 was used alongside the Lebel 1886 and Berthiers during the Battle of France. After the [[Battle of France]], the Germans took over a large number of MAS-36s, which were given the designation ''Gewehr 242(f)'' and put into service with their own garrison units based in occupied France and later the [[Volkssturm]].<ref name=\"ESAA\" />\n\n==Further development==\nPost World War II produced rifles feature production simplifications like stamped nose caps with a hooded front sight element, stamped magazine floor plates, a stamped front sling attachment featuring a ring, a protective measure to prevent dirt ingress in the trigger area and a side-mounted cam track and button to dial and lock the selected firing range on the rear sight element. The hooded front sight element reduced [[glare (vision)|glare]] under unfavorable light conditions and added extra protection for the post. The bolt of post World War II produced rifles can not be closed on an empty chamber, indicating the rifle needs to be reloaded. Later post war batches feature [[phosphate conversion coating|phosphating]]/[[Parkerizing]] introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment against rust. The \"second model\" is the most produced version with its derivative, the MAS 36/51.\n\n==Postwar usage==\n[[File:Crs larzac2.jpg|thumb|In service with the French Police [[Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9]] during the [[fight for the Larzac]] in 1978.]]\nThe MAS-36 was extensively used by French Army and colonial defense forces during France's postwar counter-insurgency operations in the [[First Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]],<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-12-13-texte-integral}}</ref> as well as in the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first=Chris|title=20th Century Military Uniforms |year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|page=85}}</ref> During the Suez Crisis, French paratroop marksmen of the ''2\u00e8me RPC'' (''R\u00e9giment de Parachutistes Coloniaux''), employed telescope-sighted MAS-36 rifles to eliminate enemy snipers.<ref>Leuliette, Pierre, ''St. Michael and the Dragon: Memoirs of a Paratrooper'', Houghton Mifflin (1964)</ref>  The MAS-36 remained in service into the early 1960s as an infantry rifle, often serving with indigenous colonial units. It was officially a substitute-standard rifle after France adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49]] rifle series in 1949, though its bolt design lives on in a dedicated sniper version of the rifle, the [[FR F1]] (now chambered in [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]) and its successor the [[FR F2 sniper rifle]].\n\n[[Gabon]] and [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] continued to use the MAS-36 post independence; In 1968 and 1969 they supplied [[Biafra]] with MAS-36 rifles during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. [[Haiti]] presented Biafra with 300 rifles as a gift late in the conflict.<ref name=\"Jowett\">{{cite book|last=Jowett|first=Philip|title=Modern African Wars (5): The Nigerian-Biafran War 1967-70|date=2016|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1472816092}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, civilian hunting rifle versions were made by MAS and by the gunsmith Jean Fournier. These half-stocked rifles were chambered for the [[7\u00d754mm Fournier]] (common, 7.5x54mm necked down to 7mm), [[7\u00d757mm Mauser]] (very rare), [[8\u00d760mm S]] (less common), and [[10.75\u00d768mm]] (rare). Hunting rifles in the two latter calibers had integral muzzle brakes. Also imported into the United States were a few military surplus MAS-36 rifles, converted to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO from 7.5\u00d754mm. These rifles were modified to chamber the NATO round and also had an [[SKS]] type trigger safety fitted to them.\n\nIn [[Comoros]], the French had a decent amount of MAS-36 rifles in storage during WWII and the [[Post-war]] era. When Comoros became in independent nation in 1975, the rifles were given to the new [[Military of the Comoros|Comoros Army]]. The MAS-36 was widely used during many of the coups and attempted coups that took place on the island nation from 1975 to 1989. After a reformation of the Comoros Army in 1990, the MAS-36 was replaced with newer assault weapons such as the [[AK-47]].<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>\n\nIn 1941, Britain and [[Free France]] occupied Syria, bringing thousands of MAS-36 rifles with them. When French forces departed from Syria in 1946, the rifles were given to the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] in order to arm their own [[Syrian Army|army]] and militias, as the Syrian government at the time was perceived as pro-western. The MAS-36 was widely used by Syrian forces in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. The Israeli victory and later, a coup in Syria led to Syria's loyalty shifting towards the [[Soviet Union]] instead of western countries. After purchasing large quantities of Soviet weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, the MAS-36 became obsolete with thousands of units being sent into government storage facilities. In 2011 during the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Syrian opposition]] forces captured thousands of the stored rifles. With nearly all of the rifles being still operational, the [[Free Syrian Army]] widely used the MAS-36 from 2011 to 2015. From 2015 onward, the Free Syrian Army is decreasing the use of the MAS-36 due to scarcity of the rifle's needed 7.5mm ammunition.<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>\n\n===FR F1 and FR F2 sniper rifles===\nThe French [[FR F1]] and [[FR F2]] sniper rifles utilize the same basic bolt design as the MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy inhibiting flex in these sniper rifles.\n\n==Variants==\n* '''MAS 36 CR39''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a folding hollow aluminum stock designed for use by airborne forces.\n* '''MAS 36 LG48''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and 48&nbsp;mm [[rifle grenade]] [[Grenade launcher#Muzzle-fired grenades|launcher]] used in the First Indochina War.\n* '''MAS 36/51''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[NATO]] standard rifle grenade launcher.\n* '''Fusil mod\u00e8le FR-G2''' - A highly modified MAS-36 rifle action equipped with a match barrel with harmonic compensator and telescopic sight for use by designated marksmen, used as a stopgap while the FR F1 rifles were being rebuilt into the FR F2.\n\n==Users==\n[[File:Combattants sahraouis du Front Polisario.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Polisario Front]] with a MAS-36 in 1980.]]\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.
