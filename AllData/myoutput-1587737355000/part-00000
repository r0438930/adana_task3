Food shortages were severe, especially in the harsh [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom|winter of 1946\u201347]]. From July 1945 through June 1946, the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food, primarily wheat, to Europe and Japan. It amounted to one-sixth of the American food supply and provided 35 trillion calories, enough to provide 400 calories a day for one year to 300 million people.<ref>Allen J.

Although most small towns and villages had not suffered as much damage, the destruction of transportation left them economically isolated.

To clarify the American position, a major address by Secretary of State [[George Marshall]] was planned. Marshall gave the address at Harvard University on June 5, 1947. He offered American aid to promote European recovery and reconstruction. The speech described the dysfunction of the European economy and presented a rationale for US aid.\n\n<blockquote>The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down.&nbsp;... Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the United States. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jussi M.

He offered aid, but the European countries had to organize the program themselves.\n\nThe speech, written by [[Charles Bohlen]], contained virtually no details and no numbers. More a proposal than a plan, it was a challenge to European leaders to cooperate and coordinate.  It asked Europeans to create their own plan for rebuilding Europe, indicating the United States would then fund this plan. The administration felt that the plan would likely be unpopular among many Americans, and the speech was mainly directed at a European audience. In an attempt to keep the speech out of American papers, journalists were not contacted, and on the same day, Truman called a press conference to take away headlines. In contrast, Dean Acheson, an Under Secretary of State, was dispatched to contact the European media, especially the British media, and the speech was read in its entirety on the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles L.

The two agreed that it would be necessary to invite the Soviets as the other major allied power. Marshall's speech had explicitly included an invitation to the Soviets, feeling that excluding them would have been a sign of distrust. State Department officials, however, knew that [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would almost certainly not participate and that any plan that would send large amounts of aid to the Soviets was unlikely to get Congressional approval.\n\n===Initial reactions===\nSpeaking at the Paris Peace Conference on October 10, 1946 Molotov had already stated Soviet fears: \"If American capital was given a free hand in the small states ruined  and enfeebled by the war [it] would buy up the local industries, appropriate the more attractive Rumanian, Yugoslav ... enterprises and would become the master in these small states.<ref>McCauley, Martin, ''Origins of the Cold War 1941-1949'', Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317362470}}, 244 p., p. 147</ref>\" While the Soviet ambassador in Washington suspected that the Marshall Plan could lead to the creation of an anti-Soviet bloc, Stalin was open to the offer.<ref name=\"wettig138\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=138}}</ref> He directed that\u2014in negotiations to be held in Paris regarding the aid\u2014countries in the Eastern Bloc should not reject economic conditions being placed upon them.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> Stalin only changed his outlook when he learned that (a) credit would only be extended under conditions of economic cooperation and, (b) aid would also be extended to Germany in total, an eventuality which Stalin thought would hamper the Soviets' ability to exercise influence in western Germany.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/>\n\nInitially, Stalin  maneuvered to kill the Plan, or at least hamper it by means of destructive participation in the Paris talks regarding conditions.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> He quickly realized, however, that this would be impossible after Molotov reported\u2014following his arrival in Paris in July 1947\u2014that conditions for the credit were non-negotiable.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> Looming as just as large a concern was the Czechoslovak eagerness to accept the aid, as well as indications of a similar Polish attitude.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/>\n\nStalin suspected a possibility that these Eastern Bloc countries might defy Soviet directives not to accept the aid, potentially causing a loss of control of the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> In addition, the most important condition was that every country choosing to take advantage of the plan would need to have its economic situation independently assessed\u2014a level of scrutiny to which the Soviets could not agree.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Bevin and Bidault also insisted that any aid be accompanied by the creation of a unified European economy, something incompatible with the strict Soviet command economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Compulsory Eastern Bloc rejection===\nSoviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] left Paris, rejecting the plan.<ref name=\"wettig139\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=139}}</ref> Thereafter, statements were made suggesting a future confrontation with the West, calling the United States both a \"fascizing\" power and the \"center of worldwide reaction and anti-Soviet activity\", with all U.S.-aligned countries branded as enemies.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> The Soviets also then blamed the United States for communist losses in elections in Belgium, France and Italy months earlier, in the spring of 1947.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> It claimed that \"marshallization\" must be resisted and prevented by any means, and that French and Italian communist parties were to take maximum efforts to sabotage the implementation of the Plan.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> In addition, Western embassies in Moscow were isolated, with their personnel being denied contact with Soviet officials.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/>\n\nOn July 12, a larger meeting was convened in Paris. Every country of Europe was invited, with the exceptions of Spain (a World War II neutral that had sympathized with [[Axis powers]]) and the small states of [[Andorra]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. The Soviet Union was invited with the understanding that it would likely refuse. The states of the future [[Eastern Bloc]] were also approached, and [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]] agreed to attend. In one of the clearest signs and reflections of tight Soviet control and domination over the region, [[Jan Masaryk]], the foreign minister of Czechoslovakia, was summoned to Moscow and berated by Stalin for considering Czechoslovakia's possible involvement with and joining of the Marshall Plan. The prime minister of Poland, [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]], was rewarded by Stalin for his country's rejection of the Plan, which came in the form of the Soviet Union's offer of a lucrative [[trade agreement]] lasting for a period of five years, a grant amounting to the approximate equivalent of $450 million (in 1948; the sum would have been $4.4 billion in 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|website=US Inflation Calculator}}</ref>) in the form of long-term credit and loans and the provision of 200,000 tonnes of grain, heavy and manufacturing machinery and factories and heavy industries to Poland.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855998,00.html |title=Carnations&nbsp;\u2014 TIME |magazine=TIME |date=February 9, 1948 |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Marshall Plan participants were not surprised when the Czechoslovakian and Polish delegations were prevented from attending the Paris meeting. The other [[Eastern Bloc]] states immediately rejected the offer.<ref name=\"Marshall\">Schain, p.132</ref> [[Finland]] also declined, to avoid antagonizing the Soviets (see also [[Finlandization]]). The Soviet Union's \"alternative\" to the Marshall plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with western Europe, became known as the [[Molotov Plan]], and later, the [[Comecon]]. In a 1947 speech to the United Nations, Soviet deputy foreign minister [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] said that the Marshall Plan violated the principles of the United Nations. He accused the United States of attempting to impose its will on other independent states, while at the same time using economic resources distributed as relief to needy nations as an instrument of political pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/hist249/course/Documents/vyshinsky_speech_to_un.htm|title=Vyshinsky Speech to U.N.

However, in 1948 [[Tito-Stalin Split|Tito broke decisively with Stalin]] on other issues, making Yugoslavia an independent communist state. Yugoslavia requested American aid. American leaders were internally divided, but finally agreed and began sending money on a small scale in 1949, and on a much larger scale in 1950\u201353.

The 20-member conservative isolationist Senate wing of the party, based in the rural Midwest and led by Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry]] (R-Nebraska), was outmaneuvered by the emerging internationalist wing, led by Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]] (R-Michigan). The opposition argued that it would be \"a wasteful 'operation rat-hole'\"; that it made no sense to oppose communism by supporting the socialist governments in Western Europe; and that American goods would reach Russia and increase its war potential.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Vandenberg, assisted by Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] (R-Massachusetts) admitted there was no certainty that the plan would succeed, but said it would halt economic chaos, sustain Western civilization, and stop further Soviet expansion. Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] (R-Ohio) hedged on the issue. He said it was without economic justification; however, it was \"absolutely necessary\" in \"the world battle against communism.\" In the end, only 17 senators voted against it on March 13, 1948<ref>John C. Campbell, ''The United States in World affairs: 1947-1948'' (1948) pp 500-505; quotes on pages 504, 505.</ref> A bill granting an initial $5 billion passed Congress with strong bipartisan support. Congress would eventually allocate $12.4 billion in aid over the four years of the plan.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Grogin, p.118</ref>\n\nCongress reflected public opinion, which resonated with the ideological argument that communism flourishes in poverty. Truman's own prestige and power had been greatly enhanced by his stunning victory in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]]. Across America, multiple interest groups, including business, labor, farming, philanthropy, ethnic groups, and religious groups, saw the Marshall Plan as an inexpensive solution to a massive problem, noting it would also help American exports and stimulate the American economy as well. Major newspapers were highly supportive, including such conservative outlets as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]. Vandenberg made sure of bipartisan support on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Solid Democratic South was highly supportive, the upper Midwest was dubious, but heavily outnumbered. The plan was opposed by conservatives in the rural Midwest, who opposed any major government spending program and were highly suspicious of Europeans.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1952029|title = The Region of Isolationism|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 47|issue = 2|pages = 386\u2013401|last1 = Smuckler|first1 = Ralph H.|year = 1953|doi = 10.2307/1952029}}</ref> The plan also had some opponents on the left, led by [[Henry A.

Sixteen nations met in Paris to determine what form the American aid would take, and how it would be divided. The negotiations were long and complex, with each nation having its own interests. France's major concern was that Germany not be rebuilt to its previous threatening power. The [[Benelux]] countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg), despite also suffering under the Nazis, had long been closely linked to the German economy and felt their prosperity depended on its revival. The Scandinavian nations, especially [[Sweden]], insisted that their long-standing trading relationships with the Eastern Bloc nations not be disrupted and that their neutrality not be infringed.<ref name=\"Cini, p.24 in Schain\">Cini, p.24 in Schain</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom insisted on special status as a longstanding belligerent during the war, concerned that if it were treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by [[William L. Clayton]], promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to spend too much of the money on Germany.<ref name=\"Cini, p.24 in Schain\"/> However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.<ref>Sorel, Eliot, and Pier Carlo Padoan.

Print.</ref>\n\nAgreement was eventually reached and the Europeans sent a reconstruction plan to Washington, which was formulated and agreed upon by the [[Committee of European Economic Co-operation]] in 1947. In the document, the Europeans asked for $22 billion in aid. Truman cut this to $17 billion in the bill he put to Congress.\nOn March 17, 1948, Truman addressed European security and condemned the Soviet Union before a hastily convened [[Joint Session of Congress]]. Attempting to contain spreading Soviet influence in the Eastern Bloc, Truman asked Congress to restore a peacetime military draft and to swiftly pass the '''Economic Cooperation Act,''' the name given to the Marshall Plan. Of the Soviet Union Truman said, \"The situation in the world today is not primarily the result of the natural difficulties which follow a great war. It is chiefly due to the fact that one nation has not only refused to cooperate in the establishment of a just and honorable peace but\u2014even worse\u2014has actively sought to prevent it.\"<ref name=\"Clerk.house.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/highlights.html?action=view&intID=345 |title=President Harry S.

Others thought he had not been forceful enough to contain the USSR. \"What [Truman] said fell short of being tough\", noted Representative [[Edward E. Cox|Eugene Cox]], a Democrat from Georgia, \"there is no prospect of ever winning Russian cooperation.\" Despite its reservations, the 80th Congress implemented Truman's requests, further escalating the Cold War with the USSR.<ref name=\"Clerk.house.gov\"/>\n\nTruman signed the Economic Cooperation Act into law on April 3, 1948; the Act established the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA) to administer the program. ECA was headed by economic cooperation administrator [[Paul G. Hoffman]]. In the same year, the participating countries (Austria, [[Belgium]], Denmark, France, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece, [[Iceland]], Ireland, Italy, [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], Norway, Sweden, [[Switzerland]], Turkey, and the United States) signed an accord establishing a master financial-aid-coordinating agency, the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] (later called the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or [[OECD]]), which was headed by Frenchman [[Robert Marjolin]].\n\n==Implementation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Marshall plan page 1.jpg|thumb|First page of the Marshall Plan]]\nThe first substantial aid went to [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in January 1947, which were seen as the front line of the battle against communist expansion, and were already receiving aid under the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Initially, Britain had supported the anti-communist factions in those countries, but due to its dire economic condition it decided to pull out and in February 1947 requested the US to continue its efforts.<ref>Alan Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' (1983) pp 368-9; Arnold Offner, ''Another Such Victory'' (2002) p 197; Denise M. Bostdorff, ''Proclaiming the Truman Doctrine'' (2008) p 51</ref> The ECA formally began operation in July 1948.\n\nThe ECA's official [[mission statement]] was to give a boost to the European economy: to promote European production, to bolster European currency, and to facilitate international trade, especially with the United States, whose economic interest required Europe to become wealthy enough to import US goods. Another unofficial goal of ECA (and of the Marshall Plan) was the containment of growing Soviet influence in Europe, evident especially in the growing strength of [[communist party|communist parties]] in Czechoslovakia, France, and Italy.\n\nThe Marshall Plan money was transferred to the governments of the European nations. The funds were jointly administered by the local governments and the ECA. Each European [[capital (political)|capital]] had an ECA envoy, generally a prominent American businessman, who would advise on the process. The cooperative allocation of funds was encouraged, and panels of government, business, and labor leaders were convened to examine the economy and see where aid was needed.\n\nThe Marshall Plan aid was mostly used for the purchase of goods from the United States. The European nations had all but exhausted their [[foreign-exchange reserves]] during the war, and the Marshall Plan aid represented almost their sole means of importing goods from abroad. At the start of the plan, these imports were mainly much-needed staples such as food and fuel, but later the purchases turned towards reconstruction needs as was originally intended. In the latter years, under pressure from the United States Congress and with the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], an increasing amount of the aid was spent on rebuilding the militaries of Western Europe. Of the some $13 billion allotted by mid-1951, $3.4 billion had been spent on imports of raw materials and semi-manufactured products; $3.2 billion on food, feed, and fertilizer; $1.9 billion on machines, vehicles, and equipment; and $1.6 billion on fuel.<ref>Hogan, p.415</ref>\n\nAlso established were [[counterpart fund]]s, which used Marshall Plan aid to establish funds in the local currency. According to ECA rules, recipients had to invest 60% of these funds in industry. This was prominent in Germany, where these government-administered funds played a crucial role in lending money to private enterprises which would spend the money rebuilding. These funds played a central role in the reindustrialization of Germany. In 1949\u201350, for instance, 40% of the investment in the German coal industry was by these funds.<ref>Crafts, Toniolo, p.464</ref>\n\nThe companies were obligated to repay the loans to the government, and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses. This process has continued to this day in the guise of the state-owned [[KfW]] bank, (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving loan system, the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to pay down the debt, stabilize the currency, or invest in non-industrial projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Netherlands received US aid for economic recovery in the Netherlands Indies. However, in January 1949, the American government suspended this aid in response to the Dutch efforts to restore colonial rule in Indonesia during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], and it implicitly threatened to suspend Marshall aid to the Netherlands if the Dutch government continued to oppose the independence of [[Indonesia]].<ref>Van der Eng (1988).</ref>\n\nAt the time the United States was a significant oil producing nation \u2014 one of the goals of the Marshall Plan was for Europe to use oil in place of coal, but the Europeans wanted to buy [[crude oil]] and use the Marshall Plan funds to build refineries instead.

The United States Congress passed a law on June 7, 1940 that allowed the BLS to \"make continuing studies of labor productivity\"<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 44\">{{cite journal|last=Wasser|first=Solidelle|first2=Michael |last2=Dolfman|title=BLS and the Marshall Plan: the forgotten story|journal=Monthly Labor Review|year=2005|pages=44|ref=harv}}</ref> and appropriated funds for the creation of a Productivity and Technological Development Division. The BLS could then use its expertise in the field of productive efficiency to implement a productivity drive in each Western European country receiving Marshall Plan aid.  Counterpart funds were used to finance large-scale tours of American industry.  France, for example, sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores, and offices.  They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.<ref>Richard, F. Kuisel, ''Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization'' (1993) pp 70 \u2013 102.</ref>\n\nBy implementing technological literature surveys and organized plant visits, American economists, statisticians, and engineers were able to educate European manufacturers in statistical measurement. The goal of the statistical and technical assistance from the Americans was to increase productive efficiency of European manufacturers in all industries.\n\nTo conduct this analysis, the BLS performed two types of productivity calculations. First, they used existing data to calculate how much a worker produces per hour of work\u2014the average output rate. Second, they compared the existing output rates in a particular country to output rates in other nations. By performing these calculations across all industries, the BLS was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each country's manufacturing and industrial production. From that, the BLS could recommend technologies (especially statistical) that each individual nation could implement. Often, these technologies came from the United States; by the time the Technical Assistance Program began, the United States used statistical technologies \"more than a generation ahead of what [the Europeans] were using\".<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 44\"/>\n\nThe BLS used these statistical technologies to create Factory Performance Reports for Western European nations. The American government sent hundreds of technical advisers to Europe to observe workers in the field. This on-site analysis made the Factory Performance Reports especially helpful to the manufacturers. In addition, the Technical Assistance Program funded 24,000 European engineers, leaders, and industrialists to visit America and tour America's factories, mines, and manufacturing plants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gordon|title=Lessons for Today from the Marshall Plan|journal=CIPE.ORG Feature Service: Technical Paper Series|year=2002|page=2|ref=harv}}</ref> This way, the European visitors would be able to return to their home countries and implement the technologies used in the United States. The analyses in the Factory Performance Reports and the \"hands-on\" experience had by the European productivity teams effectively identified productivity deficiencies in European industries; from there, it became clearer how to make European production more effective.\n\nBefore the Technical Assistance Program even went into effect, United States Secretary of Labor [[Maurice J. Tobin|Maurice Tobin]] expressed his confidence in American productivity and technology to both American and European economic leaders. He urged that the United States play a large role in improving European productive efficiency by providing four recommendations for the program's administrators:\n# That BLS productivity personnel should serve on American-European councils for productivity;\n# that productivity targets (based on American productivity standards) can and should be implemented to increase productivity;\n# that there should be a general exchange and publication of information; and\n# that the \"technical abstract\" service should be the central source of information.<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 49\">{{cite journal|last=Wasser|first=Solidelle|first2=Michael |last2=Dolfman|title=BLS and the Marshall Plan: the forgotten story|journal=Monthly Labor Review|year=2005|pages=49|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe effects of the Technical Assistance Program were not limited to improvements in productive efficiency. While the thousands of European leaders took their work/study trips to the United States, they were able to observe a number of aspects of American society as well. The Europeans could watch local, state, and federal governments work together with citizens in a pluralist society. They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants. The Technical Assistance Program allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gordon|title=Lessons for Today from the Marshall Plan|journal=CIPE.ORG Feature Service: Technical Paper Series|year=2002|pages=2\u20133|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of the Technical Assistance Program was its low cost. While $19.4 billion was allocated for capital costs in the Marshall Plan, the Technical Assistance Program only required $300 million. Only one-third of that $300 million cost was paid by the United States.<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 49\"/>\n\n[[File:DBP 1960 344 George C.

Any effort to extend it was halted by the growing cost of the [[Korean War]] and rearmament. American Republicans hostile to the plan had also gained seats in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1950|1950 Congressional elections]], and conservative opposition to the plan was revived. Thus the plan ended in 1951, though various other forms of American aid to Europe continued afterwards.\n\nThe years 1948 to 1952 saw the fastest period of growth in European history. Industrial production increased by 35%. Agricultural production substantially surpassed pre-war levels.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /> The poverty and starvation of the immediate postwar years disappeared, and Western Europe embarked upon an unprecedented two decades of growth that saw standards of living increase dramatically. Additionally, the long-term effect of economic integration raised European income levels substantially, by nearly 20 percent by the mid-1970s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Badinger|first=Harald|date=2005|title=Growth effects of economic integration: evidence from the EU member states|url=|journal=Review of World Economics|volume=141|pages=50\u201378|doi=10.1007/s10290-005-0015-y}}</ref> There is some debate among historians over how much this should be credited to the Marshall Plan. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe, as evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. Most believe that the Marshall Plan sped this recovery, but did not initiate it. Many argue that the structural adjustments that it forced were of great importance. Economic historians [[J. Bradford DeLong]] and [[Barry Eichengreen]] call it \"history's most successful structural adjustment program.\"<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\" />  One effect of the plan was that it subtly \"Americanized\" European countries, especially Austria, through new exposure to American popular culture, including the growth in influence of Hollywood movies and rock n' roll.<ref>Bischof, Pelinka and Stiefel 174-175</ref>\n\nThe political effects of the Marshall Plan may have been just as important as the economic ones. Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing, reducing discontent and bringing political stability. The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced, and throughout the region, communist parties faded in popularity in the years after the Marshall Plan. The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War in the form of NATO. At the same time, the nonparticipation of the states of the Eastern Bloc was one of the first clear signs that the continent was now divided.\n\nThe Marshall Plan also played an important role in European integration. Both the Americans and many of the European leaders felt that European integration was necessary to secure the peace and prosperity of Europe, and thus used Marshall Plan guidelines to foster integration. In some ways, this effort failed, as the [[OEEC]] never grew to be more than an agent of economic cooperation. Rather, it was the separate [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which did not include Britain, that would eventually grow into the [[European Union]]. However, the OEEC served as both a testing and training ground for the structures that would later be used by the [[European Economic Community]]. The Marshall Plan, linked into the [[Bretton Woods system]], also mandated free trade throughout the region.\n\nWhile some historians today feel some of the praise for the Marshall Plan is exaggerated, it is still viewed favorably and many thus feel that a similar project would help other areas of the world. After the fall of communism, several proposed a \"Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe\" that would help revive that region. Others have proposed a Marshall Plan for Africa to help that continent, and US [[Al Gore|Vice President Al Gore]] suggested a [[Global Marshall Plan]].<ref>Marshall Plan style proposals for other parts of the world have been a perennial idea. For instance, [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] have referred to their African aid goals as \"a Marshall Plan\". [https://www.theguardian.com/g8/story/0,13365,1498591,00.html Guardian.co.uk] After the end of the Cold War many felt Eastern Bloc needed a rebuilding plan.</ref> \"Marshall Plan\" has become a metaphor for any very large-scale government program that is designed to solve a specific social problem. It is usually used when calling for federal spending to correct a perceived failure of the private sector.\n\nNicholas Shaxson comments: \u201cIt is widely believed  that the plan worked by offsetting European countries\u2019 yawning deficits. But its real importance ... was simply to compensate for the US failure to institute controls on inflows of hot money from Europe. ...

Vintage press, 2012. chapter 4.</ref>  European hot money inflated the US dollar exchange rate, to the disadvantage of US exporters.\n\n==Repayment==\nThe Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants from the U.S. Treasury that did not have to be repaid.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Organisation for European Economic Co-operation|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] took the leading role in allocating funds, and the OEEC arranged for the transfer of the goods. The American supplier was paid in dollars, which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds. The European recipient, however, was not given the goods as a gift but had to pay for them (usually on credit) in local currency. These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special '''counterpart fund.''' This counterpart money, in turn, could be used by the government for further investment projects. Five percent of the counterpart money was paid to the US to cover the administrative costs of the ERP.<ref>Harry Bayard Price, ''The Marshall Plan and its Meaning'' (1955), p. 106</ref> In addition to ERP grants, the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] (an agency of the US government) at the same time made long-term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US, all of which were repaid.\n\nIn the case of Germany, there also were 16 billion marks of debts from the 1920s which had defaulted in the 1930s, but which Germany decided to repay to restore its reputation. This money was owed to government and private banks in the US, France, and Britain. Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the US. Under the [[Agreement on German External Debts|London Debts Agreement]] of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.<ref>Timothy W.

The only major Western European nation excluded was [[Francisco Franco|Francisco Franco's]] Spain, which was highly unpopular in Washington.  With the escalation of the Cold War, the United States reconsidered its position, and in 1951 embraced Spain as an ally, encouraged by Franco's aggressive [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] policies. Over the next decade, a considerable amount of American aid would go to Spain, but less than its neighbors had received under the Marshall Plan.<ref>Crafts, Toniolo, p.363</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union had been as badly affected as any part of the world by the war. The Soviets imposed large [[War reparations|reparations]] payments on the Axis allies that were in its sphere of influence. [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and especially [[East Germany]] were forced to pay vast sums and ship large amounts of supplies to the USSR. These reparation payments meant the Soviet Union itself received about the same as 16 European countries received in total from Marshall Plan aid.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2db3MMq1W70C&pg=PA16&dq=%22soviet+union%22+%22marshall+plan%22+reparations&cd=19#v=onepage&q=%22soviet%20union%22%20%22marshall%20plan%22%20reparations&f=false|title=The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: the thorny path from political to economic integration|page=16|publisher=M.E.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union would in return ship raw materials such as food and timber to the western zones. In view of the Soviet failure to do so, the western zones halted the shipments east, ostensibly on a temporary basis, although they were never resumed. It was later shown that the main reason for halting shipments east was not the behavior of the USSR but rather the recalcitrant behavior of France.<ref>John Gimbel, \"The American Reparations Stop in Germany: An Essay on the Political Uses of History\"</ref> Examples of material received by the USSR were equipment from the [[Kugel-Fischer]] ballbearing plant at [[Schweinfurt]], the [[Daimler-Benz]] underground aircraft-engine plant at [[Obrigheim]], the [[Deschimag]] shipyards at [[Bremen-Weser]], and the [[Gendorf powerplant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3403 |title=GHDI&nbsp;\u2014 Document&nbsp;\u2014 Page |publisher=Germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/omg1946n039/reference/history.omg1946n039.i0007.pdf |title=WISC.edu |accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\nThe USSR did establish [[COMECON]] as a riposte to the Marshall Plan to deliver aid for Eastern Bloc countries, but this was complicated by the Soviet efforts to manage their own recovery from the war. The members of Comecon looked to the Soviet Union for oil; in turn, they provided machinery, equipment, agricultural goods, industrial goods, and consumer goods to the Soviet Union. Economic recovery in the East was much slower than in the West, resulting in the formation of the [[shortage economy|shortage economies]] and a gap in wealth between East and West. Finland, which the USSR forbade to join the Marshall Plan and which was required to give large reparations to the USSR, saw its economy recover to pre-war levels in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Finland-ECONOMY.html |title=Economy&nbsp;\u2014 Finland |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> France, which received billions of dollars through the Marshall Plan, similarly saw its average income per person return to almost pre-war level by 1949.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=kGCfmmlGtPEC&pg=PA189&dq=%22marshall+plan%22+france+recover+pre-war+#PPA202,M1|title=Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today|last=De Long|first=J.|page=202|year=1993|chapter=The Marshall Plan|author2=Barry Eichengreen|isbn=9780262041362}}</ref> By mid-1948 industrial production in Poland, Hungary, [[Bulgaria]], and [[Czechoslovakia]] had recovered to a level somewhat above pre-war level.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=3017377 |title=Economic Changes in Eastern Bloc.

The purpose of this campaign was to sway public opinion in their direction and to inform the common person of what the Marshall Plan was and what the Plan would ultimately do.

Americans swapped their isolationist ideals for a much more global internationalist ideology after World War II.\n\n=== Polling data ===\nIn a [[NORC at the University of Chicago|National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC) poll taken in April 1945, a cross-section of Americans were asked, \"If our government keeps on sending lendlease materials, which we may not get paid for, to friendly countries for about three years after the war, do you think this will mean more jobs or fewer jobs for most Americans, or won't it make any difference?\" 75% said the same or more jobs; 10% said fewer.<ref>Hadley Cantril and Mildred Strunk, ''Public Opinion, 1935-1946'' (1947) p 414.</ref>\n\nBefore proposing anything to Congress in 1947, the Truman administration made an elaborate effort to organize public opinion in favor of the Marshall Plan spending, reaching out to numerous national organizations representing business, labor, farmers, women, and other interest groups. Political scientist Ralph Levering points out that:\n\n<blockquote>Mounting large public relations campaigns and supporting private groups such as the Citizens [[Committee for the Marshall Plan]], the administration carefully built public and bipartisan Congressional support before bringing these measures to a vote.<ref>Ralph B. Levering, ''The Public and American Foreign Policy, 1918-1978'' (1978) pp 98-99.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPublic opinion polls in 1947 consistently showed strong support for the Marshall plan among Americans.  Furthermore, Gallup  polls in England, France, and Italy showed favorable majorities over 60%   <ref>George Gallup, ed., ''The Gallup Poll: Public Opinion 1935-1971'' (1972) vol 1 pp 691, 708-9, 722</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Laissez-faire criticism===\n[[Laissez-faire]] criticism of the Marshall Plan came from a number of economists. [[Wilhelm R\u00f6pke]], who influenced [[Federal Minister of Economics and Technology (Germany)|German Minister for Economy]] [[Ludwig Erhard]] in his [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic recovery program]], believed recovery would be found in eliminating [[central planning]] and restoring a market economy in Europe, especially in those countries which had adopted more [[fascism|fascist]] and [[corporatism|corporatist]] economic policies. R\u00f6pke criticized the Marshall Plan for forestalling the transition to the free market by subsidizing the current, failing systems. Erhard put R\u00f6pke's theory into practice and would later credit R\u00f6pke's influence for West Germany's preeminent success.<ref>Erhard, p. 22; also, Zmirak</ref>\n\n[[Henry Hazlitt]] criticized the Marshall Plan in his 1947 book ''Will Dollars Save the World?'', arguing that economic recovery comes through savings, capital accumulation, and private enterprise, and not through large cash subsidies. [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] criticized the Marshall Plan in 1951, believing that \"the American subsidies make it possible for [Europe's] governments to conceal partially the disastrous effects of the various socialist measures they have adopted\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/story/2321 |title=von Mises |publisher=Mises.org |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> Some critics and Congressmen at the time believed that America was giving too much aid to Europe. America had already given Europe $9 billion in other forms of help in previous years. The Marshall Plan gave another $13 billion, equivalent to about $100 billion in 2010 value.<ref>New York: Palgrave, 2001. 1-3.</ref>\n\n===Modern criticism===\nHowever, its role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. The Marshall Plan grants were provided at a rate that was not much higher in terms of flow than the previous [[UNRRA]] aid and represented less than 3% of the combined [[national income]] of the recipient countries between 1948 and 1951,<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\" /> which would mean an increase in [[GDP]] growth of only 0.3%.<ref name=\"Nicholas Crafts 6\"/> In addition, there is no correlation between the amount of aid received and the speed of recovery: both [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] received more aid, but [[West Germany]] recovered significantly faster.<ref name=\"Nicholas Crafts 6\"/>\n\nCriticism of the Marshall Plan became prominent among historians of the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] school, such as [[Walter LaFeber]], during the 1960s and 1970s. They argued that the plan was American economic [[imperialism]] and that it was an attempt to gain control over Western Europe just as the Soviets controlled Eastern Europe economically through the [[Comecon]]. In a review of West Germany's economy from 1945 to 1951, German analyst [[Werner Abelshauser]] concluded that \"foreign aid was not crucial in starting the recovery or in keeping it going\". The economic recoveries of France, Italy, and Belgium, Cowen argues, began a few months before the flow of US money. Belgium, the country that relied earliest and most heavily on free-market economic policies after its liberation in 1944, experienced swift recovery and avoided the severe housing and food shortages seen in the rest of continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html |title=A Marshall Plan for Iraq? |publisher=Cato.org |date=May 9, 2003 |accessdate=2009-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122130923/https://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFormer US Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank [[Alan Greenspan]] gives most credit to German Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]] for Europe's economic recovery. Greenspan writes in his memoir ''[[The Age of Turbulence]]'' that Erhard's economic policies were the most important aspect of postwar Western European recovery, even outweighing the contributions of the Marshall Plan. He states that it was Erhard's reductions in economic regulations that permitted Germany's miraculous recovery, and that these policies also contributed to the recoveries of many other European countries. Its recovery is attributed to traditional economic stimuli, such as increases in investment, fueled by a high savings rate and low taxes.

Sustained [[Strategic bombing during World War II|aerial bombardment during the war]] had badly damaged most major cities, and industrial facilities were especially hard-hit.<ref>Tom Buchanan, ''Europe's Troubled Peace 1945\u20132000,'' (2006) ch 1</ref> The region's trade flows had been thoroughly disrupted; millions were in refugee camps living on aid from the United States, which was provided in the guise of the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] and other agencies.

Food shortages were severe, especially in the harsh [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom|winter of 1946\u201347]]. From July 1945 through June 1946, the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food, primarily wheat, to Europe and Japan.

Although most small towns and villages had not suffered as much damage, the destruction of transportation left them economically isolated.

Also in March 1947, former US President [[Herbert Hoover]], in one of [[The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria|his reports from Germany]], argued for a change in US occupation policy, among other things stating:\n\n<blockquote>There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a 'pastoral state' (Morgenthau's vision).

Over $14 billion was spent or loaned during the postwar period through the end of 1947 and is not counted as part of the Marshall Plan. Much of this aid was designed to restore infrastructure and help refugees. Britain, for example, received an emergency loan of $3.75 billion.<ref>''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1949'' p. 846 [http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1949-12.pdf online]</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations]] also launched a series of humanitarian and relief efforts almost wholly funded by the United States.

To clarify the American position, a major address by Secretary of State [[George Marshall]] was planned. Marshall gave the address at Harvard University on June 5, 1947. He offered American aid to promote European recovery and reconstruction. The speech described the dysfunction of the European economy and presented a rationale for US aid.\n\n<blockquote>The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down.&nbsp;... Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the United States. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jussi M.

He offered aid, but the European countries had to organize the program themselves.\n\nThe speech, written by [[Charles Bohlen]], contained virtually no details and no numbers. More a proposal than a plan, it was a challenge to European leaders to cooperate and coordinate.  It asked Europeans to create their own plan for rebuilding Europe, indicating the United States would then fund this plan. The administration felt that the plan would likely be unpopular among many Americans, and the speech was mainly directed at a European audience. In an attempt to keep the speech out of American papers, journalists were not contacted, and on the same day, Truman called a press conference to take away headlines. In contrast, Dean Acheson, an Under Secretary of State, was dispatched to contact the European media, especially the British media, and the speech was read in its entirety on the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles L.

The two agreed that it would be necessary to invite the Soviets as the other major allied power. Marshall's speech had explicitly included an invitation to the Soviets, feeling that excluding them would have been a sign of distrust. State Department officials, however, knew that [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would almost certainly not participate and that any plan that would send large amounts of aid to the Soviets was unlikely to get Congressional approval.\n\n===Initial reactions===\nSpeaking at the Paris Peace Conference on October 10, 1946 Molotov had already stated Soviet fears: \"If American capital was given a free hand in the small states ruined  and enfeebled by the war [it] would buy up the local industries, appropriate the more attractive Rumanian, Yugoslav ... enterprises and would become the master in these small states.<ref>McCauley, Martin, ''Origins of the Cold War 1941-1949'', Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317362470}}, 244 p., p. 147</ref>\" While the Soviet ambassador in Washington suspected that the Marshall Plan could lead to the creation of an anti-Soviet bloc, Stalin was open to the offer.<ref name=\"wettig138\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=138}}</ref> He directed that\u2014in negotiations to be held in Paris regarding the aid\u2014countries in the Eastern Bloc should not reject economic conditions being placed upon them.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> Stalin only changed his outlook when he learned that (a) credit would only be extended under conditions of economic cooperation and, (b) aid would also be extended to Germany in total, an eventuality which Stalin thought would hamper the Soviets' ability to exercise influence in western Germany.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/>\n\nInitially, Stalin  maneuvered to kill the Plan, or at least hamper it by means of destructive participation in the Paris talks regarding conditions.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> He quickly realized, however, that this would be impossible after Molotov reported\u2014following his arrival in Paris in July 1947\u2014that conditions for the credit were non-negotiable.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> Looming as just as large a concern was the Czechoslovak eagerness to accept the aid, as well as indications of a similar Polish attitude.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/>\n\nStalin suspected a possibility that these Eastern Bloc countries might defy Soviet directives not to accept the aid, potentially causing a loss of control of the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> In addition, the most important condition was that every country choosing to take advantage of the plan would need to have its economic situation independently assessed\u2014a level of scrutiny to which the Soviets could not agree.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Bevin and Bidault also insisted that any aid be accompanied by the creation of a unified European economy, something incompatible with the strict Soviet command economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Compulsory Eastern Bloc rejection===\nSoviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] left Paris, rejecting the plan.<ref name=\"wettig139\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=139}}</ref> Thereafter, statements were made suggesting a future confrontation with the West, calling the United States both a \"fascizing\" power and the \"center of worldwide reaction and anti-Soviet activity\", with all U.S.-aligned countries branded as enemies.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> The Soviets also then blamed the United States for communist losses in elections in Belgium, France and Italy months earlier, in the spring of 1947.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> It claimed that \"marshallization\" must be resisted and prevented by any means, and that French and Italian communist parties were to take maximum efforts to sabotage the implementation of the Plan.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> In addition, Western embassies in Moscow were isolated, with their personnel being denied contact with Soviet officials.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/>\n\nOn July 12, a larger meeting was convened in Paris. Every country of Europe was invited, with the exceptions of Spain (a World War II neutral that had sympathized with [[Axis powers]]) and the small states of [[Andorra]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. The Soviet Union was invited with the understanding that it would likely refuse. The states of the future [[Eastern Bloc]] were also approached, and [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]] agreed to attend. In one of the clearest signs and reflections of tight Soviet control and domination over the region, [[Jan Masaryk]], the foreign minister of Czechoslovakia, was summoned to Moscow and berated by Stalin for considering Czechoslovakia's possible involvement with and joining of the Marshall Plan. The prime minister of Poland, [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]], was rewarded by Stalin for his country's rejection of the Plan, which came in the form of the Soviet Union's offer of a lucrative [[trade agreement]] lasting for a period of five years, a grant amounting to the approximate equivalent of $450 million (in 1948; the sum would have been $4.4 billion in 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|website=US Inflation Calculator}}</ref>) in the form of long-term credit and loans and the provision of 200,000 tonnes of grain, heavy and manufacturing machinery and factories and heavy industries to Poland.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855998,00.html |title=Carnations&nbsp;\u2014 TIME |magazine=TIME |date=February 9, 1948 |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Marshall Plan participants were not surprised when the Czechoslovakian and Polish delegations were prevented from attending the Paris meeting. The other [[Eastern Bloc]] states immediately rejected the offer.<ref name=\"Marshall\">Schain, p.132</ref> [[Finland]] also declined, to avoid antagonizing the Soviets (see also [[Finlandization]]). The Soviet Union's \"alternative\" to the Marshall plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with western Europe, became known as the [[Molotov Plan]], and later, the [[Comecon]]. In a 1947 speech to the United Nations, Soviet deputy foreign minister [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] said that the Marshall Plan violated the principles of the United Nations. He accused the United States of attempting to impose its will on other independent states, while at the same time using economic resources distributed as relief to needy nations as an instrument of political pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/hist249/course/Documents/vyshinsky_speech_to_un.htm|title=Vyshinsky Speech to U.N.

However, in 1948 [[Tito-Stalin Split|Tito broke decisively with Stalin]] on other issues, making Yugoslavia an independent communist state. Yugoslavia requested American aid. American leaders were internally divided, but finally agreed and began sending money on a small scale in 1949, and on a much larger scale in 1950\u201353.

The 20-member conservative isolationist Senate wing of the party, based in the rural Midwest and led by Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry]] (R-Nebraska), was outmaneuvered by the emerging internationalist wing, led by Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]] (R-Michigan). The opposition argued that it would be \"a wasteful 'operation rat-hole'\"; that it made no sense to oppose communism by supporting the socialist governments in Western Europe; and that American goods would reach Russia and increase its war potential.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Vandenberg, assisted by Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] (R-Massachusetts) admitted there was no certainty that the plan would succeed, but said it would halt economic chaos, sustain Western civilization, and stop further Soviet expansion. Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] (R-Ohio) hedged on the issue. He said it was without economic justification; however, it was \"absolutely necessary\" in \"the world battle against communism.\" In the end, only 17 senators voted against it on March 13, 1948<ref>John C.

Truman's own prestige and power had been greatly enhanced by his stunning victory in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]]. Across America, multiple interest groups, including business, labor, farming, philanthropy, ethnic groups, and religious groups, saw the Marshall Plan as an inexpensive solution to a massive problem, noting it would also help American exports and stimulate the American economy as well. Major newspapers were highly supportive, including such conservative outlets as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]. Vandenberg made sure of bipartisan support on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Solid Democratic South was highly supportive, the upper Midwest was dubious, but heavily outnumbered. The plan was opposed by conservatives in the rural Midwest, who opposed any major government spending program and were highly suspicious of Europeans.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1952029|title = The Region of Isolationism|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 47|issue = 2|pages = 386\u2013401|last1 = Smuckler|first1 = Ralph H.|year = 1953|doi = 10.2307/1952029}}</ref> The plan also had some opponents on the left, led by [[Henry A.

Sixteen nations met in Paris to determine what form the American aid would take, and how it would be divided. The negotiations were long and complex, with each nation having its own interests. France's major concern was that Germany not be rebuilt to its previous threatening power. The [[Benelux]] countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg), despite also suffering under the Nazis, had long been closely linked to the German economy and felt their prosperity depended on its revival. The Scandinavian nations, especially [[Sweden]], insisted that their long-standing trading relationships with the Eastern Bloc nations not be disrupted and that their neutrality not be infringed.<ref name=\"Cini, p.24 in Schain\">Cini, p.24 in Schain</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom insisted on special status as a longstanding belligerent during the war, concerned that if it were treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by [[William L. Clayton]], promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to spend too much of the money on Germany.<ref name=\"Cini, p.24 in Schain\"/> However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.<ref>Sorel, Eliot, and Pier Carlo Padoan.

In the document, the Europeans asked for $22 billion in aid. Truman cut this to $17 billion in the bill he put to Congress.\nOn March 17, 1948, Truman addressed European security and condemned the Soviet Union before a hastily convened [[Joint Session of Congress]]. Attempting to contain spreading Soviet influence in the Eastern Bloc, Truman asked Congress to restore a peacetime military draft and to swiftly pass the '''Economic Cooperation Act,''' the name given to the Marshall Plan. Of the Soviet Union Truman said, \"The situation in the world today is not primarily the result of the natural difficulties which follow a great war.

Others thought he had not been forceful enough to contain the USSR. \"What [Truman] said fell short of being tough\", noted Representative [[Edward E. Cox|Eugene Cox]], a Democrat from Georgia, \"there is no prospect of ever winning Russian cooperation.\" Despite its reservations, the 80th Congress implemented Truman's requests, further escalating the Cold War with the USSR.<ref name=\"Clerk.house.gov\"/>\n\nTruman signed the Economic Cooperation Act into law on April 3, 1948; the Act established the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA) to administer the program. ECA was headed by economic cooperation administrator [[Paul G. Hoffman]]. In the same year, the participating countries (Austria, [[Belgium]], Denmark, France, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece, [[Iceland]], Ireland, Italy, [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], Norway, Sweden, [[Switzerland]], Turkey, and the United States) signed an accord establishing a master financial-aid-coordinating agency, the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] (later called the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or [[OECD]]), which was headed by Frenchman [[Robert Marjolin]].\n\n==Implementation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Marshall plan page 1.jpg|thumb|First page of the Marshall Plan]]\nThe first substantial aid went to [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in January 1947, which were seen as the front line of the battle against communist expansion, and were already receiving aid under the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Initially, Britain had supported the anti-communist factions in those countries, but due to its dire economic condition it decided to pull out and in February 1947 requested the US to continue its efforts.<ref>Alan Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' (1983) pp 368-9; Arnold Offner, ''Another Such Victory'' (2002) p 197; Denise M. Bostdorff, ''Proclaiming the Truman Doctrine'' (2008) p 51</ref> The ECA formally began operation in July 1948.\n\nThe ECA's official [[mission statement]] was to give a boost to the European economy: to promote European production, to bolster European currency, and to facilitate international trade, especially with the United States, whose economic interest required Europe to become wealthy enough to import US goods. Another unofficial goal of ECA (and of the Marshall Plan) was the containment of growing Soviet influence in Europe, evident especially in the growing strength of [[communist party|communist parties]] in Czechoslovakia, France, and Italy.\n\nThe Marshall Plan money was transferred to the governments of the European nations. The funds were jointly administered by the local governments and the ECA. Each European [[capital (political)|capital]] had an ECA envoy, generally a prominent American businessman, who would advise on the process. The cooperative allocation of funds was encouraged, and panels of government, business, and labor leaders were convened to examine the economy and see where aid was needed.\n\nThe Marshall Plan aid was mostly used for the purchase of goods from the United States. The European nations had all but exhausted their [[foreign-exchange reserves]] during the war, and the Marshall Plan aid represented almost their sole means of importing goods from abroad. At the start of the plan, these imports were mainly much-needed staples such as food and fuel, but later the purchases turned towards reconstruction needs as was originally intended. In the latter years, under pressure from the United States Congress and with the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], an increasing amount of the aid was spent on rebuilding the militaries of Western Europe. Of the some $13 billion allotted by mid-1951, $3.4 billion had been spent on imports of raw materials and semi-manufactured products; $3.2 billion on food, feed, and fertilizer; $1.9 billion on machines, vehicles, and equipment; and $1.6 billion on fuel.<ref>Hogan, p.415</ref>\n\nAlso established were [[counterpart fund]]s, which used Marshall Plan aid to establish funds in the local currency. According to ECA rules, recipients had to invest 60% of these funds in industry. This was prominent in Germany, where these government-administered funds played a crucial role in lending money to private enterprises which would spend the money rebuilding. These funds played a central role in the reindustrialization of Germany. In 1949\u201350, for instance, 40% of the investment in the German coal industry was by these funds.<ref>Crafts, Toniolo, p.464</ref>\n\nThe companies were obligated to repay the loans to the government, and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses. This process has continued to this day in the guise of the state-owned [[KfW]] bank, (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving loan system, the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to pay down the debt, stabilize the currency, or invest in non-industrial projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Netherlands received US aid for economic recovery in the Netherlands Indies. However, in January 1949, the American government suspended this aid in response to the Dutch efforts to restore colonial rule in Indonesia during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], and it implicitly threatened to suspend Marshall aid to the Netherlands if the Dutch government continued to oppose the independence of [[Indonesia]].<ref>Van der Eng (1988).</ref>\n\nAt the time the United States was a significant oil producing nation \u2014 one of the goals of the Marshall Plan was for Europe to use oil in place of coal, but the Europeans wanted to buy [[crude oil]] and use the Marshall Plan funds to build refineries instead. However, when independent American oil companies complained, the ECA denied funds for European refinery construction.<ref>{{Cite book |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group  |isbn= 978-0-275-94562-6 |last= Pelletiere  |first= Stephen C. |title= Iraq and the International Oil System: Why America Went to War in the Gulf |chapter= 3.

The United States Congress passed a law on June 7, 1940 that allowed the BLS to \"make continuing studies of labor productivity\"<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 44\">{{cite journal|last=Wasser|first=Solidelle|first2=Michael |last2=Dolfman|title=BLS and the Marshall Plan: the forgotten story|journal=Monthly Labor Review|year=2005|pages=44|ref=harv}}</ref> and appropriated funds for the creation of a Productivity and Technological Development Division. The BLS could then use its expertise in the field of productive efficiency to implement a productivity drive in each Western European country receiving Marshall Plan aid.  Counterpart funds were used to finance large-scale tours of American industry.  France, for example, sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores, and offices.  They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.<ref>Richard, F. Kuisel, ''Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization'' (1993) pp 70 \u2013 102.</ref>\n\nBy implementing technological literature surveys and organized plant visits, American economists, statisticians, and engineers were able to educate European manufacturers in statistical measurement. The goal of the statistical and technical assistance from the Americans was to increase productive efficiency of European manufacturers in all industries.\n\nTo conduct this analysis, the BLS performed two types of productivity calculations. First, they used existing data to calculate how much a worker produces per hour of work\u2014the average output rate. Second, they compared the existing output rates in a particular country to output rates in other nations. By performing these calculations across all industries, the BLS was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each country's manufacturing and industrial production. From that, the BLS could recommend technologies (especially statistical) that each individual nation could implement. Often, these technologies came from the United States; by the time the Technical Assistance Program began, the United States used statistical technologies \"more than a generation ahead of what [the Europeans] were using\".<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 44\"/>\n\nThe BLS used these statistical technologies to create Factory Performance Reports for Western European nations. The American government sent hundreds of technical advisers to Europe to observe workers in the field. This on-site analysis made the Factory Performance Reports especially helpful to the manufacturers. In addition, the Technical Assistance Program funded 24,000 European engineers, leaders, and industrialists to visit America and tour America's factories, mines, and manufacturing plants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gordon|title=Lessons for Today from the Marshall Plan|journal=CIPE.ORG Feature Service: Technical Paper Series|year=2002|page=2|ref=harv}}</ref> This way, the European visitors would be able to return to their home countries and implement the technologies used in the United States. The analyses in the Factory Performance Reports and the \"hands-on\" experience had by the European productivity teams effectively identified productivity deficiencies in European industries; from there, it became clearer how to make European production more effective.\n\nBefore the Technical Assistance Program even went into effect, United States Secretary of Labor [[Maurice J. Tobin|Maurice Tobin]] expressed his confidence in American productivity and technology to both American and European economic leaders. He urged that the United States play a large role in improving European productive efficiency by providing four recommendations for the program's administrators:\n# That BLS productivity personnel should serve on American-European councils for productivity;\n# that productivity targets (based on American productivity standards) can and should be implemented to increase productivity;\n# that there should be a general exchange and publication of information; and\n# that the \"technical abstract\" service should be the central source of information.<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 49\">{{cite journal|last=Wasser|first=Solidelle|first2=Michael |last2=Dolfman|title=BLS and the Marshall Plan: the forgotten story|journal=Monthly Labor Review|year=2005|pages=49|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe effects of the Technical Assistance Program were not limited to improvements in productive efficiency. While the thousands of European leaders took their work/study trips to the United States, they were able to observe a number of aspects of American society as well. The Europeans could watch local, state, and federal governments work together with citizens in a pluralist society. They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants. The Technical Assistance Program allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gordon|title=Lessons for Today from the Marshall Plan|journal=CIPE.ORG Feature Service: Technical Paper Series|year=2002|pages=2\u20133|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of the Technical Assistance Program was its low cost. While $19.4 billion was allocated for capital costs in the Marshall Plan, the Technical Assistance Program only required $300 million. Only one-third of that $300 million cost was paid by the United States.<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 49\"/>\n\n[[File:DBP 1960 344 George C.

The maximum allowed was set at about 5,800,000 tons of steel a year, equivalent to 25% of the pre-war production level.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934360,00.html \"Cornerstone of Steel\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', January 21, 1946</ref> The UK, in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located, had argued for a more limited capacity reduction by placing the production ceiling at 12 million tons of steel per year, but had to submit to the will of the US, France and the Soviet Union (which had argued for a 3 million ton limit). Steel plants thus made redundant were to be dismantled.

Any effort to extend it was halted by the growing cost of the [[Korean War]] and rearmament. American Republicans hostile to the plan had also gained seats in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1950|1950 Congressional elections]], and conservative opposition to the plan was revived. Thus the plan ended in 1951, though various other forms of American aid to Europe continued afterwards.\n\nThe years 1948 to 1952 saw the fastest period of growth in European history. Industrial production increased by 35%. Agricultural production substantially surpassed pre-war levels.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /> The poverty and starvation of the immediate postwar years disappeared, and Western Europe embarked upon an unprecedented two decades of growth that saw standards of living increase dramatically. Additionally, the long-term effect of economic integration raised European income levels substantially, by nearly 20 percent by the mid-1970s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Badinger|first=Harald|date=2005|title=Growth effects of economic integration: evidence from the EU member states|url=|journal=Review of World Economics|volume=141|pages=50\u201378|doi=10.1007/s10290-005-0015-y}}</ref> There is some debate among historians over how much this should be credited to the Marshall Plan. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe, as evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. Most believe that the Marshall Plan sped this recovery, but did not initiate it. Many argue that the structural adjustments that it forced were of great importance. Economic historians [[J. Bradford DeLong]] and [[Barry Eichengreen]] call it \"history's most successful structural adjustment program.\"<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\" />  One effect of the plan was that it subtly \"Americanized\" European countries, especially Austria, through new exposure to American popular culture, including the growth in influence of Hollywood movies and rock n' roll.<ref>Bischof, Pelinka and Stiefel 174-175</ref>\n\nThe political effects of the Marshall Plan may have been just as important as the economic ones. Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing, reducing discontent and bringing political stability. The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced, and throughout the region, communist parties faded in popularity in the years after the Marshall Plan. The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War in the form of NATO. At the same time, the nonparticipation of the states of the Eastern Bloc was one of the first clear signs that the continent was now divided.\n\nThe Marshall Plan also played an important role in European integration. Both the Americans and many of the European leaders felt that European integration was necessary to secure the peace and prosperity of Europe, and thus used Marshall Plan guidelines to foster integration. In some ways, this effort failed, as the [[OEEC]] never grew to be more than an agent of economic cooperation. Rather, it was the separate [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which did not include Britain, that would eventually grow into the [[European Union]]. However, the OEEC served as both a testing and training ground for the structures that would later be used by the [[European Economic Community]]. The Marshall Plan, linked into the [[Bretton Woods system]], also mandated free trade throughout the region.\n\nWhile some historians today feel some of the praise for the Marshall Plan is exaggerated, it is still viewed favorably and many thus feel that a similar project would help other areas of the world. After the fall of communism, several proposed a \"Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe\" that would help revive that region. Others have proposed a Marshall Plan for Africa to help that continent, and US [[Al Gore|Vice President Al Gore]] suggested a [[Global Marshall Plan]].<ref>Marshall Plan style proposals for other parts of the world have been a perennial idea. For instance, [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] have referred to their African aid goals as \"a Marshall Plan\".

It is usually used when calling for federal spending to correct a perceived failure of the private sector.\n\nNicholas Shaxson comments: \u201cIt is widely believed  that the plan worked by offsetting European countries\u2019 yawning deficits. But its real importance ... was simply to compensate for the US failure to institute controls on inflows of hot money from Europe. ... American post-war aid was less than the money flowing in the other direction.\u201c<ref>Nicholas Shaxson ''Treasure Islands - tax havens and the men who stole the world''.  Vintage press, 2012. chapter 4.</ref>  European hot money inflated the US dollar exchange rate, to the disadvantage of US exporters.\n\n==Repayment==\nThe Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants from the U.S. Treasury that did not have to be repaid.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Organisation for European Economic Co-operation|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] took the leading role in allocating funds, and the OEEC arranged for the transfer of the goods. The American supplier was paid in dollars, which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds. The European recipient, however, was not given the goods as a gift but had to pay for them (usually on credit) in local currency. These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special '''counterpart fund.''' This counterpart money, in turn, could be used by the government for further investment projects. Five percent of the counterpart money was paid to the US to cover the administrative costs of the ERP.<ref>Harry Bayard Price, ''The Marshall Plan and its Meaning'' (1955), p. 106</ref> In addition to ERP grants, the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] (an agency of the US government) at the same time made long-term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US, all of which were repaid.\n\nIn the case of Germany, there also were 16 billion marks of debts from the 1920s which had defaulted in the 1930s, but which Germany decided to repay to restore its reputation. This money was owed to government and private banks in the US, France, and Britain. Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the US. Under the [[Agreement on German External Debts|London Debts Agreement]] of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.<ref>Timothy W.

The only major Western European nation excluded was [[Francisco Franco|Francisco Franco's]] Spain, which was highly unpopular in Washington.  With the escalation of the Cold War, the United States reconsidered its position, and in 1951 embraced Spain as an ally, encouraged by Franco's aggressive [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] policies. Over the next decade, a considerable amount of American aid would go to Spain, but less than its neighbors had received under the Marshall Plan.<ref>Crafts, Toniolo, p.363</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union had been as badly affected as any part of the world by the war. The Soviets imposed large [[War reparations|reparations]] payments on the Axis allies that were in its sphere of influence. [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and especially [[East Germany]] were forced to pay vast sums and ship large amounts of supplies to the USSR. These reparation payments meant the Soviet Union itself received about the same as 16 European countries received in total from Marshall Plan aid.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2db3MMq1W70C&pg=PA16&dq=%22soviet+union%22+%22marshall+plan%22+reparations&cd=19#v=onepage&q=%22soviet%20union%22%20%22marshall%20plan%22%20reparations&f=false|title=The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: the thorny path from political to economic integration|page=16|publisher=M.E.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union would in return ship raw materials such as food and timber to the western zones. In view of the Soviet failure to do so, the western zones halted the shipments east, ostensibly on a temporary basis, although they were never resumed. It was later shown that the main reason for halting shipments east was not the behavior of the USSR but rather the recalcitrant behavior of France.<ref>John Gimbel, \"The American Reparations Stop in Germany: An Essay on the Political Uses of History\"</ref> Examples of material received by the USSR were equipment from the [[Kugel-Fischer]] ballbearing plant at [[Schweinfurt]], the [[Daimler-Benz]] underground aircraft-engine plant at [[Obrigheim]], the [[Deschimag]] shipyards at [[Bremen-Weser]], and the [[Gendorf powerplant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3403 |title=GHDI&nbsp;\u2014 Document&nbsp;\u2014 Page |publisher=Germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/omg1946n039/reference/history.omg1946n039.i0007.pdf |title=WISC.edu |accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\nThe USSR did establish [[COMECON]] as a riposte to the Marshall Plan to deliver aid for Eastern Bloc countries, but this was complicated by the Soviet efforts to manage their own recovery from the war. The members of Comecon looked to the Soviet Union for oil; in turn, they provided machinery, equipment, agricultural goods, industrial goods, and consumer goods to the Soviet Union. Economic recovery in the East was much slower than in the West, resulting in the formation of the [[shortage economy|shortage economies]] and a gap in wealth between East and West. Finland, which the USSR forbade to join the Marshall Plan and which was required to give large reparations to the USSR, saw its economy recover to pre-war levels in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Finland-ECONOMY.html |title=Economy&nbsp;\u2014 Finland |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> France, which received billions of dollars through the Marshall Plan, similarly saw its average income per person return to almost pre-war level by 1949.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=kGCfmmlGtPEC&pg=PA189&dq=%22marshall+plan%22+france+recover+pre-war+#PPA202,M1|title=Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today|last=De Long|first=J.|page=202|year=1993|chapter=The Marshall Plan|author2=Barry Eichengreen|isbn=9780262041362}}</ref> By mid-1948 industrial production in Poland, Hungary, [[Bulgaria]], and [[Czechoslovakia]] had recovered to a level somewhat above pre-war level.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=3017377 |title=Economic Changes in Eastern Bloc.

The purpose of this campaign was to sway public opinion in their direction and to inform the common person of what the Marshall Plan was and what the Plan would ultimately do. They spent months attempting to convince Americans that their cause was just and that they should embrace the higher taxes that would come in the foreseeable future.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In Search of a Usable Past: The Marshall Plan and Postwar Reconstruction Today|last=Machado|first=Barry|publisher=George C Marshall Foundation|year=2007|isbn=9780935524062|location=Lexington, VA|pages=}}</ref>\n\nA copious amount of propaganda ended up being highly effective in swaying public opinion towards supporting the Marshall Plan.

Americans swapped their isolationist ideals for a much more global internationalist ideology after World War II.\n\n=== Polling data ===\nIn a [[NORC at the University of Chicago|National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC) poll taken in April 1945, a cross-section of Americans were asked, \"If our government keeps on sending lendlease materials, which we may not get paid for, to friendly countries for about three years after the war, do you think this will mean more jobs or fewer jobs for most Americans, or won't it make any difference?\" 75% said the same or more jobs; 10% said fewer.<ref>Hadley Cantril and Mildred Strunk, ''Public Opinion, 1935-1946'' (1947) p 414.</ref>\n\nBefore proposing anything to Congress in 1947, the Truman administration made an elaborate effort to organize public opinion in favor of the Marshall Plan spending, reaching out to numerous national organizations representing business, labor, farmers, women, and other interest groups. Political scientist Ralph Levering points out that:\n\n<blockquote>Mounting large public relations campaigns and supporting private groups such as the Citizens [[Committee for the Marshall Plan]], the administration carefully built public and bipartisan Congressional support before bringing these measures to a vote.<ref>Ralph B. Levering, ''The Public and American Foreign Policy, 1918-1978'' (1978) pp 98-99.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPublic opinion polls in 1947 consistently showed strong support for the Marshall plan among Americans.  Furthermore, Gallup  polls in England, France, and Italy showed favorable majorities over 60%   <ref>George Gallup, ed., ''The Gallup Poll: Public Opinion 1935-1971'' (1972) vol 1 pp 691, 708-9, 722</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Laissez-faire criticism===\n[[Laissez-faire]] criticism of the Marshall Plan came from a number of economists. [[Wilhelm R\u00f6pke]], who influenced [[Federal Minister of Economics and Technology (Germany)|German Minister for Economy]] [[Ludwig Erhard]] in his [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic recovery program]], believed recovery would be found in eliminating [[central planning]] and restoring a market economy in Europe, especially in those countries which had adopted more [[fascism|fascist]] and [[corporatism|corporatist]] economic policies. R\u00f6pke criticized the Marshall Plan for forestalling the transition to the free market by subsidizing the current, failing systems. Erhard put R\u00f6pke's theory into practice and would later credit R\u00f6pke's influence for West Germany's preeminent success.<ref>Erhard, p. 22; also, Zmirak</ref>\n\n[[Henry Hazlitt]] criticized the Marshall Plan in his 1947 book ''Will Dollars Save the World?'', arguing that economic recovery comes through savings, capital accumulation, and private enterprise, and not through large cash subsidies. [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] criticized the Marshall Plan in 1951, believing that \"the American subsidies make it possible for [Europe's] governments to conceal partially the disastrous effects of the various socialist measures they have adopted\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/story/2321 |title=von Mises |publisher=Mises.org |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> Some critics and Congressmen at the time believed that America was giving too much aid to Europe. America had already given Europe $9 billion in other forms of help in previous years. The Marshall Plan gave another $13 billion, equivalent to about $100 billion in 2010 value.<ref>New York: Palgrave, 2001. 1-3.</ref>\n\n===Modern criticism===\nHowever, its role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. The Marshall Plan grants were provided at a rate that was not much higher in terms of flow than the previous [[UNRRA]] aid and represented less than 3% of the combined [[national income]] of the recipient countries between 1948 and 1951,<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\" /> which would mean an increase in [[GDP]] growth of only 0.3%.<ref name=\"Nicholas Crafts 6\"/> In addition, there is no correlation between the amount of aid received and the speed of recovery: both [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] received more aid, but [[West Germany]] recovered significantly faster.<ref name=\"Nicholas Crafts 6\"/>\n\nCriticism of the Marshall Plan became prominent among historians of the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] school, such as [[Walter LaFeber]], during the 1960s and 1970s. They argued that the plan was American economic [[imperialism]] and that it was an attempt to gain control over Western Europe just as the Soviets controlled Eastern Europe economically through the [[Comecon]]. In a review of West Germany's economy from 1945 to 1951, German analyst [[Werner Abelshauser]] concluded that \"foreign aid was not crucial in starting the recovery or in keeping it going\". The economic recoveries of France, Italy, and Belgium, Cowen argues, began a few months before the flow of US money. Belgium, the country that relied earliest and most heavily on free-market economic policies after its liberation in 1944, experienced swift recovery and avoided the severe housing and food shortages seen in the rest of continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html |title=A Marshall Plan for Iraq? |publisher=Cato.org |date=May 9, 2003 |accessdate=2009-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122130923/https://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFormer US Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank [[Alan Greenspan]] gives most credit to German Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]] for Europe's economic recovery.

He states that it was Erhard's reductions in economic regulations that permitted Germany's miraculous recovery, and that these policies also contributed to the recoveries of many other European countries. Its recovery is attributed to traditional economic stimuli, such as increases in investment, fueled by a high savings rate and low taxes.
