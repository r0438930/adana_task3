He then told Hogan that he hated him for leaving WWE (then known as the WWF) for [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and for testifying against him in the [[Vince McMahon#Legal trial|steroid trial]] in the 1990s. McMahon proceeded by challenging Hogan to a match at WrestleMania where if Hogan lost, he would have to retire from [[professional wrestling]]. Hogan accepted his challenge later that night.<ref name=\"SDMar61\"/> Two weeks later on the March 20 episode of ''SmackDown!'', McMahon and Hogan had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania.

Triple H downplayed Booker T's WCW success, pointing out that the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] had been held by non-wrestlers like [[Vince Russo]] and actor [[David Arquette]] calling WCW and its title \"a joke\". He implied that Booker T, as a convicted criminal, would never win a world championship in WWE. In the WrestleMania XIX press conference [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] questioned Triple H as to whether he had cut a racist promo, Triple H confirmed this was not the case and was indeed referring to Booker's criminal past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030303.html|title=RAW Results March 3, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 10 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T got revenge by attacking Triple H in the bathroom, laying him out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030310.html|title=RAW Results March 10, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 24 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T and [[Goldust]] defeated Triple H and [[Ric Flair]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tag team match|tag team match]].\n\nAnother feud from the Raw brand was the squabble over the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Championship]]; the champion Victoria had captured the title from Trish Stratus at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]. Then at Armageddon, Victoria defeated Stratus and Jacqueline in a [[Professional wrestling#Triple Threat match|triple threat match]] to retain the Women's Championship. Stratus and the returning Jazz had a match on ''Raw'' to determine who would challenge Victoria for the title at WrestleMania. During the match, Victoria entered the ring and hit both women with the title belt, earning a double disqualification. It was then announced that Victoria would defend the title against both Stratus and Jazz in a triple threat match at the event.\n\nA smaller feud, also from the Raw brand was between [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]. After Shawn Michaels lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H at Armageddon, he appeared in an in-ring segment with Chris Jericho, during which Jericho stated Michaels was washed up. After mocking Michaels and threatening to attack him, Jericho turned around into a [[superkick]]. When Michaels was a guest on Jericho's in-ring show ''The Highlight Reel'' the following month, Jericho claimed he had idolized Michaels from a young age and that he had been his inspiration to become a wrestler. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho eliminated Michaels from the Royal Rumble match. Michaels returned later in the match and attacked Jericho, helping to lead to his elimination. The two agreed to meet at WrestleMania XIX in a match.\n\n== Event ==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel<ref name=\"WMFacts\"/>\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English [[Sports commentator|commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Tazz]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Jonathan Coachman]]\n|-\n|[[Josh Mathews]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Howard Finkel]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Tony Chimel]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=9|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referee]]s\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Earl Hebner]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|Chad Patton {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Chioda]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Brian Hebner]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|Mike Sparks {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|}\n\n===Sunday Night Heat===\nBefore the event aired [[live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] faced [[Val Venis|Chief Morley]] and [[Lance Storm]] (with [[The Dudley Boyz]], ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]])) for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]''.

Booker T retaliated and took control of the match; after he delivered a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Somersault leg drop|Harlem Hangover leg drop]], Booker grasped his knee in pain, which allowed Triple H to recover and perform a ''[[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]]'' for a pinfall, thus Triple H won the match and retained the World Heavyweight Championship.<ref name=\"SLAM\"/>\n\nThe seventh match was a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street fight]] between [[Hulk Hogan]] and the WWE Chairman, [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]].<ref name=\"WMFacts\"/><ref name=\"WMWWE\"/> Both Hogan and McMahon tested each other's strength in the beginning of the match, until McMahon threw Hogan at ringside.

Hogan however, later retaliated by delivering a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|big boot]] and three [[Leg drop|running leg drop]]s to McMahon and successfully pinned McMahon, thus Hogan won the match.<ref name=\"SLAM\"/>\n\n[[File:Rockaustinxix.jpg|right|thumb|The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin]]\nThe next and final match on the [[Card (sports)#Undercard|undercard]], was the encounter of [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].<ref name=\"WMFacts\"/><ref name=\"WMWWE\"/> The match began with Austin and The Rock brawling in the ring, which ended up at ringside. Throughout the match, The Rock worked over Austin's leg, which included applying a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] on Austin. The Rock then began to taunt Austin, as he put on his vest and imitated his taunts, which led both to use their finishers with unsuccessful pins. Austin performed the [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]] on The Rock for a near-fall, much to Austin's dismay. After he failed to win with the People's Elbow, The Rock then performed two Rock Bottoms on Austin for two near-falls. The Rock performed a third Rock Bottom on Austin, winning the match.<ref name=\"SLAM\"/>\n\n[[File:Lesnarbotch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brock Lesnar]] attempting a shooting star press on [[Kurt Angle]].]]\nIn the [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]], [[Brock Lesnar]] faced [[Kurt Angle]] for the [[WWE Championship]], where if Kurt Angle was [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualified]] or [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]], he would lose the title.<ref name=\"WMFacts\"/><ref name=\"WMWWE\"/> The match began with Lesnar and Angle wrestling back and forth, until Angle countered a shoulder block into a [[Suplex#German suplex|German suplex]].

One month prior at No Way Out, during a match between Hogan and The Rock, McMahon came down to the ring, only to distract Hogan, which allowed the referee, [[Sylvan Grenier]] to give The Rock a chair, which Rock used to hit Hogan and pin him for the win.<ref name=\"No Way Out - Main events\">{{cite web|date=2003-02-23|accessdate=2008-02-22|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/|title=Co-Main Events: Triple H vs. Scott Steiner for the World Heavyweight Championship (RAW) and The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan (SmackDown)|publisher=WWE}}</ref> After No Way Out, McMahon proclaimed that Hulkamania was dead and proclaiming a new 'mania; McMahonamania. On the March 6 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Hogan informed McMahon that Hulkamania was not dead and that McMahon had nothing to do with creating it. McMahon informed Hogan that he did not hate Hulkamaniacs or Hulkamania, but he hated Hogan. He then told Hogan that he hated him for leaving WWE (then known as the WWF) for [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and for testifying against him in the [[Vince McMahon#Legal trial|steroid trial]] in the 1990s. McMahon proceeded by challenging Hogan to a match at WrestleMania where if Hogan lost, he would have to retire from [[professional wrestling]]. Hogan accepted his challenge later that night.<ref name=\"SDMar61\"/> Two weeks later on the March 20 episode of ''SmackDown!'', McMahon and Hogan had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania. As Hogan was preparing to sign the contract, McMahon attacked with a steel chair from behind.

Triple H downplayed Booker T's WCW success, pointing out that the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] had been held by non-wrestlers like [[Vince Russo]] and actor [[David Arquette]] calling WCW and its title \"a joke\". He implied that Booker T, as a convicted criminal, would never win a world championship in WWE. In the WrestleMania XIX press conference [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] questioned Triple H as to whether he had cut a racist promo, Triple H confirmed this was not the case and was indeed referring to Booker's criminal past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030303.html|title=RAW Results March 3, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 10 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T got revenge by attacking Triple H in the bathroom, laying him out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030310.html|title=RAW Results March 10, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> On the March 24 episode of ''Raw'', Booker T and [[Goldust]] defeated Triple H and [[Ric Flair]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tag team match|tag team match]].\n\nAnother feud from the Raw brand was the squabble over the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Championship]]; the champion Victoria had captured the title from Trish Stratus at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]. Then at Armageddon, Victoria defeated Stratus and Jacqueline in a [[Professional wrestling#Triple Threat match|triple threat match]] to retain the Women's Championship. Stratus and the returning Jazz had a match on ''Raw'' to determine who would challenge Victoria for the title at WrestleMania. During the match, Victoria entered the ring and hit both women with the title belt, earning a double disqualification. It was then announced that Victoria would defend the title against both Stratus and Jazz in a triple threat match at the event.\n\nA smaller feud, also from the Raw brand was between [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]. After Shawn Michaels lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H at Armageddon, he appeared in an in-ring segment with Chris Jericho, during which Jericho stated Michaels was washed up. After mocking Michaels and threatening to attack him, Jericho turned around into a [[superkick]]. When Michaels was a guest on Jericho's in-ring show ''The Highlight Reel'' the following month, Jericho claimed he had idolized Michaels from a young age and that he had been his inspiration to become a wrestler. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho eliminated Michaels from the Royal Rumble match. Michaels returned later in the match and attacked Jericho, helping to lead to his elimination. The two agreed to meet at WrestleMania XIX in a match.\n\n== Event ==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel<ref name=\"WMFacts\"/>\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English [[Sports commentator|commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Tazz]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Jonathan Coachman]]\n|-\n|[[Josh Mathews]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Howard Finkel]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Tony Chimel]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=9|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referee]]s\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Earl Hebner]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|Chad Patton {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Chioda]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|[[Brian Hebner]] {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|-\n|Mike Sparks {{small|(SmackDown!)}}\n|}\n\n===Sunday Night Heat===\nBefore the event aired [[live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] faced [[Val Venis|Chief Morley]] and [[Lance Storm]] (with [[The Dudley Boyz]], ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]])) for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]''.
