Similar to ''[[college town]]'', ''[[resort town]]'' and ''[[mill town]]'', the term ''commuter town'' describes the municipality's predominant economic function. A suburb, in contrast, is a [[community]] of lesser size, density, political power and/or commerce comparative to a nearby community that is usually of greater economic importance. A town's economic function may change, for example when improved transport brings commuters to industrial suburbs or [[railway town]]s in search of suburban living. Some suburbs, for example [[Teterboro, New Jersey]] and [[Emeryville, California]], remained industrial when they became surrounded by commuter towns; many commuters work in such industrial suburbs but few reside in them; hence, they are not commuter towns.\n\nAs a general rule, suburbs are developed in areas adjacent to a main [[employment]] center, such as a town or a city, but may or may not have many jobs locally, whereas bedroom communities have few local businesses, and most residents who have jobs commute to employment centers some distance away. Commuter towns may be in rural or semi-rural areas, with a ring of [[Open space reserve|green space]] separating them from the larger city or town. Where [[urban sprawl]] and [[conurbation]] have erased clear lines among towns and cities in large [[metropolitan area]]s, this is not the case.\n\n== Causes ==\nCommuter towns can arise for a number of different reasons. Sometimes, as in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] or [[Tiburon, California]], a town loses its main source of employment, leaving its residents to seek work elsewhere. In other cases, a pleasant small town, such as [[Warwick, New York]], over time attracts more residents but not large businesses to employ them, requiring denizens to commute to employment centers. Another cause, particularly relevant in the American South and West, is the rapid growth of small cities. The earlier creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]] was one cause of the greatest growth was seen by the sprawling metropolitan areas of those cities. As a result, many small cities{{which|date=February 2017}} were absorbed into the suburbs of the larger cities.\n\nOften, however, commuter towns form when workers in a region cannot afford to live where they work and must seek residency in another town with a lower [[cost of living]]. The late 20th century [[dot-com bubble]] and [[United States housing bubble]] drove housing costs in Californian metropolitan areas to historic highs, spawning exurban growth in adjacent counties. For example, most cities in western [[Riverside County, California]] can be considered exurbs of [[Orange County, California]] and [[Los Angeles County, California]]. {{As of|2003}}, over 80% of the workforce of [[Tracy, California]] was employed in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nA related phenomenon is common in the [[resort town]]s of the [[American West]] that require large workforces, yet emphasize building larger single-family residences and other expensive housing. For example, the resort town of [[Jackson, Wyoming]] has spawned several nearby bedroom communities, including [[Victor, Idaho]], [[Driggs, Idaho]], and [[Alpine, Wyoming]], where the majority of the Jackson workforce resides. On [[Long Island, New York]], many of the workforce who serve [[The Hamptons]] also reside in communities more modest and more suburban than their workplace, giving rise to a daily reverse commuter flow from more dense to less dense areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n \nIn certain major European cities, such as [[Berlin]] and [[London]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} commuter towns were founded in response to bomb damage sustained during [[World War II]]. Residents were relocated to semi-rural areas within a {{convert|50|mi|km|sing=on}} radius, firstly because much inner city housing had been destroyed, and secondly in order to stimulate development away from cities as the industrial infrastructure shifted from rail to road. Around London, several towns \u2013 such as [[Basildon]], [[Crawley]], [[Harlow]], and [[Stevenage]] \u2013 were built for this purpose by the [[Commission for New Towns]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn some cases, commuter towns can result from negative economic conditions. [[Steubenville, Ohio]], for instance, had its own regional identity along with neighboring [[Weirton, West Virginia]] until the [[Steel crisis|collapse of the steel industry]] in the 1980s. Combined with easier access to the much larger city of [[Pittsburgh]] via the [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|Steubenville Pike]] and the [[Interstate 376|Parkway West]], Steubenville has shifted its marketing efforts to being a commuter town to Pittsburgh, as well as one with a lower cost of living in [[Ohio]] compared to tax-heavy [[Pennsylvania]]. In 2013, [[Jefferson County, Ohio]] (where Steubenville is located) was added to the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]] as part of its larger [[Combined Statistical Area]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319014514/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\nWhere commuters are wealthier and small town housing markets weaker than city housing markets, the development of a bedroom community may raise local housing prices and attract upscale service businesses in a process akin to [[gentrification]]. Long-time residents may be displaced by new commuter residents due to rising house prices. This can also be influenced by [[zoning]] restrictions in urbanized areas that prevent the construction of suitably cheap housing closer to places of employment.\n\nThe number of commuter towns increased in the [[United States|US]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] during the 20th century because of a trend for people to move out of the cities into the surrounding [[green belt]]. Historically, commuter towns were developed by railway companies to create demand for their lines. One 1920s pioneer of this form of development was the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (now part of [[London Underground]]) which marketed its [[Metro-land]] developments. This initiative encouraged many to move out of central and inner-city [[London]] to suburbs such as [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] and out of London itself, to [[commuter village]]s in [[Buckinghamshire]] or [[Hertfordshire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Commuter towns have more recently been built ahead of adequate transportation infrastructure, thus spurring the development of roads and [[public transportation]] systems. These can take the form of [[light rail]] lines extending from the city centre to new [[streetcar suburb]]s and new or expanded [[highway]]s, whose construction and [[traffic]] can lead to the community becoming part of a larger [[conurbation]].\n\nIn the United States, it is common for commuter towns to create disparities in municipal tax rates. When a commuter town collects few business taxes, residents must pay the brunt of the public operating budget in higher [[property tax|property]] or [[income tax]]es. Such municipalities may scramble to encourage [[commerce|commercial]] growth once an established [[residential]] base has been reached.\n\nA 2014 study by the British Office for National Statistics found that commuting also affects wellbeing. Commuters are more likely to be anxious, dissatisfied and have the sense that their daily activities lack meaning than those who don\u2019t have to travel to work even if they are paid more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/commuting-and-personal-well-being--2014/art-commuting-and-personal-well-being.html#tab-2--Key-Points |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/commuting-and-personal-well-being--2014/art-commuting-and-personal-well-being.html#tab-2--Key-Points |title=Commuting and Personal Well-being, 2014|publisher=Office for National Statistics |archive-date=5 January 2016 |access-date=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Belgium]], the development of traditional rural Flemish towns surrounding Brussels into commuter towns is causing major language tensions, as most of the newcoming commuters are French-speaking or even international English-speaking families with no attachment to the Flemish roots. The Flemish movement in the [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] area, with demands such as the strict enforcement of the [[Dutch language]] (restaurants with bilingual menus have been assaulted by activists, etc.) can be analyzed as a reaction against [[gentrification]] caused by the arrival of those non-Dutch speakers working in international companies, national administration or the [[European Parliament]].\n\n== Exurbs ==\nThe term \"[[exurb]]\" was also used in the United States and elsewhere, starting in 1955 for a commuter town, as the word ''exurb'' ( a [[portmanteau]] of \"extra & urban\") was coined by Auguste Comte Spectorsky, in his 1955 book ''The Exurbanites'', to describe the ring of prosperous communities beyond the [[suburb]]s that are commuter towns for an urban area.<ref>{{cite book | author = Spectorsky, Auguste C. | title =The Exurbanites | year=1955 | publisher = J. B. Lippincott & Co.|location=Lippincott, Philadelphia | oclc =476943 }}</ref> However, especially since a landmark report by the [[Brookings Institution]] in 2006, the term is generally used for areas beyond suburbs and specifically less densely built than the suburbs to which the exurbs' residents commute.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berube |first1=Alan |title=Finding Exurbia: America's Fast-Growing Communities at the Metropolitan Fringe |date=2006 |publisher=Brookings Institution |url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20061017_exurbia.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204165955/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20061017_exurbia.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nExurbs vary in wealth and education level. In the United States, exurban areas typically have much higher college education levels than closer-in suburbs, though this is not necessarily the case in other countries. They also typically have average incomes much higher than nearby rural counties, and some have some of the highest median household incomes in their respective metropolitan area. However, depending on local circumstances, some exurbs have higher poverty levels than suburbs nearer the city.\n\n=== Then and now ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nCommuters from early exurbs, such as the end of [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Pennsylvania Main Line|Main Line]] and the [[Northern Westchester]] region of [[Westchester County, New York]], reached the city center via [[commuter rail]] and [[Parkway|parkway systems]].\n\nToday's exurbs are composed of small neighborhoods in otherwise lightly developed areas, towns, and (comparatively) small cities. Some lie in the outer suburbs of an urbanized area, but a few miles of rural, wooded, or agricultural land separates many exurbs from the suburbs. Exurbs may have originated independently of the major city to which many residents commute. Most consist almost exclusively of commuters and lack the historical and cultural traditions of more established cities. Many early 20th century exurbs were organized on the principles of the [[garden city movement]].\n\nYesterday's sprawling exurbs, such as [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] and [[Garden City, New York]], often become a later decade's suburbs, surrounded and absorbed into a belt of [[infill]].\n\n=== Planning ===\nMany suburbs within a metropolitan city proper enjoyed their greatest growth in the post-World War II period, after which growth slowed for several decades; however, since the 1990s extensive development has occurred outside of cities. There have also been significant growth differences between inside and outside metro boundaries; many developments typical of exurbs, such as the proliferation of [[big box]] retailers, lie just on the outside, due to older suburbs' being restricted by inner-city land-use politics while communities outside are free to develop and grow.\n\nSome [[architect]]s, [[environmentalist]]s, and [[urban planner]]s consider exurbs to be manifestations of poor or distorted [[urban planning|planning]]. Comparatively low density towns &ndash; often featuring large lots and large homes &ndash; create heavy [[automobile dependency|motor vehicle dependency]].  \n{{quote|\"They begin as embryonic subdivisions of a few hundred homes at the far edge of beyond, surrounded by scrub. Then, they grow &ndash; first gradually, but soon with explosive force &ndash; attracting stores, creating jobs and struggling to keep pace with the need for more schools, more roads, more everything. And eventually, when no more land is available and home prices have skyrocketed, the whole cycle starts again, another 15 minutes down the turnpike.\"|Rick Lyman|''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/national/18FRISCO.html?_r=1&oref=slogin\n|title=In Exurbs, Life Framed by Hours Spent in the Car\n|newspaper=The New York Times\n|accessdate=April 28, 2008\n|author=Rick\n|date=December 18, 2005\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425025437/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/national/18FRISCO.html?_r=1&oref=slogin\n|archive-date=April 25, 2009\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\nOthers argue that exurban environments, such as those that have emerged in [[Oregon]] over the last 40 years as a result of the state's [[Land use in Oregon|unique land use laws]], have helped to protect local agriculture and local businesses by creating strict [[urban growth boundary|urban growth boundaries]] that encourage greater population densities in centralized towns, while slowing or greatly reducing urban and suburban sprawl into agricultural, timber land, and natural areas.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/the_oregon_example_statewide_planning_works/C396/L396/\n|title=The Oregon Example: Statewide Planning Works\n|work=Bozeman New West\n|accessdate=January 27, 2011\n|last=Wuerthner\n|first=George\n|date=March 19, 2007\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606224442/http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/the_oregon_example_statewide_planning_works/C396/L396/\n|archive-date=June 6, 2011\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|*[[Edge city]]\n*[[Satellite city]]\n*[[Transit village]]\n*[[Travel to work area]]}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2094885 Central City White Flight: Racial and Nonracial Causes]\n* Rybczynski, Witold (Nov. 7, 2005).

Commuters are more likely to be anxious, dissatisfied and have the sense that their daily activities lack meaning than those who don\u2019t have to travel to work even if they are paid more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/commuting-and-personal-well-being--2014/art-commuting-and-personal-well-being.html#tab-2--Key-Points |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/commuting-and-personal-well-being--2014/art-commuting-and-personal-well-being.html#tab-2--Key-Points |title=Commuting and Personal Well-being, 2014|publisher=Office for National Statistics |archive-date=5 January 2016 |access-date=7 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Belgium]], the development of traditional rural Flemish towns surrounding Brussels into commuter towns is causing major language tensions, as most of the newcoming commuters are French-speaking or even international English-speaking families with no attachment to the Flemish roots. The Flemish movement in the [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] area, with demands such as the strict enforcement of the [[Dutch language]] (restaurants with bilingual menus have been assaulted by activists, etc.) can be analyzed as a reaction against [[gentrification]] caused by the arrival of those wealthier non-Dutch speakers working in international companies, national administration or the [[European Parliament]].\n\n== Exurbs ==\nThe term \"[[exurb]]\" was also used in the United States and elsewhere, starting in 1955 for a commuter town, as the word ''exurb'' ( a [[portmanteau]] of \"extra & urban\") was coined by Auguste Comte Spectorsky, in his 1955 book ''The Exurbanites'', to describe the ring of prosperous communities beyond the [[suburb]]s that are commuter towns for an urban area.<ref>{{cite book | author = Spectorsky, Auguste C. | title =The Exurbanites | year=1955 | publisher = J. B. Lippincott & Co.|location=Lippincott, Philadelphia | oclc =476943 }}</ref> However, especially since a landmark report by the [[Brookings Institution]] in 2006, the term is generally used for areas beyond suburbs and specifically less densely built than the suburbs to which the exurbs' residents commute.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Berube |first1=Alan |title=Finding Exurbia: America's Fast-Growing Communities at the Metropolitan Fringe |date=2006 |publisher=Brookings Institution |url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20061017_exurbia.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204165955/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20061017_exurbia.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nExurbs vary in wealth and education level. In the United States, exurban areas typically have much higher college education levels than closer-in suburbs, though this is not necessarily the case in other countries. They also typically have average incomes much higher than nearby rural counties, and some have some of the highest median household incomes in their respective metropolitan area. However, depending on local circumstances, some exurbs have higher poverty levels than suburbs nearer the city.\n\n=== Then and now ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nCommuters from early exurbs, such as the end of [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Pennsylvania Main Line|Main Line]] and the [[Northern Westchester]] region of [[Westchester County, New York]], reached the city center via [[commuter rail]] and [[Parkway|parkway systems]].\n\nToday's exurbs are composed of small neighborhoods in otherwise lightly developed areas, towns, and (comparatively) small cities. Some lie in the outer suburbs of an urbanized area, but a few miles of rural, wooded, or agricultural land separates many exurbs from the suburbs. Exurbs may have originated independently of the major city to which many residents commute. Most consist almost exclusively of commuters and lack the historical and cultural traditions of more established cities. Many early 20th century exurbs were organized on the principles of the [[garden city movement]].\n\nYesterday's sprawling exurbs, such as [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] and [[Garden City, New York]], often become a later decade's suburbs, surrounded and absorbed into a belt of [[infill]].\n\n=== Planning ===\nMany suburbs within a metropolitan city proper enjoyed their greatest growth in the post-World War II period, after which growth slowed for several decades; however, since the 1990s extensive development has occurred outside of cities. There have also been significant growth differences between inside and outside metro boundaries; many developments typical of exurbs, such as the proliferation of [[big box]] retailers, lie just on the outside, due to older suburbs' being restricted by inner-city land-use politics while communities outside are free to develop and grow.\n\nSome [[architect]]s, [[environmentalist]]s, and [[urban planner]]s consider exurbs to be manifestations of poor or distorted [[urban planning|planning]]. Comparatively low density towns &ndash; often featuring large lots and large homes &ndash; create heavy [[automobile dependency|motor vehicle dependency]].  \n{{quote|\"They begin as embryonic subdivisions of a few hundred homes at the far edge of beyond, surrounded by scrub. Then, they grow &ndash; first gradually, but soon with explosive force &ndash; attracting stores, creating jobs and struggling to keep pace with the need for more schools, more roads, more everything. And eventually, when no more land is available and home prices have skyrocketed, the whole cycle starts again, another 15 minutes down the turnpike.\"|Rick Lyman|''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/national/18FRISCO.html?_r=1&oref=slogin\n|title=In Exurbs, Life Framed by Hours Spent in the Car\n|newspaper=The New York Times\n|accessdate=April 28, 2008\n|author=Rick\n|date=December 18, 2005\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425025437/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/national/18FRISCO.html?_r=1&oref=slogin\n|archive-date=April 25, 2009\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\nOthers argue that exurban environments, such as those that have emerged in [[Oregon]] over the last 40 years as a result of the state's [[Land use in Oregon|unique land use laws]], have helped to protect local agriculture and local businesses by creating strict [[urban growth boundary|urban growth boundaries]] that encourage greater population densities in centralized towns, while slowing or greatly reducing urban and suburban sprawl into agricultural, timber land, and natural areas.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/the_oregon_example_statewide_planning_works/C396/L396/\n|title=The Oregon Example: Statewide Planning Works\n|work=Bozeman New West\n|accessdate=January 27, 2011\n|last=Wuerthner\n|first=George\n|date=March 19, 2007\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606224442/http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/the_oregon_example_statewide_planning_works/C396/L396/\n|archive-date=June 6, 2011\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|*[[Edge city]]\n*[[Satellite city]]\n*[[Transit village]]\n*[[Travel to work area]]}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2094885 Central City White Flight: Racial and Nonracial Causes]\n* Rybczynski, Witold (Nov. 7, 2005).
