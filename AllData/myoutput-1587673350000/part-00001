It was directed by [[Jeff Tremaine]], who produced with [[Johnny Knoxville]] and [[Spike Jonze]]. The film stars Johnny Knoxville, [[Bam Margera]], [[Steve-O]], [[Ryan Dunn]], [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Jason \"Wee Man\" Acu\u00f1a]], [[Preston Lacy]], [[Chris Pontius]], [[Ehren McGhehey]], and [[Dave England]]. This is the last Jackass film to feature Dunn before his death in 2011.\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] released the film on October 15, 2010, to American theaters and marked the 10th anniversary of the franchise, which started in 2000. ''Jackass 3D'' earned $171.7 million on a $20 million budget. The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] versions of ''Jackass 3D'' were released on March 8, 2011, in three different versions.\n\nA sequel titled ''Jackass 3.5'' was released on June 13, 2011. In December 2019, Paramount announced a fourth ''Jackass'' film is scheduled for release in March 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/jackass-fourth-movie-coming-in-2021-2589688|title=A fourth 'Jackass' movie is coming in 2021|first=Will|last=Richards|date=December 19, 2019|work=NME|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- DO NOT remove this notice. DO NOT DO A SUMMARY OF EACH STUNT IN THE MOVIE -->\n[[Beavis and Butt-head]] introduced the film by explaining 3D technology. The opening sequence features the cast lining up and then being attacked by various objects in [[slow-motion]]. The opening sequence, as well as many of the stunts, were filmed with [[Vision Research Phantom|Phantom high speed cameras]] which shoot at 1,000 frames per second.\n\n''Jackass 3D'' follows the same premise of the previous movies and the television series. It is a compilation of various pranks, stunts and skits, and has no plot. Some of the stunts featured included [[tether ball]] being played with a [[beehive]] filled with [[Africanized bee]]s, one of [[Ehren McGhehey]]'s teeth being pulled out with a [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago]], using super mighty [[glue]] to take off chest hair and much more. The final stunt includes [[Steve-O]] being launched in the air while inside a [[portable toilet]] (which was achieved by connecting the port-a-potty to bungee cords) filled with [[excrement]].\n\nThe closing skit is done in a similar fashion as the introduction, but uses explosions as objects are thrown at the cast to the tune of Tchaikovsky's [[1812 Overture]]. After the explosions are finished, the cast members are flushed away by a wave pool. As in the past two ''Jackass'' films, comedian [[Rip Taylor]] makes an appearance before the credits roll, celebrating the end of the film in overly dramatic fashion. As the ending credits play, a retrospective is shown with clips from the [[Jackass (TV series)|original show]] along with old photographs of cast and crew set to [[Weezer]]'s \"[[Memories (Weezer song)|Memories]]\", the film's single. Knoxville's daughter, Madison, is also seen in the ending credits, joining in on the prank fun.\n\n==Cast==\nThe entire cast from the previous movies returned for the third movie, with the notable exceptions of former Jackass mainstays [[Brandon DiCamillo]] and [[Raab Himself]].\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]]\n* [[Bam Margera]]\n* [[Steve-O]]\n* [[Ryan Dunn]]\n* [[Wee Man]]\n* [[Preston Lacy]]\n* [[Chris Pontius]]\n* [[Danger Ehren]]\n* [[Dave England]]\nGuest appearances:\n* [[The Dudesons]]\n* [[Loomis Fall]]\n* [[Brandon Novak]]\n* [[Britney Spears]]\n* [[April Margera]] and [[Phil Margera]]\n* [[Rake Yohn]]\n* [[Terra Jole]]\n* [[Mike Judge]] (as the voices of [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-head]])\n* [[Will Oldham]]\n* [[Rip Taylor]]\n* [[Half Pint Brawlers]]\n* Will the Farter\n* Animal experts [[Manny Puig]], David Weathers, and Jason Deeringer\n* American Football players [[Erik Ainge]], [[Jared Allen]], and [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]]\n* Extreme sport athletes [[Mat Hoffman]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[CKY Crew#Kerry Gets|Kerry Getz]], [[Eric Koston]] and [[Parks Bonifay]]\n* Actors [[Seann William Scott]], [[Edward Barbanell]], John Taylor and Angie Simms\n* From ''[[Nitro Circus]]'', [[Andy Bell (freestyle motocross rider)|Andy Bell]], Erik Roner and Tommy \"Streetbike Tommy\" Passemante\n* From [[Weezer]], [[Rivers Cuomo]], [[Brian Bell]] and [[Scott Shriner]]\n\nLike in the past films and the show, crew members [[Jeff Tremaine]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[Rick Kosick]], [[Lance Bangs]], [[Dimitry Elyashkevich]], Sean Cliver, Greg Iguchi and Trip Taylor along with [[Seth Meisterman]], make an appearance in the movie.

It was directed by [[Jeff Tremaine]], who produced with [[Johnny Knoxville]] and [[Spike Jonze]]. The film stars Johnny Knoxville, [[Bam Margera]], [[Steve-O]], [[Ryan Dunn]], [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Jason \"Wee Man\" Acu\u00f1a]], [[Preston Lacy]], [[Chris Pontius]], [[Ehren McGhehey]], and [[Dave England]]. This was the last Jackass film to feature Dunn before his death in 2011.\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] released the film on October 15, 2010, to American theaters and marked the 10th anniversary of the franchise, which started in 2000. ''Jackass 3D'' earned $171.7 million on a $20 million budget. The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] versions of ''Jackass 3D'' were released on March 8, 2011, in three different versions.\n\nA sequel titled ''Jackass 3.5'' was released on June 13, 2011.

DO NOT DO A SUMMARY OF EACH STUNT IN THE MOVIE -->\n[[Beavis and Butt-head]] introduced the film by explaining 3D technology. The opening sequence features the cast lining up and then being attacked by various objects in [[slow-motion]]. The opening sequence, as well as many of the stunts, were filmed with [[Vision Research Phantom|Phantom high speed cameras]] which shoot at 1,000 frames per second.\n\n''Jackass 3D'' follows the same premise of the previous movies and the television series. It is a compilation of various pranks, stunts and skits, and has no plot. Some of the stunts featured included [[tether ball]] being played with a [[beehive]] filled with [[Africanized bee]]s, one of [[Ehren McGhehey]]'s teeth being pulled out with a [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago]], using super mighty [[glue]] to take off chest hair and much more. The final stunt includes [[Steve-O]] being launched in the air while inside a [[portable toilet]] (which was achieved by connecting the port-a-potty to bungee cords) filled with [[excrement]].\n\nThe closing skit is done in a similar fashion as the introduction, but uses explosions as objects are thrown at the cast to the tune of Tchaikovsky's [[1812 Overture]]. After the explosions are finished, the cast members are flushed away by a wave pool. As in the past two ''Jackass'' films, comedian [[Rip Taylor]] makes an appearance before the credits roll, celebrating the end of the film in overly dramatic fashion. As the ending credits play, a retrospective is shown with clips from the [[Jackass (TV series)|original show]] along with old photographs of cast and crew set to [[Weezer]]'s \"[[Memories (Weezer song)|Memories]]\", the film's single. Knoxville's daughter, Madison, is also seen in the ending credits, joining in on the prank fun.\n\n==Cast==\nThe entire cast from the previous movies returned for the third movie, with the notable exceptions of former Jackass mainstays [[Brandon DiCamillo]] and [[Raab Himself]].\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]]\n* [[Bam Margera]]\n* [[Steve-O]]\n* [[Ryan Dunn]]\n* [[Wee Man]]\n* [[Preston Lacy]]\n* [[Chris Pontius]]\n* [[Danger Ehren]]\n* [[Dave England]]\nGuest appearances:\n* [[The Dudesons]]\n* [[Loomis Fall]]\n* [[Brandon Novak]]\n* [[Britney Spears]]\n* [[April Margera]] and [[Phil Margera]]\n* [[Rake Yohn]]\n* [[Terra Jole]]\n* [[Mike Judge]] (as the voices of [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-head]])\n* [[Will Oldham]]\n* [[Rip Taylor]]\n* [[Half Pint Brawlers]]\n* Will the Farter\n* Animal experts [[Manny Puig]], David Weathers, and Jason Deeringer\n* American Football players [[Erik Ainge]], [[Jared Allen]], and [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]]\n* Extreme sport athletes [[Mat Hoffman]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[CKY Crew#Kerry Gets|Kerry Getz]], [[Eric Koston]] and [[Parks Bonifay]]\n* Actors [[Seann William Scott]], [[Edward Barbanell]], John Taylor and Angie Simms\n* From ''[[Nitro Circus]]'', [[Andy Bell (freestyle motocross rider)|Andy Bell]], Erik Roner and Tommy \"Streetbike Tommy\" Passemante\n* From [[Weezer]], [[Rivers Cuomo]], [[Brian Bell]] and [[Scott Shriner]]\n\nLike in the past films and the show, crew members [[Jeff Tremaine]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[Rick Kosick]], [[Lance Bangs]], [[Dimitry Elyashkevich]], Sean Cliver, Greg Iguchi and Trip Taylor along with [[Seth Meisterman]], make an appearance in the movie.
