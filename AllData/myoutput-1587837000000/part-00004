At one of these shows, [[Katharine Hepburn]] purchased seven of Warren's large watercolor paintings which she kept in her private collection.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nIn 1968 an art commission from [[Ford Motor Company]] took him to Hawaii. where he quickly settled into island life and became a highly respected member of the art community.  He maintained an art gallery in Honolulu, as well as Maui. Warren specialized in whimsical interpretations of the Hawaiian Tutus (Grandmothers) and Kikis (Grandchildren) as well as many local images.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nHe was a well-respected member of the Lahaina Art Society and always was a very willing and gracious participant in all art shows.
