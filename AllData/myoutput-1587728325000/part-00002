Over 80 species of enantiornitheans have been named, but some names represent only single bones, so it is likely that not all are valid. Enantiornitheans became extinct at the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]], along with [[Hesperornithes|hesperornithids]] and all other non-avian [[dinosaur]]s. They are thought to have no living descendants.\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe first enantiornitheans to be discovered were incorrectly referred to modern bird groups. For example, the first known enantiornithean, ''[[Gobipteryx minuta]]'', was originally considered a [[paleognath]] related to [[ostrich]]es and [[tinamou]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Elzanowski |first1=Andrzej |authorlink=Andrzej El\u017canowski |year=1974 |url=http://www.palaeontologia.pan.pl/Archive/1974_30_103-109_32-33.pdf |title=Preliminary note on the palaeognathous bird from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia |journal=Palaeontologia Polonica |volume=29 |pages=103\u20139}}</ref> Enantiornitheans were first recognized as a distinct lineage, or \"subclass\" of birds, by [[Cyril A. Walker]] in 1981. Walker made this discovery based on some partial remains from the late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]] of what is now [[Argentina]], which he assigned to a new genus, ''[[Enantiornis]]'', giving the entire group its name. Since the 1990s, many more complete enantiornitheans have been discovered, and it was determined that a few previously described \"birds\" (e.g. ''[[Iberomesornis]]'', ''[[Cathayornis]]'', and ''[[Sinornis]]'') were also enantiornitheans.\n\nThe name \"Enantiornithes\" means \"opposite birds\", from [[Ancient Greek]] ''enantios'' (''\u1f10\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'') \"opposite\" + ''ornithes'' (''\u03cc\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03c2'') \"birds\" . The name was coined by [[Cyril Alexander Walker]] in his landmark paper which established the group.<ref name=\"walker1981\">{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=C.A. |year=1981 |doi=10.1038/292051a0 |title=New subclass of birds from the Cretaceous of South America |journal=Nature |volume=292 |issue=5818 |pages=51\u20133|bibcode=1981Natur.292...51W }}</ref> In his paper, Walker explained what he meant by \"opposite\":\n\n{{bquote|Perhaps the most fundamental and characteristic difference between the Enantiornithes and all other birds is in the nature of the articulation between the [[scapula]] [...] and the [[coracoid]], where the 'normal' condition is completely reversed.<ref name=\"walker1981\"/>}}\n\nThis refers to an anatomical feature \u2013 the articulation of the [[shoulder]] bones \u2013 which has a concave-convex socket joint that is the reverse of that of modern birds. Specifically, in enantiornitheans, the facet where the ''scapula'' (shoulder blade) meets the ''coracoid'' (the primary bone of the shoulder girdle in vertebrates other than mammals) is a [[Wikt:convex|convex]] knob and the corresponding point on the shoulder blade is [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] and dish-shaped. In modern birds, the way the joint articulates is reversed.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Sylvia |last1=Hope |chapter=The Mesozoic Radiation of Neornithes |pages=339\u201388 |editor1-first=Luis M. |editor1-last=Chiappe |editor2-first=Lawrence M. |editor2-last=Witmer |year=2002 |title=Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-20094-4}}</ref>\n\nWalker was not clear on his reasons for giving this name in the etymology section of his paper, and this ambiguity led to some confusion among later researchers. For example, [[Alan Feduccia]] stated in 1996:\n{{bquote|The birds are so named because, among many distinctive features, there is a unique formation of the triosseal canal and the metatarsals are fused proximally to distally, the opposite of that in modern birds<ref>{{cite book |last1=Feduccia |first1=Alan |year=1996 |title=The Origin and Evolution of Birds |url=https://archive.org/details/originevolutiono0000fedu |url-access=registration |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-06460-5}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nFeduccia's point about the ''[[tarsometatarsus]]'' (the combined upper foot and ankle bone) is correct, but Walker did not use this reasoning in his original paper. Walker never described the fusion of the tarsometatarsus as opposite, but rather as \"Only partial\". Also, it is not certain that enantiornitheans had triosseal canals, since no fossil preserves this feature.<ref name=\"chiappe&walker2002\"/>\n\nAs a group, the Enantiornithes are often referred to as \"enantiornithines\". However, several scientists have noted that this is incorrect, because following the standard rules for forming the names of animal groups, it implies reference only to the subfamily [[Enantiornithinae]]. Following the naming conventions used for modern birds as well as extinct groups, it has been pointed out that the correct term is \"enantiornithean\".<ref name=\"youetal2006\">{{cite journal |last1=You |first1=Hai-lu |last2=Lamanna |first2=Matthew C. |last3=Harris |first3=Jerald D. |last4=Chiappe |first4=Luis M. |last5=O'Connor |first5=Jingmai |last6=Ji |first6=Shu-an |last7=L\u00fc |first7=Jun-chang |last8=Yuan |first8=Chong-xi |last9=Li |first9=Da-qing |last10=Zhang |first10=Xing |last11=Lacovara |first11=Kenneth J. |last12=Dodson |first12=Peter |last13=Ji |first13=Qiang |title=A Nearly Modern Amphibious Bird from the Early Cretaceous of Northwestern China |journal=Science |date=16 June 2006 |volume=312 |issue=5780 |pages=1640\u20131643 |doi=10.1126/science.1126377 |pmid=16778053 |bibcode=2006Sci...312.1640Y }}</ref>\n\n==Origin and range==\nEnantiornitheans have been found on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Fossils attributable to this group are exclusively [[Cretaceous]] in age, and it is believed that Enantiornitheans became extinct at the same time as their non-avialan [[dinosaur]] relatives. The earliest known enantiornitheans are from the [[Early Cretaceous]] of [[Spain]] (e.g. ''[[Noguerornis]]'') and [[China]] (e.g. ''[[Protopteryx]]'') and the latest from the [[Late Cretaceous]] of North and South America (e.g. ''[[Avisaurus]]'' and ''[[Enantiornis]]'').

Enantiornithean skulls combined a unique suite of primitive and advanced features.

Only a few species, such as ''[[Gobipteryx minuta]]'', were fully toothless and had beaks. They also had simple [[quadrate bone]]s, a complete bar separating each [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] (eye hole) from each [[antorbital fenestra]], and dentaries (the main toothed bones of the lower jaw) without forked rear tips. A [[squamosal bone]] is preserved in an indeterminate juvenile specimen, while a [[Postorbital bone|postorbital]] is preserved in ''[[Shenqiornis]]'' and ''[[Pengornis]]''. In modern birds these bones are assimilated into the cranium. Some enantiornitheans may have had their [[temporal fenestrae]] (holes in the side of the head) merged into the orbits as in modern birds due to the postorbitals either not being present or not being long enough to divide the openings.<ref name=\"oconnoretal2011skulls\">{{cite journal |last1=O\u2019Connor |first1=Jingmai K. |last2=Chiappe |first2=Luis M. |title=A revision of enantiornithine (Aves: Ornithothoraces) skull morphology |journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology |date=28 February 2011 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=135\u2013157 |doi=10.1080/14772019.2010.526639 }}</ref> A [[quadratojugal bone]], which in modern birds is fused to the jugal, is preserved in ''[[Pterygornis]]''.<ref name=\"Pterygornis\" /> The presence of these primitive features of the skull would have rendered enantiornitheans capable of only limited [[cranial kinesis]] (the ability to move the jaw independent of the cranium).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Min |last2=Hu |first2=Han |title=A Comparative Morphological Study of the Jugal and Quadratojugal in Early Birds and Their Dinosaurian Relatives |journal=The Anatomical Record |date=January 2017 |volume=300 |issue=1 |pages=62\u201375 |doi=10.1002/ar.23446 |pmid=28000410 }}</ref>\n\n===Wing===\n[[File:Mummified precocial bird wings in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber (2016) fig. 1.png|thumb|A [[X-ray microtomography|micro-CT]] scan of an amber-encased enantiornithean wing showing rachises, skin, muscle and claws.|left]]\nAs a very large group of birds, enantiornitheans displayed a high diversity of different body plans based on differences in ecology and feeding, reflected in an equal diversity of wing forms, many paralleling adaptions to different lifestyles seen in modern birds.

Most [[phylogenetic]] studies have recovered Enantiornithes as a monophyletic group distinct from the modern birds and their closest relatives.

The details of the interrelationship of all these lineages, indeed the validity of most, is disputed, although the Avisauridae, for one example, seem likely to constitute a valid group.

They are thought to have no living descendants.\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe first enantiornitheans to be discovered were incorrectly referred to modern bird groups. For example, the first known enantiornithean, ''[[Gobipteryx minuta]]'', was originally considered a [[paleognath]] related to [[ostrich]]es and [[tinamou]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Elzanowski |first1=Andrzej |authorlink=Andrzej El\u017canowski |year=1974 |url=http://www.palaeontologia.pan.pl/Archive/1974_30_103-109_32-33.pdf |title=Preliminary note on the palaeognathous bird from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia |journal=Palaeontologia Polonica |volume=29 |pages=103\u20139}}</ref> Enantiornitheans were first recognized as a distinct lineage, or \"subclass\" of birds, by [[Cyril A. Walker]] in 1981. Walker made this discovery based on some partial remains from the late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]] of what is now [[Argentina]], which he assigned to a new genus, ''[[Enantiornis]]'', giving the entire group its name. Since the 1990s, many more complete enantiornitheans have been discovered, and it was determined that a few previously described \"birds\" (e.g. ''[[Iberomesornis]]'', ''[[Cathayornis]]'', and ''[[Sinornis]]'') were also enantiornitheans.\n\nThe name \"Enantiornithes\" means \"opposite birds\", from [[Ancient Greek]] ''enantios'' (''\u1f10\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'') \"opposite\" + ''ornithes'' (''\u03cc\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03c2'') \"birds\" . The name was coined by [[Cyril Alexander Walker]] in his landmark paper which established the group.<ref name=\"walker1981\">{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=C.A. |year=1981 |doi=10.1038/292051a0 |title=New subclass of birds from the Cretaceous of South America |journal=Nature |volume=292 |issue=5818 |pages=51\u20133|bibcode=1981Natur.292...51W }}</ref> In his paper, Walker explained what he meant by \"opposite\":\n\n{{bquote|Perhaps the most fundamental and characteristic difference between the Enantiornithes and all other birds is in the nature of the articulation between the [[scapula]] [...] and the [[coracoid]], where the 'normal' condition is completely reversed.<ref name=\"walker1981\"/>}}\n\nThis refers to an anatomical feature \u2013 the articulation of the [[shoulder]] bones \u2013 which has a concave-convex socket joint that is the reverse of that of modern birds. Specifically, in enantiornitheans, the facet where the ''scapula'' (shoulder blade) meets the ''coracoid'' (the primary bone of the shoulder girdle in vertebrates other than mammals) is a [[Wikt:convex|convex]] knob and the corresponding point on the shoulder blade is [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] and dish-shaped. In modern birds, the way the joint articulates is reversed.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Sylvia |last1=Hope |chapter=The Mesozoic Radiation of Neornithes |pages=339\u201388 |editor1-first=Luis M. |editor1-last=Chiappe |editor2-first=Lawrence M. |editor2-last=Witmer |year=2002 |title=Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-20094-4}}</ref>\n\nWalker was not clear on his reasons for giving this name in the etymology section of his paper, and this ambiguity led to some confusion among later researchers. For example, [[Alan Feduccia]] stated in 1996:\n{{bquote|The birds are so named because, among many distinctive features, there is a unique formation of the triosseal canal and the metatarsals are fused proximally to distally, the opposite of that in modern birds<ref>{{cite book |last1=Feduccia |first1=Alan |year=1996 |title=The Origin and Evolution of Birds |url=https://archive.org/details/originevolutiono0000fedu |url-access=registration |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-06460-5}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nFeduccia's point about the ''[[tarsometatarsus]]'' (the combined upper foot and ankle bone) is correct, but Walker did not use this reasoning in his original paper. Walker never described the fusion of the tarsometatarsus as opposite, but rather as \"Only partial\". Also, it is not certain that enantiornitheans had triosseal canals, since no fossil preserves this feature.<ref name=\"chiappe&walker2002\"/>\n\nAs a group, the Enantiornithes are often referred to as \"enantiornithines\". However, several scientists have noted that this is incorrect, because following the standard rules for forming the names of animal groups, it implies reference only to the subfamily [[Enantiornithinae]]. Following the naming conventions used for modern birds as well as extinct groups, it has been pointed out that the correct term is \"enantiornithean\".<ref name=\"youetal2006\">{{cite journal |last1=You |first1=Hai-lu |last2=Lamanna |first2=Matthew C. |last3=Harris |first3=Jerald D. |last4=Chiappe |first4=Luis M. |last5=O'Connor |first5=Jingmai |last6=Ji |first6=Shu-an |last7=L\u00fc |first7=Jun-chang |last8=Yuan |first8=Chong-xi |last9=Li |first9=Da-qing |last10=Zhang |first10=Xing |last11=Lacovara |first11=Kenneth J. |last12=Dodson |first12=Peter |last13=Ji |first13=Qiang |title=A Nearly Modern Amphibious Bird from the Early Cretaceous of Northwestern China |journal=Science |date=16 June 2006 |volume=312 |issue=5780 |pages=1640\u20131643 |doi=10.1126/science.1126377 |pmid=16778053 |bibcode=2006Sci...312.1640Y }}</ref>\n\n==Origin and range==\nEnantiornitheans have been found on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Fossils attributable to this group are exclusively [[Cretaceous]] in age, and it is believed that Enantiornitheans became extinct at the same time as their non-avialan [[dinosaur]] relatives. The earliest known enantiornitheans are from the [[Early Cretaceous]] of [[Spain]] (e.g. ''[[Noguerornis]]'') and [[China]] (e.g. ''[[Protopteryx]]'') and the latest from the [[Late Cretaceous]] of North and South America (e.g. ''[[Avisaurus]]'' and ''[[Enantiornis]]'').

Most [[phylogenetic]] studies have recovered Enantiornithes as a monophyletic group distinct from the modern birds and their closest relatives.

The details of the interrelationship of all these lineages, indeed the validity of most, is disputed, although the Avisauridae, for one example, seem likely to constitute a valid group.

Its 2006 description studied the [[histology]] of the skeleton, while later studies reported a squamosal bone present in the specimen but unknown in other enantiornitheans.\n*'''IVPP V 13939''': Briefly described in 2004, this Yixian enantiornithean had advanced pennaceous feathers on its legs, similar to (albeit shorter than) those of other paravians such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' and ''[[Anchiornis]]''.<ref name=legfeather />\n*'''DIP-V-15100''' and '''DIP-V-15101''': Two different wings from hatchling specimens which were described in 2015. They attracted a significant amount of media attention upon their description. They were preserved in exceptional details due to having been trapped within Burmese amber for approximately 99 million years.<ref name=\"amber_enant\" />\n*'''HPG-15-1''': A partial corpse of a hatchling enantiornithean also preserved in Burmese amber. Although indeterminate, it attracted even more media attention than the two wings upon its description in 2017.<ref name=ambercorpse />\n*'''CUGB P1202''': An indeterminate juvenile [[bohaiornithid]] from the [[Jiufotang Formation]]. A 2016 analysis of its feathering found elongated putative [[melanosomes]], suggesting that a large portion of its feathering was [[iridescent]].\n*'''DIP-V-15102''': Another corpse of an indeterminate hatchling preserved in Burmese amber. Described in early 2018.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*'''MPCM-LH-26189 a/b''': A partial skeleton of a hatchling from [[Las Hoyas]] in Spain, including both slab and counter-slab components. Its 2018 description revealed how various features developed in enantiornitheans as they aged. Such features include the [[ossification]] of the [[sternum]] from various smaller bones, and the fusion of tail vertebrae into a [[pygostyle]].\n*'''YLSNHM01001''': A foot and tail preserved in Burmese amber.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Xing |first1=Lida |last2=McKellar |first2=Ryan C. |last3=O\u2019Connor |first3=Jingmai K. |last4=Niu |first4=Kecheng |last5=Mai |first5=Huijuan |title=A mid-Cretaceous enantiornithine foot and tail feather preserved in Burmese amber |journal=Scientific Reports |date=29 October 2019 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=15513 |doi=10.1038/s41598-019-51929-9 |pmid=31664115 |bibcode=2019NatSR...915513X }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Paraves|E.|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Birds}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q132268}}\n\n[[Category:Enantiornithes|*]]\n[[Category:Cretaceous birds]]\n[[Category:Early Cretaceous first appearances]]\n[[Category:Maastrichtian extinctions]]\n", "name_user": "Mandevil", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix a typo (hat -> that)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiornithes"}
