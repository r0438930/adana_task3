It introduces the character of [[Mickey Mouse universe#Mortimer Mouse|Mortimer Mouse]].\n\n==Plot==\nMickey Mouse is by his sentient car, getting ready for his girlfriend, Minnie as they are having a picnic together, just the two of them. But then, a Spanish mouse named Mortimer, who drives a sleek sports car (who is also sentient), rushes by and stops. Mortimer Mouse is one of Minnie's old friends who is also known as the rival of Mickey Mouse. He backs up and crashes his car into Mickey's car, pushing it into a tree. Mortimer starts to make fun of his short rival, making Mickey jealous. He takes two of his buttons from his shorts off. One button is hidden in Mickey's hand whilst the other button is thrown away. Mickey grumpily tries to grab Mortimer's buttons from his long trousers, but they electrocute him (revealed to be connected to batteries) making him even more jealous.\n\nThen, Mickey's car pushes Mortimer's sports car off and tries to scare it away by rattling its engine, but Mortimer's sports car loudly honks its horn, scaring Mickey's car, making it hide behind a rock nearby.\n\nAfterwards, Minnie, Mortimer, and Mickey, who is still grumpy about Mortimer, are all having a picnic together. Then Mortimer sees a bull in a nearby pen and tries to impress Minnie by doing some bullfighting. He grabs the red picnic blanket, causing Mickey to have his nose caught on a doughnut like a ring, to use to fight the bull. Mickey jealously pulls it off, then becomes a bit nervous as Minnie applauds Mortimer and tells Mickey he is good. But Mickey pouts at Minnie, breaks a teacup and storms off back to his old car.\n\nMinnie is shocked about Mickey's jealous behavior, but she only says behind Mickey's back: \"You're just jealous.\" Mickey and his car both sit next to each other, where they both kick a rock while feeling jealous and grumpy about being teased by Mortimer and his car. Meanwhile, Mortimer is still doing his bullfighting thing. His first two attempts went well, mostly by making the bull charge into the fences around its pen, but when Mortimer sees the pen's gate open and as he's about to do a third one, he immediately yelps, runs away and flees in his sports car, leaving Minnie to deal with the bull alone after dropping the blanket over her. The bull chases Minnie, who runs away with the blanket still over her. Mickey and his car notice this and, while Mickey's car hides again, Mickey manages to stop the bull, getting stuck under it in the process while Minnie runs up a tree. Mickey bites the bull's tail, making it jump and allowing him to get out. While trying to help Minnie, the bull charges at them again. Mickey manages to get out of the way as it rams into the tree, making Minnie fall back down before she immediately climbs back up. Mickey then fights the bull with the red blanket only to get wrapped up in it and is unable to run fast enough to get away. He does manage to avoid the bull by grabbing a branch with his mouth but is forced to run again (this time by crawling like a caterpillar) when the bull turns around. Mickey's car suddenly sees his owner in danger and saves him by pushing the bull aside, but the bull immediately begins chasing the car. The car once again hides while the bull turns its attention back to Mickey. His car quickly saves Mickey again by biting the bull's tail and getting it to chase it using its red taillight, tiring it out. After luring the bull towards it again, it then uses its back wheels to splash mud over the bull. Meanwhile, Mickey tries to get a still frightened Minnie down from the tree, only for them to both fall. Mickey's car catches them with the bull still in pursuit. It then creates a cloud of dust around the bull, confusing it and allowing them to escape. While on their way home, Mickey asks Minnie if Mortimer is still funny. Minnie politely denies this and they both shake hands.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Mickey Mouse: [[Walt Disney]]\n* Minnie Mouse: [[Marcellite Garner]]\n* Mortimer Mouse: unknown<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hischak |first1=Thomas S. |title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn=978-0786462711 |page=257 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Disney_Voice_Actors/e1RTP8thtR0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=traffic+troubles+mickey+mouse&pg=PA257&printsec=frontcover |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mickey Mouse (film series)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Mickey Mouse in animation}}\n\n[[Category:1936 films]]\n[[Category:1930s color films]]\n[[Category:1936 animated films]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse short films]]\n[[Category:Disney animated short films, 1930s]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wilfred Jackson]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Walt Disney]]\n\n\n{{Disney-animation-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Mickey's Rival''}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name              = Mickey's Rival\n| image             = Mickey's Rival.jpg\n| caption           = \n| director          = [[Wilfred Jackson]]\n| story             = \n| starring          = [[Walt Disney]]<br>[[Marcellite Garner]]\n| music             = \n| animator          = Les Clark<br>Clyde Geronimi<br>Dick Huemer<br>Frenchy de Tremaudan\n| layout_artist     =\n| background_artist = \n| producer          = [[Walt Disney]]\n| studio            = [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]]\n| distributor       = \n| released          = {{Film date|1936|6|20|ref1=<ref name=ultimate>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=J.B. |last2=Gerstein |first2=David |title=Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse: The Ultimate History |date=2018 |publisher=Taschen |location=Cologne |isbn=978-3-8365-5284-4}}</ref>}}\n| color_process     = [[Technicolor]]\n| runtime           = 7 min (one reel)\n| language          = [[English language|English]]\n}}\n'''''Mickey's Rival''''' is a 1936 [[Mickey Mouse]] short film.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFs5evuicXwC&pg=PA109 | title=Animated Short Films: A Critical Index to Theatrical Cartoons | publisher=Scarecrow Press | author=Boroweic, Piotr | year=1998 | pages=109}}</ref> It was directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] and produced by [[Walt Disney]].
