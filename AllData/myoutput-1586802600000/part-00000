It is an [[independent city]] located in the centre of the [[Rosenheim (district)|district of Rosenheim]] ([[Upper Bavaria]]), and is also the seat of its administration. It is located on the west bank of the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] at the confluence of the rivers Inn and [[Mangfall]], in the [[Bavarian Alpine Foreland]]. It is the third largest city in Upper Bavaria with over 61,000 inhabitants. Rosenheim is the economic centre and the busiest place in the region.\n\n==Geography==\nThe population of the town proper is approximately 60,000 inhabitants with up to 125,000 in the surrounding area. Rosenheim is situated in the Upper-Bavarian Alpine Foothills, {{convert|450|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and covers an area of {{convert|37.52|km\u00b2|2|abbr=out}}. The capital of Bavaria, [[Munich]], is {{convert|52|km|0|abbr=off}} away in North-West direction from Rosenheim. [[Rosenheim station]] is at the junction of the [[Munich\u2013Rosenheim railway|Munich\u2013Rosenheim]], the [[Rosenheim\u2013Salzburg railway|Rosenheim\u2013Salzburg]] and the [[Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein railway|Munich\u2013Innsbruck]] lines.\n\nThe landscape around Rosenheim was formed during the last ice age from the advancement of the [[Inn Valley Glacier]] and later from the Rosenheim lake. The lake existed about 10,000 years ago, covering the whole [[Inn valley]] as far as [[Wasserburg am Inn]], about {{cvt|25|km}} north of Rosenheim.\n\nEven today in many places around the town the former shoreline can be recognised where the former flat lake bed changes suddenly into relatively steep embankment.\n\n{{wide image|Marct_Rosenhaimb.jpg|650px|View of Rosenheim in 1701}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rosenheim heilig geist.jpg|thumb|right|Rosenheim, churches St. Nikolaus and Heilig Geist]]\nRosenheim's development can be traced from its location on intersecting major trade routes. Even in early times, the town's intersecting traffic stimulated its development as a market town. It subsequently evolved from a market to a salt trade and then [[railway town]] to today's wood and college town.\n\n=== Pons Aeni ===\nCrucial to the establishment of Rosenheim were the Inn and the corresponding [[Inntal]]. The Romans arrived in the year 15 BC under the leadership of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]]. They founded to the East right of the Inn the province [[Noricum]] and to the west of the Inn [[Raetia|Rhaetia]]. The [[Colonization|colonizers]] built a road through the [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]] to [[Castra Regina]], and one running east\u2013west road from [[Iuvavum]] to [[Augusta Vindelicorum|Augusta Vindelicum]]. The intersection of these two enormously important trade routes were protected by a military station whose name was \"Pons Aeni\". Less frequently used terms were \"Ponte Aoni\", \"Ad enum\" or \"stations Enensis\". The Romano Celtic settlement existed for some 500 years with that name. Pons was between Aeni Isinisca ([[Aying]]) and {{ill|Bedaium|de}} (today part of [[Seeon-Seebruck]]), as shown on the Roman road map [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] from the 4th century. The name \"Pons Aeni\" can still be recognised in local place names, \"Pfunzen\" in the name of the district \"Langenpfunzen\" and \"Leonhardspfunzen\".<ref>Stefan Trux, Franz Hilger: ''Rosenheim \u2013 Tor zum Inntal.'' S. 12.</ref>\n\n[[File:Schloss Rosenheim.jpg|thumb|Schloss Rosenheim in 1900, watercolour by Michael Kotz]]\n\n=== Origin of the town's name ===\nThe origin of the town's name is not completely clear. First mentioned in 1234, Rosenheim castle is on the eastern bank of the Inn, on today's castle hill, overlooking a new bridge over the Inn. Perhaps the name comes from the Rosenheim Rose emblem of the [[Wasserburg am Inn|Wasserburger]] Earl Hall, who built the castle. Another theory is that originally the name Ross was derived from the ''R\u00f6ssern'' steeds that were used in medieval times to pull the river transport vessels, and for which there were large stables in Rosenheim. Still in use today the street names ''Am Esbaum'' (the tree on which the horses were grazing) or ''Am Ro\u00dfacker'' are possible indications.\n\nAnother theory suggests that there could be a kindred word ''Roas'', ''Roze'' oder ''Ried'', that used to mean swamp and peat bogs, which are still to be found around Rosenheim - evident also by the name of the neighboring town of Rosenheim [[Kolbermoor]]. An example of the old names, the nearby village of [[Riedering]]. Maybe the name is also derived from Rosenheim personal names ''Roso''/''Hrodo''.\nThe most beautiful word for word theory is that formerly 'Rose' used to mean a beautiful girl. It was well known among the Inn boatmen that there were many beauties to admire in this town. The sailors of the town liked to control what was called \"home of the Rose\" - in other words Rosenheim.\n\n=== Development of Rosenheim ===\nAt about the time the first mention of Rosenheim castle in 1234, a settlement of boatmen developed on the western shore. The area around the Inn Bridge was not developed for a long time due to marshy soil at the proximity of the mouth of the river [[Mangfall]], so the settlement was located several hundred meters away. The centre of Rosenheim is therefore not directly on the riverside.\n\n[[File:Rosenheim - Neue Innbr\u00fccke.jpg|thumb|right|Rosenheim and new Inn bridge on the postcard]]\n\n=== Market Rosenheim ===\nThe town quickly grew in importance as a hub for all types of goods that were transported to the Inn (livestock, grain, silk, arms, salt), and received the 1328 [[Market town|Markets]] status. The Rosenheim ship masters made Rosenheim very wealthy during this era through the transport of goods, due to the location between [[Hall in Tirol]] the Inn and onwards to the Danube down to [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]]. Until about 1600 the settlement had grown into one of the largest and most important markets in Bavaria, even though [[town privileges]] were only attained in 1864 from the Bavarian King Ludwig II.\n\nRosenheim experienced economic decline during the 17th century in the wake of the decline of Inn Shipping Company and the consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. There were also a plague epidemic (1634) and a market fire (1641).\n\n[[File:Rosenheim 19th century.jpg|thumb|left|Rosenheim in the 19th century]]\n\nIn the 19th century Rosenheim developed as an economic centre in the Southeast of Bavaria due to [[brine]]. In 1810 an early type of wooden pipeline brought brine from the salt mines in the area [[Bad Reichenhall|Reichenhall]] and [[Traunstein]] to Rosenheim. Boiling the salt made Rosenheim the centre of Bavarian salt production until 1958.\n\nExpansion of the railways brought early connection to the railway. In 1858 Rosenheim station was inaugurated, which however would soon be too small and prove a hindrance for further urban development, in 1876 the station moved to its present site. The old railway line was the straight through road (now the Town Hall and Prince Regent Street, main Rosenheimer transport axis, from the northwest to the southeast of the town), the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the first station now serves as an exhibition center, the old station is directly opposite the 1878 City Hall - and is used in the [[ZDF]] evening series \"[[Die Rosenheim-Cops]]\" as the backdrop of the police headquarters.\n\n[[File:Rosenheim 1860 A.jpg|thumb|left|Rosenheim about 1860]]\n\nThe economic boom of the late 19th and early 20th century made the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] - and [[Art Nouveau]] (and its regional characteristics, the [[Swiss chalet style]]) the most important architectural style, which now determines the townscape. It was built in the emerging civic centre to the present Town Hall and the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Rosenheim for rare Gothic Revival-style brick for the widening Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Rosenheim had nine breweries which are still preserved in the names of some restaurants (Duschl-, Hof-, Mail-, Pernloher-, Stern-, Wei\u00dfbr\u00e4u). The only survivors being \"{{ill|Auerbr\u00e4u|de}}\" and \"{{ill|Fl\u00f6tzinger Br\u00e4u|bar||de}}\" and supply, among others, the \"[[M\u00e4rzen]]\" for the \"{{ill|Rosenheimer Herbstfest|de}}\", as well as the Bierbichler Wei\u00dfbr\u00e4u.\n\n=== Rosenheim in the Nazi era ===\n[[File:Fuente de Juan Nepomuceno, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 63.jpg|thumb|Nepomuk statue]]\n[[File:Iglesia de San Salvador, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 59.jpg|thumb|150px|Redeemer church]]\nThe number of Jews living in Rosenheim was high compared to other Bavarian cities.  However, at the start of the 20th century, the Jewish community consisted of about 50 people. The request to the city council for establishment of a separate Jewish religious association, with reference to the Bavarian-Jewish legislation, was refused, so the Rosenheim Jews remained attached to the state capital, where their dead also had to be buried.  Even the funeral of the First World War fallen son of a Jewish merchant based in Rosenheim at the city cemetery was refused and was \"the biggest disappointment and the bitterest pain\" for the father.\n[[File:Mittertor, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 65.jpg|thumb|left|Mittertor, old town entrance]]\n\nWith the creation of the first local Nazi group outside of Munich in 1920, the Rosenheim Jews saw increasing hostility.  Centre of hate campaigns was the Rosenheim School.  A scandal occurred in June 1920, after a reader accused the writer of a letter titled \"Rosenheimer Jews\" in the local press, who wanted to repeal the provisions of the Versailles Treaty and held military exercises  at the Rosenheim School.  Seven members of the high school and a member of the \"Chiemgau\" then raided a villa inhabited by Jews in the ''Herbststrasse''.  The college of the town of Rosenheim, on July 29, 1920 came to the conclusion that {{\"|\u2026 es sei bedauerlich, dass die Bewegung zur Bek\u00e4mpfung eines volksausbeuterischen Judentums [\u2026], die in ihrem Wesen gewi\u00df berechtigt sei, durch solche Ausw\u00fcchse in Mi\u00dfkredit komme.}} \"... it was regrettable that the people's movement to fight exploitative Jews[...], which certainly was justified in its nature, has been discredited.\" Protests of the Bavarian Jewish Central Association were unsuccessful, only an unmistakable message of the Bavarian Interior Ministry September 1920 was able to maintain peace.\n[[File:Lokschuppen in Rosenheim02 klein.jpg|thumb|right|Lokschuppen exhibition center]]\n\nOn April 1, 1933, shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, guards were set up in front of Jewish shops, warning against buying in these stores, but to desist assault and criminal damage.  A large proportion of the population ignored these calls.  The shops were therefore still frequented, much to the annoyance of Nazi activists who acted with the backing of then-Mayor Gmelch.  Despite the support of the population, six of the eleven Jewish business owners gave up their businesses by 1937.\n\nThe assassination of German diplomat vom Rath by the Jew Herschel Grynszpan on 7 November 1938 in Paris was taken as a final opportunity to strike against the Jews. The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] came with 8 to 10 men on November 10 at 3\u20134 o'clock in the morning to the last two Jewish shops and destroyed their inventory and merchandise.\n\nThe fate of many Rosenheim Jews is documented. Those who could, emigrated, mostly to the United States. However, many failed entry and exit applications, and many died in concentration camps.<ref name=\"RiDR\">Rosenheim im Dritten Reich; Beitr\u00e4ge zur Stadtgeschichte, editor Kulturamt der Stadt Rosenheim 1989</ref>\n\n===Bombing during the Second World War ===\n[[File:Westerndorf.jpg|thumb|St. John the Baptist church and [[Bavarian Alps]]]]\n\nFrom the beginning of bombing raids on German cities in the spring of 1942, Rosenheim was not spared.  In November 1943 there were shelters for only 650 people for a population of approximately 22,000. However, by February 1944 shelters had been built for about 6400 people and in conjunction with other shelters a total of 10,525 people could be protected.\n\nDuring 14 bomb attacks, 201 people were killed and 179 injured. The focus of the air attacks was the railway station and the railway tracks, as Rosenheim was an important transportation hub between Munich, Salzburg and Innsbruck. The neighbouring communities of Ziegelberg, Stephanskirchen, Westerndorf St. Peter and Oberpfaffenhofen were also hit. The first air attack was on 20 October 1944 at lunch time from 12:47 to 13:17 o'clock with over a hundred aircraft dropping 1,000 bombs, leaving 27 dead and 59 wounded. The heaviest air raid took place on 18 April 1945. From 14:40 to 14:55 around 200 to 1300 aircraft dropped bombs in the area around the station, resulting in 53 dead and 36 injured, in addition, this attack also made 800 people homeless. The station building was almost completely destroyed and railway tracks were destroyed over a length of 20 kilometers. The last air attacks were made on 19 and 21 April 1945. During the war the majority of at least 173 unexploded bombs were recovered. In 1964, the ''[[Oberbayerisches Volksblatt]]'' reported that the approximate location of 38 undiscovered unexploded ordnance was known.<ref name=\"RiDR\"/>\n\n=== Historical timeline ===\n[[File:Inn Rosenheim.jpeg|thumb|Bridge on the river [[Inn (river)|Inn]]]]\n[[File:Rosenheim, RO - M\u00fcnchener Str Nrn 8 bis 4 Gillitzerblock v S.JPG|thumb|Pedestrian zone M\u00fcnchener Str. with Gillitzerblock]]\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|----- align=right \n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 15AD || align=left | Forerunner of Rosenheim: Roman Military station Pons Aeni (Bridge, cemetery, pottery)\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1234 || First record of \u201eSchloss Rosenheim\u201c\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1276 || First record of the Bridge over the Inn and salt transport\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1328 || Rosenheim gets market status\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1602 || First market regulations\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1641 || The great fire of 1641\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1700 || Founding of a bath\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1810 || Roxal [[brine]] salt works founded\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1811 || First suspension bridge over the Inn\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1864 || Market Rosenheim becomes a town\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1870 || Rosenheim obtains town status\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1925 || Founding of the  ''Holztechnikum Rosenheim''\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1971 || Founding of the ''[[Fachhochschule]]''\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1982 || Opening of the city hall (today the Kultur- und Kongresszentrum Rosenheim ''KU\u2019KO'' (Culture and Congress Centre))\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1984 || Opening of the pedestrian zone\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1988 || Opening of the exhibition centre {{ill|Lokschuppen Rosenheim|lt=Lokschuppen|de}}\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 2006 || Renovation of the church Nikolauskirche\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 2007 || Rebuilding of the square Ludwigplatz\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 2010 || {{ill|Landesgartenschau Rosenheim 2010|lt=Regional garden festival in Rosenheim|de}}\n|}\n|}\n\n=== Population growth ===\n[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung in rosenheim.svg|thumb|right|Population growth in Rosenheim since 1840]]\nThe population growth rate in the last 10 years was about 3&nbsp;Percent.\n{| \n| valign=\"top\" width=25% |\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center; width:60%;\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center; width:35%;\" | Population\n! style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center; width:5%;\"  |\n|-\n| 1815 || 2.240 <ref>Joseph von Kl\u00f6ckel: Rosenheim mit seiner Heilquelle und Umgegend im Jahre 1815 beschrieben, 1. vol.: Rosenheim mit seiner Heilquelle, M\u00fcnchen 1815, hier: S. 19</ref> || &nbsp;\n|-\n| 1861 || 4.140 <ref name=\"chronik_rosenheim\">Stempfle: Chronik der Stadt Rosenheim 1860\u20131890, in: Das bayerische Inn-Oberland 43 (1981), S. 73\u2013148</ref> || &nbsp;\n|-\n| 1880 || 8.355 <ref name=\"chronik_rosenheim\"/> || &nbsp;\n|-\n| 1900 || 14.247 <ref>Das bayerische Oberland am Inn 6 (1907), S. 69</ref> || &nbsp;\n|-\n| 1905 || 15.403 <ref>Brockhaus ''Kleines Konversations-Lexikon.''

This may indicate the former arms of [[Wasserburg am Inn]] have returned, because Wasserburg ruled Rosenheim until 1247. The oldest known seal of Rosenheim was built in 1374 and already shows the rose, which has not changed since.  The only exception is a picture by [[Philipp Apian]], which was painted around the year 1568 and shows a border around the rose.<ref>Wappenverzeichnis: [http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/r/rosenhei.htm http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/r/rosenhei.htm]</ref>\n\nThere exists also a logo for Rosenheim, containing the same rose which is present on the coat of arms.\n\n== Landmarks and culture  ==\n[[File:Kultur und Kongresszentrum Rosenheim-1.jpg|thumb|Kultur- und Kongress-Zentrum]]\n\n=== Theater ===\nThe ''Kultur- und Kongresszentrum Rosenheim (KU'KO)'' (Culture and Congress Centre) was built on the site of the [[brine]] works, demolished in 1967. Inaugurated on October 2, 1982 as the town hall, now the Culture and Congress Centre Rosenheim has evolved over the years into a national event centre.  Today in the 3000-square-foot multipurpose building approximately 400 events are held annually.\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Ludwigsplatz Rosenheim 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ludwigsplatz]]\n[[File:Mangfalleinm\u00fcndung in den Inn.jpg|thumb|Confluence of the river [[Mangfall]] in the river [[Inn (river)|Inn]]]]\nSince 1885, the {{ill|Mittertor|de}} has housed the Municipal Museum with a large collection (about 5000 exhibits) of the cultural history of the town and [[Rosenheim (district)|district of Rosenheim]], from the prehistory and early history and Roman times to the recent town history in the 20th century. It is one of the most important regional history collections in South East Upper Bavaria.\n\nThe Inn Museum houses the hydraulic engineering and marine technology collection of the Rosenheim Water Management Office and is located in the historic river master's ''Bruckbaustadel'' at the Inn Bridge.  With many original objects, the museum displays the Inn Shipping Company, the source of Rosenheim's prosperity in the Middle Ages, in the past centuries.  In addition, the museum provides facts about the river landscape and river engineering, geology, settlement history, marine engineering, bridge design and the development of waterways.\n\nThe ''Wood technology Museum'' was established in 1990 in the listed Ellmaierhaus. It is housed on the first floor, which is accessed via the so-called Jacob's ladder.  At more than 400 square meters of exhibition space displays this unique museum, which is closely related to the ''timber town of Rosenheim'' and its training centres for wood occupations, wood as a raw material, its importance and processing past and present.  The exhibition shows not only the end products, but also their production and the necessary tools.  Regular special exhibitions complete the offer of the ''Wood technology Museum''.\n\nThe Municipal Gallery of 1935-1937 was built by [[German Bestelmeyer]]. Every year, six art exhibitions are held here. In addition to contemporary art, also exhibitions of works from the 19th and 20th century are held.  A thematic focus is the art from the region and the [[Munich School]].\n\nThe ''{{ill|Lokschuppen Rosenheim|lt=Lokschuppen|de}}'' is an internationally renowned exhibition centre with annually changing exhibitions in the former railways round house.\n\nThe brine pump house is one of the few monuments in the town which recall time from 1810 to 1958 of Rosenheim's brine industry.<ref>Ludwig Gassner: ''Rosenheim und dessen Umgebung.

Admission is only possible with town guides or by agreement with the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nThe ''{{ill|Klepper Faltbootwerft|lt=Klepper|de||nl|Klepper (kano)}}'' museum houses various exhibits, on the one hand the history of the Klepper [[folding boat]], coats and tents.  On the other hand, it is also dedicated to the development of the company Klepper, who was once the biggest employer in Rosenheim.\n\n===Architecture ===\n[[File:Lokschuppen in Rosenheim05 klein Trux.jpg|thumb|Town Hall Rosenheim]]\nThe Mittertor (the sole survivor of five market gates) was the eastern gate of the market before 1350, which was then protected with a double ditch. Since the 15th century, it separated the interior from the exterior of the market served as a customs office. Until the 19th century it also contained several municipal facilities such as the [[Clerk (municipal official)|town clerk's]] office. After the great fire in 1641 the Rosenheim onion dome was built and later extended into a long building.  At its core is the Mittertor the oldest building in town.  On the fa\u00e7ade to the side of the square is the emblem of Louis Rosenheim, with the white rose against a red background. The [[coat of arms of Bavaria|Bavarian crest]] can also be seen here.\n[[File:Ludwigsplatz Fischbrunnen Rosenheim-1.jpg|thumb|right|Ludwigsplatz]]\n\nThe street ''M\u00fcnchener Strasse'' follows the ''Gillitzerblock'', that is also called \"small pedestrian zone.\"  Immediately apparent are the magnificently restored [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] fronts.  The name ''Gillitzerblock'' come from its builder Thomas Gillitzer.  At the end of the 19th century he obtained a relatively large area of land, for its day, and built 15 houses, including the Hotel ''Deutscher Kaiser''. Since the 1960s, the once solely Gr\u00fcnderzeit ensemble has been altered with new construction and renovations.  Only the fa\u00e7ades in ''M\u00fcnchener Strasse'' have been preserved and restored to the original.\n\nThe ''Quest-{{ill|Kunstm\u00fchle|de}}'' was built from 1855 to 1916 in several phases as industrial complexes. ''Kunstm\u00fchle'' was at these times the name for technically advanced mills - German ''Kunst'' means art. The mill was renovated in the 1990s and now serves as a restaurant and office space. The ''Quest-Kunstm\u00fchle'' Power station is located on the Mangfallkanal. The former mill houses the exhibition halls of the Rosenheim arts club. The approximately {{convert|200|m\u00b2|0|abbr=out}} upper floor holds exhibitions of contemporary artists, exchange exhibitions with other art associations and activities accompanying the exhibition.\n\nThe Rosenheim ballroom was built in the former Rosenheim Hofbr\u00e4us buildings. The hall with ballroom and vaulted cellar was built in 1878. It was renovated in 1994 and since 2001 has been used as an event space, with its many possible uses of the centre of the eastern town of Rosenheim.\n\nThe town's landmark is the gothic spire ({{convert|65|m|0|abbr=on}}) of the parish church St. Nikolaus ({{convert|1450|m|0|abbr=on}}) with its baroque [[onion dome]] ({{convert|1641|m|0|abbr=on}}).\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float: right; width:30%\"\n|+ Sculptures in the ''Salingarten''\n! style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | Name || style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | Sculptor\n|-\n| Wasserrad || Josef Hamberger\n|-\n| Stehende || Rolf M\u00e4rkl\n|-\n| Liegende || {{ill|Marianne L\u00fcdicke|de}}\n|-\n| Mensch und Pferd || Prof. Heinrich Kirchner\n|-\n| Norne || Louise Stomps\n|-\n| Passantengruppe || Erika Maria Lankes\n|-\n| Stele || Alfred Regnat\n|}\n\n=== Parks ===\nThe ''Kunstwiese'' shows three-dimensional contemporary art works by artists from Rosenheim all year round.\n\nThe ''Riedergarten'' was created in 1729 as a private herb garden by Rosenheim pharmacist Johann Rieder. It was sold to the town in 1925 by physician Dr. Herman Rieder for use as a summer garden. In 2002 the garden was redesigned by the opening up of a previously culverted stream, adding a modern character.\n\nSince 1987 the ''Salingarten'', in front of the Culture and Congress Centre Ku'Ko, has been used as a sculpture garden. Large sculptures by important sculptors from Rosenheim and environment can be seen here.\n\n==Transport==\n\nThere are regular regional train connections to Munich and [[Salzburg]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n[[File:Franz Ferdinand (band) 2008.11.24 009.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Nick McCarthy]]]]\n\n*[[Nick McCarthy|Nicholas McCarthy]] (born 1974), English musician\n*[[Siegfried Fischbacher]]\n*[[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] (1893-1946), [[First world war|WWI]] [[Jagdgeschwader I (World War I)|flying ace]], German politician & senior member of [[NSDAP]] and convicted [[holocaust|war criminal]].\n*[[George Dzundza]] (born 1945), actor\n*[[Nadine Samonte]] (born 1988), actress\n*[[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] (1916-1982), [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]] ace pilot, was not from Rosenheim, but he spent the last years of his life in the town.[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13805, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]]]\n*[[Philipp Grubauer]], NHL goaltender\n*[[Tobias Schweinsteiger]] (born 1982), brother of [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], former football player\n*[[Edmund Stoiber]], (born 1941), politician and jurist, former Minister President of Bavaria (CSU)\n*[[Mark Benecke]] (born 1970), biologist\n*[[Jupp Kapellmann]] (born 1949), former German footballer\n*[[Lars Bender]] (born 1989), footballer\n*[[Sven Bender]] (born 1989), footballer\n*[[Martin Tomczyk]] (born 1981), auto racing driver\n*[[Ray Manzarek]] (1939-2013), American musician, member of [[The Doors]]\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nRosenheim is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften|url=https://www.rosenheim.de/stadt-buerger/wir-ueber-uns/staedtepartnerschaften.html|website=rosenheim.de|publisher=Rosenheim|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Lazise]], Italy, since 1974\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Brian\u00e7on]], France, since 1979\n*{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Ichikawa, Chiba|Ichikawa]], Japan, since 2004\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Out of Rosenheim]]\n* [[Rosenheim Poltergeist]]\n* [[Starbulls Rosenheim]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}} {{in lang|de}}\n* [https://www.fh-rosenheim.de/ Fachhochschule Rosenheim] {{in lang|de}}\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rosenheim}}\n\n{{Germany_districts_bavaria}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rosenheim| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in Bavaria]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Inn (river)]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||municipality in the district of Altenkirchen|Rosenheim, Rhineland-Palatinate|the Bavarian district|Rosenheim (district)|other uses}}\n{{Infobox German location <!--was \"Infobox Town DE\"-->\n|type = Stadt\n|name = Rosenheim\n|name_local =\n|image_photo       = Rosenheim,_X,_aufgehellt.jpeg\n|image_caption     = 2010 aerial photo of Rosenheim and [[Simssee]].\n|image_coa =  Wappen Rosenheim Neu.svg\n| <!-- image_map =  map_rosenheim_in_germany.png -->\n|state = Bavaria\n|regbzk = Oberbayern\n|district = [[List of German urban districts|urban district]]\n|population = 60465\n|population_as_of = {{date|2007-06-30}}\n|population_ref =\n|Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel = 09163000\n|area = 37.22\n|elevation = 440\n|elevationmax = 470\n|coordinates = {{coord|47|51|0|N|12|8|0|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| lat_hem = N\n| lon_hem = E\n|postal_code = 83001-83028\n|area_code = 08031\n|licence = RO\n|mayor = Gabriele Bauer<ref>[https://www.rosenheim.de/stadt-buerger/politik-und-rathaus/oberbuergermeisterin.html Oberb\u00fcrgermeisterin Gabriele Bauer] Stadt Rosenheim (2014)</ref>\n|party =CSU\n|website = [https://www.rosenheim.de/ rosenheim.de]\n}}\n'''Rosenheim''' is a town in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is an [[independent city]] located in the centre of the [[Rosenheim (district)|district of Rosenheim]] ([[Upper Bavaria]]), and is also the seat of its administration. It is located on the west bank of the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] at the confluence of the rivers Inn and [[Mangfall]], in the [[Bavarian Alpine Foreland]]. It is the third largest city in Upper Bavaria with over 61,000 inhabitants. Rosenheim is the economic centre and the busiest place in the region.\n\n==Geography==\nThe population of the town proper is approximately 60,000 inhabitants with up to 125,000 in the surrounding area. Rosenheim is situated in the Upper-Bavarian Alpine Foothills, {{convert|450|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and covers an area of {{convert|37.52|km\u00b2|2|abbr=out}}. The capital of Bavaria, [[Munich]], is {{convert|52|km|0|abbr=off}} away in North-West direction from Rosenheim. [[Rosenheim station]] is at the junction of the [[Munich\u2013Rosenheim railway|Munich\u2013Rosenheim]], the [[Rosenheim\u2013Salzburg railway|Rosenheim\u2013Salzburg]] and the [[Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein railway|Munich\u2013Innsbruck]] lines.\n\nThe landscape around Rosenheim was formed during the last ice age from the advancement of the [[Inn Valley Glacier]] and later from the Rosenheim lake. The lake existed about 10,000 years ago, covering the whole [[Inn valley]] as far as [[Wasserburg am Inn]], about {{cvt|25|km}} north of Rosenheim.\n\nEven today in many places around the town the former shoreline can be recognised where the former flat lake bed changes suddenly into relatively steep embankment.\n\n{{wide image|Marct_Rosenhaimb.jpg|650px|View of Rosenheim in 1701}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rosenheim heilig geist.jpg|thumb|right|Rosenheim, churches St. Nikolaus and Heilig Geist]]\nRosenheim's development can be traced from its location on intersecting major trade routes. Even in early times, the town's intersecting traffic stimulated its development as a market town. It subsequently evolved from a market to a salt trade and then [[railway town]] to today's wood and college town.\n\n=== Pons Aeni ===\nCrucial to the establishment of Rosenheim were the Inn and the corresponding [[Inntal]]. The Romans arrived in the year 15 BC under the leadership of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]]. They founded to the East right of the Inn the province [[Noricum]] and to the west of the Inn [[Raetia|Rhaetia]]. The [[Colonization|colonizers]] built a road through the [[Brenner Pass|Brenner]] to [[Castra Regina]], and one running east\u2013west road from [[Iuvavum]] to [[Augusta Vindelicorum|Augusta Vindelicum]]. The intersection of these two enormously important trade routes were protected by a military station whose name was \"Pons Aeni\". Less frequently used terms were \"Ponte Aoni\", \"Ad enum\" or \"stations Enensis\". The Romano Celtic settlement existed for some 500 years with that name. Pons was between Aeni Isinisca ([[Aying]]) and {{ill|Bedaium|de}} (today part of [[Seeon-Seebruck]]), as shown on the Roman road map [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] from the 4th century. The name \"Pons Aeni\" can still be recognised in local place names, \"Pfunzen\" in the name of the district \"Langenpfunzen\" and \"Leonhardspfunzen\".<ref>Stefan Trux, Franz Hilger: ''Rosenheim \u2013 Tor zum Inntal.'' S. 12.</ref>\n\n[[File:Schloss Rosenheim.jpg|thumb|Schloss Rosenheim in 1900, watercolour by Michael Kotz]]\n\n=== Origin of the town's name ===\nThe origin of the town's name is not completely clear. First mentioned in 1234, Rosenheim castle is on the eastern bank of the Inn, on today's castle hill, overlooking a new bridge over the Inn. Perhaps the name comes from the Rosenheim Rose emblem of the [[Wasserburg am Inn|Wasserburger]] Earl Hall, who built the castle. Another theory is that originally the name Ross was derived from the ''R\u00f6ssern'' steeds that were used in medieval times to pull the river transport vessels, and for which there were large stables in Rosenheim. Still in use today the street names ''Am Esbaum'' (the tree on which the horses were grazing) or ''Am Ro\u00dfacker'' are possible indications.\n\nAnother theory suggests that there could be a kindred word ''Roas'', ''Roze'' oder ''Ried'', that used to mean swamp and peat bogs, which are still to be found around Rosenheim - evident also by the name of the neighboring town of Rosenheim [[Kolbermoor]]. An example of the old names, the nearby village of [[Riedering]]. Maybe the name is also derived from Rosenheim personal names ''Roso''/''Hrodo''.\nThe most beautiful word for word theory is that formerly 'Rose' used to mean a beautiful girl. It was well known among the Inn boatmen that there were many beauties to admire in this town. The sailors of the town liked to control what was called \"home of the Rose\" - in other words Rosenheim.\n\n=== Development of Rosenheim ===\nAt about the time the first mention of Rosenheim castle in 1234, a settlement of boatmen developed on the western shore. The area around the Inn Bridge was not developed for a long time due to marshy soil at the proximity of the mouth of the river [[Mangfall]], so the settlement was located several hundred meters away. The centre of Rosenheim is therefore not directly on the riverside.\n\n[[File:Rosenheim - Neue Innbr\u00fccke.jpg|thumb|right|Rosenheim and new Inn bridge on the postcard]]\n\n=== Market Rosenheim ===\nThe town quickly grew in importance as a hub for all types of goods that were transported to the Inn (livestock, grain, silk, arms, salt), and received the 1328 [[Market town|Markets]] status. The Rosenheim ship masters made Rosenheim very wealthy during this era through the transport of goods, due to the location between [[Hall in Tirol]] the Inn and onwards to the Danube down to [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]]. Until about 1600 the settlement had grown into one of the largest and most important markets in Bavaria, even though [[town privileges]] were only attained in 1864 from the Bavarian King Ludwig II.\n\nRosenheim experienced economic decline during the 17th century in the wake of the decline of Inn Shipping Company and the consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. There were also a plague epidemic (1634) and a market fire (1641).\n\n[[File:Rosenheim 19th century.jpg|thumb|left|Rosenheim in the 19th century]]\n\nIn the 19th century Rosenheim developed as an economic centre in the Southeast of Bavaria due to [[brine]]. In 1810 an early type of wooden pipeline brought brine from the salt mines in the area [[Bad Reichenhall|Reichenhall]] and [[Traunstein]] to Rosenheim. Boiling the salt made Rosenheim the centre of Bavarian salt production until 1958.\n\nExpansion of the railways brought early connection to the railway. In 1858 Rosenheim station was inaugurated, which however would soon be too small and prove a hindrance for further urban development, in 1876 the station moved to its present site. The old railway line was the straight through road (now the Town Hall and Prince Regent Street, main Rosenheimer transport axis, from the northwest to the southeast of the town), the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the first station now serves as an exhibition center, the old station is directly opposite the 1878 City Hall - and is used in the [[ZDF]] evening series \"[[Die Rosenheim-Cops]]\" as the backdrop of the police headquarters.\n\n[[File:Rosenheim 1860 A.jpg|thumb|left|Rosenheim about 1860]]\n\nThe economic boom of the late 19th and early 20th century made the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] - and [[Art Nouveau]] (and its regional characteristics, the [[Swiss chalet style]]) the most important architectural style, which now determines the townscape. It was built in the emerging civic centre to the present Town Hall and the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Rosenheim for rare Gothic Revival-style brick for the widening Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Rosenheim had nine breweries which are still preserved in the names of some restaurants (Duschl-, Hof-, Mail-, Pernloher-, Stern-, Wei\u00dfbr\u00e4u). The only survivors being \"{{ill|Auerbr\u00e4u|de}}\" and \"{{ill|Fl\u00f6tzinger Br\u00e4u|bar||de}}\" and supply, among others, the \"[[M\u00e4rzen]]\" for the \"{{ill|Rosenheimer Herbstfest|de}}\", as well as the Bierbichler Wei\u00dfbr\u00e4u.\n\n=== Rosenheim in the Nazi era ===\n[[File:Fuente de Juan Nepomuceno, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 63.jpg|thumb|Nepomuk statue]]\n[[File:Iglesia de San Salvador, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 59.jpg|thumb|150px|Redeemer church]]\nThe number of Jews living in Rosenheim was high compared to other Bavarian cities.  However, at the start of the 20th century, the Jewish community consisted of about 50 people. The request to the city council for establishment of a separate Jewish religious association, with reference to the Bavarian-Jewish legislation, was refused, so the Rosenheim Jews remained attached to the state capital, where their dead also had to be buried.  Even the funeral of the First World War fallen son of a Jewish merchant based in Rosenheim at the city cemetery was refused and was \"the biggest disappointment and the bitterest pain\" for the father.\n[[File:Mittertor, Rosenheim, Alemania, 2019-05-19, DD 65.jpg|thumb|left|Mittertor, old town entrance]]\n\nWith the creation of the first local Nazi group outside of Munich in 1920, the Rosenheim Jews saw increasing hostility.  Centre of hate campaigns was the Rosenheim School.  A scandal occurred in June 1920, after a reader accused the writer of a letter titled \"Rosenheimer Jews\" in the local press, who wanted to repeal the provisions of the Versailles Treaty and held military exercises  at the Rosenheim School.  Seven members of the high school and a member of the \"Chiemgau\" then raided a villa inhabited by Jews in the ''Herbststrasse''.  The college of the town of Rosenheim, on July 29, 1920 came to the conclusion that {{\"|\u2026 es sei bedauerlich, dass die Bewegung zur Bek\u00e4mpfung eines volksausbeuterischen Judentums [\u2026], die in ihrem Wesen gewi\u00df berechtigt sei, durch solche Ausw\u00fcchse in Mi\u00dfkredit komme.}} \"... it was regrettable that the people's movement to fight exploitative Jews[...], which certainly was justified in its nature, has been discredited.\" Protests of the Bavarian Jewish Central Association were unsuccessful, only an unmistakable message of the Bavarian Interior Ministry September 1920 was able to maintain peace.\n[[File:Lokschuppen in Rosenheim02 klein.jpg|thumb|right|Lokschuppen exhibition center]]\n\nOn April 1, 1933, shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, guards were set up in front of Jewish shops, warning against buying in these stores, but to desist assault and criminal damage.  A large proportion of the population ignored these calls.  The shops were therefore still frequented, much to the annoyance of Nazi activists who acted with the backing of then-Mayor Gmelch.  Despite the support of the population, six of the eleven Jewish business owners gave up their businesses by 1937.\n\nThe assassination of German diplomat vom Rath by the Jew Herschel Grynszpan on 7 November 1938 in Paris was taken as a final opportunity to strike against the Jews. The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] came with 8 to 10 men on November 10 at 3\u20134 o'clock in the morning to the last two Jewish shops and destroyed their inventory and merchandise.\n\nThe fate of many Rosenheim Jews is documented. Those who could, emigrated, mostly to the United States. However, many failed entry and exit applications, and many died in concentration camps.<ref name=\"RiDR\">Rosenheim im Dritten Reich; Beitr\u00e4ge zur Stadtgeschichte, editor Kulturamt der Stadt Rosenheim 1989</ref>\n\n===Bombing during the Second World War ===\n[[File:Westerndorf.jpg|thumb|St. John the Baptist church and [[Bavarian Alps]]]]\n\nFrom the beginning of bombing raids on German cities in the spring of 1942, Rosenheim was not spared.  In November 1943 there were shelters for only 650 people for a population of approximately 22,000. However, by February 1944 shelters had been built for about 6400 people and in conjunction with other shelters a total of 10,525 people could be protected.\n\nDuring 14 bomb attacks, 201 people were killed and 179 injured. The focus of the air attacks was the railway station and the railway tracks, as Rosenheim was an important transportation hub between Munich, Salzburg and Innsbruck. The neighbouring communities of Ziegelberg, Stephanskirchen, Westerndorf St. Peter and Oberpfaffenhofen were also hit. The first air attack was on 20 October 1944 at lunch time from 12:47 to 13:17 o'clock with over a hundred aircraft dropping 1,000 bombs, leaving 27 dead and 59 wounded. The heaviest air raid took place on 18 April 1945. From 14:40 to 14:55 around 200 to 1300 aircraft dropped bombs in the area around the station, resulting in 53 dead and 36 injured, in addition, this attack also made 800 people homeless. The station building was almost completely destroyed and railway tracks were destroyed over a length of 20 kilometers. The last air attacks were made on 19 and 21 April 1945. During the war the majority of at least 173 unexploded bombs were recovered. In 1964, the ''[[Oberbayerisches Volksblatt]]'' reported that the approximate location of 38 undiscovered unexploded ordnance was known.<ref name=\"RiDR\"/>\n\n=== Historical timeline ===\n[[File:Inn Rosenheim.jpeg|thumb|Bridge on the river [[Inn (river)|Inn]]]]\n[[File:Rosenheim, RO - M\u00fcnchener Str Nrn 8 bis 4 Gillitzerblock v S.JPG|thumb|Pedestrian zone M\u00fcnchener Str. with Gillitzerblock]]\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|----- align=right \n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 15AD || align=left | Forerunner of Rosenheim: Roman Military station Pons Aeni (Bridge, cemetery, pottery)\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1234 || First record of \u201eSchloss Rosenheim\u201c\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1276 || First record of the Bridge over the Inn and salt transport\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1328 || Rosenheim gets market status\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1602 || First market regulations\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1641 || The great fire of 1641\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1700 || Founding of a bath\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1810 || Roxal [[brine]] salt works founded\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1811 || First suspension bridge over the Inn\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1864 || Market Rosenheim becomes a town\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1870 || Rosenheim obtains town status\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1925 || Founding of the  ''Holztechnikum Rosenheim''\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1971 || Founding of the ''[[Fachhochschule]]''\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1982 || Opening of the city hall (today the Kultur- und Kongresszentrum Rosenheim ''KU\u2019KO'' (Culture and Congress Centre))\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1984 || Opening of the pedestrian zone\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 1988 || Opening of the exhibition centre {{ill|Lokschuppen Rosenheim|lt=Lokschuppen|de}}\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 2006 || Renovation of the church Nikolauskirche\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 2007 || Rebuilding of the square Ludwigplatz\n|-----\n| style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | 2010 || {{ill|Landesgartenschau Rosenheim 2010|lt=Regional garden festival in Rosenheim|de}}\n|}\n|}\n\n=== Population growth ===\n[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung in rosenheim.svg|thumb|right|Population growth in Rosenheim since 1840]]\nThe population growth rate in the last 10 years was about 3&nbsp;Percent.\n{| \n| valign=\"top\" width=25% |\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center; width:60%;\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center; width:35%;\" | Population\n! style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center; width:5%;\"  |\n|-\n| 1815 || 2.240 <ref>Joseph von Kl\u00f6ckel: Rosenheim mit seiner Heilquelle und Umgegend im Jahre 1815 beschrieben, 1. vol.: Rosenheim mit seiner Heilquelle, M\u00fcnchen 1815, hier: S. 19</ref> || &nbsp;\n|-\n| 1861 || 4.140 <ref name=\"chronik_rosenheim\">Stempfle: Chronik der Stadt Rosenheim 1860\u20131890, in: Das bayerische Inn-Oberland 43 (1981), S. 73\u2013148</ref> || &nbsp;\n|-\n| 1880 || 8.355 <ref name=\"chronik_rosenheim\"/> || &nbsp;\n|-\n| 1900 || 14.247 <ref>Das bayerische Oberland am Inn 6 (1907), S. 69</ref> || &nbsp;\n|-\n| 1905 || 15.403 <ref>Brockhaus ''Kleines Konversations-Lexikon.''

This may indicate the former arms of [[Wasserburg am Inn]] have returned, because Wasserburg ruled Rosenheim until 1247. The oldest known seal of Rosenheim was built in 1374 and already shows the rose, which has not changed since.  The only exception is a picture by [[Philipp Apian]], which was painted around the year 1568 and shows a border around the rose.<ref>Wappenverzeichnis: [http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/r/rosenhei.htm http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/r/rosenhei.htm]</ref>\n\nThere exists also a logo for Rosenheim, containing the same rose which is present on the coat of arms.\n\n== Landmarks and culture  ==\n[[File:Kultur und Kongresszentrum Rosenheim-1.jpg|thumb|Kultur- und Kongress-Zentrum]]\n\n=== Theater ===\nThe ''Kultur- und Kongresszentrum Rosenheim (KU'KO)'' (Culture and Congress Centre) was built on the site of the [[brine]] works, demolished in 1967. Inaugurated on October 2, 1982 as the town hall, now the Culture and Congress Centre Rosenheim has evolved over the years into a national event centre.  Today in the 3000-square-foot multipurpose building approximately 400 events are held annually.\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Ludwigsplatz Rosenheim 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ludwigsplatz]]\n[[File:Mangfalleinm\u00fcndung in den Inn.jpg|thumb|Confluence of the river [[Mangfall]] in the river [[Inn (river)|Inn]]]]\nSince 1885, the {{ill|Mittertor|de}} has housed the Municipal Museum with a large collection (about 5000 exhibits) of the cultural history of the town and [[Rosenheim (district)|district of Rosenheim]], from the prehistory and early history and Roman times to the recent town history in the 20th century. It is one of the most important regional history collections in South East Upper Bavaria.\n\nThe Inn Museum houses the hydraulic engineering and marine technology collection of the Rosenheim Water Management Office and is located in the historic river master's ''Bruckbaustadel'' at the Inn Bridge.  With many original objects, the museum displays the Inn Shipping Company, the source of Rosenheim's prosperity in the Middle Ages, in the past centuries.  In addition, the museum provides facts about the river landscape and river engineering, geology, settlement history, marine engineering, bridge design and the development of waterways.\n\nThe ''Wood technology Museum'' was established in 1990 in the listed Ellmaierhaus. It is housed on the first floor, which is accessed via the so-called Jacob's ladder.  At more than 400 square meters of exhibition space displays this unique museum, which is closely related to the ''timber town of Rosenheim'' and its training centres for wood occupations, wood as a raw material, its importance and processing past and present.  The exhibition shows not only the end products, but also their production and the necessary tools.  Regular special exhibitions complete the offer of the ''Wood technology Museum''.\n\nThe Municipal Gallery of 1935-1937 was built by [[German Bestelmeyer]]. Every year, six art exhibitions are held here. In addition to contemporary art, also exhibitions of works from the 19th and 20th century are held.  A thematic focus is the art from the region and the [[Munich School]].\n\nThe ''{{ill|Lokschuppen Rosenheim|lt=Lokschuppen|de}}'' is an internationally renowned exhibition centre with annually changing exhibitions in the former railways round house.\n\nThe brine pump house is one of the few monuments in the town which recall time from 1810 to 1958 of Rosenheim's brine industry.<ref>Ludwig Gassner: ''Rosenheim und dessen Umgebung.

Until the 19th century it also contained several municipal facilities such as the [[Clerk (municipal official)|town clerk's]] office. After the great fire in 1641 the Rosenheim onion dome was built and later extended into a long building.  At its core is the Mittertor the oldest building in town.  On the fa\u00e7ade to the side of the square is the emblem of Louis Rosenheim, with the white rose against a red background. The [[coat of arms of Bavaria|Bavarian crest]] can also be seen here.\n[[File:Ludwigsplatz Fischbrunnen Rosenheim-1.jpg|thumb|right|Ludwigsplatz]]\n\nThe street ''M\u00fcnchener Strasse'' follows the ''Gillitzerblock'', that is also called \"small pedestrian zone.\"  Immediately apparent are the magnificently restored [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] fronts.  The name ''Gillitzerblock'' come from its builder Thomas Gillitzer.  At the end of the 19th century he obtained a relatively large area of land, for its day, and built 15 houses, including the Hotel ''Deutscher Kaiser''. Since the 1960s, the once solely Gr\u00fcnderzeit ensemble has been altered with new construction and renovations.  Only the fa\u00e7ades in ''M\u00fcnchener Strasse'' have been preserved and restored to the original.\n\nThe ''Quest-{{ill|Kunstm\u00fchle|de}}'' was built from 1855 to 1916 in several phases as industrial complexes. ''Kunstm\u00fchle'' was at these times the name for technically advanced mills - German ''Kunst'' means art. The mill was renovated in the 1990s and now serves as a restaurant and office space. The ''Quest-Kunstm\u00fchle'' Power station is located on the Mangfallkanal. The former mill houses the exhibition halls of the Rosenheim arts club. The approximately {{convert|200|m\u00b2|0|abbr=out}} upper floor holds exhibitions of contemporary artists, exchange exhibitions with other art associations and activities accompanying the exhibition.\n\nThe Rosenheim ballroom was built in the former Rosenheim Hofbr\u00e4us buildings. The hall with ballroom and vaulted cellar was built in 1878. It was renovated in 1994 and since 2001 has been used as an event space, with its many possible uses of the centre of the eastern town of Rosenheim.\n\nThe town's landmark is the gothic spire ({{convert|65|m|0|abbr=on}}) of the parish church St. Nikolaus ({{convert|1450|m|0|abbr=on}}) with its baroque [[onion dome]] ({{convert|1641|m|0|abbr=on}}).\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float: right; width:30%\"\n|+ Sculptures in the ''Salingarten''\n! style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | Name || style=\"background:#CCDDEE;\" | Sculptor\n|-\n| Wasserrad || Josef Hamberger\n|-\n| Stehende || Rolf M\u00e4rkl\n|-\n| Liegende || {{ill|Marianne L\u00fcdicke|de}}\n|-\n| Mensch und Pferd || Prof. Heinrich Kirchner\n|-\n| Norne || Louise Stomps\n|-\n| Passantengruppe || Erika Maria Lankes\n|-\n| Stele || Alfred Regnat\n|}\n\n=== Parks ===\nThe ''Kunstwiese'' shows three-dimensional contemporary art works by artists from Rosenheim all year round.\n\nThe ''Riedergarten'' was created in 1729 as a private herb garden by Rosenheim pharmacist Johann Rieder. It was sold to the town in 1925 by physician Dr. Herman Rieder for use as a summer garden. In 2002 the garden was redesigned by the opening up of a previously culverted stream, adding a modern character.\n\nSince 1987 the ''Salingarten'', in front of the Culture and Congress Centre Ku'Ko, has been used as a sculpture garden. Large sculptures by important sculptors from Rosenheim and environment can be seen here.\n\n==Transport==\n\nThere are regular regional train connections to Munich and [[Salzburg]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n[[File:Franz Ferdinand (band) 2008.11.24 009.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Nick McCarthy]]]]\n\n*[[Nick McCarthy|Nicholas McCarthy]] (born 1974), English musician\n*[[Siegfried Fischbacher]]\n*[[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] (1893-1946), [[First world war|WWI]] [[Jagdgeschwader I (World War I)|flying ace]], German politician & senior member of [[NSDAP]] and convicted [[holocaust|war criminal]].\n*[[George Dzundza]] (born 1945), actor\n*[[Nadine Samonte]] (born 1988), actress\n*[[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] (1916-1982), [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]] ace pilot, was not from Rosenheim, but he spent the last years of his life in the town.[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13805, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]]]\n*[[Philipp Grubauer]], NHL goaltender\n*[[Tobias Schweinsteiger]] (born 1982), brother of [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], former football player\n*[[Edmund Stoiber]], (born 1941), politician and jurist, former Minister President of Bavaria (CSU)\n*[[Mark Benecke]] (born 1970), biologist\n*[[Jupp Kapellmann]] (born 1949), former German footballer\n*[[Lars Bender]] (born 1989), footballer\n*[[Sven Bender]] (born 1989), footballer\n*[[Martin Tomczyk]] (born 1981), auto racing driver\n*[[Ray Manzarek]] (1939-2013), American musician, member of [[The Doors]]\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nRosenheim is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften|url=https://www.rosenheim.de/stadt-buerger/wir-ueber-uns/staedtepartnerschaften.html|website=rosenheim.de|publisher=Rosenheim|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Lazise]], Italy, since 1974\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Brian\u00e7on]], France, since 1979\n*{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Ichikawa, Chiba|Ichikawa]], Japan, since 2004\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Out of Rosenheim]]\n* [[Rosenheim Poltergeist]]\n* [[Starbulls Rosenheim]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}} {{in lang|de}}\n* [https://www.fh-rosenheim.de/ Fachhochschule Rosenheim] {{in lang|de}}\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rosenheim}}\n\n{{Germany_districts_bavaria}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rosenheim| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in Bavaria]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Inn (river)]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenheim"}
