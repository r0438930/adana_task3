They together survived the [[Vilna Ghetto]]. A couple weeks before its final liquidation, in September 1943, they escaped its liquidation, together with a few hundred other Jews from the ghetto, by gaining a work-permit for working in [[Karl Plagge]]'s hastily expanded [[HKP 562 forced labor camp]] on Suba\u010diaus Street in Vilnius. HKP562 served a few workshops (that were spread out through Vilnius) one primary task was for the conversion of smaller trucks to use wood as fuel. At the workshop to which Schwartzberg was assigned he served as their spokesperson.\n\nAlbeit the survival rate at HKP562 was higher than in the liquidated Vilna ghetto, Plagge and some of his more benevolent officers could not avert the outcome, and most of the Jewish workers of the HKP were later also liquidated mainly by Ukrainian and Estonian SS in July 1944 before the Russians occupied Vilna/Vilnius. Schwartzberg, with wife and son, survived this liquidation by switching to new hiding places during the night, as their previous ones got discovered and those caught then murdered. Most of these hiding places were makeshift and often overfilled, which increased their likelihood of discovery.\n\nFor the Schwartzbergs and other surviving Jews the subsequent [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|Soviet occupation]] was a liberation. But Vilnius/Vilna, before the German invasion, was a predominately [[History of Vilnius|Polish and Jewish city]] but after the genocide in Lithuania, the Vilna Jewish society and community to which Schwartzberg previously belonged did not exist anymore. Thus after the Schwartzbergs recuperated, and as the Red Army proceeded west-ward towards Berlin, Schwartzberg and his family also left Vilnius and moved west. To the city of [[Szczecin]] in Poland, and then three weeks after the [[Battle of Berlin|German capitulation]], to Berlin.  An additional important calculation in Schwartzberg's decision to leave Vilna, his hometown, was also to avoid the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced migration east]] of many people in Lithuania by the Soviets, including surviving Jews.  For a related reason, he lied about his place of birth, as being Lodz, Poland, on arriving into East Berlin.  The Soviets had the policy then of repatriating people from the Baltics, often also shipping them further east.  For this reason he took the additional precaution of misinforming the Soviets about his place of birth and that of his wife and child.\n\nIn February 1949 Schwartzberg, and his wife and son, immigrated to the United States.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1949/02/17/archives/dp-chief-arrives-in-land-of-choice-modern-solomon-who-helped.html \"DP CHIEF ARRIVES IN LAND OF CHOICE; Modern 'Solomon' Who Helped Thousands in Camps Weeps With Happiness on Dock\"] , ''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 February 1949</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1949/02/18/archives/having-own-room-elates-dp-leader-hirsch-schwartzberg-sees-symbol-of.html \"HAVING OWN ROOM ELATES DP LEADER; Hirsch Schwartzberg Sees Symbol of Freedom in His First Privacy in Years\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 February 1949</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Photo: [http://digitalassets.ushmm.org/photoarchives/detail.aspx?id=1115238&search=LERMAN&index=1453 \"Members of the administrative staff of the Schlachtensee displaced persons camp pose in the office of UNRRA camp director Schwartzberg\"], archives of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schwartzberg, Hirsch}}\n[[Category:1907 births]]\n[[Category:1987 deaths]]\n[[Category:Holocaust survivors]]\n[[Category:Lithuanian Jews]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n|name= Hirsch Schwartzberg\n|image=File:ZentralKomiteePresidentSchwartzbergAtTheD\u00fcppel-CenterOfficePotsdamerChausseeInTheUSZoneBerlin.jpg\n|image_size=250\n|caption= Hirsch Schwartzberg in the D\u00fcppel-Center Office\n|birth_name=\n|birth_date= {{birth date|1907|10|28|df=yes}}\n|birth_place= [[Vilnius]] (Vilna), Russian Empire\n|residence= Vilnius\n|death_date= {{death date and age|1987|10|17|1907|10|28|df=yes}}\n|death_place= [[Ashdod]], Israel\n|resting_place=\n|monuments= [[YIVO]]\n|nationality= Polish, American\n|known_for= Leading [[Holocaust]] surviving [[Jewish refugees]] in [[Allied-occupied Germany#Berlin|Berlin]]\n|education=\n|alma_mater= |occupation=  truck business, Jewish DP leader, farmer in [[Vineland, New Jersey]], USA\n|party = none\n|spouse= Rivkah Schwartzberg\n|relatives=\n}}\n\n'''Hirsch Schwartzberg''' (Szwarcberg, Schwarzberg) (28 October 1907, in [[Vilna]]<ref>[http://multiculturalcanada.ca/node/255901?display=full# \"Passport to Nowhere: The Story of a Great Truck Driver\"] ([http://multiculturalcanada.ca/node/255939 2nd page]), by Gertrude Samuels, ''[[The Canadian Jewish Review]],'' 19 November 1948; originally from the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', 19 September 1948, (retrieved 30 Nov 2012)</ref> \u2014 17 October 1987 in [[Ashdod]]{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}) was a [[Jewish]] leader of [[Holocaust]] survivors ({{lang-yi|\u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05e3 \u05d1\u05e8\u05dc\u05d9\u05df}}) under the [[Allied occupation of Berlin|American occupation of Berlin]].\n\nHe was president of the Central Committee of Jewish Displaced Persons in Berlin.
