It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and [[Richard Curtis]], and produced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].<ref name=\"Atkinson people\">\"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/tvandradio Pick of the Day]\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nAfter university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for [[London Weekend Television]] in 1979 called [[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|''Canned Laughter'']]. Atkinson then went on to do [[Not the Nine O'Clock News|''Not the Nine O'Clock News'']] for the [[BBC]], produced by his friend [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. He featured in the show with [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Mel Smith]], and was one of the main sketch writers.\n\nThe success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' led to him taking the lead role of [[Edmund Blackadder]] in ''[[Blackadder]]''. The first series [[The Black Adder|''The Black Adder'']] (1983), set in the medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with [[Richard Curtis]]. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. [[Blackadder II|''Blackadder II'']] (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the [[Elizabethan era]]. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels [[Blackadder the Third|''Blackadder the Third'']] (1987), set in the [[Regency era]], and [[Blackadder Goes Forth|''Blackadder Goes Forth'']] (1989), set in World War I. The ''Blackadder'' series became one of the most successful of all [[BBC]] situation comedies, spawning television specials including [[Blackadder's Christmas Carol|''Blackadder's Christmas Carol'']] (1988), [[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years|''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years'']] (1988), and later [[Blackadder: Back & Forth|''Blackadder: Back & Forth'']] (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final scene of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (when Blackadder and his men go \"over the top\" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as \"bold and highly poignant\". Possessing an [[acerbic wit]] and armed with numerous quick put-downs (which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed), in a 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll Edmund Blackadder was ranked third (behind [[Homer Simpson]] from [[The Simpsons|''The Simpsons'']] and [[Basil Fawlty]] from [[Fawlty Towers|''Fawlty Towers'']]) on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]]. During the 2014 [[centennial of the start of World War I]], Conservative Party politician [[Michael Gove]] and war historian [[Max Hastings]] complained about the so-called \"Blackadder version of history\".\n\nAtkinson in 1997, promoting ''Bean''. In 2014, young adults from abroad named Mr. Bean among a group of people they most associated with British culture.\n\nAtkinson's other creation, the hapless [[Mr. Bean|''Mr. Bean'']], first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for [[Thames Television]]. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened to a modern-day [[Buster Keaton]], but Atkinson himself has stated that [[Jacques Tati]]'s character [[Monsieur Hulot]] was the main inspiration.\n\nSeveral sequels to ''Mr. Bean'' appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. [[Bean (film)|''Bean'']] (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson's colleague in ''Not the Nine O'Clock News''. A second film, [[Mr. Bean's Holiday|''Mr. Bean's Holiday'']], was released in 2007. Atkinson portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in [[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|''The Thin Blue Line'']] (1995\u201396), a television sitcom written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.\n\nAtkinson has fronted campaigns for [[Kronenbourg Brewery|Kronenbourg]], [[Fujifilm]], and [[Blood donation|Give Blood]]. Atkinson appeared as a hapless and error-prone espionage agent named Richard Lathum in a long-running series of adverts for [[Barclaycard]], on which character his title role in [[Johnny English|''Johnny English'']], [[Johnny English Reborn|''Johnny English Reborn'']] and [[Johnny English Strikes Again|''Johnny English Strikes Again'']] was based. In 1999, he played [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in [[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|''The Curse of Fatal Death'']], a special [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] serial produced for the charity telethon [[Comic Relief]]. Atkinson appeared as the ''Star in a Reasonably Priced Car'' on the BBC's [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|''Top Gear'']] in July 2011, driving the [[Kia Cee'd]] around the track in 1:42.2. Placing him at the top of the leaderboard, his lap time was significantly quicker than the previous high-profile record holder [[Tom Cruise]], whose time was a 1:44.2.\n\nAtkinson appeared at the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] in London as Mr. Bean in a comedy sketch during a performance of \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\", playing a repeated single note on [[synthesizer]]. He then lapsed into a dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the [[Chariots of Fire|film of the same name]] (about the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]), beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St. Andrews, by riding in a [[minicab]] and tripping the front runner. Atkinson starred as [[Jules Maigret]] in [[Maigret (2016 TV series)|''Maigret'']], a series of television films from ITV.\n\n=== Retirement of Mr. Bean Live ===\nIn November 2012, it emerged that Rowan Atkinson intended to retire Mr. Bean. \"The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me \u2014 basically quite physical, quite childish \u2014 I increasingly feel I'm going to do a lot less of,\" Atkinson told [[The Daily Telegraph|''The Daily Telegraph'']]'s Review. \"Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their 50s being childlike becomes a little sad. You've got to be careful.\" He has also said that the role [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] him to a degree. Despite these comments, Atkinson said in 2016 that he would never retire the character of Mr. Bean.\n\nIn October 2014, Atkinson also appeared as Mr. Bean in a TV advert for [[Snickers]]. In 2015, he starred alongside [[Ben Miller]] and [[Rebecca Front]] in a sketch for BBC [[Red Nose Day]] in which Mr. Bean attends a funeral.\n\nIn 2017, he appeared as Mr. Bean in the Chinese film ''Huan Le Xi Ju Ren''. In October 2018, Atkinson (as Mr. Bean) received [[YouTube Play Buttons|YouTube's Diamond Play Button]] for his channel surpassing 10 million subscribers on the video platform. Among the most-watched channels in the world, in 2017 it had more than 4.5 billion views.\n\n=== Animated Mr. Bean ===\nIn January 2014, ITV announced a new animated series featuring Mr. Bean with Rowan Atkinson returning to the role. It was expected to be released online as a Web-series later in 2014, as a television broadcast followed shortly after.\n\nOn 6 February 2018, Regular Capital announced that there would be a Season 5 of the Animated Mr Bean in 2019 (voiced by Atkinson). The first episode, Teddy's King, aired in February 2019.\n\nFollowing yet another 3-year hiatus, a fifth season consisting of 26 episodes is scheduled to premiere in 2019 on CITV as well as on [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] channels worldwide.\n\n=== Film ===\nAtkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the \"unofficial\" [[James Bond]] movie [[Never Say Never Again|''Never Say Never Again'']] (1983) and a leading role in [[Dead on Time (1983 film)|''Dead on Time'']] (also 1983) with [[Nigel Hawthorne]]. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film [[The Appointments of Dennis Jennings|''The Appointments of Dennis Jennings'']]. He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut [[The Tall Guy|''The Tall Guy'']] (1989) and appeared alongside [[Anjelica Huston]] and [[Mai Zetterling]] in [[The Witches (1990 film)|''The Witches'']] (1990), a film adaptation of the [[Roald Dahl]] [[The Witches (novel)|children's novel]]. He played the part of Dexter Hayman in [[Hot Shots! Part Deux|''Hot Shots! Part Deux'']] (1993), a parody of [[Rambo III|''Rambo III'']], starring [[Charlie Sheen]].\n\nAtkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in [[Four Weddings and a Funeral|''Four Weddings and a Funeral'']] (1994, written and directed by his long time collaborator [[Richard Curtis]]), and featured in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] [[The Lion King|''The Lion King'']] (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the [[red-billed hornbill]]. He also sang the song \u201c[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\u201d in ''The Lion King''. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including [[Rat Race (film)|''Rat Race'']] (2001), [[Scooby-Doo (film)|''Scooby-Doo'']] (2002), jewellery salesman Rufus in another Richard Curtis British-set romantic comedy, [[Love Actually|''Love Actually'']] (2003), and the crime comedy [[Keeping Mum|''Keeping Mum'']] (2005), which also starred [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], [[Maggie Smith]], and [[Patrick Swayze]].\n\nIn addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with [[Bean (film)|''Bean'']] (1997) to international success. A sequel, [[Mr. Bean's Holiday|''Mr. Bean's Holiday'']] (2007), (again inspired to some extent by Jacques Tati in his film \u2018Les Vacances de M. Hulot\u2019), also became an international success. He has also starred in the James Bond parody [[Johnny English (film series)|''Johnny English film series'']] (2003\u20132018).\n\n=== Theatre ===\nRowan Atkinson performed live on-stage skits \u2014 also appearing with members of [[Monty Python]] \u2014 in [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|''The Secret Policeman's Ball'']] (1979) in London for [[Amnesty International]]. Atkinson undertook a four-month tour of the UK in 1980. A recording of the stage performance was subsequently released as [[Live in Belfast|''Live in Belfast'']]''.''\n\nIn 1984, Atkinson appeared in a [[West End theatre|West End]] version of the comedy play [[The Nerd (play)|''The Nerd'']] alongside a 10-year-old [[Christian Bale]]. ''The Sneeze and Other Stories'', seven short [[Anton Chekhov]] plays, translated and adapted by [[Michael Frayn]], were performed by Rowan Atkinson, [[Timothy West]] and [[Cheryl Campbell]] at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], London in 1988 and early 1989.\n\n''Oliver!'' billboard at the West End's [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, during the West End revival of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' based on [[Charles Dickens]]' novel [[Oliver Twist|''Oliver Twist'']], Atkinson played the role of [[Fagin]]. His portrayal and singing of Fagin at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London gained favourable reviews and he was nominated for an [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] for best actor in a musical or entertainment.\n\nOn 28 November 2012, Rowan Atkinson reprised the role of Blackadder at the \"We Are Most Amused\" comedy gala for [[The Prince's Trust]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved the first new Blackadder material for 10 years, with Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.\n\nIn February 2013, Atkinson took on the titular role in a 12-week production (directed by [[Richard Eyre]]) of the [[Simon Gray]] play [[Quartermaine's Terms|''Quartermaine's Terms'']] at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in London with costars [[Conleth Hill]] ([[Game of Thrones|''Game of Thrones'']]) and [[Felicity Montagu]] ([[I'm Alan Partridge|''I'm Alan Partridge'']]). In December 2013, he revived his schoolmaster sketch for Royal Free Hospital's Rocks with Laughter at the Adelphi Theatre. A few days prior, he performed a selection of sketches in a small coffee venue in front of only 30 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindychannel.com/entertainment/rowan-atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-london_26375720|title=Rowan-Atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-London_26375720|author=(SMH/WNTSU/LR)|work=RTV6|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217104405/http://www.theindychannel.com/entertainment/rowan-atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-london_26375720|archivedate=17 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Comic style ==\nBest known for his use of [[physical comedy]] in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson's other characters rely more on language. Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely [[deadpan]] delivery.\n\nOne of his better-known [[comedic device|comic devices]] is over-articulation of the \"B\" sound, such as his pronunciation of \"[[Bob (Blackadder character)|Bob]]\" in the ''[[Blackadder II]]'' episode \"[[Bells (Blackadder)|Bells]]\". Atkinson suffers from a [[Stuttering|stammer]],<ref>{{cite news|title=10 Questions for Rowan Atkinson|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1655712,00.html|access-date=1 June 2011|work=Time|date=23 August 2007}}</ref> and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.\n\nAtkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of [[Buster Keaton]],<ref name=\"Museum.tv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|title=Museum.tv|publisher=Museum.tv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005150240/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|archive-date=5 October 2014|access-date=21 June 2011}}</ref> sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called \"the man with the rubber face\"; comedic reference was made to this in an episode of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (\"[[Sense and Senility]]\"), in which [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) refers to his master, [[Edmund Blackadder|Mr. E. Blackadder]], as a \"lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".\n\n==Influences==\n\nAtkinson's early comedy influences were the sketch comedy troupe ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', made up of [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Alan Bennett]], major figures of the 1960s British [[satire boom]], and then [[Monty Python]]. Atkinson states, \u201cI remember watching them avidly as students at university.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He continued to be influenced by the work of [[John Cleese]] following his Monty Python days, regarding Cleese as being \u201ca major, major inspiration\u201d, adding, \u201cI think that he and I are quite different in our style and our approach, but certainly it was comedy I liked to watch. He was very physical. Yes, very physical and very angry.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He was also influenced by [[Peter Sellers]], whose characters [[Hrundi Bakshi]] from ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' (1968) and [[Inspector Clouseau]] from ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' films influenced Atkinson's characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English.<ref>{{cite news |title=Want funny?

It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and [[Richard Curtis]], and produced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].<ref name=\"Atkinson people\">\"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/tvandradio Pick of the Day]\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nAfter university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for [[London Weekend Television]] in 1979 called ''[[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|Canned Laughter]]''. Atkinson then went on to do ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' for the [[BBC]], produced by his friend [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. He featured in the show with [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Mel Smith]], and was one of the main sketch writers.\n\nThe success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' led to him taking the lead role of [[Edmund Blackadder]] in ''[[Blackadder]]''. The first series ''[[The Black Adder]]'' (1983), set in medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with [[Richard Curtis]]. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. ''[[Blackadder II]]'' (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the [[Elizabethan era]]. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (1987), set in the [[Regency era]], and ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989), set in World War I. The ''Blackadder'' series became one of the most successful of all [[BBC]] situation comedies, spawning television specials including ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]'' (1988), ''[[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years]]'' (1988), and later ''[[Blackadder: Back & Forth]]'' (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final scene of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (when Blackadder and his men go \"over the top\" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as \"bold and highly poignant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/|title=Blackadder Goes Forth|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Possessing an [[acerbic wit]] and armed with numerous quick put-downs (which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed), in a 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll Edmund Blackadder was ranked third (behind [[Homer Simpson]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and [[Basil Fawlty]] from ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'') on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160558/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |title=100 Greatest TV Characters |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITVProgs/2001/05/05/Y22090001/ |title=100 Greatest ...

He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film ''[[The Appointments of Dennis Jennings]]''. He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut ''[[The Tall Guy]]'' (1989) and appeared alongside [[Anjelica Huston]] and [[Mai Zetterling]] in ''[[The Witches (1990 film)|The Witches]]'' (1990), a film adaptation of the [[Roald Dahl]] [[The Witches (novel)|children's novel]]. He played the part of Dexter Hayman in ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]'' (1993), a parody of ''[[Rambo III]]'', starring [[Charlie Sheen]].\n\nAtkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994, written and directed by his long time collaborator [[Richard Curtis]]), and featured in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] ''[[The Lion King]]'' (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the [[red-billed hornbill]]. He also sang the song \u201c[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\u201d in ''The Lion King''. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]'' (2001), ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' (2002), jewellery salesman Rufus in another Richard Curtis British-set romantic comedy, ''[[Love Actually]]'' (2003), and the crime comedy ''[[Keeping Mum]]'' (2005), which also starred [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], [[Maggie Smith]], and [[Patrick Swayze]].\n\nIn addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' (1997) to international success. A sequel, ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]'' (2007), (again inspired to some extent by Jacques Tati in his film \u2018Les Vacances de M. Hulot\u2019), also became an international success.

Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely [[deadpan]] delivery.\n\nOne of his better-known [[comedic device|comic devices]] is over-articulation of the \"B\" sound, such as his pronunciation of \"[[Bob (Blackadder character)|Bob]]\" in the ''[[Blackadder II]]'' episode \"[[Bells (Blackadder)|Bells]]\". Atkinson suffers from a [[Stuttering|stammer]],<ref>{{cite news|title=10 Questions for Rowan Atkinson|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1655712,00.html|access-date=1 June 2011|work=Time|date=23 August 2007}}</ref> and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.\n\nAtkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of [[Buster Keaton]],<ref name=\"Museum.tv\" /> sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called \"the man with the rubber face\"; comedic reference was made to this in an episode of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (\"[[Sense and Senility]]\"), in which [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) refers to his master, [[Edmund Blackadder|Mr. E. Blackadder]], as a \"lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".\n\n==Influences==\n\nAtkinson's early comedy influences were the sketch comedy troupe ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', made up of [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Alan Bennett]], major figures of the 1960s British [[satire boom]], and then [[Monty Python]]. Atkinson states, \u201cI remember watching them avidly as students at university.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He continued to be influenced by the work of [[John Cleese]] following his Monty Python days, regarding Cleese as being \u201ca major, major inspiration\u201d, adding, \u201cI think that he and I are quite different in our style and our approach, but certainly it was comedy I liked to watch. He was very physical. Yes, very physical and very angry.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He was also influenced by [[Peter Sellers]], whose characters [[Hrundi Bakshi]] from ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' (1968) and [[Inspector Clouseau]] from ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' films influenced Atkinson's characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English.<ref>{{cite news |title=Want funny?
