Residents of Laranjeiras, then a district of [[Nossa Senhora do Socorro]] with a small port on the river, petitioned [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria]] for the construction of a church in 1790. With the completion of the church, Laranjeiras had two churches: the Parish Church and the [[Church of Our Lady of the Conception of Comandaroba|Church of Our Lady of the Conception]], which belonged to the Comandaroba Plantation. The church was unable to accommodate the population of Laranjeiras, which grew rapidly in the 18th century, and the building was enlarged in 1905.<ref name=\"f\"/><ref name=\"hpip\"/>\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is located on a high point above a bend in the [[Cotinguiba River]]. The church faces the river but, unusually, does not open to Pra\u00e7a da Matriz. The south fa\u00e7ade of the church, which faces the public square, has numerous small portals and windows.<ref name=\"hpip\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe building has a structure consisting of mixed masonry of stone and brick. The church has two bell towers with a monumental pediment at center. The pediment has volutes and is topped by a cross. There are three windows at the choir level and a low arch with glazed leaves and flags. The bell towers have windows similar to those at the choir level. The windows of the bell gable are arched; the gables have domes decorated with tiles and topped by pinnacles.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"pa\"/>\n\n===Interior===\n\nThe interior has a rectangular plan with a single [[nave]], chancel, and two sacristies. A chapel dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament is located left of the altar. It has a separate door of glass and wood. The altar is simple with an altarpiece with a painting of the Holy Family. This painting, along with those of the walls of the chancel, are attributed to [[Jos\u00e9 Te\u00f3filo de Jesus]].<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"pa\"/>\n\n==Protected status==\n\nThe Parish Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1941.
