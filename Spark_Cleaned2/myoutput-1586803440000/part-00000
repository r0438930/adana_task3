To support the [[Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by an [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The Flooding of hold 1 nad 2 caused the [[bow (ship) to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southhampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.\n\n==Normandy landings D-Day==\nDue to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19-22 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned.
