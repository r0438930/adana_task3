The author interviewed parents and children who had experienced separation and reported that the separation of the children from their parents together with a background of chronic and acute adversity has created a \"perfect storm for attachment damage, toxic stress and trauma\". The author noted that a child under prolonged stress \"may develop complex patterns of protective responses that can include hyperarousal\u2014hypervigilance, agitation, flashbacks and emotional reactivity, or hypoarousal\u2014dissociative responses, emotional numbing (self-harm may be used as a tool to 'feel alive'), passive compliance and poor access to cognitive functioning\".

The investigations were done in August and September 2018. Speaking with facility mental health clinicians and program directors, they reported that separated children exhibited \"fear, feelings of abandonment, and post-traumatic stress\" with some children exhibiting acute symptoms of grief such as crying inconsolably.

The investigation found that over half of the facilities that they visited had hired case managers who did not meet minimum education standards, and newly hired employees were allowed to work before their criminal and child welfare background checks had been completed. Six facilities received waivers allowing them to skip state child welfare checks altogether.<ref name=\"CBS News\"/>\n\nDemocratic Representative [[Rosa DeLauro]], who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees HHS appropriations, said in a statement that the two reports were proof \"that President Trump's family separation policy was state-sanctioned child abuse\".
