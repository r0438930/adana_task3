Fessenden was a [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] (later a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) and member of the [[List of United States political families#The Fessendens|Fessenden political family]]. He served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] before becoming [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]].\n\nA lawyer, he was a leading antislavery Whig in Maine; in Congress, he fought the [[Slave Power]] (the plantation owners who controlled southern states). He built an antislavery coalition in the state legislature that elected him to the U.S. Senate; it became Maine's Republican organization. In the Senate, Fessenden played a central role in the debates on Kansas, denouncing the expansion of slavery. He led [[Radical Republicans]]  in attacking Democrats [[Stephen Douglas]], [[Franklin Pierce]], and [[James Buchanan]]. Fessenden's speeches were read widely, influencing Republicans such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] and building support for  Lincoln's 1860 Republican presidential nomination.  During the war, Senator Fessenden helped shape the Union's taxation and financial policies. He moderated his earlier radicalism, and supported Lincoln against the Radicals, becoming Lincoln's Treasury Secretary.<ref>Landis (2008)</ref> After the war, Fessenden was back in the Senate, as chair of the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which established terms for resuming congressional representation for the southern states, and which drafted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Later, Fessenden provided critical support that prevented Senate conviction of President [[Andrew Johnson]], who had been impeached by the House. He was the first Republican Senator to ring out \"...''not guilty''\" followed by six other Republican Senators resulting in the acquittal of President Johnson.\n\nHe is the only person to have three streets in Portland named for him: William, Pitt and Fessenden streets in the city's Oakdale neighborhood.\n\n==Youth and early career==\nFessenden was born in [[Boscawen, New Hampshire]], on October 16, 1806.  His father was attorney and legislator [[Samuel Fessenden]].  His mother was Ruth Greene. The parents were unmarried. William was separated from his mother at his birth, and he was raised by his paternal grandmother for seven years.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}\n\nHe graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1823 and then studied law. He was a founding member of the [[Temperance movement|Maine Temperance Society]] in 1827.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rolde |first=Neal |title=Maine: A Narrative History |year=1990 |publisher=Harpswell Press |location=Gardiner, ME |isbn=0-88448-069-0 |pages=175}}</ref> That year he was also admitted to the bar. He practiced with his father, who was also a prominent anti-slavery activist. He practiced law first in Bridgton, [[Maine]], a year in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and afterward in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]. He was a member of the [[Maine House of Representatives]] in 1832 and was its leading debater. He refused nominations to Congress in 1831 and in 1838, and served in the Maine legislature again in 1840, becoming chairman of the house committee to revise the statutes of the state.\n\nHe was elected for one term in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a Whig in 1840. During this term, he moved to repeal the rule that excluded anti-slavery petitions and spoke upon the loan and bankrupt bills, and the army. At the end of his term in Congress, he turned his attention wholly to his law business until he was again in the Maine legislature in 1845\u201346. He acquired a national reputation as a lawyer and an anti-slavery Whig, and in 1849 prosecuted before the [[United States Supreme Court]] an appeal from an adverse decision of Judge [[Joseph Story]], and gained a reversal by an argument which [[Daniel Webster]] pronounced the best he had heard in twenty years. He was again in the Maine legislature in 1853 and 1854.\n\n==Service in U.S. Senate and Cabinet==\n[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|280px|''Running the \"Machine\"''<br />An 1864 cartoon featuring Fessenden, [[Edwin M.

Upon taking office, he immediately began speaking against the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. His speech on the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]], in 1856, received the highest praise, and in 1858 his speech on the [[Lecompton Constitution]] of Kansas, and his criticisms of the opinion of the supreme court in the [[Dred Scott case]], were considered the ablest discussion of those topics. He participated in the organization of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], being re-elected to the Senate from that group in 1860, this time without the formality of a nomination.\n\nIn 1861, he was a member of the Peace Congress. By the secession of the Southern senators, the Republicans acquired control of the senate and placed Fessenden at the head of the finance committee. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he was the most conspicuous senator in sustaining the national credit. He opposed the [[Legal Tender Act]] as unnecessary and unjust. As chairman of the finance committee, Fessenden prepared and carried through the senate all measures relating to revenue, taxation, and appropriations, and, as declared by [[Charles Sumner]], was \"in the financial field all that our best generals were in arms.\"\n[[File:FESSENDEN, William P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] portrait of Fessenden as Treasury Secretary]]\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed Fessenden [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] upon [[Salmon P. Chase]]'s resignation.  It was the darkest hour of national finances of the United States.{{According to whom|date=March 2018}} Chase had just withdrawn a loan from the market for want of acceptable bids, and the capacity of the country to lend seemed exhausted. The currency had been enormously inflated:  the paper dollar was worth only 34 cents; gold was at $280/ounce. Fessenden at first refused the office, but at last, accepted in obedience to the universal public pressure. When his acceptance became known, gold fell to $225/ounce. He declared that no more currency should be issued, and, making an appeal to the people, he prepared and put upon the market the seven-thirty loan, which proved a triumphant success. This loan was in the form of bonds bearing interest at the rate of 7.30%, which were issued in denominations as low as $50 so that people of moderate means could take them. He also framed and recommended the measures, adopted by congress, which permitted the subsequent consolidation and funding of the government loans into the 4% and 4.5% bonds.\n[[File:US-Fractional (3rd Issue)-$0.25-Fr.1294.jpg|thumb|left|Fessenden was one of only three people [[List of people on United States banknotes|depicted]] on United States [[Fractional currency]] during their lifetime.]]\nFessenden began his service as Secretary of the Treasury on July 5, 1864. The financial situation becoming favorable, in accordance with his expressed intention, he resigned the secretaryship, leaving on March 3, 1865, to return to the Senate, to which he had now for the third time been elected.\n\nFrom 1865 to 1867, he headed the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which was responsible for overseeing the readmission of states from the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] into the Union. He wrote its report, which vindicated the power of congress over the rebellious states, showed their relations to the government under the constitution and the law of nations, and recommended the constitutional safeguards made necessary by the rebellion. At this point, Fessenden was the acknowledged leader in the senate of the Republicans. He was considered a moderate, rather than Radical, Republican.\n\n[[File:Portrait of William P. Fessenden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederic Porter Vinton]]'s portrait of Fessenden, posthumous. Circa. 1870]]\nDuring President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]] in 1868, Fessenden broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators, and in a brazen act of political betrayel, voted for acquittal. These seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. He, [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html \"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\".]</ref> and [[Edmund G. Ross]]<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm \"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\".]</ref> defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction. As a result, a 35-19 vote in favor of removing the President from office failed by a single vote of reaching a 2/3 majority.  After the trial, Congressman [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal.  In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards.<ref>David O. Stewart, ''Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy'' (2009), pp. 240\u2013249, 284\u2013299.</ref>\n\nHe served as chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] during the [[37th United States Congress|37th]] through [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]]es (from 1861 to 1867), which led to his Cabinet appointment. He also served as a chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds]] during the [[40th United States Congress|40th Congress]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] during the [[41st United States Congress|41st Congress]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Library]], also during the 41st Congress. In 1867, he was one of two senators (the other was Senator [[Justin S. Morrill]] of Vermont) who voted against the purchase of [[Alaska]] from Russia.<ref>http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llej&fileName=017/llej017.db&recNum=249</ref> His last speech in the Senate was upon the bill to strengthen the public credit. He advocated the payment of the principal of the public debt in gold and opposed the notion that it might lawfully be paid in depreciated greenbacks.\n\nFor several years, he was a regent of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He received the degree of [[LL.D.]] from Bowdoin in 1858, and from [[Harvard University]] in 1864.\n\nFessenden died on September 8, 1869, while serving in the U.S. Senate. He was interred at the [[Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in Portland, Maine.  On December 14, 1869, [[George Henry Williams]] addressed the U.S. Senate to deliver a tribute to his friend and fellow Senator.<ref>Williams, George H. (1895). Occasional Addresses.

Fessenden|Thomas Amory Deblois Fessenden]], were also Congressmen. \n\nFessenden married Ellen M. Deering in 1832, and she died in 1857.  They had three sons who served in the [[American Civil War]]: Samuel Fessenden, who was killed at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], the Brigadier-General [[James Deering Fessenden]], and the Major-General [[Francis Fessenden]], the latter of whom wrote a two-volume biography of his father, ''The Life and Services of William Pitt Fessenden,'' which was published in 1907.  A fourth son, [[William Howard Fessenden]], stayed in Maine to take care of the law practice his father had established.

The financial situation becoming favorable, in accordance with his expressed intention, he resigned the secretaryship, leaving on March 3, 1865, to return to the Senate, to which he had now for the third time been elected.\n\nFrom 1865 to 1867, he headed the [[Joint Committee on Reconstruction]], which was responsible for overseeing the readmission of states from the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] into the Union. He wrote its report, which vindicated the power of congress over the rebellious states, showed their relations to the government under the constitution and the law of nations, and recommended the constitutional safeguards made necessary by the rebellion. At this point, Fessenden was the acknowledged leader in the senate of the Republicans. He was considered a moderate, rather than Radical, Republican.\n\n[[File:Portrait of William P. Fessenden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederic Porter Vinton]]'s portrait of Fessenden, posthumous. Circa. 1870]]\nDuring President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]] in 1868, Fessenden broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators, and in a courageous act of political suicide, voted for acquittal. These seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. He, [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]],<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html \"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\".]</ref> and [[Edmund G. Ross]]<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm \"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\".]</ref> defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction. As a result, a 35-19 vote in favor of removing the President from office failed by a single vote of reaching a 2/3 majority.  After the trial, Congressman [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal.  In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards.<ref>David O. Stewart, ''Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy'' (2009), pp. 240\u2013249, 284\u2013299.</ref>\n\nHe served as chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]] during the [[37th United States Congress|37th]] through [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]]es (from 1861 to 1867), which led to his Cabinet appointment. He also served as a chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds]] during the [[40th United States Congress|40th Congress]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] during the [[41st United States Congress|41st Congress]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Library]], also during the 41st Congress. In 1867, he was one of two senators (the other was Senator [[Justin S. Morrill]] of Vermont) who voted against the purchase of [[Alaska]] from Russia.<ref>http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llej&fileName=017/llej017.db&recNum=249</ref> His last speech in the Senate was upon the bill to strengthen the public credit. He advocated the payment of the principal of the public debt in gold and opposed the notion that it might lawfully be paid in depreciated greenbacks.\n\nFor several years, he was a regent of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He received the degree of [[LL.D.]] from Bowdoin in 1858, and from [[Harvard University]] in 1864.\n\nFessenden died on September 8, 1869, while serving in the U.S. Senate. He was interred at the [[Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in Portland, Maine.  On December 14, 1869, [[George Henry Williams]] addressed the U.S. Senate to deliver a tribute to his friend and fellow Senator.<ref>Williams, George H. (1895). Occasional Addresses. Portland, Oregon: F.W. Baltes and Company. pp. 21-28.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nTwo of his brothers, [[Samuel C. Fessenden|Samuel Clement Fessenden]] and [[T. A. D. Fessenden|Thomas Amory Deblois Fessenden]], were also Congressmen. \n\nFessenden married Ellen M. Deering in 1832, and she died in 1857.  They had three sons who served in the [[American Civil War]]: Samuel Fessenden, who was killed at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], the Brigadier-General [[James Deering Fessenden]], and the Major-General [[Francis Fessenden]], the latter of whom wrote a two-volume biography of his father, ''The Life and Services of William Pitt Fessenden,'' which was published in 1907.  A fourth son, [[William Howard Fessenden]], stayed in Maine to take care of the law practice his father had established.  Their fifth child was Mary Elizabeth Deering Fessenden who died in childhood. \n\nActress [[Beverly Garland]] is his great-great-granddaughter who dropped her real name Fessenden and went by her married name Garland. \n\n{{Fessenden family tree}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the 2012 film ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'', Fessenden is played by actor Walt Smith.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Congress members who died in office (1790\u20131899)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Cook, Robert J.  \"'The Grave of All My Comforts': William Pitt Fessenden as Secretary of the Treasury, 1864-65.\" ''Civil War History'' 41.3 (1995): 208-226.</ref>\n* Cook, Robert J.
