His work culminated in designing the interior of the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[Westminster]], [[London]], England, and its iconic clock tower, later renamed the Elizabeth Tower, which houses the bell known as [[Big Ben]]. Pugin designed many churches in [[England]], and some in [[Ireland]] and [[Australia]].<ref>Hill, 2007, List of Works, pp. 501\u2013528.</ref> He was the son of [[Augustus Charles Pugin|Auguste Pugin]], and the father of [[E.

Between 1821 and 1838, Pugin's father published a series of volumes of [[architectural drawing]]s, the first two entitled ''Specimens of Gothic Architecture'' and the following three ''Examples of Gothic Architecture'', that not only remained in print but were the standard references for Gothic architecture for at least the next century.\n\n===Religion===\nAs a child, his mother took Pugin each Sunday to the services of the fashionable Scottish Presbyterian preacher [[Edward Irving]] (later the founder of the Holy [[Catholic Apostolic Church]]), at his chapel in Cross Street, [[Hatton Garden]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], London.<ref>Ferrey, 1861, pp. 43\u20134.</ref> Pugin quickly rebelled against this version of Christianity: according to [[Benjamin Ferrey]], Pugin \"always expressed unmitigated disgust at the cold and sterile forms of the Scottish church; and the moment he broke free from the trammels imposed on him by his mother, he rushed into the arms of a church which, pompous by its ceremonies, was attractive to his imaginative mind\".<ref>Ferrey, 1861, p. 45.</ref>\n\n===Education and early ventures===\nPugin learned drawing from his father, and for a while attended [[Christ's Hospital]]. After leaving school, he worked in his father's office, and in 1825 and 1827 accompanied him on visits to [[France]].<ref>Eastlake, 1872, p. 146.</ref> His first commissions independent of his father were for designs for the goldsmiths Rundell and Bridge, and for designs for furniture of [[Windsor Castle]] from the upholsterers Morrel and Seddon. Through a contact made while working at Windsor, he became interested in the design of theatrical scenery, and in 1831 obtained a commission to design the sets for the production of the new opera ''Kenilworth'' at the [[Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]].<ref>Eastlake, 1872, p. 147.</ref> He also developed an interest in sailing, and briefly commanded a small merchant [[schooner]] trading between [[Great Britain]] and [[Holland]], which allowed him to import examples of furniture and carving from [[Flanders]], with which he later furnished his house at [[Ramsgate]] in Kent.<ref name=\"Eastlake, 1872, p. 148.\">Eastlake, 1872, p. 148.</ref> During one voyage in 1830, he was wrecked on the Scottish coast near [[Leith]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Graham, James Gillespie |last=Porter|first=Bertha|volume=22}}</ref> as a result of which he came into contact with [[Edinburgh]] architect [[James Gillespie Graham]], who advised him to abandon seafaring for architecture.<ref>Eastlake, 1872, pp. 147\u20138.</ref> He then established a business supplying historically accurate carved wood and stone detailing for the increasing number of buildings being constructed in the [[Gothic Revival|Gothic Revival style]], but the enterprise quickly failed.<ref name=\"Eastlake, 1872, p. 148.\"/>\n\n===Marriages===\nIn 1831, at the age of 19, Pugin married the first of his three wives, Anne Garnet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/pugina|title=Augustus Northmore Welby Pugin|work= Dictionary of Art Historians}}</ref> She died a few months later in childbirth, leaving him a daughter. He had a further six children, including the architect [[Edward Welby Pugin]], with his second wife, Louisa Burton, who died in 1844. His third wife, Jane Knill, kept a journal of their marital life, from their marriage in 1848 to Pugin's death, which was later published.<ref>Jane Pugin and Caroline Stanford, ''\"Dearest Augustus and I\": The Journal of Jane Pugin''. Spire Books, 2004.</ref> Their son was the architect [[Peter Paul Pugin]].\n\n===Salisbury===\nFollowing his second marriage in 1833, Pugin moved to [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]], with his wife,<ref>Ferrey, 1861, p. 93.</ref> and in 1835 bought half an acre of land in [[Alderbury]], about one and a half miles outside the town. On this he built a Gothic Revival style house for his family, which he named St. Marie's Grange.<ref>Ferrey, 1861, pp. 73\u20134.</ref> Of it, [[Charles Eastlake]] said \"he had not yet learned the art of combining a picturesque exterior with the ordinary comforts of an English home\".<ref>Eastlake 1872, pp. 148\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Conversion to the Roman Catholic Church===\nIn 1834, Pugin converted to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12558b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> and was received into it the following year.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120724052849/http://www.cliftondiocese.com/386 Clifton Diocese: \"Parliament's Pugin Plaque in Salisbury\".]</ref> \nPugin's father, Auguste-Charles Pugin, was a Frenchman who had immigrated to England as a result of the [[French Revolution]], and probably, like many others, converted to the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]] in order to obtain employment, because it was very improbable that any non-Anglican would obtain a governmental commission or tender, for example.\n\nBritish society at the start of the 19th century often discriminated against dissenters from the Church of England, although things began to change during Pugin's lifetime, helping to make Pugin's eventual conversion to Roman Catholicism more socially acceptable. For example, dissenters could not take degrees at the established universities of Oxford and Cambridge until 1871, but the University of London (later renamed University College London) was founded near Pugin's birthplace in 1826 with the express purpose of educating dissenters to degree standard (although it would not be able to confer degrees until 1836). Dissenters were also unable to serve on parish or city councils, be a member of Parliament, serve in the armed forces or on a jury. A number of reforms across the 19th century relieved these restrictions, one of which was the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act]] of 1829, which allowed Roman Catholics to become MPs.\n\nPugin's conversion acquainted him with new patrons and employers. In 1832 he made the acquaintance of John Talbot, [[Earl of Shrewsbury|16th Earl of Shrewsbury]], a Catholic sympathetic to his aesthetic theory and who employed him in alterations and additions to his residence of [[History of Alton Towers|Alton Towers]], which subsequently led to many more commissions.<ref name=\"auto\">Eastlake, 1872, p. 150.</ref> Shrewsbury commissioned him to build [[St. Giles' Catholic Church, Cheadle|St. Giles Roman Catholic Church]], [[Cheadle, Staffordshire|Cheadle]], [[Staffordshire]], which was completed in 1846, and Pugin was also responsible for designing the oldest Catholic Church in [[Shropshire]], [[St Peter and Paul Church, Newport]].\n\n===''Contrasts''===\n[[File:Contrasted Residences for the Poor.jpg|thumb|\"Contrasted Residences for the Poor\" from Pugin's ''Contrasts]]\nIn 1836, Pugin published ''Contrasts'', a polemical book which argued for the [[Gothic Revival|revival of the medieval Gothic style]], and also \"a return to the faith and the social structures of the Middle Ages\".<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/24/pugin-gothic-architect |title=Pugin, God's architect |last=Hill |first=Rosemary |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> The book was prompted by the passage of the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824, the former of which is often called the '''Million Pound Act''' due to the appropriation amount by Parliament for the construction of new Anglican churches in Britain. The new churches constructed from these funds, many of them in a Gothic-Revival style due to the assertion that it was the \"cheapest\" style to use, were often criticised by Pugin and many others for their shoddy design and workmanship and poor liturgical standards relative to an authentic Gothic structure.<ref>Mary Mulvey-Roberts, ed., ''The Handbook to Gothic Literature'' (Houndsmills and London: Macmillan, 1998), 94.</ref>\n\nEach plate in ''Contrasts'' selected a type of urban building and contrasted the 1830 example with its 15th-century equivalent. In one example, Pugin contrasted a medieval monastic foundation, where monks fed and clothed the needy, grew food in the gardens&nbsp;\u2013 and gave the dead a decent burial&nbsp;\u2013 with \"a [[panopticon]] [[Workhouse#Early Victorian workhouses|workhouse]] where the poor were beaten, half-starved and sent off after death for dissection. Each structure was the built expression of a particular view of humanity: Christianity versus [[Utilitarianism]].\"<ref name = \"Guardian\"/> Pugin's biographer, Rosemary Hill, wrote: \"The drawings were all calculatedly unfair. [[King's College London]] was shown from an unflatteringly skewed angle, while [[Christ Church, Oxford]], was edited to avoid showing its famous [[Tom Tower]] because that was by [[Christopher Wren]] and so not medieval. But the cumulative rhetorical force was tremendous.\"<ref name = \"Guardian\"/>\n\nIn 1841 he published his illustrated ''The True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture'', which was premised on his two fundamental principles of Christian architecture. He conceived of \"Christian architecture\" as synonymous with medieval, \"Gothic\", or \"pointed\", architecture. In the work, he also wrote that contemporary craftsmen seeking to emulate the style of medieval workmanship should reproduce its methods.\n\n===Ramsgate===\nIn 1841 he left [[Salisbury]],<ref name=\"auto1\">Eastlake, 1872, pp. 150\u20131.</ref> having found it an inconvenient base for his growing architectural practice.<ref>Ferrey, 1861, p. 94.</ref> He sold St. Marie's Grange at a considerable financial loss,<ref>Eastlake, 1872, p. 96.</ref> and moved temporarily to [[Cheyne Walk]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London. He had, however, already purchased a parcel of land at West Cliff, [[Ramsgate]], [[Thanet District|Thanet]] in Kent, where he proceeded to build for himself a large house and, at his own expense, a [[Pugin's Church and Shrine of St Augustine|church dedicated to St. Augustine]], after whom he thought himself named. He worked on this church whenever funds permitted it. His second wife died in 1844 and was buried at [[St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham]], which he had designed.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Architectural commissions===\nFollowing the destruction by fire of the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[Westminster]], [[London]], in 1834, Pugin was employed by [[Charles Barry|Sir Charles Barry]] to supply interior designs for his entry to the architectural competition which would determine who would build the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. Pugin also supplied drawings for the entry of James Gillespie Graham. This followed a period of employment when Pugin had worked with Barry on the interior design of [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]. Despite his conversion to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1834, Pugin designed and refurbished both [[Anglican]] and [[Catholic]] churches throughout [[England]].\n\nOther works include [[St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham|St. Chad's Cathedral]], [[Erdington Abbey]], and [[Oscott College]], all in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. He also designed the collegiate buildings of St. Patrick and St. Mary in [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]], [[Ireland]]; though not the collegiate chapel. His original plans included both a chapel and an ''aula maxima'' (great hall), neither of which were built because of financial constraints. The college chapel was designed by a follower of Pugin, the Irish architect J. J. McCarthy. Also in [[Ireland]], Pugin designed St. Mary's Cathedral in [[Killarney]], [[St. Aidan's Cathedral]] in [[Enniscorthy]] (renovated in 1996), and the Dominican Church of the Holy Cross in [[Tralee]]. He revised the plans for [[St Michael's Church, Ballinasloe|St. Michael Church]] in [[Ballinasloe]], [[Galway]], [[Ireland]]. [[Bishop Wareing]] also invited Pugin to design what eventually became [[Northampton Cathedral]], a project that was completed in 1864 by Pugin's son [[Edward Welby Pugin]].\n\nPugin visited [[Italy]] in 1847; his experience there confirmed his dislike of [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] architecture, but he found much to admire in the medieval art of northern [[Italy]].\n\n===Illness and death===\n[[File:Pugintile.jpg|thumb|Tiles designed by Pugin (c.1845\u201351)]]\nIn February 1852, while travelling with his son Edward by train, Pugin suffered a total breakdown and arrived in London unable to recognise anyone or speak coherently. For four months he was confined to a private asylum, [[Kensington House (academy)|Kensington House]]. In June, he was transferred to the [[Royal Bethlem Hospital]], popularly known as Bedlam.<ref name=\"Hill484\">Hill, 2007, pp. 484\u2013490</ref> At that time, Bethlem Hospital was opposite [[St George's Cathedral, Southwark]], one of Pugin's major buildings, where he had married his third wife, Jane, in 1848. Jane and a doctor removed Pugin from Bedlam and took him to a private house in Hammersmith where they attempted therapy, and he recovered sufficiently to recognise his wife.<ref name=\"Hill484\"/> In September, Jane took her husband back to [[The Grange, Ramsgate|The Grange in Ramsgate]], where he died on 14 September 1852.<ref name=\"Hill484\"/> He is buried in his church next to The Grange, [[Pugin's Church and Shrine of St Augustine|St Augustine's, Ramsgate]].\n[[File:The tomb of Augustus Pugin in St Augustine's Church, Ramsgate.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Augustus Pugin in St Augustine's Church, Ramsgate]]\n\nOn Pugin's death certificate, the cause listed was \"convulsions followed by coma\". Pugin's biographer, Rosemary Hill, suggests that, in the last year of his life, he was suffering from [[hyperthyroidism]] which would account for his symptoms of exaggerated appetite, perspiration, and restlessness. Hill writes that Pugin's medical history, including eye problems and recurrent illness from his early twenties, suggests that he contracted [[syphilis]] in his late teens, and this may have been the cause of his death at the age of 40.<ref name=\"Hill492\">Hill, 2007, pp. 492\u2013494</ref>\n\n==Palace of Westminster==\n[[File:Palace of Westminster Westminster Hall south.jpg|thumb|[[Palace of Westminster]]]]\nIn October 1834, the [[Palace of Westminster]] [[Burning of Parliament|burned down]]. Subsequently, the Prime Minister, [[Sir Robert Peel]], wanted, now that he was premier, to disassociate himself from the controversial [[John Wilson Croker]], who was a founding member of the Athenaeum Club; a close associate of the pre-eminent neoclassical architects [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]] and [[Decimus Burton]]; an advocate of neoclassicism; and a repudiator of the neo-gothic style.<ref name=\"Williams pp.69-75\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Guy |title=Augustus Pugin Versus Decimus Burton: A Victorian Architectural Duel|year=1990|publisher=Cassell Publishers Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-304-31561-3|pages=69\u201375}}</ref> Consequently, Peel appointed a committee chaired by Edward Cust, a detestor of the style of John Nash and William Wilkins, which resolved that the new Houses of Parliament would have to be in either the 'gothic' or the 'Elizabethan' style.<ref name=\"Williams pp.69-75\"/> Augustus W.

The design is very close to earlier designs by Pugin, including an unbuilt scheme for [[Scarisbrick Hall]], Lancashire. The tower was Pugin's last design before descending into madness. In her biography, Hill quotes Pugin as writing of what is probably his best known building: \"I never worked so hard in my life [as] for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all the designs for finishing his bell tower & it is beautiful & I am the whole machinery of the clock.\"<ref>Hill, 2007, pp. 481\u2013483</ref> Hill writes that Barry omitted to give any credit to Pugin for his huge contribution to the design of the new [[Houses of Parliament]].<ref>Hill, 2007, p. 480</ref> In 1867, after the deaths of both Pugin and Barry, Pugin's son [[E. W.

He arrived in Ireland in 1838 at a time of greater religious tolerance, when Catholic churches were permitted to be built. Most of his work in Ireland consisted of religious buildings. Pugin demanded the highest quality of workmanship from his craftsmen, particularly the stonemasons. His subsequent visits to the country were brief and infrequent. He was the main architect of [[St Aidan's Cathedral|St Aidan's Roman Catholic Cathedral]] for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns|diocese of Ferns]] in [[Enniscorthy|Enniscorthy, County Wexford]]. Pugin was the architect of the [[Russell Library (St. Patrick's College)|Russell Library]] at St. Patrick's College, Maynoooth, although he did not live to see its completion. Pugin did the initial design of St. Mary's Cathedral Killarney\n\n==Pugin and Australia==\n{{one source|section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:BerrimaStFrancisXavier's.jpg|thumb|St Francis Xavier's Church, Berrima, New South Wales, designed by Augustus Pugin]]\nThe first [[Roman Catholicism in Australia|Catholic]] Bishop of [[New South Wales]], Australia, [[John Bede Polding]], met Pugin and was present when [[St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham]] and [[St Giles' Catholic Church, Cheadle]] were officially opened. Polding persuaded Pugin to design a series of churches for him. Although a number of churches do not survive, St Francis Xavier's in [[Berrima, New South Wales]], is regarded as a fine example of a Pugin church.\n\nSt Stephen's Chapel, now in the cathedral grounds in Elizabeth Street, [[Brisbane]], was built to a design of Pugin. Construction began in 1848, and the first mass in the church was celebrated on 12 May 1850. In 1859 [[James Quinn (Australian bishop)|James Quinn]] was appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane|Bishop of Brisbane]], Brisbane becoming a diocese, and Pugin's small church became a cathedral. When the new cathedral of St Stephen was opened in 1874 the small Pugin church became a school room, and later church offices and storage room. It was several times threatened with demolition before its restoration in the 1990s. In Sydney, there are several altered examples of his work, namely St Benedict's, [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]]; St Charles Borromeo, [[Ryde, New South Wales|Ryde]]; the former church of St Augustine of Hippo (next to the existing church), [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]; and [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Parramatta]], which was gutted by a fire in 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puginfoundation.org/buildings|title=puginfoundation.org|website=Go Daddy|accessdate=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070624/http://www.puginfoundation.org/buildings|archive-date=24 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nPugin's legacy in Australia is particularly of the idea of what a church should look like:<blockquote>Pugin's notion was that Gothic was Christian and Christian was Gothic ... It became the way people built churches and perceived churches should be. Even today if you ask someone what a church should look like, they'll describe a Gothic building with pointed windows and arches. Right across Australia, from outback towns with tiny churches made out of corrugated iron with a little pointed door and pointed windows, to our very greatest cathedrals, you have buildings which are directly related to Pugin's ideas.<ref>{{cite news|last=Meacham|first=Steve|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/03/1044122320848.html|title=A genius in his Gothic splendour|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=30 January 2006|date=4 February 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222231140/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/03/1044122320848.html|archivedate=22 December 2005|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death Pugin's two sons, [[E.

This work includes most of the \"Pugin\" buildings in Australia and [[New Zealand]].\n\n==Reputation and influence==\nEastlake, writing in 1872, noted that the quality of construction in Pugin's buildings was often poor, and believed he was lacking in technical knowledge, his strength lying more in his facility as a designer of architectural detail.<ref>Eastlake, 1872, pp152</ref>\n\nPugin's legacy began to fade immediately after his death.<ref name=\"Hill492\"/> This was partly due to the hostility of [[John Ruskin]]. In his appendix to ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1851), Ruskin wrote of Pugin, \"he is not a great architect but one of the smallest possible or conceivable architects\".<ref name=\"Hill458\">Hill, 2007, pp. 458\u2013459</ref> Contemporaries and admirers of Pugin, including [[Sir Henry Cole]], protested at the viciousness of the attack and pointed out that Ruskin's idea on style had much in common with Pugin's.<ref name=\"Hill458\"/> After Pugin's death, Ruskin \"outlived and out-talked him by half a century\".<ref name=\"Hill492\"/> [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] wrote, \"If Ruskin had never lived, Pugin would never have been forgotten.\"<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, 1962, p. 144</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Pugin's architectural ideas were carried forward by two young architects who admired him and had attended his funeral, [[W. E. Nesfield]] and [[Norman Shaw]]. [[George Gilbert Scott]], [[William Butterfield]] and [[George Edmund Street]] were influenced by Pugin's designs, and continued to work out the implication of ideas he had sketched in his writings.<ref name=\"Hill492\"/> In Street's office, [[Philip Webb]] met [[William Morris]] and they went on to become leading members of the English [[Arts and Crafts Movement]].<ref name=\"Hill492\"/> When the German critic [[Hermann Muthesius]] published his admiring and influential study of English domestic architecture, ''Das Englische Haus'' (1904), Pugin was all but invisible, yet \"it was he ... who invented the English House that Muthesius so admired\".<ref name=\"Hill492\"/>\n\nAn [[Armoire (Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin)|armoire]] that he designed (crafted by frequent collaborator [[John Gregory Crace (designer)|John Gregory Crace]]) is held at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O8162/armoire-a-w-pugin/|title=Armoire {{!}} A.

Between 1821 and 1838, Pugin's father published a series of volumes of [[architectural drawing]]s, the first two entitled ''Specimens of Gothic Architecture'' and the following three ''Examples of Gothic Architecture'', that not only remained in print but were the standard references for Gothic architecture for at least the next century.\n\n===Religion===\nAs a child, his mother took Pugin each Sunday to the services of the fashionable Scottish Presbyterian preacher [[Edward Irving]] (later the founder of the Holy [[Catholic Apostolic Church]]), at his chapel in Cross Street, [[Hatton Garden]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], London.<ref>Ferrey, 1861, pp. 43\u20134.</ref> Pugin quickly rebelled against this version of Christianity: according to [[Benjamin Ferrey]], Pugin \"always expressed unmitigated disgust at the cold and sterile forms of the Scottish church; and the moment he broke free from the trammels imposed on him by his mother, he rushed into the arms of a church which, pompous by its ceremonies, was attractive to his imaginative mind\".<ref>Ferrey, 1861, p. 45.</ref>\n\n===Education and early ventures===\nPugin learned drawing from his father, and for a while attended [[Christ's Hospital]].

He had a further six children, including the architect [[Edward Welby Pugin]], with his second wife, Louisa Burton, who died in 1844.

For example, dissenters could not take degrees at the established universities of Oxford and Cambridge until 1871, but the University of London (later renamed University College London) was founded near Pugin's birthplace in 1826 with the express purpose of educating dissenters to degree standard (although it would not be able to confer degrees until 1836). Dissenters were also unable to serve on parish or city councils, be a member of Parliament, serve in the armed forces or on a jury. A number of reforms across the 19th century relieved these restrictions, one of which was the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act]] of 1829, which allowed Roman Catholics to become MPs.\n\nPugin's conversion acquainted him with new patrons and employers. In 1832 he made the acquaintance of John Talbot, [[Earl of Shrewsbury|16th Earl of Shrewsbury]], a Catholic sympathetic to his aesthetic theory and who employed him in alterations and additions to his residence of [[History of Alton Towers|Alton Towers]], which subsequently led to many more commissions.<ref name=\"auto\">Eastlake, 1872, p. 150.</ref> Shrewsbury commissioned him to build [[St. Giles' Catholic Church, Cheadle|St. Giles Roman Catholic Church]], [[Cheadle, Staffordshire|Cheadle]], [[Staffordshire]], which was completed in 1846, and Pugin was also responsible for designing the oldest Catholic Church in [[Shropshire]], [[St Peter and Paul Church, Newport]].\n\n===''Contrasts''===\n[[File:Contrasted Residences for the Poor.jpg|thumb|\"Contrasted Residences for the Poor\" from Pugin's ''Contrasts]]\nIn 1836, Pugin published ''Contrasts'', a polemical book which argued for the [[Gothic Revival|revival of the medieval Gothic style]], and also \"a return to the faith and the social structures of the Middle Ages\".<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/24/pugin-gothic-architect |title=Pugin, God's architect |last=Hill |first=Rosemary |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> The book was prompted by the passage of the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824, the former of which is often called the '''Million Pound Act''' due to the appropriation amount by Parliament for the construction of new Anglican churches in Britain. The new churches constructed from these funds, many of them in a Gothic-Revival style due to the assertion that it was the \"cheapest\" style to use, were often criticised by Pugin and many others for their shoddy design and workmanship and poor liturgical standards relative to an authentic Gothic structure.<ref>Mary Mulvey-Roberts, ed., ''The Handbook to Gothic Literature'' (Houndsmills and London: Macmillan, 1998), 94.</ref>\n\nEach plate in ''Contrasts'' selected a type of urban building and contrasted the 1830 example with its 15th-century equivalent. In one example, Pugin contrasted a medieval monastic foundation, where monks fed and clothed the needy, grew food in the gardens&nbsp;\u2013 and gave the dead a decent burial&nbsp;\u2013 with \"a [[panopticon]] [[Workhouse#Early Victorian workhouses|workhouse]] where the poor were beaten, half-starved and sent off after death for dissection. Each structure was the built expression of a particular view of humanity: Christianity versus [[Utilitarianism]].\"<ref name = \"Guardian\"/> Pugin's biographer, Rosemary Hill, wrote: \"The drawings were all calculatedly unfair. [[King's College London]] was shown from an unflatteringly skewed angle, while [[Christ Church, Oxford]], was edited to avoid showing its famous [[Tom Tower]] because that was by [[Christopher Wren]] and so not medieval. But the cumulative rhetorical force was tremendous.\"<ref name = \"Guardian\"/>\n\nIn 1841 he published his illustrated ''The True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture'', which was premised on his two fundamental principles of Christian architecture. He conceived of \"Christian architecture\" as synonymous with medieval, \"Gothic\", or \"pointed\", architecture. In the work, he also wrote that contemporary craftsmen seeking to emulate the style of medieval workmanship should reproduce its methods.\n\n===Ramsgate===\nIn 1841 he left [[Salisbury]],<ref name=\"auto1\">Eastlake, 1872, pp. 150\u20131.</ref> having found it an inconvenient base for his growing architectural practice.<ref>Ferrey, 1861, p. 94.</ref> He sold St. Marie's Grange at a considerable financial loss,<ref>Eastlake, 1872, p. 96.</ref> and moved temporarily to [[Cheyne Walk]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London. He had, however, already purchased a parcel of land at West Cliff, [[Ramsgate]], [[Thanet District|Thanet]] in Kent, where he proceeded to build for himself a large house and, at his own expense, a [[Pugin's Church and Shrine of St Augustine|church dedicated to St. Augustine]], after whom he thought himself named. He worked on this church whenever funds permitted it. His second wife died in 1844 and was buried at [[St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham]], which he had designed.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Architectural commissions===\nFollowing the destruction by fire of the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[Westminster]], [[London]] in 1834, Pugin was employed by [[Charles Barry|Sir Charles Barry]] to supply interior designs for his entry to the architectural competition which would determine who would build the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. Pugin also supplied drawings for the entry of James Gillespie Graham. This followed a period of employment when Pugin had worked with Barry on the interior design of [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]. Despite his conversion to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1834, Pugin designed and refurbished both [[Anglican]] and [[Catholic]] churches throughout [[England]].\n\nOther works include [[St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham|St. Chad's Cathedral]], [[Erdington Abbey]], and [[Oscott College]], all in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. He also designed the collegiate buildings of St. Patrick and St. Mary in [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]], [[Ireland]]; though not the collegiate chapel. His original plans included both a chapel and an ''aula maxima'' (great hall), neither of which were built because of financial constraints. The college chapel was designed by a follower of Pugin, the Irish architect J. J. McCarthy. Also in [[Ireland]], Pugin designed St. Mary's Cathedral in [[Killarney]], [[St. Aidan's Cathedral]] in [[Enniscorthy]] (renovated in 1996), and the Dominican Church of the Holy Cross in [[Tralee]]. He revised the plans for [[St Michael's Church, Ballinasloe|St. Michael Church]] in [[Ballinasloe]], [[Galway]], [[Ireland]]. [[Bishop Wareing]] also invited Pugin to design what eventually became [[Northampton Cathedral]], a project that was completed in 1864 by Pugin's son [[Edward Welby Pugin]].\n\nPugin visited [[Italy]] in 1847; his experience there confirmed his dislike of [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] architecture, but he found much to admire in the medieval art of northern [[Italy]].\n\n===Illness and death===\n[[File:Pugintile.jpg|thumb|Tiles designed by Pugin (c.1845\u201351)]]\nIn February 1852, while travelling with his son Edward by train, Pugin suffered a total breakdown and arrived in London unable to recognise anyone or speak coherently. For four months he was confined to a private asylum, [[Kensington House (academy)|Kensington House]]. In June, he was transferred to the [[Royal Bethlem Hospital]], popularly known as Bedlam.<ref name=\"Hill484\">Hill, 2007, pp. 484\u2013490</ref> At that time, Bethlem Hospital was opposite [[St George's Cathedral, Southwark]], one of Pugin's major buildings, where he had married his third wife, Jane, in 1848. Jane and a doctor removed Pugin from Bedlam and took him to a private house in Hammersmith where they attempted therapy, and he recovered sufficiently to recognise his wife.<ref name=\"Hill484\"/> In September, Jane took her husband back to [[The Grange, Ramsgate|The Grange in Ramsgate]], where he died on 14 September 1852.<ref name=\"Hill484\"/> He is buried in his church next to The Grange, [[Pugin's Church and Shrine of St Augustine|St Augustine's, Ramsgate]].\n[[File:The tomb of Augustus Pugin in St Augustine's Church, Ramsgate.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Augustus Pugin in St Augustine's Church, Ramsgate]]\n\nOn Pugin's death certificate, the cause listed was \"convulsions followed by coma\". Pugin's biographer, Rosemary Hill, suggests that, in the last year of his life, he was suffering from [[hyperthyroidism]] which would account for his symptoms of exaggerated appetite, perspiration, and restlessness. Hill writes that Pugin's medical history, including eye problems and recurrent illness from his early twenties, suggests that he contracted [[syphilis]] in his late teens, and this may have been the cause of his death at the age of 40.<ref name=\"Hill492\">Hill, 2007, pp. 492\u2013494</ref>\n\n==Palace of Westminster==\n[[File:Palace of Westminster Westminster Hall south.jpg|thumb|[[Palace of Westminster]]]]\nIn October 1834, the [[Palace of Westminster]] [[Burning of Parliament|burned down]]. Subsequently, the Prime Minister, [[Sir Robert Peel]], wanted, now that he was premier, to disassociate himself from the controversial [[John Wilson Croker]], who was a founding member of the Athenaeum Club; a close associate of the pre-eminent neoclassical architects [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]] and [[Decimus Burton]]; an advocate of neoclassicism; and a repudiator of the neo-gothic style.<ref name=\"Williams pp.69-75\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Guy |title=Augustus Pugin Versus Decimus Burton: A Victorian Architectural Duel|year=1990|publisher=Cassell Publishers Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-304-31561-3|pages=69\u201375}}</ref> Consequently, Peel appointed a committee chaired by Edward Cust, a detestor of the style of John Nash and William Wilkins, which resolved that the new Houses of Parliament would have to be in either the 'gothic' or the 'Elizabethan' style.<ref name=\"Williams pp.69-75\"/> Augustus W.

The design is very close to earlier designs by Pugin, including an unbuilt scheme for [[Scarisbrick Hall]], Lancashire. The tower was Pugin's last design before descending into madness. In her biography, Hill quotes Pugin as writing of what is probably his best known building: \"I never worked so hard in my life [as] for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all the designs for finishing his bell tower & it is beautiful & I am the whole machinery of the clock.\"<ref>Hill, 2007, pp. 481\u2013483</ref> Hill writes that Barry omitted to give any credit to Pugin for his huge contribution to the design of the new [[Houses of Parliament]].<ref>Hill, 2007, p. 480</ref> In 1867, after the deaths of both Pugin and Barry, Pugin's son [[E.

He arrived in Ireland in 1838 at a time of greater religious tolerance, when Catholic churches were permitted to be built. Most of his work in Ireland consisted of religious buildings. Pugin demanded the highest quality of workmanship from his craftsmen, particularly the stonemasons. His subsequent visits to the country were brief and infrequent. He was the main architect of [[St Aidan's Cathedral|St Aidan's Roman Catholic Cathedral]] for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns|diocese of Ferns]] in [[Enniscorthy|Enniscorthy, County Wexford]]. Pugin was the architect of the [[Russell Library (St. Patrick's College)|Russell Library]] at St. Patrick's College, Maynoooth, although he did not live to see its completion. Pugin did the initial design of St. Mary's Cathedral Killarney\n\n==Pugin and Australia==\n{{one source|section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:BerrimaStFrancisXavier's.jpg|thumb|St Francis Xavier's Church, Berrima, New South Wales, designed by Augustus Pugin]]\nThe first [[Roman Catholicism in Australia|Catholic]] Bishop of [[New South Wales]], Australia, [[John Bede Polding]], met Pugin and was present when [[St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham]] and [[St Giles' Catholic Church, Cheadle]] were officially opened. Polding persuaded Pugin to design a series of churches for him. Although a number of churches do not survive, St Francis Xavier's in [[Berrima, New South Wales]], is regarded as a fine example of a Pugin church.\n\nSt Stephen's Chapel, now in the cathedral grounds in Elizabeth Street, [[Brisbane]], was built to a design of Pugin. Construction began in 1848, and the first mass in the church was celebrated on 12 May 1850. In 1859 [[James Quinn (Australian bishop)|James Quinn]] was appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane|Bishop of Brisbane]], Brisbane becoming a diocese, and Pugin's small church became a cathedral. When the new cathedral of St Stephen was opened in 1874 the small Pugin church became a school room, and later church offices and storage room. It was several times threatened with demolition before its restoration in the 1990s. In Sydney, there are several altered examples of his work, namely St Benedict's, [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]]; St Charles Borromeo, [[Ryde, New South Wales|Ryde]]; the former church of St Augustine of Hippo (next to the existing church), [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]; and [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Parramatta]], which was gutted by a fire in 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puginfoundation.org/buildings|title=puginfoundation.org|website=Go Daddy|accessdate=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070624/http://www.puginfoundation.org/buildings|archive-date=24 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nPugin's legacy in Australia is particularly of the idea of what a church should look like:<blockquote>Pugin's notion was that Gothic was Christian and Christian was Gothic ... It became the way people built churches and perceived churches should be. Even today if you ask someone what a church should look like, they'll describe a Gothic building with pointed windows and arches. Right across Australia, from outback towns with tiny churches made out of corrugated iron with a little pointed door and pointed windows, to our very greatest cathedrals, you have buildings which are directly related to Pugin's ideas.<ref>{{cite news|last=Meacham|first=Steve|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/03/1044122320848.html|title=A genius in his Gothic splendour|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=30 January 2006|date=4 February 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222231140/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/03/1044122320848.html|archivedate=22 December 2005|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death Pugin's two sons, [[E.

This work includes most of the \"Pugin\" buildings in Australia and [[New Zealand]].\n\n==Reputation and influence==\nEastlake, writing in 1872, noted that the quality of construction in Pugin's buildings was often poor, and believed he was lacking in technical knowledge, his strength lying more in his facility as a designer of architectural detail.<ref>Eastlake, 1872, pp152</ref>\n\nPugin's legacy began to fade immediately after his death.<ref name=\"Hill492\"/> This was partly due to the hostility of [[John Ruskin]].
