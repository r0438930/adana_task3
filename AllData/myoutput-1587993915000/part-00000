In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact-value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].\n\n===Factual\u2013counterfactual distinction===\n{{main|Counterfactual conditional}}\n\nFactuality\u2014what has occurred\u2014can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:\nwhat ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or \"if-then\") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, \"If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome.\" This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true\u2014for example, \"If you drink this, it will make you well.\"\n\nSuch sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.\n\n==In mathematics==\n\nIn mathematics, a ''fact'' is a statement (called a [[theorem]]} that can be proven by logical argument from certain [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s.\n\n==In science==\n{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}\n\nIn science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]]. Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]]. Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].\n\nIn the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.<ref name=\"Gower000\">{{cite book\n| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction\n| first     = Barry\n| last      = Gower\n| publisher = Routledge\n| year      = 1997\n| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1\n}}</ref>\n\nVarious [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation. Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.<ref name=\"Ravetz000\">{{cite book\n| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems\n| first     = Jerome Raymond\n| last      = Ravetz\n| publisher = Transaction Publishers\n| year      = 1996\n| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2\n}}</ref>\n\nScholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.<ref>(Gower 1996)</ref> Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:\n* the process by which \"established fact\" becomes recognized and accepted as such;<ref>(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)</ref>\n* whether and to what extent \"fact\" and \"theoretic explanation\" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;<ref>Ravetz, p. 185</ref><ref name=\"Gower, p. 138\">Gower, p. 138</ref>\n* to what extent \"facts\" are influenced by the mere act of observation;<ref name=\"Gower, p. 138\"/> and\n* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.<ref>Gower, p. 7</ref>\n\nConsistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert \"fact\" to be necessarily \"theory-laden\" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.\n\n=== The scientific method ===\nApart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.<ref>Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: \"Facts and their evolution\")</ref> Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.<ref name=\"The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine\">Cassell, Eric J.

H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, \"like fish in the Ocean,\" of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined. Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).\n\n==In law==\n{{further|Evidence (law)|Trier of fact}}\nIn most [[common law]] jurisdictions,<ref>Ed. note: this section of the article emphasizes common law jurisprudence (as primarily represented in Anglo-American\u2013based legal tradition).

For example, \"If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome.\" This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true\u2014for example, \"If you drink this, it will make you well.\"\n\nSuch sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.\n\n==In mathematics==\n\nIn mathematics, a ''fact'' is a statement (called a [[theorem]]} that can be proven by logical argument from certain [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s.\n\n==In science==\n{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}\n\nIn science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]]. Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]]. Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].\n\nIn the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.<ref name=\"Gower000\">{{cite book\n| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction\n| first     = Barry\n| last      = Gower\n| publisher = Routledge\n| year      = 1997\n| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1\n}}</ref>\n\nVarious [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation. Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.<ref name=\"Ravetz000\">{{cite book\n| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems\n| first     = Jerome Raymond\n| last      = Ravetz\n| publisher = Transaction Publishers\n| year      = 1996\n| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2\n}}</ref>\n\nScholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.<ref>(Gower 1996)</ref> Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:\n* the process by which \"established fact\" becomes recognized and accepted as such;<ref>(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)</ref>\n* whether and to what extent \"fact\" and \"theoretic explanation\" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;<ref>Ravetz, p. 185</ref><ref name=\"Gower, p. 138\">Gower, p. 138</ref>\n* to what extent \"facts\" are influenced by the mere act of observation;<ref name=\"Gower, p. 138\"/> and\n* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.<ref>Gower, p. 7</ref>\n\nConsistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert \"fact\" to be necessarily \"theory-laden\" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.\n\n=== The scientific method ===\nApart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.<ref>Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: \"Facts and their evolution\")</ref> Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.<ref name=\"The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine\">Cassell, Eric J.

H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, \"like fish in the Ocean,\" of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined. Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).\n\n==In law==\n{{further|Evidence (law)|Trier of fact}}\nIn most [[common law]] jurisdictions,<ref>Ed. note: this section of the article emphasizes common law jurisprudence (as primarily represented in Anglo-American\u2013based legal tradition).

The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.<ref>Roy W. McDonald, ''Alternative Pleading in the United States: I'' Columbia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr., 1952), pp. 443-478</ref> In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as ''[[res judicata]]'') that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts and ruling of the court.<ref>(McDonald 1952)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Brute fact]]\n* [[Consensus reality]]\n* [[Counterfactual history]]\n* [[De facto]]\n* [[Factoid]]\n* [[Lie]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiversity|Facing Facts}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{SEP|facts|Facts}}\n\n{{Philosophy of science}}\n{{Philosophical logic}}\n{{Portal bar|Science|Philosophy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Concepts in epistemology]]\n[[Category:Concepts in logic]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of science]]\n[[Category:Reality]]\n[[Category:Statements]]\n[[Category:Truth]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:b0c9:9200:7c6f:8b70:8ecb:bbf7", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact"}
