Cloth backing is used for sandpaper discs and belts, while [[mylar]] is used as backing for extremely fine grits. Fibre or [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper. The weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter. For paper backings, the weight ratings range from \"A\" to \"F\", with A designating the lightest and F the heaviest. Letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings, with the weight of the backing rated J, X, Y, T, and M, from lightest to heaviest. A flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece; relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces. Sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper, such as used in sanding belts and discs. Stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood. The harder the backing material, the faster the sanding, the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface.\n\n===Type of abrasive===\nTypes of abrasive materials include:\n* [[glass]]: no longer commonly used\n* [[flint]]: no longer commonly used\n* [[garnet]]: commonly used in [[woodworking]]\n* [[emery (mineral)|emery]]: commonly used to abrade or polish metals\n* [[aluminium oxide]]: The most common in modern use, with the widest variety of grits, lowest unit cost; can be used on metal (i.e. body shops) or wood\n* [[silicon carbide]]: available in very coarse grits all the way through to microgrits, common in wet applications\n* alumina-zirconia: (an aluminium oxide\u2013[[zirconium oxide]] alloy), used for machine grinding applications\n* [[chromium(III) oxide]]: used in extremely fine micron grit ([[micrometre]] level) papers\n* [[diamond]]: used for finishing and polishing hard metals, ceramics and glass\n* [[ceramic aluminum oxide]]: used in high pressure applications, used in both coated abrasives, as well as in bonded abrasives.\n\nSandpaper may be \"[[stearate]]d\" where a dry lubricant is loaded to the abrasive. Stearated papers are useful in sanding coats of finish and paint as the stearate \"[[soap]]\" prevents clogging and increases the useful life of the sandpaper.\n\nThe harder the grit material, the easier the sanding of surfaces like wood. The grit material for polishing granite slab must be harder than [[granite]].\n\n===Bonds===\nDifferent adhesives are used to bond the abrasive to the paper. [[Animal glue#Hide glue|Hide glue]] is still used, but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof. '''Waterproof sandpapers''' or '''wet/dry sandpapers''' use a resin bond and a waterproof backing.\n\nSandpapers can also be '''open coat''', where the particles are separated from each other and the sandpaper is more flexible. This helps prevent clogging of the sandpaper. Wet and dry sandpaper is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding surface. Arguably there are also benefits due to lubrication and cooling.\n\n===Shapes===\n\nSandpaper comes in a number of different shapes and sizes:\n\n* sheet: usually {{convert|9|by|11|in|cm}}, but other sizes may be available\n* belt: usually cloth backed, comes in different sizes to fit different [[belt sander]]s.\n* disk: made to fit different models of disc and random orbit sanders. May be perforated for some models of sanders. Attachment includes pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and \"[[Hook and loop fastener|hook-and-loop]]\" (similar to Velcro).\n* rolls: known as \"shag rolls\" by many contractors\n* sponge: for tight places\n\n==Grit sizes==\nGrit size refers to the size of the particles of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. These measurements are determined by the amount of the abrasive material that can fit through a square inch filter<ref>{{cite web |title=Sandpaper Grit |url=https://www.empireabrasives.com/blog/sandpaper-grit/ |website=Empire Abrasives |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>. Several standards have been established for grit size. These standards establish not only the average grit size, but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (Coated Abrasive Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturer's Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) \"P\" grade. The FEPA system is the same as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 6344|6344]] standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the [[Japanese Industrial Standards Committee]] (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). The \"aught\" system ({0, 00, 000, ...} aka {1/0, 2/0, 3/0, ...}) was used in the past in the US. Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as \"Coarse\", \"Medium\" and \"Fine\", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.\n\n===Grit size table===\nThe following table, compiled from the references at the bottom, compares the CAMI and \"P\" designations with the average grit size in micrometres (\u00b5m).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Grit size table\n!\n!ISO/FEPA Grit designation\n!CAMI Grit designation\n!Average particle diameter (\u00b5m)\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MACROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"9\"|Extra Coarse (Very fast removal of material, [[hardwood flooring]] initial sanding)\n|align=\"center\"|P12\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1815\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P16\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1324\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P20\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P24\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|764\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|708\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P30\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|642\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30\n|align=\"center\"|632\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|align=\"center\"|530\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P36\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|538\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"3\"|Coarse (Rapid removal of material)\n|align=\"center\"|P40\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|align=\"center\"|425\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|50\n|align=\"center\"|348\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P50\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|336\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Medium (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, for gentle removal of varnish, also used for skateboard grip tape)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|60\n|align=\"center\"|265\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P60\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|269\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P80\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|201\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|80\n|align=\"center\"|190\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Fine (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, not suitable for removing varnish or paint from wood, use for cleaning plaster and water stain from wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P100\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|162\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|align=\"center\"|140\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P120\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|125\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|120\n|align=\"center\"|115\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Very Fine (sanding of bare wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P150\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|150\n|align=\"center\"|92\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P180\n|align=\"center\"|180\n|align=\"center\"|82\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P220\n|align=\"center\"|220\n|align=\"center\"|68\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MICROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Very Fine (sanding finishes between coats)\n|align=\"center\"|P240\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|58.5\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|240\n|align=\"center\"|53.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P280\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|52.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P320\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|46.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P360\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|40.5\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Extra fine, start polishing of wood \n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|320\n|align=\"center\"|36.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P400\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|35.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30.2\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|360\n|align=\"center\"|28.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P600\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|25.8\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"6\"|Super fine (final sanding of finishes, final sanding of wood)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|400\n|align=\"center\"|23.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P800\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|21.8\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|500\n|align=\"center\"|20.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1000\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|18.3\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|600\n|align=\"center\"|16.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1200\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|15.3\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Ultra fine (final sanding and polishing of thick finishes)\n|align=\"center\"|P1500\n|align=\"center\"|800\n|align=\"center\"|12.6\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2000\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|align=\"center\"|10.3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|8.4\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n=== Similar to sandpaper ===\n* [[Emery cloth]]\n* [[Crocus cloth]]\n\n=== Tools used with sandpaper ===\n* [[Sanding block]]\n* [[Sander]]\n* [[Belt sander]]\n\n=== Related processes and tools ===\n* [[Polishing]]\n* [[Grind]]ing\n* [[Grinding machine]]\n* [[Rotary tool]]\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n* [[Sanding sealer]]\n* [[Emery (mineral)]]\n* [[Particle size (grain size)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Michael Dresdner (1992).

Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as \"Coarse\", \"Medium\" and \"Fine\", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.\n\n===Grit size table===\nThe following table, compiled from the references at the bottom, compares the CAMI and \"P\" designations with the average grit size in micrometres (\u00b5m).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Grit size table\n!\n!ISO/FEPA Grit designation\n!CAMI Grit designation\n!Average particle diameter (\u00b5m)\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MACROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"9\"|Extra Coarse (Very fast removal of material, [[hardwood flooring]] initial sanding)\n|align=\"center\"|P12\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1815\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P16\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1324\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P20\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P24\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|764\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|708\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P30\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|642\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30\n|align=\"center\"|632\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|align=\"center\"|530\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P36\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|538\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"3\"|Coarse (Rapid removal of material)\n|align=\"center\"|P40\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|align=\"center\"|425\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|50\n|align=\"center\"|348\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P50\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|336\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Medium (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, for gentle removal of varnish, also used for skateboard grip tape)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|60\n|align=\"center\"|265\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P60\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|269\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P80\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|201\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|80\n|align=\"center\"|190\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Fine (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, not suitable for removing varnish or paint from wood, use for cleaning plaster and water stain from wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P100\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|162\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|align=\"center\"|140\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P120\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|125\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|120\n|align=\"center\"|115\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Very Fine (sanding of bare wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P150\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|150\n|align=\"center\"|92\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P180\n|align=\"center\"|180\n|align=\"center\"|82\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P220\n|align=\"center\"|220\n|align=\"center\"|68\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MICROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Very Fine (sanding finishes between coats)\n|align=\"center\"|P240\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|58.5\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|240\n|align=\"center\"|53.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P280\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|52.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P320\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|46.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P360\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|40.5\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Extra fine, start polishing of wood \n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|320\n|align=\"center\"|36.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P400\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|35.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30.2\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|360\n|align=\"center\"|28.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P600\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|25.8\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"6\"|Super fine (final sanding of finishes, final sanding of wood)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|400\n|align=\"center\"|23.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P800\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|21.8\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|500\n|align=\"center\"|20.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1000\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|18.3\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|600\n|align=\"center\"|16.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1200\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|15.3\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Ultra fine (final sanding and polishing of thick finishes)\n|align=\"center\"|P1500\n|align=\"center\"|800\n|align=\"center\"|12.6\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2000\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|align=\"center\"|10.3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|8.4\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n=== Similar to sandpaper ===\n* [[Emery cloth]]\n* [[Crocus cloth]]\n\n=== Tools used with sandpaper ===\n* [[Sanding block]]\n* [[Sander]]\n* [[Belt sander]]\n\n=== Related processes and tools ===\n* [[Polishing]]\n* [[Grind]]ing\n* [[Grinding machine]]\n* [[Rotary tool]]\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n* [[Sanding sealer]]\n* [[Emery (mineral)]]\n* [[Particle size (grain size)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Michael Dresdner (1992).
