In July 2016, a second brand extension period began and two new titles were introduced: the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]]. In January 2017, these were designated as acceptable substitutes for their counterpart titles in the Grand Slam, but WWE have not yet confirmed if they are acceptable substitutes for the Triple Crown. Only four wrestlers have become a Triple Crown winner since the new titles were established, and for three of them, although they have held one of the newer titles, their Triple Crown designation is recognized by their previous titles held ([[Seth Rollins]] and [[Roman Reigns]] have each held the Universal Championship while [[Kofi Kingston]], [[The Miz]], [[Jeff Hardy]], and [[Daniel Bryan]] have each held the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, but these wrestlers had already held the required titles in those tiers). At [[WrestleMania 36]], [[Braun Strowman]] won the Universal Championship after previously holding the Intercontinental and Raw Tag Team Championships, but WWE has yet to confirm if these accolades make Strowman a Triple Crown winner.\n\nCM Punk holds the record for completing the Triple Crown in the shortest amount of time between the first and third title.

In July 2016, a second brand extension period began and two new titles were introduced: the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Championship]]. In January 2017, these were designated as acceptable substitutes for their counterpart titles in the Grand Slam, but WWE have not yet confirmed if they are acceptable substitutes for the Triple Crown. Only four wrestlers have become a Triple Crown winner since the new titles were established, and for three of them, although they have held one of the newer titles, their Triple Crown designation is recognized by their previous titles held ([[Seth Rollins]] and [[Roman Reigns]] have each held the Universal Championship while [[Kofi Kingston]], [[The Miz]], [[Jeff Hardy]], and [[Daniel Bryan]] have each held the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, but these wrestlers had already held the required titles in those tiers). At [[Wrestlemania 36]], [[Braun Strowman]] won the Universal Championship after previously holding the Intercontinental and Raw Tag Team Championships, but WWE has yet to confirm if these accolades make Strowman a Triple Crown winner.\n\nCM Punk holds the record for completing the Triple Crown in the shortest amount of time between the first and third title. It took him 203 days between June 2008 and January 2009.
