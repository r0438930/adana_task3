NFS is always fatal, most foals die within weeks of birth, although some horses have survived up to the age of two years. Early demise is usually caused by digestive problems, whereas older horses need to be humanely [[animal euthanasia|euthanized]] because of severe laminitis-induced pain. Some carriers have been identified, including 943 Arslan, 736 Keymir, 2001 Mariula, or 1054 Gilkuyruk, but the estimated number of unknown cases is likely higher, as several Russian and Turkmenian breeders have acknowledged that NFS foals are often just reported as stillborn or aborted.<ref>\"The Stavropol Sphinx\", Akhal Teke Inform 2006</ref><ref>e.g. \"10th Studbook, tome II, page 160\": 2860 Mriya, naked foal (dead) b.2000, by 1201 Kavkas, published in 2005 by VNIIK, Ryasan</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hairless Foal Photos|accessdate=May 8, 2010|url= http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/hairless/hairlesshorsephotos.html|publisher=Ultimatehorsesite.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082839/http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/hairless/hairlesshorsephotos.html|archivedate=June 10, 2011}}</ref>\n* ''Hereditary [[cryptorchidism]]'' exists within the Akhal-Teke breed and affected stallions can be traced through multiple generations.

Breeders balance the risk of cryptorchidism against propagating other desirable qualities. Some national Akhal Teke associations, however, ban Cryptorchidism from breeding.\n* The Akhal-Teke is one of many light riding horse breeds that may be prone to cervical vertebral malformation (CVM), commonly called ''[[Wobbler syndrome]]'',<ref name=Wobbler/> and to [[Degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis]] (DSLD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akhalteke.info/dsld-1-69-en.html |title=Akhalteke.info |publisher=Akhalteke.info |date= |accessdate=November 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302032005/http://www.akhalteke.info/dsld-1-69-en.html|archivedate=March 2, 2012}}</ref> These conditions are seen in a number of other breeds, including the [[Thoroughbred]].
