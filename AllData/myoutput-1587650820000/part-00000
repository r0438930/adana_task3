His first documented mention was on 21 October 1258, when he appears together with his father and two younger brothers in the consent of the foundation of a [[Cistercian]] abbey in [[Rudy, Silesian Voivodeship|Rudy]].\n\n===Duke of Racib\u00f3rz===\nAfter his father's death in 1282, and according to the custom during the [[History of Poland (966\u20131385)#Fragmentation and Invasion.2C .281138-1295.29|fragmentation of Poland]], Mieszko and his brothers divided the Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz between them: Mieszko and his youngest brother [[Przemys\u0142aw of Racib\u00f3rz|Przemys\u0142aw]] received together the district of [[Racib\u00f3rz]] as co-rulers. The other two brothers, [[Casimir of Bytom|Casimir]] and [[Bolko I of Opole|Bolko I]], received [[Opole]]. Because Przemys\u0142aw was still a minor at that time, Mieszko ruled alone until he attained his majority, in 1284.\n\nIn 1285 Mieszko politically supported the [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Thomas II Zaremba]] against [[Henry IV Probus]], providing shelter to the Bishop in Raciborz. His politics against Henry IV were reinforced when the Duke of Wroc\u0142aw repudiated his wife Constance \u2014sister of Mieszko\u2014 and sent her back to her homeland. Another consequence of Mieszko's politics was an armed expedition of Henry IV in 1287 against Racib\u00f3rz, who was sieged. Then Mieszko was forced to refuse his help to the Bishop.\n\n===Duke of Cieszyn===\nIn 1290 the division was made of the Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz: Przemys\u0142aw retained [[Racib\u00f3rz]] and Mieszko obtained the rule over the districts of [[Cieszyn]], [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] and [[Zator]]. The first time that he signed himself as Duke of Cieszyn was on 1 January 1290.\n\nIn internal politics he pursued vigorous policies. Mieszko carried out intensive colonizing policies and founded many settlements. He also gave city rights to several towns: Cieszyn, O\u015bwi\u0119cim  (in 1291), [[Bielsko]], [[Skocz\u00f3w]] and [[Fry\u0161t\u00e1t]]. On 10 November 1292 he granted the city rights to [[Zator]].\n\n===Struggles for the Throne of Krak\u00f3w===\n[[File:Cieszyn 7245.jpg|thumb|190px|Mieszko I monument in Cieszyn. Sculpted by Jan Raszka.]]\n\nMieszko refused to support any of the Piast pretenders to the [[Poland|Polish]] throne (Henry IV Probus, [[Przemys\u0142 II]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]). Instead he stood alongside King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]. On 17 January 1291 the formal agreement was signed in [[Olomouc]] which formed the alliance between the Bohemian Kingdom, Mieszko and his two brothers Casimir and Przemys\u0142aw. Mieszko eventually swore [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] to King Wenceslaus II, although the exact date was still debatable; the most accepted date by historians was 11 August 1292.\n\nDespite his alliance, Mieszko didn't take an active part in Wenceslaus II's campaign against W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high in 1292; however, he put his army at the King's disposal and later took part in the Battle of [[Siewierz]]. Mieszko was present at the coronation of Wenceslaus II as King of Poland in [[Gniezno]] in 1300. After the death of Wenceslaus II in 1305, Mieszko continued to support the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]] in the person of [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]], son and successor of Wenceslaus II.\n\nOn 5 October 1305, Mieszko obtained his major victory when his daughter Viola Elisabeth married King Wenceslaus III. This union was a chance for Mieszko to make himself one of the most powerful figures in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and he even began some attempts to obtain the Polish crown.\n\nHowever, Mieszko's promising career ended suddenly with the murder of Wenceslaus III (Olomouc, 4 August 1306). Viola Elisabeth never bore Wenceslaus III any children and the P\u0159emyslid dynasty became extinct.\n\nAfter 1306 the political activity of Mieszko almost disappeared. Is unknown why this happened, because at that time he was only around fifty-years-old and was still considered young enough. The government of the Duchy was increasingly absorbed by his sons Wladyslaw and Kazimierz. The only sign of his political activities during this time was the lease of the Czech city of [[K\u0119ty]] to the Bishop of Krak\u00f3w, [[Jan Muskata]], a strong opposer to the rule of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high in [[Greater Poland]]. However, in contrast to his brother Bolko I, Mieszko didn't support the [[Rebellion of w\u00f3jt Albert]] in 1311.\n\n===Donations to the Church===\nMieszko was known for his generosity to the church. Thanks to him, the construction was completed of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] convent at O\u015bwi\u0119cim (shortly after 1283). Also, he financially assisted the monastery of [[Czarnow\u0105sy]] near Opole and in the Dominican of Cieszyn.\n\n===Death===\nMieszko's exact date of death is unknown. Diplomatic sources suggest that he died in 1314 or in the first half of 1315, before 27 June. He was probably buried in the Dominican church in Cieszyn. In 1931 the Polish painter and sculptor [[Jan Raszka]] made a sculpture of Mieszko I in Cieszyn.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nAccording to some sources,<ref>{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast8.html |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}</ref> Mieszko's wife died around 1303, but her name is unknown.
