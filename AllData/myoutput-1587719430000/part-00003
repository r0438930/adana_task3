It is known in the United Kingdom by its original title or in translation as '''''Lunch on the Grass'''''. A satire on contemporary science and politics, it revolves around a prominent biologist and politician who wants to replace sex with [[artificial insemination]], but begins to reconsider when a picnic he organizes is interrupted by the forces of nature. The film brings up issues of [[modernity]], [[human reproduction]], youth and [[European integration]]. It ridicules [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] and celebrates a type of [[materialism]] it associates with [[classical mythology]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]].\n\nThe title is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. The female lead in ''Picnic on the Grass'' was the first major role for Rouvel, who due to an unusual contract would not appear in another film until 1963. Filming took place around Renoir's childhood home in [[Provence]], and inspiration came from the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] paintings of his father, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The filming technique was influenced by [[live television]] and involved [[Multiple-camera setup|multiple cameras]] and direct audio recording.\n\nThe press reviews were generally positive and described the film as charming and beautiful. Negative response came from the political left, where critics disapproved of the film's treatment of [[progress]] and depiction of a European [[superstate]]. The subject of European unification was topical and sensitive due to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. The film was a commercial failure and has attracted little attention from general audiences over the years.\n\n==Plot==\nThe famous biologist \u00c9tienne Alexis is the frontrunner in the upcoming election of the first President of [[United States of Europe|Europe]]. He advocates mandatory [[artificial insemination]] in order to [[Eugenics|improve humanity]] and make it worthy of modern science. He is newly engaged to his German cousin Marie-Charlotte and has invited her to a picnic near his mansion in [[Provence]].\n\nN\u00e9nette, a farmer's daughter, is disappointed with men after a failed relationship. She still wants children and applies to be a test subject for \u00c9tienne's insemination project. She ends up hired as his chambermaid and accompanies the picnic with the other servants. Present at the picnic are several cousins from both France and Germany. They are all stiff, rationally minded and profess belief in scientific [[progress]]. They have invited journalists to document the event as a symbol for the new unified Europe. The picnic takes place next to the ruins of a temple of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the goddess who the ancient Romans believed presided over childbirth. Nearby is also a group of young campers. N\u00e9nette is worried when she spots the goatherd Gaspard. She knows that when Gaspard plays his flute, strange things tend to happen. Gaspard plays and suddenly a strong wind blows away the picnic chairs and tables. As everybody takes cover, \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette are separated from the rest.\n\nWhen the wind subsides, they are invited to sit down with the campers. \u00c9tienne explains to the youth how he hopes to eliminate passion. Meanwhile, a [[Bacchanalia]] breaks out among the picnic guests not far away. Leaving the campers to look for Marie-Charlotte, \u00c9tienne ends up seeing N\u00e9nette [[Nude swimming|swimming nude]]. Shortly thereafter, Gaspard plays his flute again, and \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette run off into the high reeds. After returning, the two see the cousins and servants leaving in cars. They choose to not approach them and instead rejoin the campers, who offer them to stay the night in their camp. The next morning, \u00c9tienne says he wants to escape from the world for a while, so he and N\u00e9nette go to stay at N\u00e9nette's father Nino's house. \u00c9tienne begins to reconsider the relationship between humans and the natural world. The cousins eventually locate him and come to Nino's house. They convince N\u00e9nette to leave. Realizing she is gone, \u00c9tienne becomes agitated and goes to look for her. Gaspard, the goatherd, recommends him to kneel before his goat and ask for help. After doing so, \u00c9tienne turns ecstatic and shouts \"Down with science!\" before his cousins capture him.\n\n\u00c9tienne goes back to his old life, but on the day of his wedding he discovers N\u00e9nette working in a hotel kitchen. She is happily pregnant with his child. He abruptly brings her, not Marie-Charlotte, to the waiting crowd. He will launch his presidential campaign with a speech about science and nature, and he intends to marry N\u00e9nette.\n\n==Cast==\nCast adapted from ''A Companion to Jean Renoir'' and the [[British Film Institute]].{{sfnm|1a1=Phillips|1a2=Vincendeau|1y=2013|1p=583|2a1=British Film Institute}}\n* [[Paul Meurisse]] as Professor \u00c9tienne Alexis\n* [[Catherine Rouvel]] as N\u00e9nette\n* [[Fernand Sardou]] as Nino, N\u00e9nette's father\n* Jacqueline Morane as Titine, N\u00e9nette's elder sister\n* [[Jean-Pierre Granval]] as Ritou, Titine's husband\n* Ingrid Nordine as Marie-Charlotte\n* [[Charles Blavette]] as Gaspard, the old goatherd\n* [[Paulette Dubost]] as Mlle Forestier, the telephonist\n\n==Themes==\n===Modernity and nature===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 020.jpg|thumb|alt=Oil painting of a nude woman who sits on a rock and leans on a bow. At her feet is a dead deer with its neck pierced by an arrow.|''[[Diana (Renoir painting)|Diana]]'' by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1867]]\nThe themes of ''Picnic on the Grass'' revolve around modern issues such as artificial insemination, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the [[mass media]]. [[Jean Renoir]]'s biographer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]] writes that the film \"deals with disturbingly serious subjects using a farcical tone\".{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The film historian [[Jean Douchet]] writes that the film should be taken seriously, but describes its story as an invitation to not do so.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=295}} Renoir satirizes a [[modernity]] he does not think highly of, and uses story and tone to tell the viewer that it is not very important.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\nThe central conflict is built on several [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]: between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]], the [[Technocracy|technocratic]] [[Northern Europe]] and underdeveloped [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]], and the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] of [[Postchristianity]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy of ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=298\u2013299}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' ridicules the idealist notion of progress and celebrates the Dionysian world.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} The film portrays an empty spirituality produced by a bureaucratic [[utilitarianism]], and thereby seeks to justify the celebration of a material world imbued with spirit.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=349}} When \u00c9tienne converses with a Christian priest, the two are shown to have disagreements, but simultaneously understand each other well. This is because both still belong to the idealist side in the film's conflict.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} According to Douchet, the film sets up a scenario where harmonious equilibrium is achieved when science abandons idealism and submits to a materialist view of nature. This happens when \u00c9tienne marries N\u00e9nette who is pregnant with their naturally conceived child.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=299\u2013300}}\n\n\u00c9tienne is an intellectual who lives in a theoretical world. This makes him similar to the main characters in two earlier works by Renoir: the play ''Orvet'' (1955) and the television film ''[[The Doctor's Horrible Experiment]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=314}} \u00c9tienne's eugenic ideology combines rationalism and [[moralism]] in a way that gives [[Darwinism]] an active role in concord with [[individualism]]. [[Human reproduction]] and [[Human evolution|evolution]] become tied to \u00c9tienne's own [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficiency]] and to ideas about social responsibility.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=349\u2013350}} N\u00e9nette is comfortable with her human physicality, but is also driven by self-sufficiency in her wish to have her own child through artificial insemination. She is [[Emancipation|emancipated]] and mobile, and it is her actions that twice bring her to \u00c9tienne. Another\u2014militaristic\u2014type of women's emancipation is represented by Marie-Charlotte.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}} Allied against Western rationalism are the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Diana. Pan is evoked through the flute-playing goatherd, and Diana presides over [[chastity]] and childbirth, which in this [[Classical mythology|classical mythological]] context are aspects of female independence.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}}\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Renoir - PORTRAIT DE JEAN RENOIR, 1910.jpg|thumb|alt=Painted bust portrait of Jean Renoir as a young boy|Portrait of Jean Renoir by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1910]]\nRenoir had spent years of his childhood and adolescence in the area where ''Picnic on the Grass'' was filmed.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} He had recently begun to write a book about his father, the painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which made him reminisce about his early life.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Accordng to M\u00e9rigeau, the film was a way for Renoir to confront the boy he once was with the troubling questions of the contemporary world. Renoir's reconnection to his young self is paralleled in the mode of storytelling which is reminiscent of [[Silent film|silent cinema]]. Another parallel is with Renoir's film ''[[Partie de campagne]]'', filmed in 1936, and the similarities in its portrayal of eroticism.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The filmmaker [[Shirley Clarke]] said that ''Picnic on the Grass'' \"could only have been made by someone of 6 or 60\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=354}}\n\n===European integration===\nThe historian Hugo Frey groups ''Picnic on the Grass'' with a number of French comedies that deal with a \"modernist invasion\".{{sfn|Frey|2014|p=119}} These include the films of [[Jacques Tati]], ''[[Mr. Freedom]]'' (1968) by [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] and ''[[The Holes]]'' (1974) by [[Pierre Tchernia]]. Renoir's film stands out in the group because it targets the nascent [[European Union]] rather than the United States.{{sfn|Frey|2014|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nThe vision of a European [[superstate]] was conceived as the logical continuation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), created in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]]. The film's depiction of a French and German elite couple follows a convention where [[European integration]] is understood as something that particularly concerns France and Germany, or France and [[Germanic-speaking Europe]] overall. The way \u00c9tienne speaks to journalists, with technical and obscure terminology, envisions a future political elite as the only people who will comprehend the European project.{{sfn|Rivi\u00e8re|2018|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter working in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] in the 1940s, Renoir had re-established himself in European cinema following the international success of ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951). During the 1950s, he developed a more detached and depoliticized approach to filmmaking than before. Simultaneously, he became a more prominent celebrity in France due to television appearances and an increased appreciation for his films from the 1930s. His work became more oriented toward personal subjects.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=328\u2013329}}\n\nThe title of ''Picnic on the Grass'' is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Renoir wrote seven versions of the screenplay.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} He made the film through his own production company, Compagnie Jean Renoir. It was the last time he did that; annoyances about logistics during the production made him decide to never produce his own films again. In addition to financial backing from [[Path\u00e9]] and the UCIF, Renoir offered 50% of his earnings from ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (1937) as a [[reimbursement]] guarantee, to a limit of 10 million [[French franc|francs]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Catherine Rouvel]]\u2014whose real last name was Rouveyre\u2014did her first major role in ''Picnic on the Grass''. Renoir had met her in 1958, shortly after her 19th birthday, during a tribute to [[Robert J. Flaherty]] at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]. She accompanied her husband Georges Rouveyre whose friend Claude Beylie, who was a film critic, introduced her to Renoir. She had enrolled at the drama school Centre d'art dramatique de la rue Blanche a few weeks earlier. The same winter, Renoir contacted her for a reading and a screen test.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=697}} Before she won the role of N\u00e9nette, Renoir considered giving it to the dancer [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], whom he had directed in a ballet. He also auditioned [[Mich\u00e8le Mercier]] the same day as Rouveyre. Renoir told Rouveyre in April 1959 that the role was hers. Soon thereafter he suggested that she should change her name to Rouvel.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} For the male lead, Renoir first considered [[Pierre Blanchar]], a man in his mid 60s, before he gave the role to the 20 years younger [[Paul Meurisse]]. Renoir had previously worked with Meurisse in a production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and the two were good friends.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} In the role of the goatherd Gaspard he cast [[Charles Blavette]], who had played the title role in Renoir's film ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nRenoir rehearsed with the actors for a week before adding technicians to the rehearsals. After this, the director, designer, camera operator and assistant scouted the filming locations. The rehearsals then resumed with markers chalked on the floor corresponding to the locations' topography.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} Working with markers was something Renoir abandoned after ''Picnic on the Grass'', because he thought it was better if the actors could discover the surroundings more freely.{{sfn|Renoir|1989|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[File:Cagnes-sur-Mer- Mus\u00e9e Renoir - Ferme -1.JPG|alt=Photograph of a stone house with three floors fronted by an old olive tree|thumb|The old farmhouse at Les Collettes was a filming location. The property was acquired by the city of Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1959 and turned into the Mus\u00e9e Renoir.{{sfn|Oddos|2016}}]]\nFilming took place from 6 to 30 July 1959 at Studio Franc\u0153ur in Paris, and in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and [[La Gaude]] in [[Alpes-Maritimes]].{{sfn|Cin\u00e9-Ressources}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' borrows visual traits from French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting, and in particular that of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This is reflected in the choices of filming locations. Jean Renoir called the film \"something of a homage to the olive-trees under which my father worked so much\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}} A major location was the property Les Collettes in Cagnes-sur-Mer, which Renoir the elder had bought in 1907, and which had been the home of Jean Renoir for a part of his childhood and adolescence.{{sfnm|1a1=Durgnat|1y=1974|1p=347|2a1=M\u00e9rigeau|2y=2017|2p=700}} Renoir the elder had spent significant time in the town La Gaude where a part of the film was shot. Several of his paintings feature the nearby river Le Coup, which also appears in the film.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nAnother stylistic choice came from the director's desire to follow impulses on location and encourage improvisation. Renoir said he wanted to make a \"sort of filmed poem\" written in one sitting.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} After the rehearsals, he gave very little instruction to the actors.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} He used a rapid working method influenced by [[live television]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} Renoir had first used this technique in his recent television film ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'', which he called an \"experimental film\".{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=276}} He took advantage of the cinematographer's experience from making [[newsreel]] footage. [[Multiple-camera setup|Six cameras were placed around the scene]] to cover all useful angles and shots.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} In addition to saving time and money, the ambition was to retain the uninterrupted, intensive acting of a [[long take]] and still be able to make cuts within the scene.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|pp=276\u2013277}} The method made it possible to record most of the dialogue directly, without problems of continuity due to surrounding sounds such as those from airplanes. Up to twelve microphones were present and only around 20 phrases had to be dubbed in post-production.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}}\n\nSeveral key crew members were reused from ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment''. They included the cinematographer Georges Leclerc and the editor Ren\u00e9e Lichtig. Both would work with Renoir again on his next film, ''[[The Elusive Corporal]]'', which became his final feature film.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The working method was however not used again.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=277}} The original music was composed by [[Joseph Kosma]], who first collaborated with Renoir in 1936 and had provided music for several of his best known films.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=412}} The score for ''Picnic on the Grass'' includes a melody the goatherd plays in high pitch on his flute during the wind scene, an upbeat piece played on clarinet in jazz style, and a melody played on flute with harp [[glissando]]s during a lyrical passage.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=413}}\n\n==Release==\nPath\u00e9 released ''Picnic on the Grass'' theatrically in France on 11 November 1959.{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}} In the United Kingdom it was released by Mondial Films in April 1960 under the title ''Lunch on the Grass''.{{sfn|British Board of Film Classification}} It was released in the United States as ''Picnic on the Grass'' on 12 October 1960 by [[Kingsley-International Pictures]].{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}}\n\nFor the French home-media market, it was first released on [[VHS]] in 1990 by Fil \u00e0 film and on [[DVD]] in 2003 by [[StudioCanal|StudioCanal vid\u00e9o]]. The DVD, which was re-released in 2008, includes a 30-minute documentary directed by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Glaymann.{{sfn|BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral}} The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2007 by [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]], as part of a box set with other Renoir films. The DVD uses the original French title, ''Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur L'Herbe''.{{sfn|French|2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Contemporary critical response===\nFrench film critics generally gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a positive reception, characterized by respect for Renoir. They highlighted the film's connection to impressionism and described it as charming.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=356}} Rouvel's face was on the cover of the December 1959 issue of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', and the magazine called the film \"the most beautiful of a month rich in masterpieces\".{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959|loc=inside of the front cover}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Pour l'\u00e9quipe des \u00ab Cahiers \u00bb et le Conseil des Dix, le film de Jean Renoir est le plus beau d'un mois riche en chefs-d'\u0153uvre.}}}} The review by [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]] stressed the technical novelty of the film, released in \"the year of the '[[French New Wave|New Wave]]'\", which Renoir had influenced profoundly.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=2}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... l'ann\u00e9e de la \u00ab nouvelle vague \u00bb ...}}}} With its detached and intentionally naive style, Rohmer described it as \"avant-garde popular theater\" in the vein of ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]''.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=4}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... th\u00e9\u00e2tre populaire d'avant-garde ...}}}} For Rohmer, the satire against science should be understood through Renoir's role as an artist, not philosopher or moralist, and not as a rejection of practical science.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=6}} As for politics, he defended the artist's right to look at the problems of the world without being politically engaged.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=7}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' made 13th place on ''Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma'''s composite list of the best films of 1959.{{sfn|Hillier|1985|p=287}} [[Pierre Braunberger]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jacques Rivette]], Rohmer and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] were among the ''Cahiers'' critics who named it to year-end top ten lists.{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n[[File:Jean Renoir (1959).tif|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of Jean Renoir in his mid 60s|Jean Renoir in 1959]]\nRenoir had supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in the 1930s, but ''Picnic on the Grass'' received negative reviews from critics with [[Communism|communist]] sympathies. It was released at a time when the PCF idealized progress and its members were enthusiastic about the [[Soviet space program]].{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=328 and 340}} Samuel Lachize of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' considered the film flawed on a technical level, and criticized its lack of a clear choice between scientific progress and the rejection of it. He dismissed the philosophical content, which he took as a pseudo-[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauesque]] message about going [[back to nature]].{{sfn|Lachize|1959|p=2|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Marie|2013|pp=338\u2013339}}}} ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'' received a similar treatment from communist critics.{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=339\u2013340}} Left-wing critics also criticized ''Picnic on the Grass'' for its eventual acceptance of a European superstate, which was taken as an approval of the EEC, opposed by the left at the time. Furthermore upsetting for the left, the reservations \u00c9tienne develops were interpreted as support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s {{lang|fr|Europe des patries}} (\"Europe of fatherlands\").{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=350\u2013352}} In the 1970s, the film critic [[Raymond Durgnat]] related the response to the left's own struggle to oppose the EEC without turning to patriotism. Durgnat wrote that it was \"perhaps not too unkind to suggest that my left-wing colleagues were making their 'lost leader' a scapegoat for the very real difficulties of the left itself\u2014or should one say the lefts themselves?\"{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=352}}\n\nGideon Bachmann wrote in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' that many American critics gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a \"silly treatment\", because they did not understand it through its director as a person. He used [[Hollis Alpert]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' as a positive counterexample.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} Alpert called it \"a nonsensically unconventional movie\" where viewers \"would be better off not trying to make sense or logic out of it, but simply allowing M. Renoir to have his day in the fields\".{{sfn|Alpert|1960|p=34}} Bachmann wrote that the film is reminiscent of Tati's films, both in message and how the message is conveyed through colors.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} He contrasted the seeming simplicity with the serious content, and the impressionism with the surreal elements. He called it \"almost facile in impact but lasting in the perturbations it causes\".{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=41}}\n\n===Retrospective critical response===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' has received little attention from general audiences over time, but it has been embraced by individual critics.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} In 2006, Luc Arbona of ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' called it an \"extraordinary pamphlet\" portraying \"the peddlers of progress\" who \"only care about security, asepticity and uniformity\".{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Renoir r\u00e9alise ici un extraordinaire pamphlet o\u00f9 il met en sc\u00e8ne les camelots du progr\u00e8s qui se contrefoutent du monde, de la nature et ne se soucient que de s\u00e9curisation, d'aseptisation et d'uniformisation.}}}} Arbona called the satire \"abuntant and exhilirating\" and the film \"brilliantly prophetic\", because by the time of his writing, Arbona wrote, \"these progress-obsessed, these ad-agency apostles who have nothing but the politically correct to say, have seized power and are leading the dance.\"{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Satire foisonnante et jubilatoire, Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe est g\u00e9nialement proph\u00e9tique.

Taking its message as a rejection of modern technology, he still compared it favorably to [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]'', which shows science and the government triumphant in a crisis of natural origin. Brody made a point of separating art and politics: \"Looking to filmmakers for practical advice in the teeth of trouble is usually as pointless as turning to politicians for visions of beauty.\"{{sfn|Brody|2012}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called it \"one of Renoir's most ravishing, and simultaneously most irritating films\", because the \"sumptuous photography\" repeatedly \"collapses into cold argument\".{{sfn|Time Out}}\n\n===Box office===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' had 757,024 admissions in France.{{sfn|AlloCin\u00e9}} It was a commercial failure. Renoir addressed this in a letter to the producer Ginette Doynel a few weeks after the Paris premiere. He wrote that the failure had given him a distaste for film and television work in general. He would instead focus on his teaching position at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], his plays, and his book about his father.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' later had a significant theatrical run in the United States, which delighted Renoir.{{sfn|Silke|2005|p=134}}\n\n==Legacy==\nRouvel signed an unusual contract which had the practical effect that Renoir had to approve all her engagements for the next three years. Renoir decided to keep her away from the film industry and only accepted offers of theater roles. He rejected roles in ''[[The Green Mare (film)|The Green Mare]]'' and a film by [[G\u00e9rard Oury]]. Rouvel returned to film acting in [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Landru (film)|Bluebeard]]'', released in January 1963.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=699\u2013700}}\n\nThe film ''[[Le Bonheur (1965 film)|Le Bonheur]]'' (1965) directed by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] pays tribute to ''Picnic on the Grass'' by including a passage which plays on a television screen.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=734}} The film scholar Nancy Pogel argues in her book on [[Woody Allen]] that Allen's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) is indebted to ''Picnic on the Grass''.{{sfn|Nichols|2000|p=95}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Farm at Les Collettes, Cagnes]]''\n* [[France\u2013Germany relations]]\n* [[Pan in popular culture]]\n* [[Physis]] and [[techne]]\n* [[Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]]\n\n==References==\n===Original quotations===\n{{notelist}}\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite web |author=[[AlloCin\u00e9]] |url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208035056/http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |publisher=Tiger Global |archive-date=8 December 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=CITEREFAlloCin\u00e9 }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Alpert |first=Hollis |authorlink=Hollis Alpert |date=15 October 1960 |url=https://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1960oct15-00034/ |title=Panic on the Grass |work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Arbona |first=Luc |date=17 August 2006 |url=https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe/ |title=le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]] |language=French |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |last=Bachmann |first=Gideon |year=1960 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pp=40\u201341 |doi=10.2307/1210350 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral |url=https://data.bnf.fr/en/16179534/le_dejeuner_sur_l_herbe___film/ |title=Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe : film |publisher=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/lunch-grass-1959 |title=Lunch on the Grass |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Film Institute]] |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a8a022a |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |accessdate=18 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=29 October 2012 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/watching-sandy-with-jean-renoir |title=Watching Sandy with Jean Renoir |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=December 1959 |title=Notre couverture |trans-title=Our cover |journal=[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]] |language=French |issue=102 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959 }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=February 1960 |title=Les dix meilleurs films de l'ann\u00e9e |trans-title=The ten best films of the year |journal=Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma |language=French |issue=104 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960 }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[Cin\u00e9-Ressources]] |url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=50831 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |publisher=[[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] |accessdate=26 February 2020 |ref=CITEREFCin\u00e9-Ressources }}\n\n: {{cite book |last=Douchet |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Douchet |year=1974 |chapter=Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe (1959) (Picnic on the Grass, 1960) |editor-last=Truffaut |editor-first=Fran\u00e7ois |editorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |translator1-last=Halsey II |translator1-first=W.

It is known in the United Kingdom by its original title or in translation as '''''Lunch on the Grass'''''. A satire on contemporary science and politics, it revolves around a prominent biologist and politician who wants to replace sex with [[artificial insemination]], but begins to reconsider when a picnic he organizes is interrupted by the forces of nature. The film brings up issues of [[modernity]], [[human reproduction]], youth and [[European integration]]. It ridicules [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] and celebrates a type of [[materialism]] it associates with [[classical mythology]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]].\n\nThe title is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. The female lead in ''Picnic on the Grass'' was the first major role for Rouvel, who due to an unusual contract would not appear in another film until 1963. Filming took place around Renoir's childhood home in [[Provence]], and inspiration came from the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] paintings of his father, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The filming technique was influenced by [[live television]] and involved [[Multiple-camera setup|multiple cameras]] and direct audio recording.\n\nThe press reviews were generally positive and described the film as charming and beautiful. Negative response came from the political left, where critics disapproved of the film's treatment of [[progress]] and depiction of a European [[superstate]]. The subject of European unification was topical and sensitive due to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. The film was a commercial failure and has attracted little attention from general audiences over the years.\n\n==Plot==\nThe famous biologist \u00c9tienne Alexis is the frontrunner in the upcoming election of the first President of [[United States of Europe|Europe]]. He advocates mandatory [[artificial insemination]] in order to [[Eugenics|improve humanity]] and make it worthy of modern science. He is newly engaged to his German cousin Marie-Charlotte and has invited her to a picnic near his mansion in [[Provence]].\n\nN\u00e9nette, a farmer's daughter, is disappointed with men after a failed relationship. She still wants children and applies to be a test subject for \u00c9tienne's insemination project. She ends up hired as his chambermaid and accompanies the picnic with the other servants. Present at the picnic are several cousins from both France and Germany. They are all stiff, rationally minded and profess belief in scientific [[progress]]. They have invited journalists to document the event as a symbol for the new unified Europe. The picnic takes place next to the ruins of a temple of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the goddess who the ancient Romans believed presided over childbirth. Nearby is also a group of young campers. N\u00e9nette is worried when she spots the goatherd Gaspard. She knows that when Gaspard plays his flute, strange things tend to happen. Gaspard plays and suddenly a strong wind blows away the picnic chairs and tables. As everybody takes cover, \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette are separated from the rest.\n\nWhen the wind subsides, they are invited to sit down with the campers. \u00c9tienne explains to the youth how he hopes to eliminate passion. Meanwhile, a [[Bacchanalia]] breaks out among the picnic guests not far away. Leaving the campers to look for Marie-Charlotte, \u00c9tienne ends up seeing N\u00e9nette [[Nude swimming|swimming nude]]. Shortly thereafter, Gaspard plays his flute again, and \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette run off into the high reeds. After returning, the two see the cousins and servants leaving in cars. They choose to not approach them and instead rejoin the campers, who offer them to stay the night in their camp. The next morning, \u00c9tienne says he wants to escape from the world for a while, so he and N\u00e9nette go to stay at N\u00e9nette's father Nino's house. \u00c9tienne begins to reconsider the relationship between humans and the natural world. The cousins eventually locate him and come to Nino's house. They convince N\u00e9nette to leave. Realizing she is gone, \u00c9tienne becomes agitated and goes to look for her. Gaspard, the goatherd, recommends him to kneel before his goat and ask for help. After doing so, \u00c9tienne turns ecstatic and shouts \"Down with science!\" before his cousins capture him.\n\n\u00c9tienne goes back to his old life, but on the day of his wedding he discovers N\u00e9nette working in a hotel kitchen. She is happily pregnant with his child. He abruptly brings her, not Marie-Charlotte, to the waiting crowd. He will launch his presidential campaign with a speech about science and nature, and he intends to marry N\u00e9nette.\n\n==Cast==\nCast adapted from ''A Companion to Jean Renoir'' and the [[British Film Institute]].{{sfnm|1a1=Phillips|1a2=Vincendeau|1y=2013|1p=583|2a1=British Film Institute}}\n* [[Paul Meurisse]] as Professor \u00c9tienne Alexis\n* [[Catherine Rouvel]] as N\u00e9nette\n* [[Fernand Sardou]] as Nino, N\u00e9nette's father\n* Jacqueline Morane as Titine, N\u00e9nette's elder sister\n* [[Jean-Pierre Granval]] as Ritou, Titine's husband\n* Ingrid Nordine as Marie-Charlotte\n* [[Charles Blavette]] as Gaspard, the old goatherd\n* [[Paulette Dubost]] as Mlle Forestier, the telephonist\n\n==Themes==\n===Modernity and nature===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 020.jpg|thumb|alt=Oil painting of a nude woman who sits on a rock and leans on a bow. At her feet is a dead deer with its neck pierced by an arrow.|''[[Diana (Renoir painting)|Diana]]'' by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1867]]\nThe themes of ''Picnic on the Grass'' revolve modern issues such as artificial insemination, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the [[mass media]]. [[Jean Renoir]]'s biographer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]] writes that the film \"deals with disturbingly serious subjects using a farcical tone\".{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The film historian [[Jean Douchet]] writes that the film should be taken seriously, but describes its story as an invitation to not do so.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=295}} Renoir satirizes a [[modernity]] he does not think highly of, and uses story and tone to tell the viewer that it is not very important.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\nThe central conflict is built on several [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]: between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]], the [[Technocracy|technocratic]] [[Northern Europe]] and underdeveloped [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]], and the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] of [[Postchristianity]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy of ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=298\u2013299}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' ridicules the idealist notion of progress and celebrates the Dionysian world.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} The film portrays an empty spirituality produced by a bureaucratic [[utilitarianism]], and thereby seeks to justify the celebration of a material world imbued with spirit.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=349}} When \u00c9tienne converses with a Christian priest, the two are shown to have disagreements, but simultaneously understand each other well. This is because both still belong to the idealist side in the film's conflict.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} According to Douchet, the film sets up a scenario where harmonious equilibrium is achieved when science abandons idealism and submits to a materialist view of nature. This happens when \u00c9tienne marries N\u00e9nette who is pregnant with their naturally conceived child.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=299\u2013300}}\n\n\u00c9tienne is an intellectual who lives in a theoretical world. This makes him similar to the main characters in two earlier works by Renoir: the play ''Orvet'' (1955) and the television film ''[[The Doctor's Horrible Experiment]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=314}} \u00c9tienne's eugenic ideology combines rationalism and [[moralism]] in a way that gives [[Darwinism]] an active role in concord with [[individualism]]. [[Human reproduction]] and [[Human evolution|evolution]] become tied to \u00c9tienne's own [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficiency]] and to ideas about social responsibility.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=349\u2013350}} N\u00e9nette is comfortable with her human physicality, but is also driven by self-sufficiency in her wish to have her own child through artificial insemination. She is [[Emancipation|emancipated]] and mobile, and it is her actions that twice bring her to \u00c9tienne. Another\u2014militaristic\u2014type of women's emancipation is represented by Marie-Charlotte.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}} Allied against Western rationalism are the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Diana. Pan is evoked through the flute-playing goatherd, and Diana presides over [[chastity]] and childbirth, which in this [[Classical mythology|classical mythological]] context are aspects of female independence.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}}\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Renoir - PORTRAIT DE JEAN RENOIR, 1910.jpg|thumb|alt=Painted bust portrait of Jean Renoir as a young boy|Portrait of Jean Renoir by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1910]]\nRenoir had spent years of his childhood and adolescence in the area where ''Picnic on the Grass'' was filmed.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} He had recently begun to write a book about his father, the painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which made him reminisce about his early life.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Accordng to M\u00e9rigeau, the film was a way for Renoir to confront the boy he once was with the troubling questions of the contemporary world. Renoir's reconnection to his young self is paralleled in the mode of storytelling which is reminiscent of [[Silent film|silent cinema]]. Another parallel is with Renoir's film ''[[Partie de campagne]]'', filmed in 1936, and the similarities in its portrayal of eroticism.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The filmmaker [[Shirley Clarke]] said that ''Picnic on the Grass'' \"could only have been made by someone of 6 or 60\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=354}}\n\n===European integration===\nThe historian Hugo Frey groups ''Picnic on the Grass'' with a number of French comedies that deal with a \"modernist invasion\".{{sfn|Frey|2014|p=119}} These include the films of [[Jacques Tati]], ''[[Mr. Freedom]]'' (1968) by [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] and ''[[The Holes]]'' (1974) by [[Pierre Tchernia]]. Renoir's film stands out in the group because it targets the nascent [[European Union]] rather than the United States.{{sfn|Frey|2014|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nThe vision of a European [[superstate]] was conceived as the logical continuation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), created in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]]. The film's depiction of a French and German elite couple follows a convention where [[European integration]] is understood as something that particularly concerns France and Germany, or France and [[Germanic-speaking Europe]] overall. The way \u00c9tienne speaks to journalists, with technical and obscure terminology, envisions a future political elite as the only people who will comprehend the European project.{{sfn|Rivi\u00e8re|2018|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter working in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] in the 1940s, Renoir had re-established himself in European cinema following the international success of ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951). During the 1950s, he developed a more detached and depoliticized approach to filmmaking than before. Simultaneously, he became a more prominent celebrity in France due to television appearances and an increased appreciation for his films from the 1930s. His work became more oriented toward personal subjects.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=328\u2013329}}\n\nThe title of ''Picnic on the Grass'' is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Renoir wrote seven versions of the screenplay.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} He made the film through his own production company, Compagnie Jean Renoir. It was the last time he did that; annoyances about logistics during the production made him decide to never produce his own films again. In addition to financial backing from [[Path\u00e9]] and the UCIF, Renoir offered 50% of his earnings from ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (1937) as a [[reimbursement]] guarantee, to a limit of 10 million [[French franc|francs]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Catherine Rouvel]]\u2014whose real last name was Rouveyre\u2014did her first major role in ''Picnic on the Grass''. Renoir had met her in 1958, shortly after her 19th birthday, during a tribute to [[Robert J. Flaherty]] at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]. She accompanied her husband Georges Rouveyre whose friend Claude Beylie, who was a film critic, introduced her to Renoir. She had enrolled at the drama school Centre d'art dramatique de la rue Blanche a few weeks earlier. The same winter, Renoir contacted her for a reading and a screen test.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=697}} Before she won the role of N\u00e9nette, Renoir considered giving it to the dancer [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], whom he had directed in a ballet. He also auditioned [[Mich\u00e8le Mercier]] the same day as Rouveyre. Renoir told Rouveyre in April 1959 that the role was hers. Soon thereafter he suggested that she should change her name to Rouvel.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} For the male lead, Renoir first considered [[Pierre Blanchar]], a man in his mid 60s, before he gave the role to the 20 years younger [[Paul Meurisse]]. Renoir had previously worked with Meurisse in a production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and the two were good friends.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} In the role of the goatherd Gaspard he cast [[Charles Blavette]], who had played the title role in Renoir's film ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nRenoir rehearsed with the actors for a week before adding technicians to the rehearsals. After this, the director, designer, camera operator and assistant scouted the filming locations. The rehearsals then resumed with markers chalked on the floor corresponding to the locations' topography.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} Working with markers was something Renoir abandoned after ''Picnic on the Grass'', because he thought it was better if the actors could discover the surroundings more freely.{{sfn|Renoir|1989|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[File:Cagnes-sur-Mer- Mus\u00e9e Renoir - Ferme -1.JPG|alt=Photograph of a stone house with three floors fronted by an old olive tree|thumb|The old farmhouse at Les Collettes was a filming location. The property was acquired by the city of Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1959 and turned into the Mus\u00e9e Renoir.{{sfn|Oddos|2016}}]]\nFilming took place from 6 to 30 July 1959 at Studio Franc\u0153ur in Paris, and in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and [[La Gaude]] in [[Alpes-Maritimes]].{{sfn|Cin\u00e9-Ressources}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' borrows visual traits from French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting, and in particular that of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This is reflected in the choices of filming locations. Jean Renoir called the film \"something of a homage to the olive-trees under which my father worked so much\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}} A major location was the property Les Collettes in Cagnes-sur-Mer, which Renoir the elder had bought in 1907, and which had been the home of Jean Renoir for a part of his childhood and adolescence.{{sfnm|1a1=Durgnat|1y=1974|1p=347|2a1=M\u00e9rigeau|2y=2017|2p=700}} Renoir the elder had spent significant time in the town La Gaude where a part of the film was shot. Several of his paintings feature the nearby river Le Coup, which also appears in the film.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nAnother stylistic choice came from the director's desire to follow impulses on location and encourage improvisation. Renoir said he wanted to make a \"sort of filmed poem\" written in one sitting.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} After the rehearsals, he gave very little instruction to the actors.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} He used a rapid working method influenced by [[live television]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} Renoir had first used this technique in his recent television film ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'', which he called an \"experimental film\".{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=276}} He took advantage of the cinematographer's experience from making [[newsreel]] footage. [[Multiple-camera setup|Six cameras were placed around the scene]] to cover all useful angles and shots.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} In addition to saving time and money, the ambition was to retain the uninterrupted, intensive acting of a [[long take]] and still be able to make cuts within the scene.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|pp=276\u2013277}} The method made it possible to record most of the dialogue directly, without problems of continuity due to surrounding sounds such as those from airplanes. Up to twelve microphones were present and only around 20 phrases had to be dubbed in post-production.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}}\n\nSeveral key crew members were reused from ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment''. They included the cinematographer Georges Leclerc and the editor Ren\u00e9e Lichtig. Both would work with Renoir again on his next film, ''[[The Elusive Corporal]]'', which became his final feature film.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The working method was however not used again.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=277}} The original music was composed by [[Joseph Kosma]], who first collaborated with Renoir in 1936 and had provided music for several of his best known films.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=412}} The score for ''Picnic on the Grass'' includes a melody the goatherd plays in high pitch on his flute during the wind scene, an upbeat piece played on clarinet in jazz style, and a melody played on flute with harp [[glissando]]s during a lyrical passage.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=413}}\n\n==Release==\nPath\u00e9 released ''Picnic on the Grass'' theatrically in France on 11 November 1959.{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}} In the United Kingdom it was released by Mondial Films in April 1960 under the title ''Lunch on the Grass''.{{sfn|British Board of Film Classification}} It was released in the United States as ''Picnic on the Grass'' on 12 October 1960 by [[Kingsley-International Pictures]].{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}}\n\nFor the French home-media market, it was first released on [[VHS]] in 1990 by Fil \u00e0 film and on [[DVD]] in 2003 by [[StudioCanal|StudioCanal vid\u00e9o]]. The DVD, which was re-released in 2008, includes a 30-minute documentary directed by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Glaymann.{{sfn|BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral}} The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2007 by [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]], as part of a box set with other Renoir films. The DVD uses the original French title, ''Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur L'Herbe''.{{sfn|French|2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Contemporary critical response===\nFrench film critics generally gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a positive reception, characterized by respect for Renoir. They highlighted the film's connection to impressionism and described it as charming.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=356}} Rouvel's face was on the cover of the December 1959 issue of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', and the magazine called the film \"the most beautiful of a month rich in masterpieces\".{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959|loc=inside of the front cover}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Pour l'\u00e9quipe des \u00ab Cahiers \u00bb et le Conseil des Dix, le film de Jean Renoir est le plus beau d'un mois riche en chefs-d'\u0153uvre.}}}} The review by [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]] stressed the technical novelty of the film, released in \"the year of the '[[French New Wave|New Wave]]'\", which Renoir had influenced profoundly.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=2}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... l'ann\u00e9e de la \u00ab nouvelle vague \u00bb ...}}}} With its detached and intentionally naive style, Rohmer described it as \"avant-garde popular theater\" in the vein of ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]''.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=4}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... th\u00e9\u00e2tre populaire d'avant-garde ...}}}} For Rohmer, the satire against science should be understood through Renoir's role as an artist, not philosopher or moralist, and not as a rejection of practical science.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=6}} As for politics, he defended the artist's right to look at the problems of the world without being politically engaged.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=7}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' made 13th place on ''Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma'''s composite list of the best films of 1959.{{sfn|Hillier|1985|p=287}} [[Pierre Braunberger]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jacques Rivette]], Rohmer and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] were among the ''Cahiers'' critics who named it to year-end top ten lists.{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n[[File:Jean Renoir (1959).tif|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of Jean Renoir in his mid 60s|Jean Renoir in 1959]]\nRenoir had supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in the 1930s, but ''Picnic on the Grass'' received negative reviews from critics with [[Communism|communist]] sympathies. It was released at a time when the PCF idealized progress and its members were enthusiastic about the [[Soviet space program]].{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=328 and 340}} Samuel Lachize of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' considered the film flawed on a technical level, and criticized its lack of a clear choice between scientific progress and the rejection of it. He dismissed the philosophical content, which he took as a pseudo-[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauesque]] message about going [[back to nature]].{{sfn|Lachize|1959|p=2|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Marie|2013|pp=338\u2013339}}}} ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'' received a similar treatment from communist critics.{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=339\u2013340}} Left-wing critics also criticized ''Picnic on the Grass'' for its eventual acceptance of a European superstate, which was taken as an approval of the EEC, opposed by the left at the time. Furthermore upsetting for the left, the reservations \u00c9tienne develops were interpreted as support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s {{lang|fr|Europe des patries}} (\"Europe of fatherlands\").{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=350\u2013352}} In the 1970s, the film critic [[Raymond Durgnat]] related the response to the left's own struggle to oppose the EEC without turning to patriotism. Durgnat wrote that it was \"perhaps not too unkind to suggest that my left-wing colleagues were making their 'lost leader' a scapegoat for the very real difficulties of the left itself\u2014or should one say the lefts themselves?\"{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=352}}\n\nGideon Bachmann wrote in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' that many American critics gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a \"silly treatment\", because they did not understand it through its director as a person. He used [[Hollis Alpert]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' as a positive counterexample.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} Alpert called it \"a nonsensically unconventional movie\" where viewers \"would be better off not trying to make sense or logic out of it, but simply allowing M. Renoir to have his day in the fields\".{{sfn|Alpert|1960|p=34}} Bachmann wrote that the film is reminiscent of Tati's films, both in message and how the message is conveyed through colors.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} He contrasted the seeming simplicity with the serious content, and the impressionism with the surreal elements. He called it \"almost facile in impact but lasting in the perturbations it causes\".{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=41}}\n\n===Retrospective critical response===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' has received little attention from general audiences over time, but it has been embraced by individual critics.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} In 2006, Luc Arbona of ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' called it an \"extraordinary pamphlet\" portraying \"the peddlers of progress\" who \"only care about security, asepticity and uniformity\".{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Renoir r\u00e9alise ici un extraordinaire pamphlet o\u00f9 il met en sc\u00e8ne les camelots du progr\u00e8s qui se contrefoutent du monde, de la nature et ne se soucient que de s\u00e9curisation, d'aseptisation et d'uniformisation.}}}} Arbona called the satire \"abuntant and exhilirating\" and the film \"brilliantly prophetic\", because by the time of his writing, Arbona wrote, \"these progress-obsessed, these ad-agency apostles who have nothing but the politically correct to say, have seized power and are leading the dance.\"{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Satire foisonnante et jubilatoire, Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe est g\u00e9nialement proph\u00e9tique.

Taking its message as a rejection of modern technology, he still compared it favorably to [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]'', which shows science and the government triumphant in a crisis of natural origin. Brody made a point of separating art and politics: \"Looking to filmmakers for practical advice in the teeth of trouble is usually as pointless as turning to politicians for visions of beauty.\"{{sfn|Brody|2012}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called it \"one of Renoir's most ravishing, and simultaneously most irritating films\", because the \"sumptuous photography\" repeatedly \"collapses into cold argument\".{{sfn|Time Out}}\n\n===Box office===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' had 757,024 admissions in France.{{sfn|AlloCin\u00e9}} It was a commercial failure. Renoir addressed this in a letter to the producer Ginette Doynel a few weeks after the Paris premiere. He wrote that the failure had given him a distaste for film and television work in general. He would instead focus on his teaching position at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], his plays, and his book about his father.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' later had a significant theatrical run in the United States, which delighted Renoir.{{sfn|Silke|2005|p=134}}\n\n==Legacy==\nRouvel signed an unusual contract which had the practical effect that Renoir had to approve all her engagements for the next three years. Renoir decided to keep her away from the film industry and only accepted offers of theater roles. He rejected roles in ''[[The Green Mare (film)|The Green Mare]]'' and a film by [[G\u00e9rard Oury]]. Rouvel returned to film acting in [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Landru (film)|Bluebeard]]'', released in January 1963.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=699\u2013700}}\n\nThe film ''[[Le Bonheur (1965 film)|Le Bonheur]]'' (1965) directed by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] pays tribute to ''Picnic on the Grass'' by including a passage which plays on a television screen.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=734}} The film scholar Nancy Pogel argues in her book on [[Woody Allen]] that Allen's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) is indebted to ''Picnic on the Grass''.{{sfn|Nichols|2000|p=95}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Farm at Les Collettes, Cagnes]]''\n* [[France\u2013Germany relations]]\n* [[Pan in popular culture]]\n* [[Physis]] and [[techne]]\n* [[Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]]\n\n==References==\n===Original quotations===\n{{notelist}}\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite web |author=[[AlloCin\u00e9]] |url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208035056/http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |publisher=Tiger Global |archive-date=8 December 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=CITEREFAlloCin\u00e9 }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Alpert |first=Hollis |authorlink=Hollis Alpert |date=15 October 1960 |url=https://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1960oct15-00034/ |title=Panic on the Grass |work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Arbona |first=Luc |date=17 August 2006 |url=https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe/ |title=le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]] |language=French |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |last=Bachmann |first=Gideon |year=1960 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pp=40\u201341 |doi=10.2307/1210350 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral |url=https://data.bnf.fr/en/16179534/le_dejeuner_sur_l_herbe___film/ |title=Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe : film |publisher=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/lunch-grass-1959 |title=Lunch on the Grass |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Film Institute]] |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a8a022a |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |accessdate=18 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=29 October 2012 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/watching-sandy-with-jean-renoir |title=Watching Sandy with Jean Renoir |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=December 1959 |title=Notre couverture |trans-title=Our cover |journal=[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]] |language=French |issue=102 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959 }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=February 1960 |title=Les dix meilleurs films de l'ann\u00e9e |trans-title=The ten best films of the year |journal=Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma |language=French |issue=104 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960 }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[Cin\u00e9-Ressources]] |url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=50831 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |publisher=[[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] |accessdate=26 February 2020 |ref=CITEREFCin\u00e9-Ressources }}\n\n: {{cite book |last=Douchet |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Douchet |year=1974 |chapter=Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe (1959) (Picnic on the Grass, 1960) |editor-last=Truffaut |editor-first=Fran\u00e7ois |editorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |translator1-last=Halsey II |translator1-first=W.
