Packaged with a black and orange design, and with the signature man icon with an added image of a fire, it had a warm, tingly feeling in the mouth once drunk. It featured the traditional Irn-Bru flavour with an aftertaste similar to ginger.\n\nIrn-Bru was also sold in reusable 750 ml glass bottles which, like other Barr's drinks, were able to be returned to the manufacturer in exchange for a 30 pence (previously 20p) deposit paid on purchase.

Bru and other Barr products are exported to Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, [[Gibraltar]], Greece and [[Cyprus]], as well as parts of Africa and Asia. It is available in the [[Republic of Ireland]], increasingly being stocked in [[BWG]] and [[ADM Londis]] supplied stores, as well as in supermarkets owned by [[Dunnes Stores]] and [[Tesco Ireland]]. In [[Ireland]] generally, the drink mainly sells in [[Ulster]], chiefly in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[County Donegal]]. It is also available in [[Malta]], [[Belgium]] and, as of 2005, in [[Poland]]. It is now sold in [[Iceland]], as of 2011. A similarly named product, using the ''Iron Brew'' spelling but bearing little resemblance to Irn-Bru in flavour, colour or packaging, is produced by [[Coca-Cola]] in [[South Africa]].\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], Irn-Bru was manufactured and distributed under licence by Occasio Australia Pty Ltd until 2009. It was available in 500 ml and 1.25 litre in both standard and diet. The drink enjoyed growing success in the country, with its first advertising campaign launched in [[Queensland]] in September 2007. It was initially available in major chains such as [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths (supermarket)|Woolworths]], [[Caltex Woolworths|Caltex]] service stations and in many independent grocers and convenience stores. It was then delisted at Coles supermarkets. Because of manufacturing and bottling issues, Occasio ceased local production in late 2009. It is now imported direct from the UK and distributed by British Provender Pty Ltd,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishprovender.com.au/ |title=British Provender Pty Ltd |publisher=Britishprovender.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> and can again be found in the international sections of major supermarket chains and some convenience stores.\n\n===Canada===\nIrn-Bru sold in [[Canada]] contained no caffeine until recently.

Barr in Glasgow, Scotland. Irn-Bru can be found at [[Sobeys]] supermarkets.\n\nThe now-defunct McKinlay soft-drink company in [[Glace Bay]], [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], Nova Scotia, Canada, for many years offered its own non-licensed beverage called ''Irn-Bru'' and later \"Cape Breton's Irn-Bru\". It was a brown carbonated soft-drink with a fruity cola taste.\n\nThe standard Irn-Bru distributed in Canada also contains the \"Not a source of iron\" disclaimer on the label.\nThe UK version of the drink (with caffeine) is commonly imported by speciality retailers, particularly in areas with large Scottish populations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bramblehouse.net/store.html?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=170&category_id=12&keyword=bru | title=Irn-Bru at Bramble House | accessdate=4 December 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nIrn-Bru started being sold at [[7-Eleven]].

Found mostly in [[Lulu Hypermarket|LuLu]] supermarkets.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIrn-Bru is commonly available nationwide from supermarkets as cans and 1.25 litre plastic bottles. It is bottled by Oasis, the same company that bottles Coca-Cola. Imported Irn-Bru from Scotland is available from speciality stores.\n\n===Norway===\nIrn-Bru entered the Norwegian market in May 2008. They had to withdraw from the market again in 2009 as a result of problems with production agreements and lack of funding for marketing.\n\nThey were believed to be sponsoring the [[Norwegian First Division]] club [[Mj\u00f8ndalen IF]] in 2009. This later turned out to be fraud carried out by a third party company, and Mj\u00f8ndalen IF never received any sponsorship from Irn-Bru, even though the team played the 2009 season with Irn-Bru logo on their shirts.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://dt.no/sport/mif/mif-utsatt-for-sponsorbloff-1.5342594 | work=dt.no | title=MIF utsatt for sponsorbl\u00f8ff | date=2 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Russia ===\nIrn-Bru began being sold in Russia in 1997, and by 2002 it had become their third best selling soft drink.

It can be found in key tourist areas such as the Balearic Islands, the Spanish coastal region and Canary Islands with both the regular and sugar-free variant available. Outside of the United Kingdom, Spain is among the top 10 Irn-Bru markets.\n\n===United States===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nIrn-Bru and Diet Irn-Bru have been formulated since 2002 by A.G. Barr plc to meet the regulations for food colouring of the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). [[Ponceau 4R]], used in the UK formulation, is prohibited by the FDA. Barr uses alternative food and drink colourants manufactured by a US company approved by the FDA. The product labelling also meets US labelling standards on nutritional information and bar code. Compliant Irn-Bru is solely imported by Great Scot International in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], North Carolina, who supplies distributors and retailers throughout the US. It is supplied in 500 ml PTE bottles and 4 pack 330ml cans.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Drink|Scotland}}\n* [[Iron Brew (South African soft drink)|Iron Brew]] \u2013 a similarly-named South African soft drink\n* [[List of brand name soft drinks products]]\n* [[List of soft drink flavors]]\n* [[List of soft drink producers]]\n* [[List of soft drinks by country]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Davidson, Alan.

A mother plays the piano, while the father and two children deliver a song which ends with the mother singing: \"...even though I used to be a man\". This advertisement was broadcast in 2000, but when it was repeated in 2003, it led to seventeen complaints<ref>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/adv_comp/a14/a14.pdf Ofcom response to complaints about Leith Agency advert for Irn-Bru], July 2004.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014041334/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/adv_comp/a14/a14.pdf |date=14 October 2008 }}</ref> about it being offensive to members of the transgender community. Issue A14 of the [[Ofcom]] Advertising Complaints bulletin reports that the children's response to their mother's claim was not offensive. The advertisement was meant to be a joke about changing points of view over time. However, the scene involving the mother shaving at the end of the advertisement was deemed to be potentially offensive to [[transgender]] people, and so it was taken off the air.\n\nIn 2003, an Irn-Bru commercial which showed a [[midwife]] trying to entice a baby from its mother's womb during a difficult delivery sparked fifty complaints. Some saw it as upsetting to women who had suffered [[miscarriages]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://business.scotsman.com/medialeisure/IrnBru-foetus-campaign-leaves-TV.2435902.jp |work=The Scotsman  | title=Irn-Bru Foetus Campaign Leaves TV Viewers Fizzing | date=15 June 2003}}</ref>\n\nOne billboard that drew criticism featured a young woman in a [[bikini]] along with the slogan \"Diet Irn-Bru.

It is available in the [[Republic of Ireland]], increasingly being stocked in [[BWG]] and [[ADM Londis]] supplied stores, as well as in supermarkets owned by [[Dunnes Stores]] and [[Tesco Ireland]]. In [[Ireland]] generally, the drink mainly sells in [[Ulster]], chiefly in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[County Donegal]]. It is also available in [[Malta]], [[Belgium]] and, as of 2005, in [[Poland]]. It is now sold in [[Iceland]], as of 2011. A similarly named product, using the ''Iron Brew'' spelling but bearing little resemblance to Irn-Bru in flavour, colour or packaging, is produced by [[Coca-Cola]] in [[South Africa]].\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], Irn-Bru was manufactured and distributed under licence by Occasio Australia Pty Ltd until 2009. It was available in 500 ml and 1.25 litre in both standard and diet. The drink enjoyed growing success in the country, with its first advertising campaign launched in [[Queensland]] in September 2007. It was initially available in major chains such as [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths (supermarket)|Woolworths]], [[Caltex Woolworths|Caltex]] service stations and in many independent grocers and convenience stores. It was then delisted at Coles supermarkets. Because of manufacturing and bottling issues, Occasio ceased local production in late 2009.

Outside of the United Kingdom, Spain is among the top 10 Irn-Bru markets.\n\n===United States===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nIrn-Bru and Diet Irn-Bru have been formulated since 2002 by A.G. Barr plc to meet the regulations for food colouring of the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). [[Ponceau 4R]], used in the UK formulation, is prohibited by the FDA. Barr uses alternative food and drink colourants manufactured by a US company approved by the FDA. The product labelling also meets US labelling standards on nutritional information and bar code. Compliant Irn-Bru is solely imported by Great Scot International in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], North Carolina, who supplies distributors and retailers throughout the US.
