It is owned and operated by the Railway Restoration Project 113 Organization out of [[Minersville, Pennsylvania|Minersville, PA]].\n\n== Original career ==\nCNJ #113 was one of five B-7 type switchers built for the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]], numbers 111-115. These locomotives were designed to operate on the Anthracite Roads of Pennsylvania, so instead of having regular fireboxes, they had [[wootten firebox]]es which allowed them to burn [[anthracite coal]]. Since these locomotives were designed with a 0-6-0 wheel arrangement, their only effective use was to be operated as switchers since they did not ride smoothly and rarely got past 15 miles per hour. 113 along with her sisters operated in the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey|CNJ]]'s freight yards for almost three decades. In 1945, the railroad had changed their class to ''6S46'' (6-wheeled Switcher, 46,000 pounds tractive effort). By 1951, she along with her sister counterparts were placed out of service in favor of the new diesel locomotives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrproject113.org/cnj-113|title=rrproject-113 {{!}} CNJ 113|website=rrproject-113|language=en|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== Change in Ownership ==\nAround 1953, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company (now the [[Reading Anthracite Company|Reading Anthracite Co.]]) had bought No. 113 and used her at a [[colliery]] in Locust Summit, outside of [[Ashland, Pennsylvania|Ashland, PA]] until she was last used in 1960. She became the last CNJ steam engine to be steamed up. No. 113 had also run a few fan trips with CNJ #774 in 1954, but 774 was soon scrapped. 113 was then stored outside at Locust Summit for many years and as a result, suffered a massive amount deterioration and even had some trees growing around her. The Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company eventually decided to donate her to the Historic Red Clay Valley Inc. located in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1980. In 1986, the locomotive was purchased by Robert E. Kimmel Sr. and she was later moved to Minersville where she operates out of today.\n\n== Restoration ==\nWork to restore the locomotive to operating condition began in 1999 and it took more than twenty years for it to fully be operational again. The total cost to restore the engine was more than $600,000 and had countless hours of volunteer labor. 113 was also restored with minimal protection from the elements and no heavy machinery. \nMany of the parts on the locomotive had long been missing before the restoration had even started. As a result, many of the parts had to be made from scratch since there had not been any commercial builders that produced parts for steam locomotives in decades. One example of this is how the volunteers had to make a wooden cast of the original three-chime whistle by measuring an original CNJ whistle which was available to them. The engine was finally fired up after more than five decades of inactivity in late fall of 2012. The Railway Restoration Project 113 Organization conducted a test-run on the same day with the engine also doing some more test-runs in 2013 and 2014.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrproject113.org/restoration-photos|title=rrproject-113 {{!}} RESTORATION|website=rrproject-113|language=en|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== Present ==\nAfter the test-runs for the engine in late 2012 and two/thirds of 2013, the locomotive began operating on some passenger excursions in late 2013 with [[Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad 425|Reading Blue Mountain & Northern Railroad 425]]. CNJ 113 continued to run more excursions by itself and with RBM&N 425 during the 2014 season. Every year since then the 113 has been hauling excursions across the RBM&NR's lines in cooperation with the railroad. For the excursions, the [[Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad|Reading Blue Mountain & Northern Railroad]] provides passenger cars and occasionally some helper locomotives to Railway Restoration Project 113 in order for the excursions to occur. She happens to be the only surviving CNJ steam locomotive that is still operational. There is only one other CNJ locomotive and that is CNJ No. 592, however she is not operational and currently resides at the [[B&O Railroad Museum|Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Museum]]. Currently, No. 113 operates out of Minersville, PA at the Minersville Train Depot hauling multiple excursions each year.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.rrproject113.org/ Railway Restoration Project 113's Homepage]\n* [http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/locopicture.aspx?id=54286 Railroad Pictures Archive: CNJ 113]\n*[[c:File:CNJ1132-9-91.jpg|CNJ 113 in 1991]]\n*[http://www.borail.org/CNJ-No-592.aspx CNJ No. 592]\n\n[[Category:0-6-0 locomotives]]\n[[Category:ALCO locomotives]]\n[[Category:Individual locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Steam locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1923]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Central Railroad of New Jersey 113}}\n{{Infobox locomotive|boilerpressure={{convert|200|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on}}|builddate=June 1923|builder=[[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO)|cylindercount=2|cylindersize={{convert|23|\u00d7|26|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|disposition=Operational, based out of RRP headquarters in [[Minersville, Pennsylvania]]|driverdiameter={{convert|51|in|m|3|abbr=on}}|fleetnumbers=CNJ #113<br/>Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. #113|fueltype=[[Anthracite coal]]|gauge={{track gauge|ussg|allk=on}}|image=|name=Central Railroad of New Jersey #113 <ref>{{cite web | url=http://steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=1032 | title=Central Railroad of New Jersey No. 113 | publisher=Steam Locomotive Information | accessdate=11 December 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220143355/http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=1032 | archive-date=2014-02-20 | url-status=live }}</ref>|numinclass=3rd of 5 total|operator=[[Central Railroad of New Jersey]], [[Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company]]|powertype=Steam|restoredate=2012 (by Railway Restoration Project 113)|operatorclass=B-7|retiredate=1951 (from CNJ)<br/>1960 (from Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co.)|serialnumber=64384|tractiveeffort={{convert|45800|lbf|kN|1|abbr=on}}|uicclass=|whytetype=[[0-6-0]]|boiler={{convert|76.5|in|m|2|abbr=on}} diameter|currentowner=[[The Railway Restoration Project 113 Organization]]|locotenderweight={{convert|336300|lb|kg t|abbr=on}}|locoweight={{convert|197000|lb|kg t|abbr=on}}}}'''Central Railroad of New Jersey 113''', also known as '''CNJ 113''', is an [[0-6-0]] \"[[0-6-0|Switcher]]\" type [[steam locomotive]] originally built in June of [[1923]] by the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO) for the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=1032|title=Steam Locomotive Information|website=www.steamlocomotive.info|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref> The locomotive was designed solely for yard service and could only operate at slow speeds due to the locomotive not having any leading or trailing wheels, but only six driving wheels (thus the [[0-6-0]] wheel arrangement). #113 currently performs passenger [[Excursion train|excursion service]]s and some freight assignments on [[Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad|Reading Blue Mountain & Northern]] operated tracks.
