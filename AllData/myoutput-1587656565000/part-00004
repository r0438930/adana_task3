For Moufawad-Paul, Maoism must be understood as being both a ''continuation'' of [[Leninist]] political, philosophical and strategic positions, while simultaneously, acting as a ''rupture'' from the dogmatic orthodoxy and theoretical limits of standard Marxism-Leninism, thus Maoism is characterized as both continuity and rupture. Throughout the work, Moufawad-Paul offers a critique of contemporary and historical Maoist organizations, such as The Revolutionary Communist Party USA, The Shining Path, The Naxalite insurgency in India, and The New People's Army, as well as contemporary Marxist intellectuals, [[Slavoj Zizek]], [[Alain Badiou]], and Tom Clark (author of ''State and Counter-Revolution'').\n\n===The Terrain of Maoism-qua-Maoism===\nMoufawad-Paul premises his work on five axioms, which are introduced in chapter one:\n\n# The distinction between \"Mao Zedong Thought\" and \"[[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]]\" (what he calls \"Maoism-qua-Maoism\")\n# Maoism, as political ideology began in 1988 with the formation of [[The Communist Party of Peru]], the first self-labelled Maoist party that conceived Maoism as a \"third stage\" of revolutionary science \n# Historical Materialism is a science due to its ability to explain historical phenomenon\n# Maoism as a third stage of revolutionary science that is both a ''continuity'' and ''rupture'' from Marxism-Leninism\n# To understand Maoism, one must understand the theoretical limitations of Marxism-Leninism.\n\n===Science's Dogmatic Shadow===\nIn the second chapter, Moufawad-Paul introduces his argument that Marxism, in contrast to contemporary intellectual consensus, is not simply a philosophy, but a science, specifically Marx's theory of [[historical materialism]].\n\n===The General Limits of Marxism-Leninism===\nIn the third chapter, Moufawad-Paul discusses the inherent contradictions within the ideology of standard Marxism-Leninism. According to Moufawad-Paul, within a Marxist-Leninist [[Vanguard Party]] if understood through Lenin's [[What is to be Done?]], is a party that represents the working class but is limited by the conception of \"the general staff of the proletariat.\" Writing in response to Marxist writer Tom Clark's ''State and Counter Revolution'', Moufawad-Paul concludes that the dialectical conflict between the working-class character of socialism and the petite-bourgeoisie character of the Vanguard Party is resolved through the application of the Maoist strategy of the [[mass line]], wherein the Vanguard Party is further developed through the mass line.\n\n===A New Anti-Revisionism===\nIn this chapter Moufawad-Paul defends the concept of [[Anti-Revisionism]], which is an essential component of Maoist ideology, anti-revisionism is the Marxist position opposing alteration or \"revision\" of the established Marxist-Leninist ideology that had been developed in the Soviet Union following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] (though Moufawad-Paul is also critical of Stalin's conception of Marxism-Leninism, treating it as a limit transgressed by Maoism). Moufawad-Paul defends this concept along using the logic of his conception of Maoism as a ''continuity'' of and ''rupture'' from [[Marxism-Leninism]]. \nMaufawad-Paul explains that any new conception of Anti-Revisionism must be understood within the dialectical interrelation between ''continuity'' and ''rupture'' within Maoism.\n\n===Maoism or Trotskyism===\n''Continuity and Rupture'' contains an additional essay titled \"Maoism or Trotskyism\" which evaluates [[Maoism]] and [[Trotskyism]] as derivative forms of [[Leninism]] and their mutual claim to be the continuation of the Leninist political philosophy that led the [[October Revolution]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Maoism sidebar}}\nJ.
