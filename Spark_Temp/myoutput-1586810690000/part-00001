Unlike some other ports, such as [[Liverpool]], London, and [[Bristol]], where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Despite the still-active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre, further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped; the [[Ocean Village, Southampton|Ocean Village]] development, which included a local [[marina]] and small entertainment complex, is a good example. Southampton is home to the headquarters of both the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] and the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] of the Department for Transport in addition to cruise operator [[Carnival UK]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2007/12/12/26148/carnival-uk-signs-for-new-southampton-cruise-terminal.html |title=Carnival UK signs for new Southampton cruise terminal |publisher=TravelWeekly |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203022/http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2007/12/12/26148/carnival-uk-signs-for-new-southampton-cruise-terminal.html |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesssouthampton.com/content/default.asp?PageId=255 |title=Carnival UK |publisher=businesssouthampton.com |accessdate=5 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214052257/http://www.businesssouthampton.com/content/default.asp?PageId=255 |archive-date=14 December 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, a more diverse range of industry also came to the city, including aircraft and car manufacture, cables, electrical engineering products, and petrochemicals.

Two of these, a [[RORO|car ferry]] service and a fast [[catamaran]] passenger ferry service, provide links to [[Cowes|East Cowes]] and [[Cowes]], respectively, on the [[Isle of Wight]] and are operated by [[Red Funnel]]. The third ferry is the [[Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry|Hythe Ferry]], providing a passenger service to [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] on the other side of [[Southampton Water]].\n\nSouthampton used to be home to a number of ferry services to the continent, with destinations such as [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]], [[Lisbon]], [[Tangier]] and [[Casablanca]]. A ferry port was built during the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.plimsoll.org/Southampton/TheDocks/EasternDocks/OuterDock3.asp The result appeared to be very successful] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416223023/http://www.plimsoll.org/Southampton/TheDocks/EasternDocks/OuterDock3.asp |date=16 April 2008 }} Retrieved 2 January 2008</ref> However, a number of these relocated to Portsmouth and by 1996, there were no longer any car ferries operating from Southampton with the exception of services to the [[Isle of Wight]]. The land used for Southampton Ferry Port was sold off and a retail and housing development was built on the site. The Princess Alexandra Dock was converted into a marina. Reception areas for new cars now fill the Eastern Docks where passengers, dry docks and trains used to be.\n\n===Bus===\n[[File:Buses by Guildhall.jpg|thumb|Bluestar and First Southampton buses outside the Guildhall]]\nThe main [[bus]] operators are [[First Hampshire & Dorset|First Southampton]], [[Bluestar (bus company)|Bluestar]], [[Xelabus]] and Wheelers.

This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services.\n\nThere are two main termini for bus services. First uses stops around Pound Tree Road and Vincent's Walk, except the X4 to Portsmouth and X5 to Gosport, which start and end their journeys from Westquay. This leaves the other terminal of West Quay available for other operators. [[Unilink]] passes West Quay in both directions, and the Salisbury Reds X7 service to Salisbury drops passengers off and pick them up there, terminating at a series of bus stands along the road. Certain Bluestar services also do this, while others stop at Bargate and some loop round West Quay, stopping at Hanover Buildings.\n\n===Tram===\n{{main|Southampton Corporation Tramways}}\nThere was a [[Southampton Corporation Tramways|tram system]] from 1879 to 1949.
