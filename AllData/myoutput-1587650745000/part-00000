The protagonist of the story, Sung Jin-Woo, is the weakest of the rank E hunters and barely stronger than a normal human. He is nicknamed by his fellow hunters as \"the weakest\". One day, he and other hunters find themselves trapped in an extremely dangerous dungeon, and only a few of them survive and manage to escape. Sung Jin-Woo himself hardly survives and is the only one who completes all the trials in this dungeon. He then turns into a \"player\" who can now see an interface showing him quests. Will he succeed in becoming the most powerful hunter?\n\nThe manhwa depicts how the weakest of all the hunters grows to become the strongest there is. Hunter Sung-Woo likes clearing dungeons alone and have gained tremendous strength and magic powers in the process. The Ant arc just finished and Sung Jin-Woo was able to defeat the Ant king without even using his full strength.
