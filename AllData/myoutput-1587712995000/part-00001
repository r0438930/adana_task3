Scholars are uncertain of the origin of the Proto-Germanic form itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cunt |title=Cunt |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}</ref> There are [[cognate]]s in most Germanic languages, such as the Swedish, [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Nynorsk]] ''{{lang|sv|kunta}}''; [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] and [[Middle Low German]] ''{{lang|fy|kunte}}''; [[Middle Dutch]] ''{{lang|dum|conte}}''; Dutch ''{{lang|nl|kut}}'' (cunt) and ''{{lang|nl|kont}}'' (butt); [[Middle Low German]] ''{{lang|gml|kutte}}''; [[Middle High German]] ''{{lang|gmh|kotze}}'' (\"{{lang|en|[[prostitution|prostitute]]}}\"); German ''{{lang|de|kott}}'', and perhaps [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|cot}}''. The [[etymology]] of the Proto-Germanic term is disputed. It may have arisen by [[Grimm's law]] operating on the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''{{PIE|*gen/gon}}'' \"{{lang|en|create, become}}\" seen in [[gonads]], [[genital]], [[gamete]], [[genetics]], [[gene]], or the Proto-Indo-European root ''{{PIE|*g\u02b7neh\u2082/guneh\u2082}}'' \"{{lang|en|woman}}\" ({{lang-el|italic=yes|gun\u00ea}}, seen in [[gynaecology]]). Relationships to similar-sounding words such as the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|cunnus}}'' (\"{{lang|en|vulva}}\"), and its derivatives French ''{{lang|fr|con}}'', Spanish ''{{lang|es|co\u00f1o}}'', and Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|cona}}'', or in [[Persian language|Persian]] ''{{lang|fa-Latn|kun}}'' ({{lang|fa|\u06a9\u0648\u0646}}), have not been conclusively demonstrated. Other Latin words related to ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Female genitals|cunnus]]'' are ''{{lang|la|cuneus}}'' (\"{{lang|en|wedge}}\") and its derivative ''{{lang|la|cun\u0113re}}'' (\"{{lang|en|to fasten with a wedge}}\", (figurative) \"{{lang|en|to squeeze in}}\"), leading to English words such as ''[[cuneiform]]'' (\"{{lang|en|wedge-shaped}}\"). In [[Middle English]], ''cunt'' appeared with many spellings, such as ''{{lang|enm|coynte}}'', ''{{lang|enm|cunte}}'' and ''{{lang|enm|queynte}}'', which did not always reflect the actual [[pronunciation]] of the word.\n\nThe word in its modern meaning is attested in Middle English.

Its first appearance in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was in 1972, which cites the word as having been in use from 1230 in what was supposedly a London street name of \"Gropecunte Lane\". It was, however, also used before 1230, having been brought over by the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s, originally not an [[obscenity]] but rather an ordinary name for the vulva or vagina. [[Gropecunt Lane]] was originally a street of prostitution, a [[red light district]]. It was normal in the [[Middle Ages]] for streets to be named after the goods available for sale therein, hence the prevalence in cities having a medieval history of names such as \"Silver Street\" and \"Fish Street\". In some locations, the former name has been [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]], as in the City of York, to the more acceptable \"Grape Lane\".<ref>Baker, N & Holt, R.

It is sometimes unclear whether the two words were thought of as distinct from one another. Elsewhere in Chaucer's work the word ''queynte'' seems to be used with meaning comparable to the modern \"quaint\" (curious or old-fashioned, but nevertheless appealing).<ref>{{OED|'''4''' quaint, a.

Although Shakespeare does not use the word explicitly (or with [[derogatory]] meaning) in his plays, he still uses [[Word play|wordplay]] to sneak it in obliquely. In Act III, Scene 2, of ''[[Hamlet]]'', as the castle's residents are settling in to watch the [[Subplot|play-within-the-play]], Hamlet asks his girlfriend [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], \"Lady, shall I lie in your lap?\" Ophelia replies, \"No, my lord.\" Hamlet, feigning shock, says, \"Do you think I meant ''country matters''?\" Then, to drive home the point that the [[Stress (linguistics)|accent]] is definitely on the first [[syllable]] of ''country'', Shakespeare has Hamlet say, \"That's a fair thought, to lie between maids' legs.\"<ref>Partridge, Eric, ''Shakespeare's Bawdy'', Routledge, London, 2001, p. 111</ref> In ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (Act II, Scene V) the puritanical Malvolio believes he recognises his employer's handwriting in an anonymous letter, commenting \"There be her very Cs, her Us, and her Ts: and thus makes she her great Ps\", unwittingly punning on \"cunt\" and \"piss\",<ref name=\"Silverton\" /> and while it has also been argued that the slang term \"cut\" is intended,<ref>{{cite book|first=Bruce R.|last=Smith|title=Twelfth night, or, What you will: texts and contexts |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2001|page=64}}</ref> Pauline Kiernan writes that Shakespeare ridicules \"prissy puritanical party-poopers\" by having \"a Puritan spell out the word 'cunt' on a public stage\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Pauline|last=Kiernan|title=Filthy Shakespeare: Shakespeare's Most Outrageous Sexual Puns|publisher=Quercus|year=2006|page=61}}</ref> A related scene occurs in ''Henry V'': when Katherine is learning English, she is appalled at the \"''gros, et impudique''\" words \"foot\" and \"gown\", which her teacher has mispronounced as \"''coun''\". It is usually argued that Shakespeare intends to suggest that she has misheard \"foot\" as \"''foutre''\" (French, \"fuck\") and \"coun\" as \"''con''\" (French \"cunt\", also used to mean \"idiot\").<ref>Partridge, Eric, ''Shakespeare's Bawdy'', Routledge, London, 2001, p. 110</ref>\n\nSimilarly [[John Donne]] alludes to the obscene meaning of the word without being explicit in his poem ''[[The Good-Morrow]]'', referring to sucking on \"country pleasures\".

The [[etymology]] of the Proto-Germanic term is disputed.

In [[Middle English]], ''cunt'' appeared with many spellings, such as ''{{lang|enm|coynte}}'', ''{{lang|enm|cunte}}'' and ''{{lang|enm|queynte}}'', which did not always reflect the actual [[pronunciation]] of the word.\n\nThe word in its modern meaning is attested in Middle English.

Its first appearance in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was in 1972, which cites the word as having been in use from 1230 in what was supposedly a London street name of \"Gropecunte Lane\".

[[Gropecunt Lane]] was originally a street of prostitution, a [[red light district]]. It was normal in the [[Middle Ages]] for streets to be named after the goods available for sale therein, hence the prevalence in cities having a medieval history of names such as \"Silver Street\" and \"Fish Street\".

Although Shakespeare does not use the word explicitly (or with [[derogatory]] meaning) in his plays, he still uses [[Word play|wordplay]] to sneak it in obliquely. In Act III, Scene 2, of ''[[Hamlet]]'', as the castle's residents are settling in to watch the [[Subplot|play-within-the-play]], Hamlet asks his girlfriend [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], \"Lady, shall I lie in your lap?\" Ophelia replies, \"No, my lord.\" Hamlet, feigning shock, says, \"Do you think I meant ''country matters''?\" Then, to drive home the point that the [[Stress (linguistics)|accent]] is definitely on the first [[syllable]] of ''country'', Shakespeare has Hamlet say, \"That's a fair thought, to lie between maids' legs.\"<ref>Partridge, Eric, ''Shakespeare's Bawdy'', Routledge, London, 2001, p. 111</ref> In ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (Act II, Scene V) the puritanical Malvolio believes he recognises his employer's handwriting in an anonymous letter, commenting \"There be her very Cs, her Us, and her Ts: and thus makes she her great Ps\", unwittingly punning on \"cunt\" and \"piss\",<ref name=\"Silverton\" /> and while it has also been argued that the slang term \"cut\" is intended,<ref>{{cite book|first=Bruce R.|last=Smith|title=Twelfth night, or, What you will: texts and contexts |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2001|page=64}}</ref> Pauline Kiernan writes that Shakespeare ridicules \"prissy puritanical party-poopers\" by having \"a Puritan spell out the word 'cunt' on a public stage\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Pauline|last=Kiernan|title=Filthy Shakespeare: Shakespeare's Most Outrageous Sexual Puns|publisher=Quercus|year=2006|page=61}}</ref> A related scene occurs in ''Henry V'': when Katherine is learning English, she is appalled at the \"''gros, et impudique''\" words \"foot\" and \"gown\", which her teacher has mispronounced as \"''coun''\".
