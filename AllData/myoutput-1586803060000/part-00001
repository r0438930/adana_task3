In the 10 years from 1144, two successive [[count of Anjou|counts of Anjou]] in France, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] and his son, the future Henry II, won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western Europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as the [[Angevin Empire]]. As a political entity this was structurally different from the preceding [[House of Normandy|Norman]] and subsequent [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] realms. Geoffrey became [[Duke of Normandy]] in 1144 and died in 1151. In 1152 his heir, Henry, added Aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Henry also inherited the claim of his mother, [[Empress Matilda]], the daughter of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], to the English throne, to which he succeeded in 1154 following the death of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=1}}</ref>\n\nHenry was succeeded by his third son, [[Richard I of England|Richard]], whose reputation for martial prowess won him the epithet \"{{lang|fr|C\u0153ur de Lion}}\" or \"Lionheart\".<ref name=\"Turner & Heiser 71\">{{harvnb|Turner|Heiser|2000|p=71}}</ref> He was born and raised in England but spent very little time there during his adult life, perhaps as little as six months.

In 1204 John lost much of the Angevins' continental territories, including Anjou, to the French crown. He and his successors were still recognized as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|dukes of Aquitaine]]. The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the rationale behind John's son, [[Henry III of England]], being considered the first [[Plantagenet]] {{ndash}} a name derived from the nickname of his great-grandfather, Geoffrey. Where no distinction is made between the Angevins{{mdash}}and Angevin era{{mdash}}and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king.<ref>{{harvnb| Blockmans|Hoppenbrouwers |2014|p=173}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=15\u201323}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|2007|pp=85\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1991|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref> From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] before dividing into two competing [[cadet branch]]es, the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]].\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n===Angevin===\nThe adjective Angevin is especially used in English history to refer to the kings who were also counts of Anjou{{mdash}}beginning with Henry II{{mdash}}descended from Geoffrey and Matilda; their characteristics, descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid-twelfth to early-thirteenth centuries. In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou, or any sovereign, government derived from this. As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler. As such Angevin is also used for other [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou]]; including the three kings' ancestors, their cousins who held the crown of [[King of Jerusalem#House of Anjou|Jerusalem]] and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and the [[Valois House of Anjou]].<ref>{{OED|Angevin}}</ref>\n\n===Angevin Empire===\n\nThe term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined in 1887 by [[Kate Norgate]]. As far as it is known there was no contemporary name for this assemblage of territories which were referred to{{mdash}}if at all{{mdash}}by clumsy circumlocutions such as ''our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be'' or ''the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father''. Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial. In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term ''espace Plantagenet'' was acceptable.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=2\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\n[[Image:The Children of Henry2 England.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=An illuminated diagram showing the Angevins; coloured lines connect the two to show the lineal descent|Thirteenth-century depiction of the Angevins ([[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his legitimate children): (''left to right'') [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]] and [[John, King of England|John]]]]\nThe Angevins descend from [[Geoffrey II, Count of G\u00e2tinais]] and [[Ermengarde of Anjou, Duchess of Burgundy|Ermengarde of Anjou]]. In 1060 this couple inherited, via [[cognatic kinship]], the county of Anjou from an older line dating from 870 and a noble called [[Ingelger]].<ref name=Davies1997p190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref><ref name=\"vauchezsixtyfive\">{{harvnb|Vauchez|2000|p=65}}</ref> The marriage of Count Geoffrey to Matilda, the only surviving legitimate child of [[Henry I of England]], was part of a struggle for power during the tenth and eleventh centuries among the lords of [[Normandy]], [[Brittany]], [[Poitou]], [[Blois]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and the kings of France. It was from this marriage that Geoffrey's son, Henry, inherited the claims to England, Normandy and Anjou that marks the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.<ref name=Gillingham7>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=7}}</ref>  This was the third attempt by Geoffrey's father [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V]] to build a political alliance with Normandy. The first was by marrying his daughter [[Matilda of Anjou|Matilda]] to Henry's heir [[William Adelin]], who drowned in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]''. Fulk then married his daughter [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]] to [[William Clito]], heir to Henry's older brother [[Robert Curthose]], but Henry had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to his lands.<ref name=Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}</ref>\n\n==Inheritance custom and Angevin practice==\n\nAs society became more prosperous and stable in the 11th century, inheritance customs developed  that allowed daughters (in the absence of sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph de Diceto]] noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The marriage of Geoffrey to the daughter of a king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context.  It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito's rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]] or [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]] who in the event did seize King Henry's English crown. King Henry's great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as \"the heir to the Kingdom\", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother, [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=10\u201312}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[William of Newburgh]] writing in the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey's early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the paternal and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=18}}</ref> Henry's brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 21\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe unity of Henry's assemblage of domains was largely dependent on the ruling family, influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure. The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation. Indeed, if Henry II's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young, the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered. Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together. For example, in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John. This was complicated by the Angevins' being subjects of the kings of France, who felt these feudal rights of homage and the right of allegiance more legally belonged to them. This was particularly true when the wardship of Geoffrey's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204. On the Young King's death in 1183, Richard became heir in chief, but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance. More by accident than design this meant that, while Richard inherited the patrimony, John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany. By the mid-thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an ''Angevin Empire'' as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=119\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|Angevin arrival in England}}Arrival in England==\n[[File:France 1154-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Multi-coloured map of 12th-century France and southern England|Henry's continental holdings in 1154, showing the lands known as the Angevin Empire in shades of red.]]\nHenry I of England named his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] heir; but when he died in 1135 Matilda was far from England in Anjou or Maine, while her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] was closer in Boulogne, giving him the advantage he needed to race to England and have himself crowned and anointed king of England.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=13}}</ref>  Matilda's husband Geoffrey, though he had little interest in England, commenced a long struggle for the duchy of Normandy.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=7}}.</ref> To create a second front Matilda landed in England during 1139 to challenge Stephen, instigating the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. In 1141 she captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|battle of Lincoln]], prompting the collapse of his support.  While Geoffrey pushed on with the conquest of Normandy over the next four years, Matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory. She was even forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], allowing Stephen to resume control of much of England. Geoffrey never visited England to offer practical assistance but instead sent Henry as a male figurehead{{mdash}}beginning in 1142 when Henry was only 9{{mdash}}with a view that if England was conquered it would be Henry that would become king. In 1150 Geoffrey also transferred the title of Duke of Normandy to Henry but retained the dominant role in governance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=15\u201318}}</ref> Three fortuitous events allowed Henry to finally bring the conflict to a successful conclusion:\n* In 1151 Count Geoffrey died before having time to complete his plan to divide his inheritance between his sons Henry and [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], who would have received England and Anjou respectively.\n* [[Louis VII of France]] divorced [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] whom Henry quickly married, greatly increasing his resources and power with the acquisition of [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].\n* In 1153 Stephen's son [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] died. The disheartened Stephen, who had also recently been widowed, gave up the fight and, with the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], repeated the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142: Stephen would be king for life, Henry his successor, preserving Stephen's second son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]]'s rights to his family estates. Stephen did not live long and so Henry inherited in late 1154.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHenry faced many challenges to secure possession of his father's and grandfathers\u2019 lands that required the reassertion and extension of old suzerainties.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=23}}</ref>  In 1162 [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], died, and Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish what he saw as his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend [[Thomas Becket]] to succeed him.  Instead, Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors.  Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly: over church tenures, Henry's brother's marriage and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket, and other members of the English episcopate, to recognise sixteen ancient customs{{mdash}}governing relations between the king, his courts, and the church{{mdash}}in writing for the first time in the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to Becket's time as chancellor. In response Becket fled into exile for five years. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry's son as [[coregent]] by the [[Archbishop of York]] as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. When he heard the news, Henry said: \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk.\" Three of Henry's men killed Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him. Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death. The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry a pariah, so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks.<ref>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=142}}</ref>\n\nIn 1171 Henry invaded Ireland to assert his overlordship following alarm at the success of knights he had allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales who had assumed the role of colonisers and accrued autonomous power, including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given Henry a papal [[Laudabiliter|blessing]] to expand his power into Ireland to reform the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=53}}.</ref>  Originally this would have allowed some territory to be granted to Henry's brother, William, but other matters had distracted Henry and William was now dead. Instead Henry's designs were made plain when he gave the lordship of Ireland to his youngest son, John.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nIn 1172 Henry II tried to give his landless youngest son John a wedding gift of the three castles  of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon|Chinon]], [[Loudun]] and [[Mirebeau]]. This angered the 18-year-old Young King who had yet to receive any lands from his father and prompted a [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|rebellion]] by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons. [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] supported the rebellion to destabilise Henry II. [[William the Lion]] and other subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt and it took 18 months for Henry to force the rebels to submit to his authority.<ref name=Jones2012p82>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=82\u201392}}</ref> In Le Mans in 1182, Henry II gathered his children to plan a [[partible inheritance]] in which his eldest son (also called Henry) would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; [[Richard I of England|Richard]] the Duchy of Aquitaine; [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] Brittany, and John Ireland. This degenerated into further conflict. [[Henry the Young King|The younger Henry]] rebelled again before he died of [[dysentery]] and, in 1186, Geoffrey died after a tournament accident. In 1189 Richard and [[Philip II of France]] took advantage of Henry's failing health and forced him to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard as his sole heir.<ref name=Jones2012p109>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=109}}</ref> Two days later the old king died, defeated and miserable in the knowledge that even his favoured son John had rebelled.

In the 10 years from 1144, two successive [[count of Anjou|counts of Anjou]] in France, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] and his son, the future Henry II, won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western Europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as the [[Angevin Empire]]. As a political entity this was structurally different from the preceding [[House of Normandy|Norman]] and subsequent [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] realms. Geoffrey became [[Duke of Normandy]] in 1144 and died in 1151. In 1152 his heir, Henry, added Aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Henry also inherited the claim of his mother, [[Empress Matilda]], the daughter of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], to the English throne, to which he succeeded in 1154 following the death of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=1}}</ref>\n\nHenry was succeeded by his third son, [[Richard I of England|Richard]], whose reputation for martial prowess won him the epithet \"{{lang|fr|C\u0153ur de Lion}}\" or \"Lionheart\".<ref name=\"Turner & Heiser 71\">{{harvnb|Turner|Heiser|2000|p=71}}</ref> He was born and raised in England but spent very little time there during his adult life, perhaps as little as six months. Despite this Richard remains an enduring [[icon]]ic figure both in England and in France, and is one of very few kings of England remembered by his nickname as opposed to [[regnal number]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|1948|p=58}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Richard died, his brother John \u2013 Henry's fifth and only surviving son \u2013 took the throne. In 1204 John lost much of the Angevins' continental territories, including Anjou, to the French crown. He and his successors were still recognized as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|dukes of Aquitaine]]. The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the rationale behind John's son, [[Henry III of England]], being considered the first [[Plantagenet]] {{ndash}} a name derived from the nickname of his great-grandfather, Geoffrey. Where no distinction is made between the Angevins{{mdash}}and Angevin era{{mdash}}and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king.<ref>{{harvnb| Blockmans|Hoppenbrouwers |2014|p=173}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=15\u201323}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|2007|pp=85\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1991|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref> From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] before dividing into two competing [[cadet branch]]es, the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]].\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n===Angevin===\nThe adjective Angevin is especially used in English history to refer to the kings who were also counts of Anjou{{mdash}}beginning with Henry II{{mdash}}descended from Geoffrey and Matilda; their characteristics, descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid-twelfth to early-thirteenth centuries. In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou, or any sovereign, government derived from this. As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler. As such Angevin is also used for other [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou]]; including the three kings' ancestors, their cousins who held the crown of [[King of Jerusalem#House of Anjou|Jerusalem]] and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and the [[Valois House of Anjou]].<ref>{{OED|Angevin}}</ref>\n\n===Angevin Empire===\n\nThe term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined in 1887 by [[Kate Norgate]]. As far as it is known there was no contemporary name for this assemblage of territories which were referred to{{mdash}}if at all{{mdash}}by clumsy circumlocutions such as ''our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be'' or ''the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father''. Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial. In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term ''espace Plantagenet'' was acceptable.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=2\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\n[[Image:The Children of Henry2 England.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=An illuminated diagram showing the Angevins; coloured lines connect the two to show the lineal descent|Thirteenth-century depiction of the Angevins ([[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his legitimate children): (''left to right'') [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]] and [[John, King of England|John]]]]\nThe Angevins descend from [[Geoffrey II, Count of G\u00e2tinais]] and [[Ermengarde of Anjou, Duchess of Burgundy|Ermengarde of Anjou]]. In 1060 this couple inherited, via [[cognatic kinship]], the county of Anjou from an older line dating from 870 and a noble called [[Ingelger]].<ref name=Davies1997p190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref><ref name=\"vauchezsixtyfive\">{{harvnb|Vauchez|2000|p=65}}</ref> The marriage of Count Geoffrey to Matilda, the only surviving legitimate child of [[Henry I of England]], was part of a struggle for power during the tenth and eleventh centuries among the lords of [[Normandy]], [[Brittany]], [[Poitou]], [[Blois]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and the kings of France. It was from this marriage that Geoffrey's son, Henry, inherited the claims to England, Normandy and Anjou that marks the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.<ref name=Gillingham7>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=7}}</ref>  This was the third attempt by Geoffrey's father [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V]] to build a political alliance with Normandy. The first was by marrying his daughter [[Matilda of Anjou|Matilda]] to Henry's heir [[William Adelin]], who drowned in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]''. Fulk then married his daughter [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]] to [[William Clito]], heir to Henry's older brother [[Robert Curthose]], but Henry had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to his lands.<ref name=Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}</ref>\n\n==Inheritance custom and Angevin practice==\n\nAs society became more prosperous and stable in the 11th century, inheritance customs developed  that allowed daughters (in the absence of sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph de Diceto]] noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The marriage of Geoffrey to the daughter of a king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context.  It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito's rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]] or [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]] who in the event did seize King Henry's English crown. King Henry's great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as \"the heir to the Kingdom\", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother, [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=10\u201312}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[William of Newburgh]] writing in the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey's early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the paternal and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=18}}</ref> Henry's brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 21\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe unity of Henry's assemblage of domains was largely dependent on the ruling family, influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure. The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation. Indeed, if Henry II's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young, the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered. Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together. For example, in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John. This was complicated by the Angevins' being subjects of the kings of France, who felt these feudal rights of homage and the right of allegiance more legally belonged to them. This was particularly true when the wardship of Geoffrey's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204. On the Young King's death in 1183, Richard became heir in chief, but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance. More by accident than design this meant that, while Richard inherited the patrimony, John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany. By the mid-thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an ''Angevin Empire'' as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=119\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|Angevin arrival in England}}Arrival in England==\n[[File:France 1154-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Multi-coloured map of 12th-century France and southern England|Henry's continental holdings in 1154, showing the lands known as the Angevin Empire in shades of red.]]\nHenry I of England named his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] heir; but when he died in 1135 Matilda was far from England in Anjou or Maine, while her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] was closer in Boulogne, giving him the advantage he needed to race to England and have himself crowned and anointed king of England.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=13}}</ref>  Matilda's husband Geoffrey, though he had little interest in England, commenced a long struggle for the duchy of Normandy.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=7}}.</ref> To create a second front Matilda landed in England during 1139 to challenge Stephen, instigating the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. In 1141 she captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|battle of Lincoln]], prompting the collapse of his support.  While Geoffrey pushed on with the conquest of Normandy over the next four years, Matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory. She was even forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], allowing Stephen to resume control of much of England. Geoffrey never visited England to offer practical assistance but instead sent Henry as a male figurehead{{mdash}}beginning in 1142 when Henry was only 9{{mdash}}with a view that if England was conquered it would be Henry that would become king. In 1150 Geoffrey also transferred the title of Duke of Normandy to Henry but retained the dominant role in governance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=15\u201318}}</ref> Three fortuitous events allowed Henry to finally bring the conflict to a successful conclusion:\n* In 1151 Count Geoffrey died before having time to complete his plan to divide his inheritance between his sons Henry and [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], who would have received England and Anjou respectively.\n* [[Louis VII of France]] divorced [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] whom Henry quickly married, greatly increasing his resources and power with the acquisition of [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].\n* In 1153 Stephen's son [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] died. The disheartened Stephen, who had also recently been widowed, gave up the fight and, with the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], repeated the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142: Stephen would be king for life, Henry his successor, preserving Stephen's second son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]]'s rights to his family estates. Stephen did not live long and so Henry inherited in late 1154.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHenry faced many challenges to secure possession of his father's and grandfathers\u2019 lands that required the reassertion and extension of old suzerainties.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=23}}</ref>  In 1162 [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], died, and Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish what he saw as his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend [[Thomas Becket]] to succeed him.  Instead, Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors.  Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly: over church tenures, Henry's brother's marriage and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket, and other members of the English episcopate, to recognise sixteen ancient customs{{mdash}}governing relations between the king, his courts, and the church{{mdash}}in writing for the first time in the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to Becket's time as chancellor. In response Becket fled into exile for five years. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry's son as [[coregent]] by the [[Archbishop of York]] as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. When he heard the news, Henry said: \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk.\" Three of Henry's men killed Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him. Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death. The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry a pariah, so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks.<ref>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=142}}</ref>\n\nIn 1171 Henry invaded Ireland to assert his overlordship following alarm at the success of knights he had allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales who had assumed the role of colonisers and accrued autonomous power, including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given Henry a papal [[Laudabiliter|blessing]] to expand his power into Ireland to reform the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=53}}.</ref>  Originally this would have allowed some territory to be granted to Henry's brother, William, but other matters had distracted Henry and William was now dead.

This angered the 18-year-old Young King who had yet to receive any lands from his father and prompted a [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|rebellion]] by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons. [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] supported the rebellion to destabilise Henry II. [[William the Lion]] and other subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt and it took 18 months for Henry to force the rebels to submit to his authority.<ref name=Jones2012p82>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=82\u201392}}</ref> In Le Mans in 1182, Henry II gathered his children to plan a [[partible inheritance]] in which his eldest son (also called Henry) would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; [[Richard I of England|Richard]] the Duchy of Aquitaine; [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] Brittany, and John Ireland. This degenerated into further conflict. [[Henry the Young King|The younger Henry]] rebelled again before he died of [[dysentery]] and, in 1186, Geoffrey died after a tournament accident.
