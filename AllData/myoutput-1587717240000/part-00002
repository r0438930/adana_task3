Set in a fictionalized version of [[Chicago]], the plot follows [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] Aiden Pearce's search for revenge after the killing of his niece. The game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]], and the world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. An [[online multiplayer]] mode allows up to eight players to engage in [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in 2009, and continued for over five years. Duties were shared by many of Ubisoft's studios worldwide, with more than a thousand people involved. The developers visited Chicago to conduct field research on the setting, and used regional language for authenticity. Hacking features were created in consultation with the cyber-security company [[Kaspersky Lab]], and the in-game [[control system]] was based on [[SCADA]]. The score was composed by [[Brian Reitzell]], who infused it with [[krautrock]].\n\nFollowing its announcement in June 2012, ''Watch Dogs'' was widely anticipated. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Wii U]] in 2014. The game received generally favorable reviews; praise was directed at the gameplay, mission and open world design, combat system, hacking elements and mission variety, while criticism was expressed concerning the discrepancy in graphics quality between marketing and the real game, along with the plot and protagonist being less well-received. ''Watch Dogs'' was a commercial success, breaking the record for the biggest first-day sales of a Ubisoft game and becoming the biggest launch of a new [[intellectual property]] in the United Kingdom at the time. The game has shipped over 10 million copies; its sequel, ''[[Watch Dogs 2]]'', was released in November 2016. A third game, ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]'', is in development.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Watch Dogs gameplay.png|thumb|left|Players can view descriptive backgrounds of pedestrians with the in-game smartphone.|alt=The player character walking through an urban environment, using his smartphone to scan the area.

Brenks tries to find the hacker, giving himself and Pearce away. Fearing for his family, Pearce drives them to safety in the guise of a surprise trip to the country. On the way, hitman Maurice Vega fires a gunshot which crashes the car; Pearce's niece Lena lapses into a coma and dies. 11 months later, Pearce tracks down Vega at a baseball stadium in the Parker Square district of Chicago. After a fruitless interrogation about Vega's [[Contract killing|contractor]], he leaves Vega in the hands of his partner, fixer Jordi Chin. While investigating, Brenks approaches Pearce with a request to find the other hacker from the Merlaut job. Pearce refuses, and Brenks [[retaliate]]s by kidnapping his younger sister, which forces Pearce to comply with Brenks' demands. With the help of Clara Lille, a member of the hacking syndicate DedSec, Pearce tracks down the second hacker\u2014gang leader and [[United States Armed Forces|Army]] veteran Delford 'Iraq' Wade\u2014and obtains a data sample from Wade's servers. He and Lille discover that Wade has [[blackmail|information on almost every citizen]] of Chicago, protecting his gang from the authorities.\n\nWhen they come across encrypted data beyond Lille's ability she tells Pearce to find Raymond 'T-Bone' Kenney, whose hacking caused the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]] which led to the implementation of the ctOS [[operating system]]. After meeting Pearce and completing several tasks for him, Kenney agrees to help decrypt the data. Pearce assaults Wade's compound, and downloads its server data. Wade confronts him, but Pearce kills him and leaves the compound. Another hacker, JB \"Defalt\" Markowicz, infiltrates their system, steals the information and deletes it from their servers. Markowicz leaves a recording that discloses Lille's involvement in locating Pearce and Brenks during the Merlaut job, which resulted in the death of Pearce's niece. Pearce angrily tells Lille to leave. When the authorities later confront Brenks about the loss of the server data, he tells them Pearce's identity. Pearce and Kenney find and take down Markowicz, retrieving the data.\n\nPearce discovers where his sister is being held, frees her, and they drive to nearby Pawnee for safety. Kenney finds the contractor who ordered the hit on Pearce that ended up killing Lena: Dermot \"Lucky\" Quinn, the [[Irish Mob]] boss who owns the Merlaut Hotel. Pearce confronts Quinn, shutting off his [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] by hacking it. The dying Quinn says that he ordered the hit because he thought Pearce was searching for secret video footage of Mayor Donovan Rushmore (with whom Quinn is associated), who accidentally murdered his secretary when she threatened to expose his dealings with Quinn. After Quinn dies, Pearce races to Lille (who is ambushed and gunned down by Brenks' men). Pearce uploads the video of Mayor Rushmore, driving him to commit suicide. He tries to find Brenks, who has unlocked ctOS (giving him access to the city). Pearce infects ctOS with a virus that shuts down the system, causing a citywide [[Power outage|blackout]]. He thus reaches Brenks, who is hiding in a lighthouse. Chin arrives, claiming to be on Brenks' payroll, but Pearce injures him and kills his former mentor. Chin calls Pearce one last time to tell him where Vega is kept; Pearce heads there, and decides his fate.\n\n===''Bad Blood''===\nA year after the main events of ''Watch Dogs'', in 2014, Kenney decides to leave Chicago after performing what he thought was his last hacking job: removing more data about him from the Blume servers and planting a fake trail to lead Blume away from him. However, he later learns that this isn't the case as he receives a call from former colleague Tobias Frewer, asking for help after he had been kidnapped by Fixers and stuffed in the trunk of their vehicle. After rescuing Frewer, Kenney realizes that if the Fixers knew where to find Frewer, they would eventually find him. He decides to get the Fixers off of his and Frewer's scents completely.\n\nKenney learns that Markowicz is the one behind the Fixers who have been looking for him. After learning where he is, Kenney manages to sneak inside the building and find mannequins representing the people who had died during the blackout he had caused eleven years ago. He later comes across an empty room with TV screens playing news footage of what had happened in 2003, causing an angry Kenney to smash the screens in, all while screaming that he had no intention of anyone dying during the blackout. Suddenly, a hanging mannequin with a Defalt mask comes falling from the ceiling as Kenney realizes that Markowicz's brother was one of the people who had died in the blackout, and that for Markowicz this whole thing was on a much more personal scale. Kenney manages to escape the building after killing the Fixers who were sent to kill him.\n\nWith Frewer's help, Kenney finds out where Markowicz is hiding, making his way there along with Frewer. Once inside, Kenney is stuck in a room and faced with not only Markowicz but also the other people whose loved ones were killed by the blackout. The room is then filled with gas; Markowicz's last attempt to kill Kenney. Luckily for Kenney, Frewer has his phone on him, which Kenney hacks in order to reroute the ventilation in the room he is in and the room Markowicz is in, killing Markowicz in the process. Managing to survive, Kenney decides to stay in Chicago, once Frewer agrees to help him in his fight against Blume, also hoping to recruit Pearce into their group.\n\n== Development ==\nBeginning in 2009 with ten people and expanding to over a thousand,<ref name=\"Dutton-May2013\" /><ref name=\"Pereira-May2014\" /><ref name=\"Hoad-Jun2013\" /> ''Watch Dogs'' was developed over five years (from prototype to finished game)<ref name=\"Nutt-Apr2014\" /> on a budget of about $68{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"Cook-Jan2014\" /> Before its announcement in 2012, the game had the [[working title]] of ''Nexus''.<ref name=\"Carle-Jul2014\" /> The initial sales pitch was the notion that one could control an entire city with the push of a button.<ref name=\"Nutt-Apr2014\" />\n\n''Watch Dogs'' runs on the [[game engine]] Disrupt, which developer [[Ubisoft Montreal]] created for it<ref name=\"Hillier-Feb2013\" /> (although it was originally intended for another game in the ''[[Driver (video game series)|Driver]]'' franchise).<ref name=\"Goldfarb-Dec2013\" /> According to producer Dominic Guay, Disrupt has three pillars: simulation of the environment and its contents, how the environment can be affected, and the connectivity of a seamless online experience.<ref name=\"Lewis-Jul2013\" /> Director Jonathan Morin said that the [[PlayStation 4]] technology allowed for better wind and water simulations and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\"Dutton-May2013\" />\n\nRegional colloquialisms specific to Chicago were added to give the game authenticity. The developer traveled to the city several times for field research, photos, recording audio, meeting people, and interviewing the [[Chicago Police Department]] to gain insight. Landmarks were designed to only resemble their real-life counterparts, because their artistic rights would have tripled the budget. Fictionalizing Chicago allowed them to fit several district themes on one map.<ref name=\"Hoad-Jun2013\" /><ref name=\"deMatos-May2014\" /> The city was chosen as the setting for its contradictory nature, with great wealth and abject poverty.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Jan2018\" /> Morin said that after it was chosen, Chicago became the most-surveilled city in America.<ref name=\"Griffiths-Sep2013\" />\n\nThe developers noted that character movements in games like ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' were the same in every situation, and attempted to rectify this in ''Watch Dogs'' to contextualize protagonist Aiden Pearce.<ref name=\"Dutton-May2013\" /> The in-game [[control system]] ctOS was based on the [[SCADA]] system, and the story was inspired by the cyber-attack by the computer worm [[Stuxnet]] on SCADA.<ref name=\"Starkey-Dec2013\" /> The developers consulted the cyber-security company [[Kaspersky Lab]] (which discovered the Stuxnet worm) about the hacking features to increase their authenticity.<ref name=\"Kietzmann-May2013\" /><ref name=\"Kushner-Feb2013\" /> To create hacking factions in the game (like DedSec), the developer was influenced by the [[hacktivist]] group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], state-sponsored hackers, and tales of [[corporate espionage]].<ref name=\"Starkey-Dec2013\" />\n\n''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' and ''[[Saints Row]]'' were studied to develop complex controls, so the core hacking mechanic was reduced to a single button.<ref name=\"Nutt-Apr2014\" /> When the game was delayed, ideas long set aside (like the hacking of a [[Headset (audio)|headset]]) could be implemented.<ref name=\"Steinman-Mar2014\" /> The score, by [[Brian Reitzell]], was released on vinyl and CD by [[Invada Records]] in partnership with Ubisoft Music on July 28, 2014.<ref name=\"Minsker-May2014\" /> Reitzell began composing by reading the script, concluding that [[krautrock]] would suit ''Watch Dogs''.<ref name=\"Carle-Jul2014\" /> The game was [[released to manufacturing]] in May 2014.<ref name=\"Pereira-May2014\" />\n\n==Release==\n[[Ubisoft]] announced ''Watch Dogs'' at its June 4, 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] press conference, confirming it for [[Microsoft Windows]], PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.<ref name=\"Goldfarb-Jun2012\" /> A QR code that appeared in the first gameplay demonstration as [[viral marketing]] led to a website called DotConnexion, which contained information about the in-game world.<ref name=\"Grubb-Jun2012\" /> PlayStation 4, [[Xbox One]], and [[Wii U]] were announced in early 2013 as additional platforms for ''Watch Dogs'', which was scheduled for release later that year.<ref name=\"Tach-Feb2013\" /><ref name=\"Hinkle-Feb2013\" /><ref name=\"Makuch-May2013\" /> Originally set to be released that November,<ref name=\"Karmali-Apr2013\" /> the developer delayed it until early 2014 to \"not compromise on quality\".<ref name=\"Makuch-Oct2013\" /> The final release date was set for May 27, 2014,<ref name=\"Makuch-Mar2014\" /> before its release for the Wii U on November 18 in North America, November 20 in Australia and New Zealand, and November 21 in Europe.<ref name=\"Kubba-Sep2014\" /><ref name=\"TradeMedia-Sep2014\" /> A free mobile [[application software|app]] was released for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, with ''Watch Dogs'' players connecting with console or PC users for two racing modes.<ref name=\"EddieMakuch-May2014\" />\n\nFour collector's editions were available,<ref name=\"Karmali-Apr2013\" /> and the [[GameStop]] pre-order version contained a poster by [[Alex Ross]].<ref name=\"Gaudiosi-May2013\" /> An [[eBook]], ''//n/Dark Clouds'' by [[John Shirley]] as a continuation of ''Watch Dogs'', was released in conjunction with the game.<ref name=\"Macy-Apr2014\" /> ''Watch Dogs'' was marketed with a live-action sequence directed by [[Devin Graham]] and a three-part documentary series by [[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]], ''Phreaked Out''.<ref name=\"Graser-May2014\" /> After promotional material was sent to Australian media as a [[safe]] containing the game and a voicemail explaining the delivery, the [[Sydney]] offices of [[Nine.com.au]] (unaware of the voicemail) called a [[bomb disposal]] unit when the safe beeped;

His favorite feature was the extra content, like collectibles and minigames.<ref name=\"Destruct-May2014\" /> ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead found the car-handling \"slick and intuitive\" and called the visuals \"dazzling\".<ref name=\"EuroG-May2014\" /> In ''[[Game Informer]]'', Jeff Marchiafava wrote that the hacking added meaning to the combat, the shooting mechanic \"make[s] full-scale firefights enjoyable\", and praised the stealth approach. He found that the variety of gameplay and environments in the campaign missions provided an \"entertaining\" experience.<ref name=\"GI-May2014\" /> Kevin VanOrd of ''[[GameSpot]]'' thought the game's primary strength was in combat and was grateful for the hacking component's contribution. VanOrd said that the story only flourished when it left behind the \"revenge-story cliches\", and he felt more attached to supporting characters than to Aiden Pearce. He praised the game's open world, particularly its extra content.<ref name=\"GSpot-May2014\" />\n\nAt ''[[GamesRadar]]'', Andy Hartup said he enjoyed the [[set piece]]s and individual missions: \"You'll enjoy ''Watch Dogs''{{'}} narrative in piecemeal, rather than as a whole\". He praised the setting's details (which he thought revealed \"the city's true beauty\"), and called the combat and hacking \"satisfying\".<ref name=\"GRadar-May2014\" /> Dan Stapleton of ''[[IGN]]'' praised the game's visuals and the open world's \"intricately detailed\" map. He also enjoyed the combat: \"The cover-based gunplay feels good\".<ref name=\"IGN-May2014\" /> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Christopher Livingston called the hacking the game's most positive feature; although he liked the stealth, his favorite approach to battle was gunplay.<ref name=\"PCGUS-May2014\" /> For ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Arthur Gies praised the combat's gunplay feature and wrote that it was \"aided by a good, functional third-person cover system, which helps with more than just shooting \u2014 it also allows for effective stealth\".<ref name=\"Poly-May2014\" /> Steven Burns of ''VideoGamer.com'' called the game \"undoubtedly enjoyable, but it won't linger long in the memory\".<ref name=\"VG-May2014\" />\n\nCarter was dissatisfied with the story, citing \"lifeless\" characters and calling the plot's events \"fairly predictable and cliched\"; the graphics were thought inferior to the game's marketing footage.<ref name=\"Destruct-May2014\" /> Whitehead criticized the hacking for resorting to \"tired old [[Pipe Mania|PipeMania]]-style\" puzzles and saw the story and main character as the game's weakest aspects, saying that the script avoided the moral dilemmas offered by its set-up.<ref name=\"EuroG-May2014\" /> Marchiafava agreed with Carter that the graphics were less impressive than they were in early videos, criticizing poor character design and the story for not living up to its gameplay.<ref name=\"GI-May2014\" /> Like Whitehead, VanOrd said that the predicament surrounding technology \"rarely reaches any conclusions or digs very deeply\".<ref name=\"GSpot-May2014\" /> Hartup criticized the main character, calling him \"a bit of a dullard\", and faulted the story for its reliance on \"unimaginative [[stereotype]]s\".<ref name=\"GRadar-May2014\" /> Jeff Gerstmann of ''[[Giant Bomb]]'' criticized the story and characters for a lack of organization, which he said made it difficult to care about the game.<ref name=\"GB-May2014\" /> Stapleton disliked the main character's lack of personality, and found the supporting cast more interesting.<ref name=\"IGN-May2014\" /> Livingston saw little to like in the story, and also preferred another character to Pearce.<ref name=\"PCGUS-May2014\" /> Gies wrote, \"After a promising (albeit well-trod) start, ''Watch Dogs''{{'}} plot struggles to remain coherent\", and likened the characters to caricatures.<ref name=\"Poly-May2014\" /> [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] wrote in ''[[New Statesman]]'' that the game \"has so many complex side missions and obligatory tasks that it becomes dull; it\u2019s humourlessly derivative of the open world of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''\".<ref name=\"watson20141222\">{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/12/date-destiny-tom-watson-best-and-worst-games-2014 |title=A date with Destiny: Tom Watson on the best and worst games of 2014 |last=Watson |first=Tom |date=2014-12-22 |magazine=New Statesman |access-date=13 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n''Watch Dogs'' was Ubisoft's most pre-ordered new [[intellectual property]] (IP), their second-highest pre-ordered title, the most pre-ordered game of the year (more than 800,000 copies), and the most pre-ordered game for the [[eighth generation of video game consoles]].

Set in a fictionalized version of [[Chicago]], the plot follows [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] Aiden Pearce's search for revenge after the killing of his niece. The game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]], and the world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. An [[online multiplayer]] mode allows up to eight players to engage in [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in 2009, and continued for over five years. Duties were shared by many of Ubisoft's studios worldwide, with more than a thousand people involved. The developers visited Chicago to conduct field research on the setting, and used regional language for authenticity. Hacking features were created in consultation with the cyber-security company [[Kaspersky Lab]], and the in-game [[control system]] was based on [[SCADA]]. The score was composed by [[Brian Reitzell]], who infused it with [[krautrock]].\n\nFollowing its announcement in June 2012, ''Watch Dogs'' was widely anticipated. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Wii U]] in 2014. The game received generally favorable reviews; praise was directed at the gameplay, mission and open world design, combat system, hacking elements and mission variety, while criticism was expressed concerning the discrepancy in graphics quality between marketing and the real game, along with the plot and protagonist being less well-received. ''Watch Dogs'' was a commercial success, breaking the record for the biggest first-day sales of a Ubisoft game and becoming the biggest launch of a new [[intellectual property]] in the United Kingdom at the time. The game has shipped over 10 million copies; its sequel, ''[[Watch Dogs 2]]'', was released in November 2016. A third game, ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]'', is in development.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Watch Dogs gameplay.png|thumb|left|Players can view descriptive backgrounds of pedestrians with the in-game smartphone.|alt=The player character walking through an urban environment, using his smartphone to scan the area.

Brenks tries to find the hacker, giving himself and Pearce away. Fearing for his family, Pearce drives them to safety in the guise of a surprise trip to the country. On the way, hitman Maurice Vega fires a gunshot which crashes the car; Pearce's niece Lena lapses into a coma and dies. 11 months later, Pearce tracks down Vega at a baseball stadium in the Parker Square district of Chicago. After a fruitless interrogation about Vega's [[Contract killing|contractor]], he leaves Vega in the hands of his partner, fixer Jordi Chin. While investigating, Brenks approaches Pearce with a request to find the other hacker from the Merlaut job. Pearce refuses, and Brenks [[retaliate]]s by kidnapping his younger sister, which forces Pearce to comply with Brenks' demands. With the help of Clara Lille, a member of the hacking syndicate DedSec, Pearce tracks down the second hacker\u2014gang leader and [[United States Armed Forces|Army]] veteran Delford 'Iraq' Wade\u2014and obtains a data sample from Wade's servers. He and Lille discover that Wade has [[blackmail|information on almost every citizen]] of Chicago, protecting his gang from the authorities.\n\nWhen they come across encrypted data beyond Lille's ability she tells Pearce to find Raymond 'T-Bone' Kenney, whose hacking caused the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]] which led to the implementation of the ctOS [[operating system]]. After meeting Pearce and completing several tasks for him, Kenney agrees to help decrypt the data. Pearce assaults Wade's compound, and downloads its server data. Wade confronts him, but Pearce kills him and leaves the compound. Another hacker, JB \"Defalt\" Markowicz, infiltrates their system, steals the information and deletes it from their servers. Markowicz leaves a recording that discloses Lille's involvement in locating Pearce and Brenks during the Merlaut job, which resulted in the death of Pearce's niece. Pearce angrily tells Lille to leave. When the authorities later confront Brenks about the loss of the server data, he tells them Pearce's identity. Pearce and Kenney find and take down Markowicz, retrieving the data.\n\nPearce discovers where his sister is being held, frees her, and they drive to nearby Pawnee for safety. Kenney finds the contractor who ordered the hit on Pearce that ended up killing Lena: Dermot \"Lucky\" Quinn, the [[Irish Mob]] boss who owns the Merlaut Hotel. Pearce confronts Quinn, shutting off his [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] by hacking it. The dying Quinn says that he ordered the hit because he thought Pearce was searching for secret video footage of Mayor Donovan Rushmore (with whom Quinn is associated), who accidentally murdered his secretary when she threatened to expose his dealings with Quinn. After Quinn dies, Pearce races to Lille (who is ambushed and gunned down by Brenks' men). Pearce uploads the video of Mayor Rushmore, driving him to commit suicide. He tries to find Brenks, who has unlocked ctOS (giving him access to the city). Pearce infects ctOS with a virus that shuts down the system, causing a citywide [[Power outage|blackout]]. He thus reaches Brenks, who is hiding in a lighthouse. Chin arrives, claiming to be on Brenks' payroll, but Pearce injures him and kills his former mentor. Chin calls Pearce one last time to tell him where Vega is kept; Pearce heads there, and decides his fate.\n\n===''Bad Blood''===\nA year after the main events of ''Watch Dogs'', in 2014, Kenney decides to leave Chicago after performing what he thought was his last hacking job: removing more data about him from the Blume servers and planting a fake trail to lead Blume away from him. However, he later learns that this isn't the case as he receives a call from former colleague Tobias Frewer, asking for help after he had been kidnapped by Fixers and stuffed in the trunk of their vehicle. After rescuing Frewer, Kenney realizes that if the Fixers knew where to find Frewer, they would eventually find him. He decides to get the Fixers off of his and Frewer's scents completely.\n\nKenney learns that Markowicz is the one behind the Fixers who have been looking for him. After learning where he is, Kenney manages to sneak inside the building and find mannequins representing the people who had died during the blackout he had caused eleven years ago. He later comes across an empty room with TV screens playing news footage of what had happened in 2003, causing an angry Kenney to smash the screens in, all while screaming that he had no intention of anyone dying during the blackout. Suddenly, a hanging mannequin with a Defalt mask comes falling from the ceiling as Kenney realizes that Markowicz's brother was one of the people who had died in the blackout, and that for Markowicz this whole thing was on a much more personal scale. Kenney manages to escape the building after killing the Fixers who were sent to kill him.\n\nWith Frewer's help, Kenney finds out where Markowicz is hiding, making his way there along with Frewer. Once inside, Kenney is stuck in a room and faced with not only Markowicz but also the other people whose loved ones were killed by the blackout. The room is then filled with gas; Markowicz's last attempt to kill Kenney. Luckily for Kenney, Frewer has his phone on him, which Kenney hacks in order to reroute the ventilation in the room he is in and the room Markowicz is in, killing Markowicz in the process. Managing to survive, Kenney decides to stay in Chicago, once Frewer agrees to help him in his fight against Blume, also hoping to recruit Pearce into their group.\n\n== Development ==\nBeginning in 2009 with ten people and expanding to over a thousand,<ref name=\"Dutton-May2013\" /><ref name=\"Pereira-May2014\" /><ref name=\"Hoad-Jun2013\" /> ''Watch Dogs'' was developed over five years (from prototype to finished game)<ref name=\"Nutt-Apr2014\" /> on a budget of about $68{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"Cook-Jan2014\" /> Before its announcement in 2012, the game had the [[working title]] of ''Nexus''.<ref name=\"Carle-Jul2014\" /> The initial sales pitch was the notion that one could control an entire city with the push of a button.<ref name=\"Nutt-Apr2014\" />\n\n''Watch Dogs'' runs on the [[game engine]] Disrupt, which developer [[Ubisoft Montreal]] created for it<ref name=\"Hillier-Feb2013\" /> (although it was originally intended for another game in the ''[[Driver (video game series)|Driver]]'' franchise).<ref name=\"Goldfarb-Dec2013\" /> According to producer Dominic Guay, Disrupt has three pillars: simulation of the environment and its contents, how the environment can be affected, and the connectivity of a seamless online experience.<ref name=\"Lewis-Jul2013\" /> Director Jonathan Morin said that the [[PlayStation 4]] technology allowed for better wind and water simulations and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\"Dutton-May2013\" />\n\nRegional colloquialisms specific to Chicago were added to give the game authenticity. The developer traveled to the city several times for field research, photos, recording audio, meeting people, and interviewing the [[Chicago Police Department]] to gain insight. Landmarks were designed to only resemble their real-life counterparts, because their artistic rights would have tripled the budget. Fictionalizing Chicago allowed them to fit several district themes on one map.<ref name=\"Hoad-Jun2013\" /><ref name=\"deMatos-May2014\" /> The city was chosen as the setting for its contradictory nature, with great wealth and abject poverty.<ref name=\"GamesTM-Jan2018\" /> Morin said that after it was chosen, Chicago became the most-surveilled city in America.<ref name=\"Griffiths-Sep2013\" />\n\nThe developers noted that character movements in games like ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' were the same in every situation, and attempted to rectify this in ''Watch Dogs'' to contextualize protagonist Aiden Pearce.<ref name=\"Dutton-May2013\" /> The in-game [[control system]] ctOS was based on the [[SCADA]] system, and the story was inspired by the cyber-attack by the computer worm [[Stuxnet]] on SCADA.<ref name=\"Starkey-Dec2013\" /> The developers consulted the cyber-security company [[Kaspersky Lab]] (which discovered the Stuxnet worm) about the hacking features to increase their authenticity.<ref name=\"Kietzmann-May2013\" /><ref name=\"Kushner-Feb2013\" /> To create hacking factions in the game (like DedSec), the developer was influenced by the [[hacktivist]] group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], state-sponsored hackers, and tales of [[corporate espionage]].<ref name=\"Starkey-Dec2013\" />\n\n''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' and ''[[Saints Row]]'' were studied to develop complex controls, so the core hacking mechanic was reduced to a single button.<ref name=\"Nutt-Apr2014\" /> When the game was delayed, ideas long set aside (like the hacking of a [[Headset (audio)|headset]]) could be implemented.<ref name=\"Steinman-Mar2014\" /> The score, by [[Brian Reitzell]], was released on vinyl and CD by [[Invada Records]] in partnership with Ubisoft Music on July 28, 2014.<ref name=\"Minsker-May2014\" /> Reitzell began composing by reading the script, concluding that [[krautrock]] would suit ''Watch Dogs''.<ref name=\"Carle-Jul2014\" /> The game was [[released to manufacturing]] in May 2014.<ref name=\"Pereira-May2014\" />\n\n==Release==\n[[Ubisoft]] announced ''Watch Dogs'' at its June 4, 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] press conference, confirming it for [[Microsoft Windows]], PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.<ref name=\"Goldfarb-Jun2012\" /> A QR code that appeared in the first gameplay demonstration as [[viral marketing]] led to a website called DotConnexion, which contained information about the in-game world.<ref name=\"Grubb-Jun2012\" /> PlayStation 4, [[Xbox One]], and [[Wii U]] were announced in early 2013 as additional platforms for ''Watch Dogs'', which was scheduled for release later that year.<ref name=\"Tach-Feb2013\" /><ref name=\"Hinkle-Feb2013\" /><ref name=\"Makuch-May2013\" /> Originally set to be released that November,<ref name=\"Karmali-Apr2013\" /> the developer delayed it until early 2014 to \"not compromise on quality\".<ref name=\"Makuch-Oct2013\" /> The final release date was set for May 27, 2014,<ref name=\"Makuch-Mar2014\" /> before its release for the Wii U on November 18 in North America, November 20 in Australia and New Zealand, and November 21 in Europe.<ref name=\"Kubba-Sep2014\" /><ref name=\"TradeMedia-Sep2014\" /> A free mobile [[application software|app]] was released for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, with ''Watch Dogs'' players connecting with console or PC users for two racing modes.<ref name=\"EddieMakuch-May2014\" />\n\nFour collector's editions were available,<ref name=\"Karmali-Apr2013\" /> and the [[GameStop]] pre-order version contained a poster by [[Alex Ross]].<ref name=\"Gaudiosi-May2013\" /> An [[eBook]], ''//n/Dark Clouds'' by [[John Shirley]] as a continuation of ''Watch Dogs'', was released in conjunction with the game.<ref name=\"Macy-Apr2014\" /> ''Watch Dogs'' was marketed with a live-action sequence directed by [[Devin Graham]] and a three-part documentary series by [[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]], ''Phreaked Out''.<ref name=\"Graser-May2014\" /> After promotional material was sent to Australian media as a [[safe]] containing the game and a voicemail explaining the delivery, the [[Sydney]] offices of [[Nine.com.au]] (unaware of the voicemail) called a [[bomb disposal]] unit when the safe beeped; Ubisoft apologized to the staff.<ref name=\"Makuch-May2014\" /> [[Downloadable content]] (''Bad Blood'', with playable character Raymond Kenney) was released in September 2014.<ref name=\"Steinman-Sep2014\" /><ref name=\"Krupa-Sep2014\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 77/100<ref name=\"MC-PC\" /> <br /> (PS4) 80/100<ref name=\"MC-PS4\" /> <br /> (XONE) 78/100<ref name=\"MC-XONE\" /> <br /> (WIIU) 62/100<ref name=\"MC-WIIU\" />\n| Destruct = 8/10<ref name=\"Destruct-May2014\" />\n| EuroG = 7/10<ref name=\"EuroG-May2014\" />\n| GI = 8.5/10<ref name=\"GI-May2014\" />\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=\"GSpot-May2014\" />\n| GRadar = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"GRadar-May2014\" />\n| GB = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"GB-May2014\" />\n| IGN = 8.4/10<ref name=\"IGN-May2014\" />\n| PCGUS = 8.7/10<ref name=\"PCGUS-May2014\" />\n| Poly = 8/10<ref name=\"Poly-May2014\" />\n| VG = 7/10<ref name=\"VG-May2014\" />\n}}\n''Watch Dogs''{{'}} reveal at [[E3 2012]] generated favorable reception from critics at [[E3 2012]].<ref name=\"Kollar-Jun2012\" /><ref name=\"North-Jun2012\" /> According to leaked marketing material, it received over eighty E3 awards and nominations and [[G4tv]] called it a \"truly next-gen adventure\".<ref name=\"Schreier-Feb2013\" /> At [[E3 2013]], the game received over fifty awards and nominations.<ref name=\"Lewis-Jun2013\" /> The following year, Ubisoft was accused of graphical [[downgrading]] after a [[NeoGAF]] forum post compared its 2012 visuals to 2014 video footage.<ref name=\"GameSpot-Mar2014\" />\n\nAccording to Ubisoft researcher Thomas Geffroyd, studies and quantitative analysis indicated that about sixty percent of gamers changed their view of technology after playing ''Watch Dogs''.<ref name=\"Takahashi-Oct2016\" /> Chris Carter of ''[[Destructoid]]'' liked the virtual rendition of Chicago and the detail of non-player characters, concluding that the gameplay was fun. His favorite feature was the extra content, like collectibles and minigames.<ref name=\"Destruct-May2014\" /> ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead found the car-handling \"slick and intuitive\" and called the visuals \"dazzling\".<ref name=\"EuroG-May2014\" /> In ''[[Game Informer]]'', Jeff Marchiafava wrote that the hacking added meaning to the combat, the shooting mechanic \"make[s] full-scale firefights enjoyable\", and praised the stealth approach. He found that the variety of gameplay and environments in the campaign missions provided an \"entertaining\" experience.<ref name=\"GI-May2014\" /> Kevin VanOrd of ''[[GameSpot]]'' thought the game's primary strength was in combat and was grateful for the hacking component's contribution. VanOrd said that the story only flourished when it left behind the \"revenge-story cliches\", and he felt more attached to supporting characters than to Aiden Pearce. He praised the game's open world, particularly its extra content.<ref name=\"GSpot-May2014\" />\n\nAt ''[[GamesRadar]]'', Andy Hartup said he enjoyed the [[set piece]]s and individual missions: \"You'll enjoy ''Watch Dogs''{{'}} narrative in piecemeal, rather than as a whole\". He praised the setting's details (which he thought revealed \"the city's true beauty\"), and called the combat and hacking \"satisfying\".<ref name=\"GRadar-May2014\" /> Dan Stapleton of ''[[IGN]]'' praised the game's visuals and the open world's \"intricately detailed\" map. He also enjoyed the combat: \"The cover-based gunplay feels good\".<ref name=\"IGN-May2014\" /> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Christopher Livingston called the hacking the game's most positive feature; although he liked the stealth, his favorite approach to battle was gunplay.<ref name=\"PCGUS-May2014\" /> For ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Arthur Gies praised the combat's gunplay feature and wrote that it was \"aided by a good, functional third-person cover system, which helps with more than just shooting \u2014 it also allows for effective stealth\".<ref name=\"Poly-May2014\" /> Steven Burns of ''VideoGamer.com'' called the game \"undoubtedly enjoyable, but it won't linger long in the memory\".<ref name=\"VG-May2014\" />\n\nCarter was dissatisfied with the story, citing \"lifeless\" characters and calling the plot's events \"fairly predictable and cliched\"; the graphics were thought inferior to the game's marketing footage.<ref name=\"Destruct-May2014\" /> Whitehead criticized the hacking for resorting to \"tired old [[Pipe Mania|PipeMania]]-style\" puzzles and saw the story and main character as the game's weakest aspects, saying that the script avoided the moral dilemmas offered by its set-up.<ref name=\"EuroG-May2014\" /> Marchiafava agreed with Carter that the graphics were less impressive than they were in early videos, criticizing poor character design and the story for not living up to its gameplay.<ref name=\"GI-May2014\" /> Like Whitehead, VanOrd said that the predicament surrounding technology \"rarely reaches any conclusions or digs very deeply\".<ref name=\"GSpot-May2014\" /> Hartup criticized the main character, calling him \"a bit of a dullard\", and faulted the story for its reliance on \"unimaginative [[stereotype]]s\".<ref name=\"GRadar-May2014\" /> Jeff Gerstmann of ''[[Giant Bomb]]'' criticized the story and characters for a lack of organization, which he said made it difficult to care about the game.<ref name=\"GB-May2014\" /> Stapleton disliked the main character's lack of personality, and found the supporting cast more interesting.<ref name=\"IGN-May2014\" /> Livingston saw little to like in the story, and also preferred another character to Pearce.<ref name=\"PCGUS-May2014\" /> Gies wrote, \"After a promising (albeit well-trod) start, ''Watch Dogs''{{'}} plot struggles to remain coherent\", and likened the characters to caricatures.<ref name=\"Poly-May2014\" /> [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] wrote in ''[[New Statesman]]'' that the game \"has so many complex side missions and obligatory tasks that it becomes dull; it\u2019s humourlessly derivative of the open world of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''\".<ref name=\"watson20141222\">{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/12/date-destiny-tom-watson-best-and-worst-games-2014 |title=A date with Destiny: Tom Watson on the best and worst games of 2014 |last=Watson |first=Tom |date=2014-12-22 |magazine=New Statesman |access-date=13 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n''Watch Dogs'' was Ubisoft's most pre-ordered new [[intellectual property]] (IP), their second-highest pre-ordered title, the most pre-ordered game of the year (more than 800,000 copies), and the most pre-ordered game for the [[eighth generation of video game consoles]].
