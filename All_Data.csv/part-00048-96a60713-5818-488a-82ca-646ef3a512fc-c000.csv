The '''Cape Lookout Lighthouse''' is a 163-foot high lighthouse located on the Southern [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]]. It flashes every 15 seconds and is visible at least 12 miles out to sea and up to 19 miles. The Cape Lookout Light is one of the very few [[lighthouse]]s that operate during the day.

It is the second lighthouse that has stood at [[Cape Lookout (North Carolina)|this location]], and is nearly identical to the [[Bodie Island Lighthouse]], which has horizontal stripes, and the [[Currituck Beach Lighthouse]], which is unpainted red brick. The more famous [[Cape Hatteras Lighthouse]] bears spiral stripes.

The present lighthouse was completed and lit on November 1, 1859 at a cost of $45,000, which Congress approved in 1857. This lighthouse used a first-order [[Fresnel lens]] which allowed the light to shine brighter. On May 20, 1861, North Carolina joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and all of the lenses were removed from the coastal lighthouses and navigational beacons to prevent Union forces from using the lights to navigate the coast.  [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops captured the nearby Beaufort and Morehead City in 1862 and, by the end of the next year, a third-order [[Fresnel lens]] was installed in the Cape Lookout lighthouse.  On April 2, 1864, a small group of Confederate troops under the command of L.C. Harland snuck through Union lines and out to the lighthouse. Their attempt to blow up the lighthouse was unsuccessful, however the explosion did destroy the lighthouse oil supply and damaged the iron stairs.  With iron unavailable during the war, the damaged sections of the stairs were replaced by wooden ones.  The Fresnel lenses from all the North Carolina lighthouses were found in 1865 in Raleigh, NC.

'''George Mathews Jr.''' (September 30, 1774 – November 14, 1836), was a Judge of the Superior Courts of the [[Territory of Mississippi]] and the [[Territory of Orleans]], and Presiding Judge of the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] from 1813 until his death in 1836. His ruling in ''[[Marie Louise v. Marot]]'' was cited as precedent by dissenting [[U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] [[John McLean]] in the 1856 [[Landmark decisions in the United States|landmark]] ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case.

==Early life==
{{See also|Mathews family}}
Mathews was born in [[Augusta County, Virginia]], on September 30, 1774, the son of a planter and [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] officer, [[George Mathews (Georgia)|George Mathews]] and his wife, Polly. The elder Mathews would later serve twice as [[Governor of Georgia]].  In 1785, the elder Mathews moved himself and his whole family to [[Wilkes County, Georgia]], to land that today is in [[Oglethorpe County, Georgia|Oglethorpe County]].

Mathews returned to Virginia for his education at Liberty Hall Academy (which later became [[Washington and Lee University]]).  He originally set out to become a physician but was persuaded by his father to [[Reading law|study law]] under his brother, John Mathews, in [[Augusta, Georgia]].<ref name = \"Mazureau's Oration\">{{cite journal| last = Dart| first = Henry P.  | title = Mazureau's Oration on Mathews| journal = Louisiana Historical Quarterly| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 149| publisher = Louisiana Historical Society | location = New Orleans, Louisiana | date = September 22, 1922| url = https://archive.org/stream/louisianahistor02unkngoog/louisianahistor02unkngoog_djvu.txt   | accessdate = 2009-05-18}}</ref> He married Harriet Flowers in 1809 and they resided near [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]], at her family's [[Butler Greenwood Plantation]].<ref>National Park Service: ''Butler-Greenwood Plantation'', http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/louisiana/but.htm, retrieved 27 Aug 2009.</ref>

George and Harriett Mathews raised indigo, cotton, sugar cane, and corn on the [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], shipping the crops from their own dock on Bayou Sara and extending their land holdings to include a sugar plantation in [[Lafourche Parish]] that, according to Lewis Gray's figures, placed them among the top 9% of sugar planters in the state in the 1850s.<ref>{{Citation

==Career on the bench==
In 1804 Mathews was appointed by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to be judge of the Superior Court of the newly created [[Territory of Mississippi]].  He served for two years on that court before being appointed judge of the Superior Court for the [[Territory of Orleans]] in 1806.

When Louisiana became a state in 1813, the territorial courts were replaced by a new Supreme Court.  Mathews was appointed by Governor [[William C.C. Claiborne]] as judge of that new high court on February 23, 1813. He served alongside Judges [[Dominic Augustin Hall]], [[Pierre Derbigny]] and [[Francois Xavier Martin]].<ref name=\"Mazureau's Oration\"/>  He reputedly learned both [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as much of the law of the State of Louisiana was rooted in the traditions of the land's previous colonial overlords and many lawyers spoke one of the two languages but not English.<ref name=\"Mazureau's Oration\"/>
[[File:JohnMcLean.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|[[Us supreme court justices|US Supreme Court Justice]] [[John McLean]], who relied on Mathews' precedent for his dissent from the Court ruling in [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] ]]

=== ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' precedent ===
In the early 1830s, a Louisiana family went to France with their young slave girl, Josephine Louise. When the family returned home, the slave girl's mother sued to obtain a declaration of immediate emancipation as a result of the girl being transported to a country that did not recognize the institution of slavery. The 1835 case, ''[[Marie Louise v. Marot]]'' (1836) was heard by the Louisiana state district court and appealed to the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]]. The Court held that a slave who is taken to a territory prohibitive of slavery cannot be again reduced to slavery on returning to a territory allowing of slavery. Mathews, speaking for the court, stated that \"[b]eing free for one moment...it was not in the power of her former owner to reduce her again to slavery.\"<ref name=Friedman>\"Champion of Civil Rights: Judge John Minor Wisdom\". Southern Biography Series: LSU Press, 2009, p 24. https://books.google.com/books?id=atfIkRdwQ9kC&pg=PA24&dq=%22louisiana%22+%22george+mathews%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%20%22george%20mathews%22&f=false Retrieved December 4, 2012.</ref>

21 years later, his precedent was relied upon by [[US Supreme Court]] Justice [[John McLean (US Associate Justice)|John McLean]], who dissented from the court's [[Dred Scott v.

'''George Mathews Jr.''' (September 30, 1774 – November 14, 1836), was a Judge of the Superior Courts of the [[Territory of Mississippi]] and the [[Territory of Orleans]], and Presiding Judge of the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] from 1813 until his death in 1836. His ruling in ''[[Marie Louise v. Marot]]'' was cited as precedent by dissenting [[U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] [[John McLean]] in the 1856 [[Landmark decisions in the United States|landmark]] ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case.

==Early life==
Mathews was born in [[Augusta County, Virginia]], on September 30, 1774, the son of a planter and [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] officer, [[George Mathews (Georgia)|George Mathews]] and his wife, Polly. The elder Mathews would later serve twice as [[Governor of Georgia]].  In 1785, the elder Mathews moved himself and his whole family to [[Wilkes County, Georgia]], to land that today is in [[Oglethorpe County, Georgia|Oglethorpe County]].

Mathews returned to Virginia for his education at Liberty Hall Academy (which later became [[Washington and Lee University]]).  He originally set out to become a physician but was persuaded by his father to [[Reading law|study law]] under his brother, John Mathews, in [[Augusta, Georgia]].<ref name = \"Mazureau's Oration\">{{cite journal| last = Dart| first = Henry P.  | title = Mazureau's Oration on Mathews| journal = Louisiana Historical Quarterly| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 149| publisher = Louisiana Historical Society | location = New Orleans, Louisiana | date = September 22, 1922| url = https://archive.org/stream/louisianahistor02unkngoog/louisianahistor02unkngoog_djvu.txt   | accessdate = 2009-05-18}}</ref> He married Harriet Flowers in 1809 and they resided near [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]], at her family's [[Butler Greenwood Plantation]].<ref>National Park Service: ''Butler-Greenwood Plantation'', http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/louisiana/but.htm, retrieved 27 Aug 2009.</ref>

George and Harriett Mathews raised indigo, cotton, sugar cane, and corn on the [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], shipping the crops from their own dock on Bayou Sara and extending their land holdings to include a sugar plantation in [[Lafourche Parish]] that, according to Lewis Gray's figures, placed them among the top 9% of sugar planters in the state in the 1850s.<ref>{{Citation

==Career on the bench==
In 1804 Mathews was appointed by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to be judge of the Superior Court of the newly created [[Territory of Mississippi]].  He served for two years on that court before being appointed judge of the Superior Court for the [[Territory of Orleans]] in 1806.

When Louisiana became a state in 1813, the territorial courts were replaced by a new Supreme Court.  Mathews was appointed by Governor [[William C.C. Claiborne]] as judge of that new high court on February 23, 1813. He served alongside Judges [[Dominic Augustin Hall]], [[Pierre Derbigny]] and [[Francois Xavier Martin]].<ref name=\"Mazureau's Oration\"/>  He reputedly learned both [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as much of the law of the State of Louisiana was rooted in the traditions of the land's previous colonial overlords and many lawyers spoke one of the two languages but not English.<ref name=\"Mazureau's Oration\"/>
[[File:JohnMcLean.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|[[Us supreme court justices|US Supreme Court Justice]] [[John McLean]], who relied on Mathews' precedent for his dissent from the Court ruling in [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] ]]

=== ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' precedent ===
In the early 1830s, a Louisiana family went to France with their young slave girl, Josephine Louise. When the family returned home, the slave girl's mother sued to obtain a declaration of immediate emancipation as a result of the girl being transported to a country that did not recognize the institution of slavery. The 1835 case, ''[[Marie Louise v. Marot]]'' (1836) was heard by the Louisiana state district court and appealed to the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]]. The Court held that a slave who is taken to a territory prohibitive of slavery cannot be again reduced to slavery on returning to a territory allowing of slavery. Mathews, speaking for the court, stated that \"[b]eing free for one moment...it was not in the power of her former owner to reduce her again to slavery.\"<ref name=Friedman>\"Champion of Civil Rights: Judge John Minor Wisdom\".

21 years later, his precedent was relied upon by [[US Supreme Court]] Justice [[John McLean (US Associate Justice)|John McLean]], who dissented from the court's [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott ruling]] that a slave was a piece of property that could by transported by his owner from a Southern state into a territory that forbade slavery without losing his slave status.<ref name=Friedman /> Six of 8 justices did not abide by the precedent in what has been considered the worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"Finkelman, Paul 2007\">Finkelman, Paul.

'''Dalton Ichiro Tanonaka''' (born June 13, 1954) is an American television executive. He has spent most of his career in Asia, receiving several international and U.S. awards for his journalism work. Tanonaka is also known for his community service, providing scholarships to deserving students and speaking  at schools and universities.<ref>{{harvnb|Tanonaka|1993}}, {{harvnb|Tanonaka|1994}}, {{harvnb|Tanonaka|1996}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Tanonaka was born in Kapaau, [[Kohala, Hawaii]], not far from the original statue of [[King Kamehameha I]]. He was raised in Honolulu on the island of Oahu, attending public schools through his graduation from [[Kalani High School]], where he played football and soccer. After working as a tour escort to \"grow up\" and save money, Tanonaka graduated from Mesa College (now [[Colorado Mesa University]]) in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], in 1976 with an Associate in Arts degree, and [[Northern Illinois University]] in [[DeKalb, Illinois]], in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism.

==Career==
After TV and newspaper jobs at the ABC and NBC affiliates in Honolulu and the ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'', Tanonaka was recruited by Japan's public broadcaster [[NHK]] in 1990. He helped launch and was the anchor of \"Japan Business Today\", an internationally distributed daily program from Tokyo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2001/06/23/people/dalton-tanonaka/|title=Dalton Tanonaka|first=Vivienne|last=Kenrick|date=Jun 23, 2001|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref>
After the NHK project ended in 1994, Tanonaka joined the launch team of the U.S. business channel [[CNBC Asia|CNBC in Asia]]. From regional headquarters in Chai Wan, Hong Kong, Tanonaka anchored daily news and feature programs including \"The NBC Asia Evening News\" and \"Money, Money, Money\".

When the operations of CNBC Asia was moved to Singapore in 1998, Tanonaka returned to Hawaii for a brief period. He was appointed Honolulu's director of economic development, where he served until resuming his journalism career in 1999. [[CNN International]] recruited him to its Asia headquarters in Hong Kong, where he anchored programs including \"BizAsia\", \"Asia Tonight\", and \"TalkAsia\".

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the U.S., Tanonaka asked to be released from his CNN contract and returned to Hawaii to make an attempt at public service. In [[Hawaii gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]], he ran unsuccessfully for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii]], finishing second behind former [[Hawaii State Circuit Courts|Circuit Court]] judge [[Duke Aiona]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20130821071826/http://thegardenisland.com/news/dalton-tanonaka-running-for-republican-lt-governor-seat/article_fc8c41bf-c449-56d0-ad8e-3c18f185a32b.html ]</ref> Following a brief period as president of the [[Pacific Basin Economic Council]] (PBEC) based in Honolulu, Tanonaka ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2004.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/candidates/295076/</ref> During this campaign, allegations of illegalities were made by political opponents. Tanonaka cooperated with authorities, but after agreeing to plead guilty to technical violations, U.S. District Judge [[Helen Gillmor]] ordered him to spend 90 days in the [[Honolulu Federal Detention Center]] to \"send a message\" to the public.

In 2006, Tanonaka joined Indonesia's first 24-hour news channel [[Metro TV (Indonesia)|MetroTV]] in Jakarta.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130821071818/http://asiadreams.com/edisi/january-february/asia-inspiration/dalton-tanonaka.html ]</ref>  He was tasked with creating a new international-standard English program for global distribution. \"Indonesia Now\" debuted in September 2006, and is seen on international networks such as Japan's NHK as well as live-streamed on the Internet at www.metrotvnews.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotvnews.com/indonesianow-beta/ |title=Indonesia Now Beta  |accessdate=August 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222145044/http://www.metrotvnews.com/indonesianow-beta/ |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}</ref>

In 2010, Tanonaka teamed up with actress Rahayu \"Sara\" Saraswati for the weekly dialogue program \"TalkIndonesia\".  In 2011, he created \"ASEAN Today\", a monthly program done in partnership with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) Secretariat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asean.org/news/asean-secretariat-news/item/asean-today-tv-program-debuts-globally |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730084014/http://www.asean.org/news/asean-secretariat-news/item/asean-today-tv-program-debuts-globally |archive-date=2013-07-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tanonaka was a regular columnist in the ''[[Jakarta Post]]'' \"Weekender\" magazine from its debut in 2007, moving to the ''[[Jakarta Globe]]'' in 2010.<ref>http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/dalton-tanonaka-despite-the-frustrations-35-things-to-love-about-life-in-indonesia/</ref> In January 2014, Tanonaka became CEO of \"[[The Indonesia Channel]],\" the country's first 24-hour all-English channel for global distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindonesiachannel.com/|title=The Indonesia Channel|website=www.theindonesiachannel.com|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref>

==Humanitarian work and activism==
Training professional journalists has been a regular part of Tanonaka's career. Under a program coordinated by the Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD), he has travelled to Iran, Pakistan and Mauritius to hold workshops in broadcasting standards and skills. The Tanonaka International Journalism Scholarship was named for Tanonaka's father Thomas, and given to deserving university students in Indonesia. Winners were handed cash grants and received living stipends in cities such as [[Yogyakarta]], [[Lampung]], and Jakarta, the most recent in June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cce-indonesia.org/Tanonaka_Scholarship.html|title=cce-indonesia.org|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref> As a member of the [[Asian American Journalists Association]] (AAJA),{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Tanonaka created and initially endowed the AAJA Minoru Yasui Memorial Scholarship in memory of [[Minoru Yasui|the late civil rights advocate]]. It was first awarded in 1993 to promising male broadcast students to support and motivate interest in the field.

Tanonaka has also been involved in a variety of other charitable activities in Indonesia. In December 2006, he was the co-creator of the \"Beat The Bird Flu Concert\" in Jakarta, Indonesia, to spotlight prevention measures of the deadly virus. He secured MetroTV's commitment in airing public service announcements and a concert special. An ongoing environmental disaster in [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo, East Java]] prompted Tanonaka and friend Ron Mullers to hold a fund-raising event in 2007 for victims of [[Sidoarjo mud flow|an unstoppable mudflow]] that wiped out homes and businesses. After raising nearly $10,000 with the participation of Tanonaka's rock'n'roll band, the men went personally to the mudflow site to personally hand out packets of money directly to affected residents. Finally, to develop and promote Indonesian artists, Tanonaka created \"The Mister Moonlight Show\" in 2009, a live music event with Indonesian musicians and singers for five-star hotel venues. It is now in its fourth year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hotjakartaevent/|title=THE MISTER MOONLIGHT SHOW|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref>

Tanonaka and Mullers led a community drive to erect a statue of a young Barack Obama in a park near the U.S. president's childhood home in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was unveiled in December 2009, and moved to its permanent location at Obama's elementary school in February 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8405314.stm|title=Indonesia unveils statue of Obama|date=Dec 10, 2009|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

He was raised in Honolulu on the island of Oahu, attending public schools through his graduation from [[Kalani High School]], where he played football and soccer. After working as a tour escort to \"grow up\" and save money, Tanonaka graduated from Mesa College (now [[Colorado Mesa University]]) in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], in 1976 with an Associate in Arts degree, and [[Northern Illinois University]] in [[DeKalb, Illinois]], in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism.

==Career==
After TV and newspaper jobs at the ABC and NBC affiliates in Honolulu and the ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'', Tanonaka was recruited by Japan's public broadcaster [[NHK]] in 1990. He helped launch and was the anchor of \"Japan Business Today\", an internationally distributed daily program from Tokyo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2001/06/23/people/dalton-tanonaka/|title=Dalton Tanonaka|first=Vivienne|last=Kenrick|date=Jun 23, 2001|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref>
After the NHK project ended in 1994, Tanonaka joined the launch team of the U.S. business channel [[CNBC Asia|CNBC in Asia]]. From regional headquarters in Chai Wan, Hong Kong, Tanonaka anchored daily news and feature programs including \"The NBC Asia Evening News\" and \"Money, Money, Money\".

When the operations of CNBC Asia was moved to Singapore in 1998, Tanonaka returned to Hawaii for a brief period. He was appointed Honolulu's director of economic development, where he served until resuming his journalism career in 1999. [[CNN International]] recruited him to its Asia headquarters in Hong Kong, where he anchored programs including \"BizAsia\", \"Asia Tonight\", and \"TalkAsia\".

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the U.S., Tanonaka asked to be released from his CNN contract and returned to Hawaii to make an attempt at public service. In [[Hawaii gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]], he ran unsuccessfully for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii]], finishing second behind former [[Hawaii State Circuit Courts|Circuit Court]] judge [[Duke Aiona]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20130821071826/http://thegardenisland.com/news/dalton-tanonaka-running-for-republican-lt-governor-seat/article_fc8c41bf-c449-56d0-ad8e-3c18f185a32b.html ]</ref> Following a brief period as president of the [[Pacific Basin Economic Council]] (PBEC) based in Honolulu, Tanonaka ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2004.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/candidates/295076/</ref> During this campaign, allegations of illegalities were made by political opponents. Tanonaka cooperated with authorities, but after agreeing to plead guilty to technical violations, U.S. District Judge [[Helen Gillmor]] ordered him to spend 90 days in the [[Honolulu Federal Detention Center]] to \"send a message\" to the public.

In 2006, Tanonaka joined Indonesia's first 24-hour news channel [[Metro TV (Indonesia)|MetroTV]] in Jakarta.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130821071818/http://asiadreams.com/edisi/january-february/asia-inspiration/dalton-tanonaka.html ]</ref>  He was tasked with creating a new international-standard English program for global distribution. \"Indonesia Now\" debuted in September 2006, and is seen on international networks such as Japan's NHK as well as live-streamed on the Internet at www.metrotvnews.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotvnews.com/indonesianow-beta/ |title=Indonesia Now Beta  |accessdate=August 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222145044/http://www.metrotvnews.com/indonesianow-beta/ |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}</ref>

In 2010, Tanonaka teamed up with actress Rahayu \"Sara\" Saraswati for the weekly dialogue program \"TalkIndonesia\".  In 2011, he created \"ASEAN Today\", a monthly program done in partnership with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) Secretariat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asean.org/news/asean-secretariat-news/item/asean-today-tv-program-debuts-globally |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730084014/http://www.asean.org/news/asean-secretariat-news/item/asean-today-tv-program-debuts-globally |archive-date=2013-07-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tanonaka was a regular columnist in the ''[[Jakarta Post]]'' \"Weekender\" magazine from its debut in 2007, moving to the ''[[Jakarta Globe]]'' in 2010.<ref>http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/dalton-tanonaka-despite-the-frustrations-35-things-to-love-about-life-in-indonesia/</ref> In January 2014, Tanonaka became CEO of \"[[The Indonesia Channel]],\" the country's first 24-hour all-English channel for global distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindonesiachannel.com/|title=The Indonesia Channel|website=www.theindonesiachannel.com|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref>

==Humanitarian work and activism==
Training professional journalists has been a regular part of Tanonaka's career. Under a program coordinated by the Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD), he has travelled to Iran, Pakistan and Mauritius to hold workshops in broadcasting standards and skills. The Tanonaka International Journalism Scholarship was named for Tanonaka's father Thomas, and given to deserving university students in Indonesia. Winners were handed cash grants and received living stipends in cities such as [[Yogyakarta]], [[Lampung]], and Jakarta, the most recent in June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cce-indonesia.org/Tanonaka_Scholarship.html|title=cce-indonesia.org|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref> As a member of the [[Asian American Journalists Association]] (AAJA),{{cn|date=February 2020}} Tanonaka created and initially endowed the AAJA Minoru Yasui Memorial Scholarship in memory of [[Minoru Yasui|the late civil rights advocate]]. It was first awarded in 1993 to promising male broadcast students to support and motivate interest in the field.

Tanonaka has also been involved in a variety of other charitable activities in Indonesia. In December 2006, he was the co-creator of the \"Beat The Bird Flu Concert\" in Jakarta, Indonesia, to spotlight prevention measures of the deadly virus. He secured MetroTV's commitment in airing public service announcements and a concert special. An ongoing environmental disaster in [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo, East Java]] prompted Tanonaka and friend Ron Mullers to hold a fund-raising event in 2007 for victims of [[Sidoarjo mud flow|an unstoppable mudflow]] that wiped out homes and businesses. After raising nearly $10,000 with the participation of Tanonaka's rock'n'roll band, the men went personally to the mudflow site to personally hand out packets of money directly to affected residents. Finally, to develop and promote Indonesian artists, Tanonaka created \"The Mister Moonlight Show\" in 2009, a live music event with Indonesian musicians and singers for five-star hotel venues. It is now in its fourth year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hotjakartaevent/|title=THE MISTER MOONLIGHT SHOW|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019}}</ref>

Tanonaka and Mullers led a community drive to erect a statue of a young Barack Obama in a park near the U.S. president's childhood home in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was unveiled in December 2009, and moved to its permanent location at Obama's elementary school in February 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8405314.stm|title=Indonesia unveils statue of Obama|date=Dec 10, 2009|accessdate=Sep 13, 2019|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

==Background==
{{see|List of lawsuits involving Donald Trump}}

With circumstantial evidence of possible money laundering in the Trump organization, the House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed numerous records from the President's accounting firm, Mazars, Deutsche Bank and other companies. The President sued, and the subpoena was blocked while the case wound its way through the courts, losing in district court and on appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/supreme-court-temporarily-halts-court-order-requiring-accountants-to-turn-over-trumps-tax-returns-to-congress.html|title=Supreme Court temporarily halts court order requiring accountants to turn over Trump's tax returns to Congress|first=Tucker Higgins,Jacob|last=Pramuk|date=November 18, 2019|website=CNBC}}</ref> The Supreme Court agreed to continue the block for a few days, ordering the House Counsel to submit a rebuttal by November 21, which it did.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-11-21/house-attorneys-say-trumps-tax-returns-needed-for-impeachment-inquiry|title=House attorneys say Trump's tax returns are needed for impeachment inquiry|date=November 22, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In seeking a rapid subpoena ruling, House general counsel [[Douglas Letter]] wrote, \"The president certainly has no right to dictate the timetable by which third parties provide information that could potentially be relevant to that inquiry.\"<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/21/democrats-seek-quick-subpoena-ruling-in-trump-tax-records-case/|newspaper=Roll Call|date=November 21, 2019|author=Todd Ruger|title=Democrats seek quick subpoena ruling in Trump tax records case}}</ref>

The target of the subpoena (Mazars) has said that it is willing to comply with the subpoena; Trump's lawsuit against Mazars, brought in his personal capacity, has delayed Mazars' response.<ref name=Lederman>{{cite web|author=Marty Lederman|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/67461/understanding-the-two-mazars-subpoena-cases-before-the-supreme-court/|title=Understanding the Two Mazars Subpoena Cases Before the Supreme Court|date=November 25, 2019|website=Just Security}}</ref> Legal scholar [[Marty Lederman]] has described the ''Mazars'' case as the more important than the ''Trump v. Vance'' case.<ref name=Lederman/> Lederman describes Trump's argument&mdash;that Congress entirely lacks \"constitutional authority to investigate a sitting President's possible conflicts of interest and violations of law\"&mdash;as an \"alarming\" assertion that, \"would, if credited, be a radical departure from our constitutional history and tradition.\"<ref name=Lederman/>

==D.C. Circuit==
===Ruling===
Circuit Judge [[David S. Tatel]] wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Circuit Judge [[Patricia Millett]].<ref name=\"circuitopinions\">{{cite court |litigants=Trump v.

===Dissent===
Circuit Judge [[Neomi Rao]] dissented, insisting that the impeachment power is the only legitimate method for such congressional investigations.<ref name=\"circuitopinions\"/>

===En banc rehearing denied===
On November 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit denied the Trump administration's petition for an ''[[en banc]]'' rehearing.

==Supreme Court==
On November 25, 2019, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted a stay of the D.C.

The target of the subpoena (Mazars) has said that it is willing to comply with the subpoena; Trump's lawsuit against Mazars, brought in his personal capacity, has delayed Mazars' response.<ref name=Lederman>{{cite web|author=Marty Lederman|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/67461/understanding-the-two-mazars-subpoena-cases-before-the-supreme-court/|title=Understanding the Two Mazars Subpoena Cases Before the Supreme Court|date=November 25, 2019|website=Just Security}}</ref> Legal scholar [[Marty Lederman]] has described the ''Mazars'' case as the more important than the ''Trump v.

==D.C. Circuit==
===Ruling===
Circuit Judge [[David S. Tatel]] wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Circuit Judge [[Patricia Millett]].<ref name=\"circuitopinions\">{{cite court |litigants=Trump v.

===Dissent===
Circuit Judge [[Neomi Rao]] dissented, insisting that the impeachment power is the only legitimate method for such congressional investigations.<ref name=\"circuitopinions\"/>

===En banc rehearing denied===
On November 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit denied the Trump administration's petition for an ''[[en banc]]'' rehearing.

==Supreme Court==
On November 25, 2019, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted a stay of the D.C.

Oral arguments was originally scheduled to take place on March 31, 2020, but two weeks before the arguments were to take place, the Supreme Court postponed arguments in response to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]] and waited one month to announce the rescheduled date.

==Background==
{{see|List of lawsuits involving Donald Trump}}

With circumstantial evidence of possible money laundering in the Trump organization, the House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed numerous records from the President's accounting firm, Mazars, Deutsche Bank and other companies. The President sued, and the subpoena was blocked while the case wound its way through the courts, losing in district court and on appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/supreme-court-temporarily-halts-court-order-requiring-accountants-to-turn-over-trumps-tax-returns-to-congress.html|title=Supreme Court temporarily halts court order requiring accountants to turn over Trump's tax returns to Congress|first=Tucker Higgins,Jacob|last=Pramuk|date=November 18, 2019|website=CNBC}}</ref> The Supreme Court agreed to continue the block for a few days, ordering the House Counsel to submit a rebuttal by November 21, which it did.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-11-21/house-attorneys-say-trumps-tax-returns-needed-for-impeachment-inquiry|title=House attorneys say Trump's tax returns are needed for impeachment inquiry|date=November 22, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In seeking a rapid subpoena ruling, House general counsel [[Douglas Letter]] wrote, \"The president certainly has no right to dictate the timetable by which third parties provide information that could potentially be relevant to that inquiry.\"<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/21/democrats-seek-quick-subpoena-ruling-in-trump-tax-records-case/|newspaper=Roll Call|date=November 21, 2019|author=Todd Ruger|title=Democrats seek quick subpoena ruling in Trump tax records case}}</ref>

'''''Steel Diver''''' is a [[simulation video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]], with assistance by Vitei, for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. In the game, the player controls a [[submarine]] via a set of touch-screen based levers and wheels. The game was released in 2011, and was followed up by a [[free-to-play]] sequel in 2014, titled ''[[#Steel Diver: Sub Wars|Steel Diver: Sub Wars]]''.

==Story==
In the year 19XX, a 'power-hungry rogue nation' invaded several nearby countries. A secret organization known as the 'Steel Divers' was formed from various countries' navies to combat this threat. The Steel Divers travel through various areas including [[Arctic]] and [[jungle]] settings and are eventually tasked with destroying the enemy stronghold.

==Gameplay==
''Steel Diver'' consists of 3 main modes: ''Missions'', ''Periscope Strike'', and ''Steel Commander''. ''Missions'' is further broken down into 2 modes: ''Campaign'' and ''Time Trials''. The main gameplay occurs during ''Campaign''. In ''Campaign'', the player uses sliders and dials on the touchscreen to manoeuver a submarine through side-scrolling levels displayed on the top screen, sinking enemy submarines, [[battleship]]s and avoiding [[naval mine]]s and [[depth charge]]s as required. There are seven missions available, playable with different subs and difficulty modes, which usually involve goals such as eliminating enemy fleets or infiltrating enemy bases by reaching the goal in a time limit. ''Time Trials'' features the same gameplay style and controls, however the levels are shorter and are not connected to the story, instead being solely to achieve a fast time through a complex path. ''Periscope Strike'' mode is played after every successful mission or can also be played separately, or as part of ''Steel Commander''. This mode sees the player moving the system to rotate a [[periscope]] to fire torpedoes at enemy ships. ''Steel Commander'' is playable against the CPU or a human opponent via Download Play. It is a strategy game in which the two players command a fleet of battleships and submarines and try to sink each other's fleet.<ref name=\"Steel Diver Official Site (AU)\">{{cite web|title=Steel Diver|url=http://gamesites.nintendo.com.au/steel-diver/en_AU/index.php|publisher=Nintendo Australia Pty.

At [[History of the Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2004]], ''Steel Diver'' was first shown as a playable tech demo for the then-upcoming [[Nintendo DS]].

== Teaching math in Braille ==
About 1950, Pairman started focusing on teaching mathematics to blind students, learning Braille and learning how to make diagrams using her sewing machine and other household items.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Her daughter Margaret later wrote, “Geometry was a particular problem, because you really need diagrams. Braille is done on paper like thin cardstock. So she rounded up all kinds of household implements like pinking shears and pastry wheels and such and created diagrams that could be felt with the fingers, like the Braille symbols. Apparently nobody had ever done this before.\"<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" />

Pairman's son-in-law Thomas Streeter wrote about a visit to Hanover, when he was shown some of her work. “A graduate student at Harvard was blind and needed a particular book put into Braille, and it was full of mathematical symbols. What to do? The sewing machine, of course. She had written down the math and had it beside the machine. She put a piece of Braille paper under the foot and proceeded to reproduce the symbols by guiding the paper under the needle. It had to be the mirror image of what she had written.\"<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" />

In about 1959, the Hanover Gazette published an article about her saying that Pairman was in the process of transcribing two mathematical texts, one was for a freshman student at Boston College, and another, a reference book on group theory, destined for a post-graduate course at Columbia University in New York. The article went on to say that she was in regular discussions with Dartmouth math freshmen three hours each week and that apparently, by the end of the spring term, she had taken over the course instruction.<ref name=\":2\" />

Pairman's daughter Margaret wrote later: “For all the satisfaction that she got from these [Braille] projects, the only time I saw her truly happy was when she was teaching. And she had precious little opportunity to do that, being obviously ahead of her time and also stuck in a males-only college community and in a world where it was well-nigh impossible for married ladies to function professionally.”<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" />

== Personal Life ==
On 10 August 1922, Pairman married Bancroft Huntington Brown (1894-1974) at Roselea, the Pairman home in Broomieknowe, Scotland and afterwards assumed the name '''Eleanor P. Brown''', becoming widely known as '''Nora Brown'''. Her husband was a Harvard graduate student who had also received his PhD in 1922.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/bancroft-huntington-brown-24-fgg5w0?geo_a=r&geo_s=us&geo_t=us&geo_v=2.0.0&o_xid=62916&o_lid=62916&o_sch=Partners|title=Bancroft Huntington Brown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ancestry.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> Together, they had four children, John Pairman (b. 1923), Barbara (1925-1979), Joanna (1935-1935), and Margaret Wylde (b. 1937). Her two surviving children (Joanna died as a baby) went on to earn doctorates of their own.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> 

Pairman passed away after a long battle with breast cancer on 14 September 1973, at the age of 77, in [[White River Junction, Vermont]]. She was survived by her husband, two sisters, three children, seven grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. Her husband passed away the following year.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />

'''Leonard Nathaniel Goldsmid-Montefiore''' (2 June 1889&nbsp;– 23 December 1961) was a wealthy member of the [[Montefiore]] family, the only son of [[Claude Montefiore]], and he succeeded his father as a leader of Jewish philanthropic organisations in the UK including the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]], the [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]], and the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]].<ref name=Lipman/><ref name=NYT/><ref name=Palgrave/><ref name=Shute/> He was a founder and president of the [[Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide]].<ref name=Beloff/>

==Early life==
He was the only son of [[Claude Montefiore]]—a prominent Jewish scholar and philanthropist—and was named after his uncle [[Leonard A. Montefiore]]. He was born at the family home of number 12, [[Portman Square]] on 2 June 1889. His mother, Therese Alice, died on the following day, and so he was brought up by his grandmother, Emma Montefiore, who was from the wealthy [[Goldsmid family]].<ref name=DNB/>

He was educated at [[Clifton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he read history. While a student, he spent time in Berlin and Hanover, where he became fluent in German. After graduation, he worked and lived at [[Toynbee Hall]]—a [[settlement movement|settlement]] house in which rich people lived alongside the poor to do social work and alleviate poverty.<ref name=DNB/>

In 1914, at the start of the [[First World War]], he joined a cycling battalion of the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]. He served in India and [[Siberian intervention|Siberia]], rising to the rank of captain. In 1918, he was admitted to the [[Order of the British Empire]], and in 1921 he joined the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]], being introduced by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Viscount Milner]].<ref name=DNB/>

In 1924, he married the sister of a close friend from college, Muriel Jeanetta Tuck (1892–1988), who was from the wealthy family that ran [[Raphael Tuck & Sons]]. They had two sons, David and Alan, who became a physician and Oxford don.<ref name=DNB/>{{clarify|date=April 2020}}<!-- who became a physician? -->

==Charitable service==
Leonard Montefiore was active in numerous charitable, cultural, and philanthropic organisations. [[Chaim Bermant]] wrote, \"He attended them all, gave money to them all, offered guidance to them all\".<ref name=DNB/>

These organisation included:<ref name=DNB/>
* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] – president, vice-president, chairman of the industrial committee
* [[Bernhard Baron Settlement]]
* [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]
* [[Clifton College]] – governor
* [[Froebel Educational Institute]] – chairman 1939–1961
* [[Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women]]
* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]] – chairman of the industrial committee
* [[Jewish Colonization Association]]
* [[Jewish Refugees Committee]] – chairman
* [[Jews’ Free School]]
* [[Jews’ Temporary Shelter]]
* [[League of British Jews]]
* [[Leo Baeck College]] – chairman
* [[Reform Synagogues Association]] – president
* [[West London Synagogue]] – reader, senior treasurer, vice-president and warden
* [[Wiener Library]] – founder and president

==Germany and the Second World War==
When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and his National Socialist party seized power, they threatened the Jewish community in Germany. Montefiore was at that time co-chairman of the Joint Foreign Committee of the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] and the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]; the other co-chairman was [[Neville Laski]]. This committee had a tradition of protecting and supporting overseas Jews and it then established the [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]. Another founder member was Otto Schiff, who organised the Jewish Refugees Committee, which Montefiore chaired. The wealth supporting this fund enabled a promise to be made to the British government that Jewish refugees from Germany would not be a burden on public finances.<ref name=KC/> They also lobbied British society to protest against German discrimination against Jews but were not successful initially. Others wanted to organise a boycott of German goods but the Board of Deputies saw this as too extreme. There was also concern about [[Zionism|Zionist]] influence, which the Board opposed as subverting their status as British.<ref name=Gewirtz/> Montefiore was himself opposed to Zionism until he visited Israel in 1955.<ref name=DNB/>     

Montefiore's fluency in the German language enabled him to study the details of the oppression of the Jews in Germany.<ref name=DNB/> He publicised these, writing articles, letters and [[pamphlet]]s including ''The Jews in Germany: Facts and Figures'' (1934) and ''Exiles from Germany'' (1937).<ref name=Palgrave/>

In 1944, he toured the Mediterranean theatre to meet [[Jewish Brigade|Jewish servicemen]] for the Welfare Branch of the [[War Office]].<ref name=DNB/>

==The Windermere children==
Montefiore organised aid for hundreds of Jewish orphans after the Second World War, acting as their [[legal guardian|guardian]] and arranging for them to be flown to England in heavy bombers by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].<ref name=ToI/> They had been liberated from Nazi concentration camps and so required care and rehabilitation for which he arranged a special camp at [[Windermere]]. Montefiore made regular visits and took a personal interest in their development. Nurse Eva Kahn-Minden recalled his manner,

{{quote|text=Monty has been to pay one of his flying visits. Taxi arrives; coat thrown into some corner, he greets me, asks how things are; the boys meet him, shake hands, talk, jest; up the stairs two at a time into Nathan's to deliver \"a few highbrow magazines\" and to discuss the latest on science, politics and art; down to inspect garden, cowshed;<br />...<br />When he has left, everyone has the feeling that he has come just for him or her – a remarkable man! Intelligence, compassion and financial freedom—which is the strongest? Love, concern and a certain shyness coupled with some extrovert abilities—perhaps that would describe him even better.<ref name=Gilbert/>}}

This refugee rescue was dramatised as ''[[The Windermere Children]]'' and broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 2020 for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of [[Auschwitz]].<ref name=ToI/> In this production, the part of Leonard Montefiore was played by [[Tim McInnerny]].<ref name=BBC/>

'''Leonard Nathaniel Goldsmid-Montefiore''' (2 June 1889&nbsp;– 23 December 1961) was a wealthy member of the [[Montefiore]] family, the only son of [[Claude Montefiore]], and he succeeded his father as a leader of Jewish philanthropic organisations in the UK including the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]], the [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]], and the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]].<ref name=Lipman/><ref name=NYT/><ref name=Palgrave/><ref name=Shute/> He was a founder and president of the [[Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide]].<ref name=Beloff/>

==Early life==
He was the only son of [[Claude Montefiore]]—a prominent Jewish scholar and philanthropist—and was named after his uncle [[Leonard A. Montefiore]]. He was born at the family home of number 12, [[Portman Square]] on 2 June 1889. His mother, Therese Alice, died on the following day, and so he was brought up by his grandmother, Emma Montefiore, who was from the wealthy [[Goldsmid family]].<ref name=DNB/>

He was educated at [[Clifton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he read history. While a student, he spent time in Berlin and Hanover, where he became fluent in German. After graduation, he worked and lived at [[Toynbee Hall]]—a [[settlement movement|settlement]] house in which rich people lived alongside the poor to do social work and alleviate poverty.<ref name=DNB/>

In 1914, at the start of the [[First World War]], he joined a cycling battalion of the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]. He served in India and [[Siberian intervention|Siberia]], rising to the rank of captain. In 1918, he was admitted to the [[Order of the British Empire]], and in 1921 he joined the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]], being introduced by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Viscount Milner]].<ref name=DNB/>

In 1924, he married the sister of a close friend from college, Muriel Jeanetta Tuck (1892–1988), who was from the wealthy family that ran [[Raphael Tuck & Sons]]. They had two sons, David and Alan, who became a physician and Oxford don.<ref name=DNB/>{{clarify|date=April 2020}}<!-- who became a physician? -->

==Charitable service==
Leonard Montefiore was active in numerous charitable, cultural, and philanthropic organisations. [[Chaim Bermant]] wrote, \"He attended them all, gave money to them all, offered guidance to them all\".<ref name=DNB/>

These organisation included:<ref name=DNB/>
* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] – president, vice-president, chairman of the industrial committee
* [[Bernhard Baron Settlement]]
* [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]
* [[Clifton College]] – governor
* [[Froebel Educational Institute]] – chairman 1939–1961
* [[Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women]]
* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]] – chairman of the industrial committee
* [[Jewish Colonization Association]]
* [[Jewish Refugees Committee]] – chairman
* [[Jews’ Free School]]
* [[Jews’ Temporary Shelter]]
* [[League of British Jews]]
* [[Leo Baeck College]] – chairman
* [[Reform Synagogues Association]] – president
* [[West London Synagogue]] – reader, senior treasurer, vice-president and warden
* [[Wiener Library]] – founder and president

==Germany and the Second World War==
When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and his National Socialist party seized power, they threatened the Jewish community in Germany. Montefiore was at that time co-chairman of the Joint Foreign Committee of the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] and the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]; the other co-chairman was [[Neville Laski]]. This committee had a tradition of protecting and supporting overseas Jews and it then established the [[Central British Fund for German Jewry]]. Another founder member was Otto Schiff, who organised the Jewish Refugees Committee, which Montefiore chaired. The wealth supporting this fund enabled a promise to be made to the British government that Jewish refugees from Germany would not be a burden on public finances.<ref name=KC/> They also lobbied British society to protest against German discrimination against Jews but were not successful initially. Others wanted to organise a boycott of German goods but the Board of Deputies saw this as too extreme. There was also concern about [[Zionism|Zionist]] influence, which the Board opposed as subverting their status as British.<ref name=Gewirtz/> Montefiore was himself opposed to Zionism until he visited Israel in 1955.<ref name=DNB/>     

Montefiore's fluency in the German language enabled him to study the details of the oppression of the Jews in Germany.<ref name=DNB/> He publicised these, writing articles, letters and [[pamphlet]]s including ''The Jews in Germany: Facts and Figures'' (1934) and ''Exiles from Germany'' (1937).<ref name=Palgrave/>

In 1944, he toured the Mediterranean theatre to meet [[Jewish Brigade|Jewish servicemen]] for the Welfare Branch of the [[War Office]].<ref name=DNB/>

==The Windermere children==
Montefiore organised aid for hundreds of Jewish orphans after the Second World War, acting as their [[legal guardian|guardian]] and arranging for them to be flown to England in heavy bombers by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].<ref name=ToI/> They had been liberated from Nazi concentration camps and so required care and rehabilitation for which he arranged a special camp at [[Windermere]]. Montefiore made regular visits and took a personal interest in their development. Nurse Eva Kahn-Minden recalled his manner,

{{quote|text=Monty has been to pay one of his flying visits. Taxi arrives; coat thrown into some corner, he greets me, asks how things are; the boys meet him, shake hands, talk, jest; up the stairs two at a time into Nathan's to deliver \"a few highbrow magazines\" and to discuss the latest on science, politics and art; down to inspect garden, cowshed;<br />...<br />When he has left, everyone has the feeling that he has come just for him or her – a remarkable man! Intelligence, compassion and financial freedom—which is the strongest? Love, concern and a certain shyness coupled with some extrovert abilities—perhaps that would describe him even better.<ref name=Gilbert/>}}

This refugee rescue was dramatised as ''[[The Windermere Children]]'' and broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 2020 for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of [[Auschwitz]].<ref name=ToI/> In this production, the part of Leonard Montefiore was played by [[Tim McInnerny]].<ref name=BBC/>

'''Store Dyrehave''' (literally Large Animal Park) is a forest located to the east of the village [[Ny Hammersholt]] immediately south of [[Hillerød]], on both sides of [[Lyngby Kongevej|Københavnsvej]], in [[North Zealand]], Denmark.  Consisting of conifers and beech, it was enclosed with stone walls in 1619–28 as a royal deer park for hunting. In 1680, [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] introduced a geometrical system of roads forming a star with eight branches for [[par force hunting]].<ref name=dsd/> Although par force hunting was discontinued in 1777, the road system and numbered stone posts remain fully intact.<ref name=MFM>{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/publikationer/2008/dec/store-dyrehave/|title=Store Dyrehave|publisher=Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet|accessdate=16 July 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref> Store Dyrehave is one of the three forests forming the [[Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1315/|title=Sites in Denmark, France and Turkey inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List|website=unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|date=4 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jagtskov.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumenter/Forskning/Verdensarv/UNESCO_verdensarv.pdf|title=UNESCO verdensarv i Nordsjællands  skove? |author= Jette Baagøe|publisher=Jagtskov.dk|accessdate=19 July 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref>

==Location==
Store Dyrehave has an almost quadratic shape. Præstevang, an area on the northwestern side of the forest, is bounded by the town of Hillerød on three sides. The small town of [[Ny Hammersholt]] and Hillerød Golf Club are located on the southwest side while the northeastern margin of the forest is bounded by the Istedrødvej motorway. To the southeast is the small village of [[Kirkelte]] in [[Allerød Municipality]]. Its open surroundings, which were protected in 1972, partly separate Store Dyrehave from [[Tokkekøb Hegn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fredninger.dk/fredning/kirkelte/|title=Kirkelte|website=Danmarks Naturfredningsforening|accessdate=21 July 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> [[Lyngby Kongevej|Kongevejen]], a former royal road that is now part of secondary route 201, passes through the forest close to its southwestern margin, linking Hillerød with Copenhagen through the towns of [[Blovstrød]], [[Birkerød]] and [[Kongens Lyngby]].

==History==
[[File:Store Dyrehave c. 1700.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Store Dyrehave seen on a map by  H. H. Scheel from about 1700.]]
The first enclosed deer park for hunting at [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s new [[Frederiksborg Castle]] was ''Lille Dyrehave'' (Small Deer Park) immediately to the north of the castle (now the Romantic landscape section of the [[Park of Frederiksborg Castle|castle's park]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oresundstid.dk/dansk/oresundstid/1700/side03-02.htm |title=Kongens jagtrevir |website=oresundstid.dk |accessdate=21 July 2015 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310225331/http://www.oresundstid.dk/dansk/oresundstid/1700/side03-02.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2007 }}</ref> Store Dyrehave, south of the castle, was enclosed with stone walls in 1619–28. In 1680, [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] introduced a French-inspired geometrical system of roads forming a star with eight branches for [[par force hunting]].<ref name=dsd/> Par force hunting took place in the forest until 1777.<ref name=MFM/> 

In the 18th century, the forest was used for breeding [[Frederiksborg horse]]s by the Royal Frederiksborg Stud.<ref name=dsd>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Sj%C3%A6lland/Store_Dyrehave|title=Store Dyrehave|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=16 July 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref> The horses were separated in groups according to colour. Each group consisted of 15-20 [[mare]]s and one [[stallion]]. The blue-couloured horses were kept in Store Dyrehave while the grey ones grazed in Præstevang.<ref name=SISD>{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/naturguider/store-dyrehave/sevaerdigheder/|title=Seværdigheder I Store Dyrehave|website=Naturstyrelsen|accessdate=22 July 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> 

In 1859, [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] created a small Romantic garden complex in Præstevangen in the northwestern part of the forest, which he named ''Fantasiens Ø'' (Isle of Fantasy). It is located on a small island created by digging a canal across a peninsula, in the Brededam Lake and originally included a small pavilion and a kitchen annexe. The garden fell into neglect after Frederick VII's death, the kitchen was pulled down in 1905 and the pavilion removed in 1969, but a few ruins remain.<ref name=MFM/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/publikationer/2009/jul/hjertestien-i-praestevang/|title=Hjertestien i Præstevang|website=naturstyrelsen.dk|publisher=Naturstyrelsen|date=28 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2015|language=Danish}} Pamphlet on Præstevangen</ref>

As a part of the [[Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand]], Store Dyrehave was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]] on 4 July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1315/|title=Sites in Denmark, France and Turkey inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List|website=unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|date=4 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jagtskov.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumenter/Forskning/Verdensarv/UNESCO_verdensarv.pdf|title=UNESCO verdensarv i Nordsjællands  skove? |author= Jette Baagøe|publisher=Jagtskov.dk|accessdate=19 July 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref>

==Ecology==
[[File:Store Dyrehave - Malte Enghave.JPG|thumb|200px|Malte Enghave, a pasture which is again graxed by cattle to keep the area open.]]
Store Dyrehave comprises {{convert|1230|ha}} of forest, 18.8 hectares of lakes and ponds, 40.8 hectares of marshland, 21.6 hectares of plains and 9.8 hectares of meadows. [[Deciduous|Deciduous trees]] dominate the periphery of the forest, with [[beech]] as the most common species, covering 414.8 hectares, while oak trees cover 132 hectares and other deciduous trees cover 120 hectares. Mainly found in the central part of the forest, evergreens cover approximately 364 hectares of which ''[[Picea]]'' species account for 227 hectares. The share of deciduous forest will gradually be increased.<ref name=dsd/>

Maltemosen, in the northern part of the forest, is a [[poor fen]]. Typical flora include [[cotton-grass]] and [[Eriophorum|wild calla]] as well as the  carnivorous [[Drosera|sundew]] and [[Utricularia vulgaris|greater bladderwort]]. Rågårdsmosen and Sortedam on the southwest side of Kongevejeb close to Ny Hammersholt, are peat bogs.<ref name=SISD/>

Store Dyrehave is home to both [[roe deer]] and [[fallow deer]], while [[red deer]]&mdash;which used to be the focus of attention during the royal hunts&mdash;are no longer found in the area.<ref name=dsd/>

[[File:Store Dyrehave - Kongestenen 1.JPG|thumb|200px|The King's Stone ]]
[[File:Store Dyrehave - Hingsterhus 1.JPG|thumb|200px|Hingsterhus]]
Although par force hunting was discontinued in 1777 by prohibition, the road system and numbered stone posts remain fully intact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturbeskyttelse/skovbrug/statsskovene/driftsplanlaegning/nordsjaelland/omraadeplaner/store-dyrehave/|title=Store Dyrehave|publisher=Naturstyrelsen|accessdate=19 July 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref> ''Kongestenen'' (The King's Stone), a stone featuring Christian V's monogram and a [[compass rose]], is located at ''Stjernen'' (The Star), an 8-way junction in the centre of the forest. The eight radial roads intersect a series of smaller paths called ''Etkorset'' (The One-Cross), ''Tokorset'' (The Two-Cross), ''Trekorset'' (The Three-Cross), etc.<ref name=MFM/>

The ruins after the pavilion and remains of the vegetation can still be seen on Fantasiens Ø. The forest also contains a number of old houses, so-called ''banghuse'', which were originally used by the men who took care of the horses. They include Hingsterhus and Horsebohus.<ref name=SISD/>

==Activities==
Store Dyrehave contains various facilities for camping and bonfires. There are also a 20&nbsp;km mountain bike trail, an exercise trail and marked running routes (6, 10 and 20&nbsp;km).<ref name=dsd/>

'''Store Dyrehave''' (literally Large Animal Park) is a forest located to the east of the village [[Ny Hammersholt]] immediately south of [[Hillerød]], on both sides of [[Lyngby Kongevej|Københavnsvej]], in [[North Zealand]], Denmark.  Consisting of conifers and beech, it was enclosed with stone walls in 1619–28 as a royal deer park for hunting. In 1680, [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] introduced a geometrical system of roads forming a star with eight branches for [[par force hunting]].<ref name=dsd/> Although par force hunting was discontinued in 1777, the road system and numbered stone posts remain fully intact.<ref name=MFM>{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/publikationer/2008/dec/store-dyrehave/|title=Store Dyrehave|publisher=Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet|accessdate=16 July 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref> Store Dyrehave is one of the three forests forming the [[Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1315/|title=Sites in Denmark, France and Turkey inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List|website=unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|date=4 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jagtskov.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumenter/Forskning/Verdensarv/UNESCO_verdensarv.pdf|title=UNESCO verdensarv i Nordsjællands  skove? |author= Jette Baagøe|publisher=Jagtskov.dk|accessdate=19 July 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref>

==Location==
Store Dyrehave has an almost quadratic shape. Præstevang, an area on the northwestern side of the forest, is bounded by the town of Hillerød on three sides. The small town of Ny Hammersholt and Hillerød Golf Club are located on the southwest side while the northeastern margin of the forest is bounded by the Istedrødvej motorway. To the southeast is the small village of [[Kirkelte]] in [[Allerød Municipality]]. Its open surroundings, which were protected in 1972, partly separate Store Dyrehave from [[Tokkekøb Hegn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fredninger.dk/fredning/kirkelte/|title=Kirkelte|website=Danmarks Naturfredningsforening|accessdate=21 July 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> [[Lyngby Kongevej|Kongevejen]], a former royal road that is now part of secondary route 201, passes through the forest close to its southwestern margin, linking Hillerød with Copenhagen through the towns of [[Blovstrød]], [[Birkerød]] and [[Kongens Lyngby]].

==History==
[[File:Store Dyrehave c. 1700.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Store Dyrehave seen on a map by  H. H. Scheel from about 1700.]]
The first enclosed deer park for hunting at [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s new [[Frederiksborg Castle]] was ''Lille Dyrehave'' (Small Deer Park) immediately to the north of the castle (now the Romantic landscape section of the [[Park of Frederiksborg Castle|castle's park]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oresundstid.dk/dansk/oresundstid/1700/side03-02.htm |title=Kongens jagtrevir |website=oresundstid.dk |accessdate=21 July 2015 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310225331/http://www.oresundstid.dk/dansk/oresundstid/1700/side03-02.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2007 }}</ref> Store Dyrehave, south of the castle, was enclosed with stone walls in 1619–28. In 1680, [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] introduced a French-inspired geometrical system of roads forming a star with eight branches for [[par force hunting]].<ref name=dsd/> Par force hunting took place in the forest until 1777.<ref name=MFM/> 

In the 18th century, the forest was used for breeding [[Frederiksborg horse]]s by the Royal Frederiksborg Stud.<ref name=dsd>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Sj%C3%A6lland/Store_Dyrehave|title=Store Dyrehave|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=16 July 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref> The horses were separated in groups according to colour. Each group consisted of 15-20 [[mare]]s and one [[stallion]]. The blue-couloured horses were kept in Store Dyrehave while the grey ones grazed in Præstevang.<ref name=SISD>{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/naturguider/store-dyrehave/sevaerdigheder/|title=Seværdigheder I Store Dyrehave|website=Naturstyrelsen|accessdate=22 July 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> 

In 1859, [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] created a small Romantic garden complex in Præstevangen in the northwestern part of the forest, which he named ''Fantasiens Ø'' (Isle of Fantasy). It is located on a small island created by digging a canal across a peninsula, in the Brededam Lake and originally included a small pavilion and a kitchen annexe. The garden fell into neglect after Frederick VII's death, the kitchen was pulled down in 1905 and the pavilion removed in 1969, but a few ruins remain.<ref name=MFM/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/publikationer/2009/jul/hjertestien-i-praestevang/|title=Hjertestien i Præstevang|website=naturstyrelsen.dk|publisher=Naturstyrelsen|date=28 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2015|language=Danish}} Pamphlet on Præstevangen</ref>

==Ecology==
[[File:Store Dyrehave - Malte Enghave.JPG|thumb|200px|Malte Enghave, a pasture which is again graxed by cattle to keep the area open.]]
Store Dyrehave comprises {{convert|1230|ha}} of forest, 18.8 hectares of lakes and ponds, 40.8 hectares of marshland, 21.6 hectares of plains and 9.8 hectares of meadows. [[Deciduous|Deciduous trees]] dominate the periphery of the forest, with [[beech]] as the most common species, covering 414.8 hectares, while oak trees cover 132 hectares and other deciduous trees cover 120 hectares. Mainly found in the central part of the forest, evergreens cover approximately 364 hectares of which ''[[Picea]]'' species account for 227 hectares. The share of deciduous forest will gradually be increased.<ref name=dsd/>

Maltemosen, in the northern part of the forest, is a [[poor fen]]. Typical flora include [[cotton-grass]] and [[Eriophorum|wild calla]] as well as the  carnivorous [[Drosera|sundew]] and [[Utricularia vulgaris|greater bladderwort]]. Rågårdsmosen and Sortedam on the southwest side of Kongevejeb close to Ny Hammersholt, are peat bogs.<ref name=SISD/>

Store Dyrehave is home to both [[roe deer]] and [[fallow deer]], while [[red deer]]&mdash;which used to be the focus of attention during the royal hunts&mdash;are no longer found in the area.<ref name=dsd/>

The eight radial roads intersect a series of smaller paths called ''Etkorset'' (The One-Cross), ''Tokorset'' (The Two-Cross), ''Trekorset'' (The Three-Cross), etc.<ref name=MFM/>

The ruins after the pavilion and remains of the vegetation can still be seen on Fantasiens Ø. The forest also contains a number of old houses, so-called ''banghuse'', which were originally used by the men who took care of the horses. They include Hingsterhus and Horsebohus.<ref name=SISD/>

==Activities==
Store Dyrehave contains various facilities for camping and bonfires. There are also a 20&nbsp;km mountain bike trail, an exercise trail and marked running routes (6, 10 and 20&nbsp;km).<ref name=dsd/>

The '''Cape Lookout Lighthouse''' is a 163-foot high lighthouse located on the Southern [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]].

==History==
[[Image:Cape Lookout at South Core Banks.jpg|left|thumb|View of Cape Lookout Lighthouse from a public beach access on South Core Banks, 2007]]
It is the second lighthouse that has stood at [[Cape Lookout (North Carolina)|this location]], and is nearly identical to the [[Bodie Island Lighthouse]], which has horizontal stripes, and the [[Currituck Beach Lighthouse]], which is unpainted red brick. The more famous [[Cape Hatteras Lighthouse]] bears spiral stripes. The first lighthouse at Cape Lookout was completed and lit in 1812 at a cost of more than $20,000, which Congress authorized in 1804. It took eight years to build.<ref name=\"nps.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/calo/historyculture/lhouse_timeline.htm|title=Lighthouse History Timeline - Cape Lookout National Seashore (U.S. National Park Service)|work=nps.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> It was the fourth lighthouse to be built in North Carolina and was a 96 foot high brick tower with wooden shingles painted with red and white horizontal stripes. However, it proved to be too short to light the treacherous Lookout Shoals, which were nicknamed the \"Horrible Headland.\"<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web |author = Survey and Planning Unit Staff| title =Cape Lookout Light Station | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =September 1972| url = https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/CR0002.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2014-08-01}}</ref>

The present lighthouse was completed and lit on November 1, 1859 at a cost of $45,000, which Congress approved in 1857. This lighthouse used a first-order [[Fresnel lens]] which allowed the light to shine brighter. On May 20, 1861, North Carolina joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and all of the lenses were removed from the coastal lighthouses and navigational beacons to prevent Union forces from using the lights to navigate the coast. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops captured the nearby Beaufort and Morehead City in 1862 and, by the end of the next year, a third-order [[Fresnel lens]] was installed in the Cape Lookout lighthouse. On April 2, 1864, a small group of Confederate troops under the command of L.C. Harland snuck through Union lines and out to the lighthouse. Their attempt to blow up the lighthouse was unsuccessful, however the explosion did destroy the lighthouse oil supply and damaged the iron stairs. With iron unavailable during the war, the damaged sections of the stairs were replaced by wooden ones. The Fresnel lenses from all the North Carolina lighthouses were found in 1865 in Raleigh. The lenses were shipped back to their original manufacturers to be checked out and repaired. In 1867, the temporary wooden stairs were replaced when iron once again became available after the war and the original first-order [[Fresnel lens]] was reinstalled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/calo/historyculture/civil-war-lighthouse.htm|title=The Cape Lookout Light and the Civil War - Cape Lookout National Seashore (U.S. National Park Service)|work=nps.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>

In 1873, the lighthouse was painted in its distinctive black and white diagonal checkerboard, or diamond, pattern.<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/> There are those who believe the Cape Hatteras Light and the Cape Lookout Light paint schemes were reversed. This belief arose since the Cape Hatteras Light protects ships from Diamond Shoals and should therefore have the diamond pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rickslighthouses.com/cape_lookout.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518073953/http://www.rickslighthouses.com/cape_lookout.htm |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref> However, the daymark patterns were randomly assigned and there is no evidence to suggest that the Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras patterns were switched.

The lighthouse is part of the [[Cape Lookout National Seashore]] and can only be accessed by private ferry. During the summer, the Cape Lookout Light Station Visitor Center and Keepers' Quarters Museum are open. Though tower climbs were suspended in February 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/calo/parknews/02_22_2008.htm|title=Lighthouse Climbs Suspended For Public Safety - Cape Lookout National Seashore (U.S. National Park Service)|work=nps.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> the lighthouse opened for climbing permanently July 15, 2010.

* The Cape Lookout Lighthouse was completed in 1812 at a cost of $20,678.54 and had one wooden and one brick tower.
* The station was described in 1850, when William Fulford was keeper, as having 13 lamps, new lighting apparatus having been installed in 1848. The keeper was obliged, in 1850, to keep wheeling away sand from the front side of the keeper’s dwelling to prevent the sand from covering it up. \"The sand banks,\" the report reads, \"are now higher than the tops of the windows; and only a few feet from them, at high water mark. On the sea side, it has washed away about 100 feet last year by abrasion and sea flows.\"
* In 1851 Cape Lookout Lighthouse was reported as one of nine coast lights \"which require to be improved.  The towers of each of them should have an elevation of 150 feet above the level of the sea and should be fitted up in the best manner with first-order lens apparatus, to insure a brilliancy and range adequate to the wants of commerce. These lights are not sufficiently well distinguished, but a general plan for all the seacoast lights will best accomplish this object.\"
* On March 3, 1857, Congress appropriated $45,000 \"for rebuilding and fitting out with first-order apparatus the lighthouse at Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\" The new lighthouse was completed and first lighted on November 1, 1859.  During the Civil War, in 1862, the tower was damaged and the lens, etc., removed, but by 1863 the lighthouse had been refitted and the light reexhibited. A third-order lens was placed in use temporarily until the first-order lens, \"injured by the rebels\" could be repaired and restored in 1867.
* The lighthouse is now a black and white diagonally checkered tower, 169 feet above ground and 156 feet above water and shows a group flashing white electric light every 15 seconds of 80,000 candela, visible 19 miles, from a first-order lens.

The lighthouse is part of the [[Cape Lookout National Seashore]] and can only be accessed by private ferry. During the summer, the Cape Lookout Light Station Visitor Center and Keepers' Quarters Museum are open. Though tower climbs were suspended in February 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/calo/parknews/02_22_2008.htm|title=Lighthouse Climbs Suspended For Public Safety - Cape Lookout National Seashore (U.S. National Park Service)|work=nps.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> the lighthouse opened for climbing permanently July 15, 2010. The regular season lasts from mid-May to mid-September each year. During the open season, visitors are allowed to climb the 207 steps to the top of the lighthouse and experience the breath-taking view of Core Banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/calo/planyourvisit/lighthouse-climbs.htm|title=Climbing the Cape Lookout Lighthouse - Cape Lookout National Seashore (U.S. National Park Service)|work=nps.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>

|quote     = CAPE LOOKOUT LIGHT:
* The Cape Lookout Lighthouse was completed in 1812 at a cost of $20,678.54 and had one wooden and one brick tower.
* The station was described in 1850, when William Fulford was keeper, as having 13 lamps, new lighting apparatus having been installed in 1848. The keeper was obliged, in 1850, to keep wheeling away sand from the front side of the keeper’s dwelling to prevent the sand from covering it up. \"The sand banks,\" the report reads, \"are now higher than the tops of the windows; and only a few feet from them, at high water mark. On the sea side, it has washed away about 100 feet last year by abrasion and sea flows.\"
* In 1851 Cape Lookout Lighthouse was reported as one of nine coast lights \"which require to be improved.  The towers of each of them should have an elevation of 150 feet above the level of the sea and should be fitted up in the best manner with first-order lens apparatus, to insure a brilliancy and range adequate to the wants of commerce. These lights are not sufficiently well distinguished, but a general plan for all the seacoast lights will best accomplish this object.\"
* On March 3, 1857, Congress appropriated $45,000 \"for rebuilding and fitting out with first-order apparatus the lighthouse at Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\" The new lighthouse was completed and first lighted on November 1, 1859.  During the Civil War, in 1862, the tower was damaged and the lens, etc., removed, but by 1863 the lighthouse had been refitted and the light reexhibited. A third-order lens was placed in use temporarily until the first-order lens, \"injured by the rebels\" could be repaired and restored in 1867.
* The lighthouse is now a black and white diagonally checkered tower, 169 feet above ground and 156 feet above water and shows a group flashing white electric light every 15 seconds of 80,000 candela, visible 19 miles, from a first-order lens.

'''''The Hundred and One Dalmatians''''' is a 1956 children's novel by [[Dodie Smith]] about the kidnapping of a family of Dalmatian puppies. It was originally serialized in ''[[Woman's Day]]'' as ''The Great Dog Robbery''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedca.org/Historical/101BreedPopularity.pdf|title='101 Dalmatians' and Breed Popularity in the U.S.|last=Steinmetz|first=Cheryl|date=2005|website=Dalmatian Club Of America|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[The Starlight Barking]]'', continues from the end of the novel.

At a [[dinner|dinner party]] attended by the Dearly couple, [[Cruella de Vil]] expresses her dislike for animals; subsequently, the couple's new [[Dalmatian dog|Dalmatian]] puppies disappear. The Dearly dogs are now among 97 puppies who were kidnapped or legally purchased from various owners, with the intention of skinning them for their [[fur]]. Through the co-operation of animals and the \"Twilight barking\", the dogs are found in [[Suffolk]], England, and a rescue ensues.

==Plot==
Pongo and Missis are a pair of [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]s who live with the newly married Mr. and Mrs. Dearly and their two nannies, Nanny Cook and Nanny Butler. Mr. Dearly is a \"financial wizard\" who has been granted lifelong tax exemption and lent a house on the Outer Circle in [[Regent's Park]] in return for wiping out the [[government debt]]. The dogs consider the humans their pets, but allow the humans to think that they are the owners.

Missis gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. Concerned that Missis will not be able to feed them all, the humans join in to help. As Mrs. Dearly looks for a canine [[wet nurse]], she finds an exhausted liver-spotted Dalmatian in the middle of the road in the pouring rain. She has the dog treated by a vet, learns that she has recently given birth, and names her Perdita (meaning \"lost\"). Perdita helps to nurse the pups and becomes a member of the family, later telling Pongo about her lost love Prince and the resulting litter of puppies which were sold by her owner, and that she had run away looking for those puppies.

One day, while walking Pongo and Missis, Mr. and Mrs. Dearly have a chance meeting with an old schoolmate of Mrs. Dearly: Cruella de Vil, a very wealthy woman so fixated on fur clothing that she married a furrier and forces him to keep his fur collection in their home so she can wear the pieces whenever she likes. She admires the two dogs and expresses a desire to have a Dalmatian-skin coat. She happens to be in the house when the puppies start to arrive, and offers to buy them all. They refuse, and shortly after that the puppies disappear. The humans fail to trace them but through the \"Twilight Barking\", a forum of communication in which dogs can relay messages to each other across the country, the dogs track them down to \"Hell Hall\", the ancestral home of the de Vil family in [[Suffolk]]. Pongo and Missis try to tell the Dearlys where the puppies are but fail: Pongo tried to say the human word \"Suffolk\" but could not make the \"s\" sound. The dogs decide to find the puppies themselves, leaving Perdita to look after the Dearlys. After an eventful journey across the English countryside, with food and accommodation along the way arranged by dogs through the Barking Network, they meet the Colonel, an [[Old English Sheepdog]] at [[Withermarsh]] in Suffolk; he shows them Hell Hall and tells them its history. They get inside the mansion and discover that there are 97 puppies in Hell Hall, including Pongo and Missis' own 15.

Cruella de Vil arrives and tells the two crooks in charge of Hell Hall that they must slaughter and skin the dogs as soon as possible because of the publicity surrounding the theft of the Dearlys' puppies. Pongo and Missis realize they must rescue all of the puppies immediately and they escape the night before Christmas Eve. One puppy, Cadpig, is a [[runt]] and too weak to walk the long distance from Suffolk to London so Tommy, the Colonel's two-year-old owner, lends her a toy farm cart; one of the litters of puppies is just the right age for two of its members to fit its shaft, so they pull it in shifts. When Cruella returns to find the puppies gone, she begins to pursue them. However, the Dalmatians have encountered one of the Barking Network dogs, who points out how conspicuous they are and helps them break into a chimney sweep's establishment where they roll in [[soot]] to disguise themselves. Cruella nearly catches up with them, but they are able to hide in an empty removal van at the invitation of a [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier|Staffordshire terrier]] whose \"pets\" own the van—which is returning to London that very night.

Upon arriving in London, the dogs destroy the de Vils' collection of animal skins and fur coats with the help of Cruella's cat, who was angry and distressed at losing many litters of kittens which Cruella had drowned. The Dalmatians then return to the Dearlys' house, where Pongo and Missis bark until Mr. Dearly opens the door, whereupon the whole mass of puppies go streaming in without stopping. Once the dogs roll on the carpet to remove the soot from their coats, the Dearlys recognise them and send out for steaks to feed them. The litter that pulled Cadpig's cart proved to be Perdita's litter by Prince. Mr. Dearly finds out where the puppies had been when he discovers a label on the toy cart which contains Tommy's name and address. The Dearlys also place advertisements seeking the owners of the other puppies, but it turns out that they had all been sold, rather than stolen as the Dearlys' were.

Cruella's now-homeless cat drops by (and is invited to stay) with the news that the destruction of her husband's fur business has forced Cruella to put Hell Hall up for sale. When the Dearlys visit Suffolk to return Tommy's cart, they realize that, with 97 puppies, and three adult Dalmatians, a larger home would be a good idea, so Mr Dearly buys the hall with money he has been given by the government for sorting out another tax problem. He proposes to use it to start a \"dynasty of Dalmatians\" (and a \"dynasty of Dearlys\" to take care of them). Finally, Perdita's lost love, Prince, turns up. His owners see his love for Perdita and allow him to stay with the Dearlys and become their \"one hundred and oneth\" Dalmatian.

==Adaptations==

{{Main|One Hundred and One Dalmatians (franchise)}}
[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] adapted the novel into an [[animated film]], released to cinemas on 25 January 1961 as ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''. It became the tenth highest-grossing film of 1961,<ref name=\"Gebert\">{{Cite book|last=Gebert |first=Michael |title=The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards |publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks |year=1996 |isbn=0-668-05308-9 |page= }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> and one of the studio's most popular films of the decade. It was re-issued to cinemas four times, in 1969, 1979, 1985 and 1991. The 1991 reissue was the twentieth highest earning film of the year for domestic earnings. It was remade into [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|a live action movie]] years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1991 |title=1991 Domestic Grosses #1–50 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2 April 2008 }}</ref>

In both the live-action and animated adaptations, Missis was renamed Perdita, and other characters, such as Prince, Tommy, Cruella's cat, and Cruella's husband were omitted. In the animated film, Pongo and Missis' owners' last names were changed to \"Radcliffe\" from \"Dearly\", and in the live-action film, Cruella (portrayed by [[Glenn Close]]) appears as the spoiled magnate of an haute couture fashion house, \"''House of DeVil''\". Disney kept the book's characters Horace and Jasper Baddun, who appeared in both versions as thieves hired by Cruella to steal Pongo and Missis' puppies. (In the novel, their names are Saul and Jasper Baddun.) Disney later created an [[101 Dalmatians: The Series|animated television series]] starring three of the puppies (Lucky, Rolly and Cadpig) and a sequel film for each version (''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure|One Hundred and One Dalmatians II]]'' and ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'').

The novel has been adapted for the stage by [[Debbie Isitt]] for the [[Belgrade Theatre|Belgrade Theatre, Coventry]] in 2000 (followed by productions at the [[Royal & Derngate|Royal & Derngate, Northampton]] in 2007 and [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in 2017), by [[Bryony Lavery]] for the Chichester Youth Theatre in 2014 and was devised by the company (directed by Sally Cookson) for [[Tobacco Factory Theatre]]s in 2014. The novel was also adapted into a [[101 Dalmatians Musical|2009 musical]] and will be adapted into an upcoming [[101 Dalmatians (2020 musical)|2020 musical]].

Although marketed under Sid Meier's name, ''Civilization II'', ''Sid Meier's Colonization'' and ''Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri'' all credited Reynolds as lead designer.

MicroProse wanted to make a sequel and asked Reynolds to design it. MicroProse put Meier on retainer for consultational advice and for the use of his name, but Meier only had peripheral involvement in the design of this game. The sequel game, hence, was primarily designed by Reynolds.

''[[Rise of Nations]]'' was Reynolds' first game at Big Huge Games. Later came ''[[Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends|Rise of Legends]]'', a real-time strategy game, [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Microsoft]].

Buller has lectured and written numerous articles and papers about Aboriginal law, criminal law, family law and human rights.

==Early Life==

Marion Buller was born in 1953 in Toronto, Ontario. She is a member of the Mistawasis' First Nations although she did not grow up on the reserve because of discriminatory sections of the Indian Act from that time, she instead was raised in Toronto. Throughout her childhood she maintained a close relationship with her indigenous grandparents even though she did not grow up on the reserve, they taught her their traditional teachings that played a major part in her life while growing up. From a young age a strong work ethic was instilled into her, she learned cooking, cleaning, sewing and outside work from both her mother and father. In her life, work was not a “woman’s or man’s” job but you had to work hard to be considered equal to others. As both a woman and an indigenous woman she was taught that she would have to work even harder than most to get to the places she needed to be. Education was expected in her family, and she was taught that girls are entitled to the same education as boys received. 
She was not always aiming for a career in law, at first she wanted a career in a museum. After she finished her BA in Anthropology at the University of Victoria she went to work in the private sector, but because of the job market at the time, she knew she would need some sort of post-graduate degree. She decided to do Law at the University of Victoria so moving was not required. At first she thought she might go into Business Law, but while in first year she took Criminal Law with Dr. Keith Jobson and from that point forward knew she needed to be in the courtroom. 
Marion cannot pinpoint in her life when or how she became a feminist. Her upbringing taught her to believe in equality and equity but also the world’s shortcomings of inequality and equity that must be corrected. 
	“I learned these lessons not just by words, but by the examples set by my family  members.” 
<ref>M. Buller. Personal Communication. March 31, 2020.</ref>


==Career==

Judge Marion Buller attended the [[University of Victoria]] where she received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Anthropology]] in 1975 and later graduated with her [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] in 1987. Buller’s career in law was nothing far from noteworthy; she was instrumental in facilitating several organizations regarding indigenous rights, women’s rights, Aboriginal law, family law and human rights.  From 1988-1994, Buller worked as a [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[Criminal law|criminal]] lawyer in British Columbia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/careers/departments/anthropology/profiles/buller-marion.php|title=Honourable Marion Buller - University of Victoria|website=UVic.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. In 1994, Buller was appointed to the [[Provincial and territorial courts in Canada|Provincial Court]] bench, making her the first female indigenous Judge in British Columbia.

{{Main|Dust Bowl}}
In North America, the term \"Dust Bowl\" was first used to describe a series of dust storms that hit the [[prairie]]s of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] during the 1930s,<ref name=\"ncdc\"/> and later to describe the area in the United States that was most affected by the storms, including western Kansas, eastern Colorado, northeastern New Mexico, and the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles.<ref name=\"histevents\">{{cite web|title=Dust Bowl 1931–1939|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3424800020/dust-bowl-1931-1939.html|work=Historic Events for Students: The Great Depression|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

The \"black blizzards\" started in the Eastern states in 1930, affecting agriculture from [[Maine]] to [[Arkansas]].

== Personal accounts of Black Sunday and other dust storms ==
During the 1930s, many residents of the Dust Bowl kept accounts and journals of their lives and of the storms that hit their areas. Collections of accounts of the dust storms during the 1930s have been compiled over the years and are now available in book collections and online.

The Black Sunday storm is detailed in the 2012 [[Ken Burns]] PBS documentary ''[[The Dust Bowl (film)|The Dust Bowl]]''.

== In popular culture ==

Musicians and songwriters began to reflect the Dust Bowl and the events of the 1930s in their music. [[Woody Guthrie]], a singer-songwriter from Oklahoma, wrote a variety of songs documenting his experiences living during the era of dust storms.<ref name=\"nws\"/> Several were collected in his first album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]''. One of them, ''Great Dust Storm'', describes the events of Black Sunday.  An excerpt of the lyrics follows:

''On the 14th day of April of 1935,<br />
''There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky.<br />
''You could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black,<br />
''And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track.<br />
''From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,<br />
''Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,<br />
''It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,<br />
''We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom.<ref name=\"nws\"/>

Musician Kat Eggleston has written a play, ''The Cyclone Line'', about her father Al Eggleston's experiences growing up in 1930s Oklahoma, Black Sunday, and the Dust Bowl in general. Its first public performances were on [[Vashon, Washington|Vashon (Island), Washington]], where he lived most of his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vashonalliedarts.org/the-cyclone-line-a-play-by-kat-eggleston/|title=The Cyclone Line, a play by Kat Eggleston « Vashon Center for the Arts|website=vashonalliedarts.org|access-date=November 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103235016/http://vashonalliedarts.org/the-cyclone-line-a-play-by-kat-eggleston/|archive-date=November 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Americana recording artist [[Grant Maloy Smith]] released an album in 2017 called ''Dust Bowl – American Stories'' that featured two songs that directly referenced Black Sunday. The song \"Old Black Roller\" is written from a first person perspective during the Black Sunday storm, and another song \"Never Seen The Rain\" has these chorus lyrics: \"We worked the land to death, me and my brother | 'Til April 14, 1935 | Oklahoma, you were like our mother - oh, my\"

[[Image:Ball mill.gif|thumb|Ball mill]]
A '''ball mill''' is a type of [[grinder (milling)|grinder]] used to grind, blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and [[selective laser sintering]].  It works on the principle of  impact and  attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.

A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.  The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal.  It is partially filled with balls.  The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel ([[chrome steel]]), stainless steel, ceramic or rubber.  The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as [[Mangalloy|manganese steel]] or [http://sakarrubtech.com/mill-lining.php rubber lining].  Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills.  The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter.

The general idea behind the ball mill is an ancient one, but it was not until the [[industrial revolution]] and the invention of [[steam power]] that an effective ball milling machine could be built.  It is reported to have been used for grinding flint for pottery in 1870.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kj7PSOqTZ3IC&printsec=frontcover|title=The history of grinding|publisher=SME|year=2005|isbn=0-87335-238-6|author=Lynch, A.|author2=Rowland C}}</ref>

==Working==
In case of continuously operated ball mill, the material to be ground is fed from the left through a 60° cone and the product is discharged through a 30° cone to the right. As the shell rotates, the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they cascade down (or drop down on to the feed), from near the top of the shell. In doing so, the solid particles in between the balls and ground are reduced in size by impact.

==Applications==
The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal, pigments, and feldspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out either wet or dry but the former is performed at low speed. Blending of explosives is an example of an application for rubber balls.<ref name=\"TM_9-1300-214_p10-8\">{{Citation |author=US Army |title=Department of the Army technical manual: military explosives (TM 9-1300-214) |page=10-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODYYAAAAYAAJ&pg=SA10-PA8&dq=%22ball+mill%22+%22rubber+balls%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L9SGVauFJcKyggT8sZnABA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22ball%20mill%22%20%22rubber%20balls%22&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> For systems with multiple components, ball milling has been shown to be effective in increasing [[solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] chemical reactivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Takacs|first1=Laszlo|title=Self-sustaining reactions induced by ball milling|journal=Progress in Materials Science|date=January 2002|volume=47|issue=4|pages=355–414|doi=10.1016/S0079-6425(01)00002-0}}</ref> Additionally, ball milling has been shown effective for production of amorphous materials. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Takacs|first1=Laszlo|title=Self-sustaining reactions induced by ball milling|journal=Progress in Materials Science|date=January 2002|volume=47|issue=4|pages=355–414|doi=10.1016/S0079-6425(01)00002-0}}</ref>

A ball mill, a type of [[grinder (milling)|grinder]], is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like [[ores]], chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including [[ceramic]] balls, [[flint]] pebbles and [[stainless steel]] balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder. Industrial ball mills can operate continuously, fed at one end and discharged at the other end. Large to medium-sized ball mills are mechanically rotated on their axis, but small ones normally consist of a cylindrical capped container that sits on two drive shafts ([[pulleys]] and belts are used to transmit rotary motion). A [[rock tumbler]] functions on the same principle.  Ball mills are also used in [[pyrotechnics]] and the manufacture of [[black powder]], but cannot be used in the preparation of some pyrotechnic mixtures such as [[flash powder]] because of their sensitivity to impact. High-quality ball mills are potentially expensive and can grind mixture particles to as small as 5 [[Nanometre|nm]], enormously increasing surface area and reaction rates. 

The grinding works on the principle of critical speed.  Critical speed can be understood as that speed after which the steel balls (which are responsible for the grinding of particles) start rotating along the direction of the cylindrical device; thus causing no further grinding.

The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials, and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement, silicates, refractory material, fertilizer, glass ceramics, etc. as well as for [[Mineral processing|ore dressing]] of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry. There are two kinds of ball mill, grate type and overfall type due to different ways of discharging material.  Many types of grinding media are suitable for use in a ball mill, each material having its own specific properties and advantages.  Key properties of grinding media are size, density, hardness, and composition.
* Size: The smaller the media particles, the smaller the particle size of the final product.  At the same time, the grinding media particles should be substantially larger than the largest pieces of material to be ground.
* Density: The media should be denser than the material being ground.  It becomes a problem if the grinding media floats on top of the material to be ground.
* Hardness: The grinding media needs to be durable enough to grind the material, but where possible should not be so tough that it also wears down the tumbler at a fast pace.
* Composition: Various grinding applications have special requirements.  Some of these requirements are based on the fact that some of the grinding media will be in the finished product.  Others are based in how the media will react with the material being ground.
* Where the color of the finished product is important, the color and material of the grinding media must be considered.
* Where low contamination is important, the grinding media may be selected for ease of separation from the finished product (i.e.: steel dust produced from stainless steel media can be magnetically separated from non-ferrous products).  An alternative to separation is to use media of the same material as the product being ground.
* Flammable products have a tendency to become [[dust explosion|explosive in powder form]].  Steel media may spark, becoming an ignition source for these products.  Either wet-grinding, or non-sparking media such as [[ceramic]] or [[lead]] must be selected.
* Some media, such as iron, may react with corrosive materials.  For this reason, [[stainless steel]], ceramic, and [[flint]] grinding media may each be used when corrosive substances are present during grinding.

The grinding chamber can also be filled with an inert [[shield gas]] that does not react with the material being ground, to prevent oxidation or explosive reactions that could occur with ambient air inside the mill.

==Advantages of the ball mill==
[[File:Ceramic ball mill before 1945 Thiem and Towe Halle.jpg|thumb|Ceramic ball mill before 1945 [[Thiem&Towe]] [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. Property of Faculty of Chemistry, Gdańsk University of Technology]]
Ball milling boasts several advantages over other systems: the cost of installation and grinding medium is low; it is suitable for both batch and continuous operation, similarly it is suitable for open as well as closed circuit grinding and is applicable for materials of all degrees of hardness.

== Varieties ==
Aside from common ball mills there is a second type of ball mill called a ''planetary ball mill''. Planetary ball mills are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A planetary ball mill consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1).
The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the planetary ball mill.

A '''ball mill''' is a type of [[grinder (milling)|grinder]] used to grind, blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and [[selective laser sintering]].  It works on the principle of  impact and  attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.

A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.  The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal.  It is partially filled with balls.  The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel ([[chrome steel]]), stainless steel, ceramic or rubber.  The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as [[Mangalloy|manganese steel]] or [http://sakarrubtech.com/mill-lining.php rubber lining].  Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills.  The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter.

The general idea behind the ball mill is an ancient one, but it was not until the [[industrial revolution]] and the invention of [[steam power]] that an effective ball milling machine could be built.  It is reported to have been used for grinding flint for pottery in 1870.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kj7PSOqTZ3IC&printsec=frontcover|title=The history of grinding|publisher=SME|year=2005|isbn=0-87335-238-6|author=Lynch, A.|author2=Rowland C}}</ref>

==Working==
In case of continuously operated ball mill, the material to be ground is fed from the left through a 60° cone and the product is discharged through a 30° cone to the right. As the shell rotates, the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they cascade down (or drop down on to the feed), from near the top of the shell. In doing so, the solid particles in between the balls and ground are reduced in size by impact.

==Applications==
The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal, pigments, and feldspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out either wet or dry but the former is performed at low speed. Blending of explosives is an example of an application for rubber balls.<ref name=\"TM_9-1300-214_p10-8\">{{Citation |author=US Army |title=Department of the Army technical manual: military explosives (TM 9-1300-214) |page=10-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODYYAAAAYAAJ&pg=SA10-PA8&dq=%22ball+mill%22+%22rubber+balls%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L9SGVauFJcKyggT8sZnABA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22ball%20mill%22%20%22rubber%20balls%22&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> For systems with multiple components, ball milling has been shown to be effective in increasing [[solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] chemical reactivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Takacs|first1=Laszlo|title=Self-sustaining reactions induced by ball milling|journal=Progress in Materials Science|date=January 2002|volume=47|issue=4|pages=355–414|doi=10.1016/S0079-6425(01)00002-0}}</ref> Additionally, ball milling has been shown effective for production of amorphous materials. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Takacs|first1=Laszlo|title=Self-sustaining reactions induced by ball milling|journal=Progress in Materials Science|date=January 2002|volume=47|issue=4|pages=355–414|doi=10.1016/S0079-6425(01)00002-0}}</ref>

A ball mill, a type of [[grinder (milling)|grinder]], is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like [[ores]], chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including [[ceramic]] balls, [[flint]] pebbles and [[stainless steel]] balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder. Industrial ball mills can operate continuously, fed at one end and discharged at the other end. Large to medium-sized ball mills are mechanically rotated on their axis, but small ones normally consist of a cylindrical capped container that sits on two drive shafts ([[pulleys]] and belts are used to transmit rotary motion). A [[rock tumbler]] functions on the same principle.  Ball mills are also used in [[pyrotechnics]] and the manufacture of [[black powder]], but cannot be used in the preparation of some pyrotechnic mixtures such as [[flash powder]] because of their sensitivity to impact.

'''Cleon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|iː|ɒ|n|,_|-|ə|n}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:Κλέων|Κλέων]]}} ''Kleon'', {{IPA-el|kléɔːn|anc}}; died 422 BC) was an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[strategos|general]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. He was the first prominent representative of the commercial class in Athenian politics, although he was an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] himself. His contemporaries, the historian [[Thucydides]] and the comedic playwright [[Aristophanes]], both represent him as an unscrupulous, warmongering [[demagogue]], but both of them had strong motives to present Cleon unfavorably.

==Public service==
===Opposition to Pericles===
Cleon first came to notice as an opponent of [[Pericles]] in the late 430s BCE through his opposition to Pericles' strategy of refusing battle against the [[Peloponnesian League]] invaders in 431 BCE.  As a result, he found himself acting in concert with the Athenian aristocratic parties, who also had no liking for Pericles. During 430 BCE, after the unsuccessful expedition by Pericles to the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]], and when the city was devastated by the [[Plague of Athens|plague]], Cleon headed the opposition to Pericles' rule. At this time, Pericles was accused by Cleon of maladministration of public money, with the result of Pericles being found guilty and removed from office.<ref>[[George Grote]]. ''History of Greece'', abridged ed., 1907, p.&nbsp;406, note 1</ref> However, Pericles' setback was temporary and he was soon reinstated.

===Rise in popularity===
The death of Pericles from the plague in 429 BCE left the field clear for new leadership in Athens. Hitherto Cleon had only been a vigorous opposition speaker, a trenchant critic and accuser of state officials, but he now came forward as the professed champion and leader of the [[democracy]] and rapidly came to dominate Athenian politics.  Although rough and unpolished, he was charismatic, with natural eloquence and a powerful voice, and he knew how to work upon the emotions of the Athenian populace. He strengthened his support amongst the poorer citizens by increasing the pay for jury work, which provided a livelihood for many of the poorer Athenians.

The fondness of the Athenians for litigation increased his power; and the practice of \"[[sycophant|sycophancy]]\" (raking up material for false charges) enabled him to remove those who were likely to endanger his ascendancy. In 426 BCE, Cleon brought an unsuccessful prosecution against [[Laches (person)|Laches]] based on his [[Strategos|generalship]] in the unsuccessful first Sicilian expedition.  This is one of the very few times that an Athenian general escaped civil punishment for a defeat.  Having no further use for his former aristocratic associates, he broke off all connection with them, and thus felt at liberty to attack the secret combinations for political purposes, the oligarchical clubs to which they mostly belonged. Whether he also introduced a property-tax for military purposes, and even held a high position connected with the treasury, is uncertain.

===War against Sparta, subsequent death===
Cleon's ruling principles were an inveterate hatred of the nobility, and an equal hatred of Sparta. It was mainly through him that the opportunity of concluding an honourable peace (in 425 BCE) was lost, and in his determination to see [[Sparta]] defeated, often spoke of dazzling future benefits. He insisted upon Athenian security via strategic possession of territories rather than by Spartan goodwill.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Peloponnesian_War.html?id=NSDgGwAACAAJ|title=The Peloponnesian War|last=Kagan|first=Donald|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780142004371|language=en}}</ref>

In 427 BCE, Cleon urged his Athenian countrymen to put to death the whole adult male population of [[Mytilene]], which had put itself at the head of a revolt. His proposal, though at first accepted, was soon rescinded due to a protracted rebuttal by [[Diodotus (son of Eucrates)|Diodotus]]. Nonetheless approximately one thousand chief leaders and prominent men of Mytilene were executed. In 425 BCE, Cleon reached the summit of his fame by capturing and transporting to Athens the Spartans who had been blockaded at the [[Battle of Sphacteria]]. Much of the credit was probably due to the military skill of his colleague [[Demosthenes (general)|Demosthenes]] (not the orator); but it was due to Cleon's determination that the [[ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] sent out the additional force that was needed.

It was almost certainly due to Cleon that the tribute of the \"allies\" was doubled in 425 BCE. In 422 BCE he was sent to recapture [[Amphipolis]], but was outmaneuvered by the Spartan general [[Brasidas]]. However, both Brasidas and Cleon were killed at Amphipolis and their deaths removed the chief obstacle to peace. Thus, in 421 BCE the [[peace of Nicias]] was signed.

==Aristophanes and Thucydides on Cleon==
The character of Cleon is represented by [[Aristophanes]]<ref>Cf. Aristophanes, chiefly ''[[The Knights]]'' (864–867: \"You are like the fishers for eels; in still waters they catch nothing, but if they thoroughly stir up the slime, their fishing is good; in the same way it's only in troublous times that you line your pockets.\", etc.), ''[[The Wasps]]'' (esp. 664–712), and most mentions of Cleon in the other plays.</ref> and [[Thucydides]]<ref>Cf. Thucydides, ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', book III (36: \"the most violent man at Athens\", and 37–40 on the Mytilene affair), IV (21: \"a popular leader of the time and very powerful with the multitude\", 22, 27–29 on the Pylos affair), and V (16: \"Cleon and Brasidas, who had been the two principal opponents of peace on either side—the latter from the success and honour which war gave him, the former because he thought that, if tranquillity were restored, his crimes would be more open to detection and his slanders less credited\").</ref> in a very unfavourable light. Their portrayals may be justified considering he instilled a feeling of mistrust within Athens through a kind of Athenian \"[[McCarthyism]]\", caused by the excessive number of informants he employed to keep watch on the city. Yet, both have been suspected of being prejudiced witnesses: The playwright Aristophanes had a grudge against Cleon, who may have accused him before the Council of having ridiculed (in his lost play ''Babylonians'') the policy and institutions of his city in the presence of foreigners and at the time of a great national danger. Thucydides, believing in the shortcomings of democratic government,<ref>A.H.M. Jones, ‘The Athenian democracy and its critics’, ''Cambridge Historical Journey''. 11.1 (1953), 1–26.</ref> had also been prosecuted (unjustly, his ships arriving two days after a town was occupied by Spartan forces) for military incapacity and exiled by a decree proposed by Cleon. Indeed, of all the persons who appear in Thucydides' ''History'', Cleon is treated with the least impartiality.<ref>[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 80</ref> It is therefore possible that Cleon has had injustice done to him in the portraits handed down by these two writers.<ref>\"Cleon\", ''Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition'', vol. IV, p. 495</ref>

His influence lay in his forceful and bullying style of oratory, anti-intellectual and anti-aristocratic in tone, and his [[populism]]. This might have brought him many enemies. He seems to have aimed at short-term goals, but Athens' poor stood to benefit by his policies, at the expense of heavy taxes levied onto her allies.<ref>\"Cleon\", ''Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'', edited by M.C. Howatson and Ian Chilvers, Oxford University Press</ref>

Aristophanes, chiefly ''[[The Knights]]'' (864–867: \"You are like the fishers for eels; in still waters they catch nothing, but if they thoroughly stir up the slime, their fishing is good; in the same way it's only in troublous times that you line your pockets.\", etc.), ''[[The Wasps]]'' (esp. 664–712), and most mentions of Cleon in the other plays.</ref> and [[Thucydides]]<ref>Cf. Thucydides, ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', book III (36: \"the most violent man at Athens\", and 37–40 on the Mytilene affair), IV (21: \"a popular leader of the time and very powerful with the multitude\", 22, 27–29 on the Pylos affair), and V (16: \"Cleon and Brasidas, who had been the two principal opponents of peace on either side—the latter from the success and honour which war gave him, the former because he thought that, if tranquillity were restored, his crimes would be more open to detection and his slanders less credited\").</ref> in a very unfavourable light. Their portrayals may be justified considering he instilled a feeling of mistrust within Athens through a kind of Athenian \"[[McCarthyism]]\", caused by the excessive number of informants he employed to keep watch on the city. Yet, both have been suspected of being prejudiced witnesses: The playwright Aristophanes had a grudge against Cleon, who may have accused him before the Council of having ridiculed (in his lost play ''Babylonians'') the policy and institutions of his city in the presence of foreigners and at the time of a great national danger. Thucydides, believing in the shortcomings of democratic government,<ref>A.H.M. Jones, ‘The Athenian democracy and its critics’, ''Cambridge Historical Journey''. 11.1 (1953), 1–26.</ref> had also been prosecuted (unjustly, his ships arriving two days after a town was occupied by Spartan forces) for military incapacity and exiled by a decree proposed by Cleon. Indeed, of all the persons who appear in Thucydides' ''History'', Cleon is treated with the least impartiality.<ref>[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 80</ref> It is therefore possible that Cleon has had injustice done to him in the portraits handed down by these two writers.<ref>\"Cleon\", ''Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition'', vol. IV, p. 495</ref>

His influence lay in his forceful and bullying style of oratory, anti-intellectual and anti-aristocratic in tone, and his [[populism]]. This might have brought him many enemies. He seems to have aimed at short-term goals, but Athens' poor stood to benefit by his policies, at the expense of heavy taxes levied onto her allies.<ref>\"Cleon\", ''Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'', edited by M.C. Howatson and Ian Chilvers, Oxford University Press</ref>

'''Cooter''' is a city in [[Pemiscot County, Missouri|Pemiscot County]], [[Missouri]], United States. The population was 469 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
According to Houck's History of Missouri, the town of Cooter was named in 1854 for the Madame Coutre, the owner of a brothel that served travelers that passed through the Missouri Bootheel. Madame Coutre is believed to have emigrated from [[France]] in the mid-1700s to the Franco-American village of [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve, Missouri]]. Marie Coutre travelled inland westward, and in 1795 is listed in documents as being a merchant and tavern owner in the area of present-day Cooter. 

She was famous for her extra large vaginal labia that were sought out by riverboat crewmen looking for company. It was due to her renown vagina that cooter entered American English as a slang word. Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, was said to have paid for \"some cooter\" at least four times during his career as a riverboat pilot. Madame Marie Coutre ran the brothel until her death in 1812. Her daughter, Joan Cooter, took over the family business, which lasted five generations.

The Cooter Tavern Inn was shutdown in 1929 by a crack team of FBI agents enforcing Prohibition laws. The brothel was demolished, but the town retains the name of its legendary founder.<ref>A History of Missouri Vol. 2, by Louis Houck. Published by R.R. Donnelley & Sons, Chicago, 1908.{{quotation requested|date=November 2016}}</ref>

'''James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle''' [[Order of the Bath|KB]] (c. 1580{{snd}}March 1636) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British nobility|noble]].

==Life==
A Scot, he was the son of Sir James Hay of Fingask, second son of Peter Hay of [[Megginch Castle|Megginch]] (a branch member of Hay of Leys, a younger branch of the Erroll family) and his wife Margaret, daughter of Crichton of Ruthven.<ref name=JS>[https://digital.nls.uk/histories-of-scottish-families/archive/95428023?mode=transcription ''Historical Account of the Family of Hay of Leys''], (Edinburgh, 1832), pp. 20-1. Accessed January 2020.</ref> His mother was Margaret Murray, cousin of [[George Hay, 1st Earl of Kinnoull|George Hay]], afterwards [[George Hay, 1st Earl of Kinnoull|1st Earl of Kinnoull]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=339}}

His aunts married well and had two well regarded uncles. His uncle Peter Hay of Megginch married Margaret Ogilvie, daughter of Sir Patrick Ogilvie of Inch, and are the ancestors of the later [[Earls of Kinnoull]] via their son, his first cousin Peter of Kirklands of Megginch.<ref name=JS /> His uncle Edmund Hay was Professor of Scots Law at [[University_of_Douai|Douay]].<ref name=JS />

He was knighted and taken into favour by [[James VI of Scotland]], brought into England in 1603, treated as a \"prime favourite\" and made a gentleman of the bedchamber. In 1604, he was sent on a mission to France and pleaded for the Huguenots, which annoyed [[Henry IV of France]] and caused a substantial reduction of the present made to the English envoy. On 21 June 1606, he was created by patent a baron for life with precedence next to the barons, but without a place or voice in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], no doubt to render his advancement less unpalatable to the English lords.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=339}}

The king bestowed on him numerous grants, paid his debts, and secured for him a rich bride in the person of Honoria, only daughter and heir of [[Edward Denny, 1st Earl of Norwich|Edward, Lord Denny]]. Their marriage was celebrated by ''[[Lord Hay's Masque]],'' staged on 6 January 1607. On 9 February 1608 he performed in the masque ''[[The Hue and Cry After Cupid]]'' at [[Whitehall Palace]] as a sign of the zodiac, to celebrate the wedding of [[John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness|John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington]] to Elizabeth Radclyffe.<ref>Edmund Lodge, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 3 (London, 1838), p. 223.</ref> In 1610 he was made a knight of the [[Order of the Bath]], and in 1613 master of the wardrobe, while in 1615 he was created Lord Hay of [[Sawley, Lancashire|Sawley]], and took his seat in the [[House of Lords]]. At this time, his first wife Honora was buried 16 August 1614 at Waltham Abbey.  He was sent to France next year to negotiate the marriage of Princess Christina with [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], and on his return, being now a widower, he was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=339}}  

In February 1617 he presented a masque by [[Ben Jonson]], ''[[Lovers Made Men]]'', to the French ambassador [[Charles Cauchon de Maupas|Baron de Tour]] at his house in London. The performance was staged by the [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford|Countess of Bedford]] and said to have cost £2200.<ref>Norman Egbert McClure, ''The Letters of John Chamberlain'', vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), pp. 51, 55, 57.</ref> Later that year, he married Lady Lucy Percy (1599–1660), daughter of [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]] (the famous \"Wizard Earl\"), by his wife [[Dorothy Percy, Countess of Northumberland|Dorothy Devereux]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=339}}

[[File:Coat of arms of Sir James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, KG.png|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Sir James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, KG]]
In 1618 he resigned the mastership of the wardrobe for a large sum in compensation. He was created Viscount Doncaster, and in February 1619 was despatched on a mission to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]], where during the beginning [[Thirty Years' War]] he identified himself with the cause of the \"Winter King\", Elector [[Frederick V of the Palatinate]], and urged James to make war in his support. In 1621 and 1622 he was sent to [[Kingdom of France|France]] to obtain peace for the [[Huguenots]] from [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], in which he was unsuccessful, and in September 1622 was created [[Earl of Carlisle]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=339}}

Next year he went to [[Paris]] on the occasion of Prince Charles's journey to [[Madrid]], and again in 1624 to join [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|Henry Rich]], afterwards Lord Holland, in negotiating the prince's marriage with [[Henrietta Maria]], when he advised James without success to resist [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]'s demands on the subject of religious toleration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=339}} In 1624 he was made a knight of the [[Order of the Garter]]. Charles's marriage in 1625 was [[Proxy marriage|by proxy]], so the wedding contract was signed by Carlisle and Holland. The king's representative at the actual wedding was [[Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Chevreuse|the duke of Chevreuse]], yet Carlisle and Holland acted as witnesses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Carlisle became gentleman of the bedchamber to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] after his accession. In 1628, after the failure of the expedition to [[Isle of Rhe|Rhe]], he was sent to make a diversion against [[Cardinal Richelieu]] in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]; he counselled peace with Spain and the vigorous prosecution of the war with France, but on his return home found his advice neglected. He took no further part in public life, and died in March 1636.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=339–340}}

Carlisle was a man of good sense and of accommodating temper, with some diplomatic ability. His extravagance and lavish expenditure, his double suppers and costly entertainments, were the theme of satirists and wonder of society, and his debts were said at his death to amount to more than £80,000. He left behind him, says [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]], a reputation of a very fine gentleman and a most accomplished courtier, and after having spent, in a very jovial life, above £400,000, which upon a strict computation he received from the crown, he left not a house or acre of land to be remembered by.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}}

==Colonial proprietor==
Hay by 1612 was a director of the [[Virginia Company]].<ref>Schreiber, p. 168.</ref> He was a patentee and councillor of the plantation of [[New England]], and showed great interest in the colonies.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=339}}

Carlise also had an interest in the Caribbean.

The first earl was succeeded by James, his only surviving son by his first wife.

==Family==
Hay's first wife was Honoria Denny. His second wife, [[Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle]], was involved in many conspiracies, or allegations thereof, during the [[English Civil War]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}}

The first earl was succeeded by James, his only surviving son by his first wife.  James married Margaret Russell, third daughter of [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford]], but James died without issue on 30 October 1660. At his death, the peerage became extinct in the Hay family.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}} The Hay Family currently spans across the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

'''Song Machine''' is a series of [[single (music)|singles]] and [[music video]]s releasing in 2020, by British [[virtual band]] [[Gorillaz]]. The project marks the first release with [[Remi Kabaka Jr.]] as an official band member,<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Hewlett |first=Denholm |date=24 December 2019 |title=Gorillaz: Reject False Icons (Director's Cut) |medium=Motion picture |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=qGKgMuYKqf4 |access-date=5 January 2020 |time=23:32 |location=YouTube |publisher=Gorillaz}}</ref> as well as the return of the character [[Murdoc Niccals]] in promotional material, after his absence from ''[[The Now Now]]'' in 2018. The project began with \"[[Momentary Bliss]]\", which featured rapper [[Slowthai]] & punk rock band [[Slaves (UK band)|Slaves]], on 30 January, and is expected to continue until the end of the year.<ref name=\"nastylittleman1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nastylittleman.com/artists/gorillaz/|title=GORILLAZ {{!}} Nasty Little Man|website=www.nastylittleman.com|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

==Background==
On 28 January, the band officially released images via social media teasing a concept entitled ''Song Machine''.  A 23-second promotional single entitled \"Song Machine Theme Tune\" was released on streaming services with an accompanying video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2071709/gorillaz-song-machine-season-one-tease/news/|title=Gorillaz Are Teasing Something Called 'Song Machine'|date=2020-01-28|website=Stereogum|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>
Damon Albarn and [[Remi Kabaka Jr.|Remi Kabaka]] spoke to [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Annie Mac]] for the official premiere, saying that ''Song Machine'' \"may have an obtuse narrative arc at the end of each season, but it's more ''[[Ozark (TV series)|Ozark]]'', than ''[[Designated Survivor (TV series)|Designated Survivor]]''. You just keep going until you run out of ideas.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/gorillaz-slowthai-slaves-momentary-bliss-song-machine-945697/|title=Gorillaz Debut 'Song Machine' Series With 'Momentary Bliss'|first1=Jon|last1=Blistein|first2=Jon|last2=Blistein|date=January 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2020/01/31/watch-gorillaz-new-video-momentary-bliss-featuring-slowthai-slaves|title=Gorillaz unveil 'Momentary Bliss' video, featuring slowthai and Slaves|website=diymag.com}}</ref>

Upon the premiere of \"Momentary Bliss\", Albarn revealed that the group had been in the studio with [[ScHoolboy Q]] and [[Sampa the Great]] among others, although he did say that these songs were likely to be saved for future series of ''Song Machine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000drwj |title=Radio 1's Future Sounds with Annie Mac - Gorillaz, slowthai and Slaves - BBC Sounds |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2020-02-27}}</ref> The group also teased a possible collaboration with Australian band [[Tame Impala]] on [[Instagram]].<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/music/gorillaz-tease-tame-impala-collaboration-as-song-machine-project-continues-2603985]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>
A press release was put out to explain Song Machine further, with virtual Gorillaz member Russel Hobbs saying: \"''Song Machine'' is a whole new way of doing what we do, Gorillaz breaking the mould 'cos the mould got old. World is moving faster than a supercharged particle, so we’ve gotta stay ready to drop. We don’t even know who's stepping through the studio next. ''Song Machine'' feeds on the unknown, runs on pure chaos. So whatever the hell’s coming, we’re primed and ready to produce like there’s no tomorrow.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/song-machine-gorillaz-team-up-with-slowthai-and-slaves-for-new-online-series-2602750|title=Song Machine: Gorillaz team up with Slowthai and Slaves for new online series|date=January 29, 2020}}</ref>

In 1952 he was appointed First secretary of the party district leadership at [[Ribnitz-Damgarten]] on the north coast.   Then, in December 1952, he was relieved of his functions \"on account of gross breach of party rules\".<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenWK/><ref>''\"wegen grober Verletzung des Parteistatuts\"''</ref>

Nevertheless, between 1953 and 1958 he was second and then first secretary to the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] district leadership at [[Greifswald]], then till 1960 he was secretary for [[Agitprop|Agitation and Propaganda]] for the party district leadership in the [[Rostock]] region in succession to [[:de:Karl Zylla|Karl Zylla]]<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenWK/> before, in 1973, moving to the other end of the country and taking a position as First Secretary of the [[Dresden]] district leadership, where his predecessor had been [[:de:Fritz Reuter (Politiker)|Fritz Reuter]].<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenWK/>

===National politics===
In 1963 Krolikowski became a member of the Party Central Committee, and in 1970 he became a member of the national [[People's Chamber|People's Chamber ''(\"Volkskammer\")'']],<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenWK/> where his responsibilities included membership of the assembly's National Defence Committee.   In 1971 he joined the party politburo's central committee.   Between 1973 and 1976 he was Secretary of the Party's Central Committee, and from 1976 right up till 1989 he was a member of the Economics Commission and of Central Committee Working Groups on the Balance of Payments and on inter-German Economic Relations.<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenWK/>   From 1976 till 1988 he was First Deputy Chairman of the [[German Democratic Republic]]'s [[Council of Ministers of the GDR|Ministerial Council]].   In 1988, following the sudden death of [[:de:Werner Felfe|Werner Felfe]] (who had suffered the misfortune to be identified in western media as a possible successor to [[Erich Honecker|First Secretary Erich Honecker)]] Krolikowski regained the Central Committee secretaryship for agriculture.<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenWK/>

===Various reverses===
In November 1989 [[Die Wende|The Wall came down.]]  In November 1989 Werner Krolikowski resigned from his various public offices and on 3 December 1989 he was expelled from what had till very recently been the unchallenged [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|ruling party]] in [[East Germany]].   An investigation was launched, based on \"suspicions of abuse of office and corruption\" (''\"Verdachts auf Amtsmißbrauch u. Korruption\"'').   In May 1990 he was charged with \"misappropriation of state funds\" (''\"Veruntreuung von Staatsgeldern\"'') and arrested before being released on bail.   However, the case was dropped on health grounds.<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenWK/>

==The ambassador's insight==
The extent to which [[East Germany]]'s leader [[Erich Honecker]] and his inner circle felt unsettled and undermined by on-going [[Perestroika]] in the [[Soviet Union]] became more widely known after Honecker himself had retired.   The Soviet ambassador in [[East Berlin]] from 1983 till 1990 was a man called [[Vyacheslav Kochemasov]], a diplomat whose experience of politics in [[Moscow]] and in [[East Berlin]] went back a long way.   He gave an interview to the western press in 1992 in which he disclosed that as far back as 1986 Werner Krolikowski had told him, in confidence, that the situation in the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] Politburo had become \"unbearable\":  policy decisions were totally driven by dogma, there was no longer any discussion, there was an absurd level of centralisation and an utterly implausible communications strategy.  Something must be done:  the leader must be replaced.<ref name=spiegel471992> {{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13681231.html |author1=Publisher-editor [[Rudolf Augstein]]|author2=|title=Schmeichelei und Unterwürfigkeit  SPIEGEL-Interview mit Moskaus Ex-Botschafter in der DDR, Wjatscheslaw Kotschemassow, über Erich Honecker|publisher= [[Der Spiegel]] (online)|date=16 November 1992|accessdate= 26 November 2014}}</ref>

==Werner's brother==
Werner Krolikowski's elder brother, [[Herbert Krolikowski]] (1924-2012) was also an East German politician of eminence.

'''Song Machine''' is a series of [[single (music)|singles]] and [[music video]]s releasing in 2020, by British [[virtual band]] [[Gorillaz]]. The project marks the first release with [[Remi Kabaka Jr.]] as an official band member,<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Hewlett |first=Denholm |date=24 December 2019 |title=Gorillaz: Reject False Icons (Director's Cut) |medium=Motion picture |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=qGKgMuYKqf4 |access-date=5 January 2020 |time=23:32 |location=YouTube |publisher=Gorillaz}}</ref> as well as the return of the character [[Murdoc Niccals]] in promotional material, after his absence from ''[[The Now Now]]'' in 2018. The project began with \"[[Momentary Bliss]]\", which featured rapper [[Slowthai]] & punk rock band [[Slaves (UK band)|Slaves]], on 30 January, and is expected to continue until the end of the year.<ref name=\"nastylittleman1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nastylittleman.com/artists/gorillaz/|title=GORILLAZ {{!}} Nasty Little Man|website=www.nastylittleman.com|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

==Background==
On 28 January, the band officially released images via social media teasing a concept entitled ''Song Machine''.  A 23-second promotional single entitled \"Song Machine Theme Tune\" was released on streaming services with an accompanying video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2071709/gorillaz-song-machine-season-one-tease/news/|title=Gorillaz Are Teasing Something Called 'Song Machine'|date=2020-01-28|website=Stereogum|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>
Damon Albarn and [[Remi Kabaka Jr.|Remi Kabaka]] spoke to [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Annie Mac]] for the official premiere, saying that ''Song Machine'' \"may have an obtuse narrative arc at the end of each season, but it's more ''[[Ozark (TV series)|Ozark]]'', than ''[[Designated Survivor (TV series)|Designated Survivor]]''. You just keep going until you run out of ideas.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/gorillaz-slowthai-slaves-momentary-bliss-song-machine-945697/|title=Gorillaz Debut 'Song Machine' Series With 'Momentary Bliss'|first1=Jon|last1=Blistein|first2=Jon|last2=Blistein|date=January 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2020/01/31/watch-gorillaz-new-video-momentary-bliss-featuring-slowthai-slaves|title=Gorillaz unveil 'Momentary Bliss' video, featuring slowthai and Slaves|website=diymag.com}}</ref>

Upon the premiere of \"Momentary Bliss\", Albarn revealed that the group had been in the studio with [[ScHoolboy Q]] and [[Sampa the Great]] among others, although he did say that these songs were likely to be saved for future series of ''Song Machine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000drwj |title=Radio 1's Future Sounds with Annie Mac - Gorillaz, slowthai and Slaves - BBC Sounds |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2020-02-27}}</ref> The group also teased a possible collaboration with Australian band [[Tame Impala]] on [[Instagram]].<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/music/gorillaz-tease-tame-impala-collaboration-as-song-machine-project-continues-2603985]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>
A press release was put out to explain Song Machine further, with virtual Gorillaz member Russel Hobbs saying: \"''Song Machine'' is a whole new way of doing what we do, Gorillaz breaking the mould 'cos the mould got old. World is moving faster than a supercharged particle, so we’ve gotta stay ready to drop. We don’t even know who's stepping through the studio next. ''Song Machine'' feeds on the unknown, runs on pure chaos. So whatever the hell’s coming, we’re primed and ready to produce like there’s no tomorrow.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/song-machine-gorillaz-team-up-with-slowthai-and-slaves-for-new-online-series-2602750|title=Song Machine: Gorillaz team up with Slowthai and Slaves for new online series|date=January 29, 2020}}</ref>

'''Song Machine''' is a series of [[single (music)|singles]] and [[music video]]s releasing in 2020, by British [[virtual band]] [[Gorillaz]]. The project marks the first release with [[Remi Kabaka Jr.]] as an official band member,<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Hewlett |first=Denholm |date=24 December 2019 |title=Gorillaz: Reject False Icons (Director's Cut) |medium=Motion picture |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=qGKgMuYKqf4 |access-date=5 January 2020 |time=23:32 |location=YouTube |publisher=Gorillaz}}</ref> as well as the return of the character [[Murdoc Niccals]] in promotional material, after his absence from ''[[The Now Now]]'' in 2018. The project began with \"[[Momentary Bliss]]\", which featured rapper [[Slowthai]] & punk rock band [[Slaves (UK band)|Slaves]], on 30 January, and is expected to continue until the end of the year.<ref name=\"nastylittleman1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nastylittleman.com/artists/gorillaz/|title=GORILLAZ {{!}} Nasty Little Man|website=www.nastylittleman.com|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

==Background==
On 28 January, the band officially released images via social media teasing a concept entitled ''Song Machine''.  A 23-second promotional single entitled \"Song Machine Theme Tune\" was released on streaming services with an accompanying video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2071709/gorillaz-song-machine-season-one-tease/news/|title=Gorillaz Are Teasing Something Called 'Song Machine'|date=2020-01-28|website=Stereogum|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>
Damon Albarn and [[Remi Kabaka Jr.|Remi Kabaka]] spoke to [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Annie Mac]] for the official premiere, saying that ''Song Machine'' \"may have an obtuse narrative arc at the end of each season, but it's more ''[[Ozark (TV series)|Ozark]]'', than ''[[Designated Survivor (TV series)|Designated Survivor]]''. You just keep going until you run out of ideas.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/gorillaz-slowthai-slaves-momentary-bliss-song-machine-945697/|title=Gorillaz Debut 'Song Machine' Series With 'Momentary Bliss'|first1=Jon|last1=Blistein|first2=Jon|last2=Blistein|date=January 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2020/01/31/watch-gorillaz-new-video-momentary-bliss-featuring-slowthai-slaves|title=Gorillaz unveil 'Momentary Bliss' video, featuring slowthai and Slaves|website=diymag.com}}</ref>

Upon the premiere of \"Momentary Bliss\", Albarn revealed that the group had been in the studio with [[ScHoolboy Q]] and [[Sampa the Great]] among others, although he did say that these songs were likely to be saved for future series of ''Song Machine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000drwj |title=Radio 1's Future Sounds with Annie Mac - Gorillaz, slowthai and Slaves - BBC Sounds |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2020-02-27}}</ref> The group also teased a possible collaboration with Australian band [[Tame Impala]] on [[Instagram]].<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/music/gorillaz-tease-tame-impala-collaboration-as-song-machine-project-continues-2603985]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>
A press release was put out to explain Song Machine further, with virtual Gorillaz member Russel Hobbs saying: \"''Song Machine'' is a whole new way of doing what we do, Gorillaz breaking the mould 'cos the mould got old. World is moving faster than a supercharged particle, so we’ve gotta stay ready to drop. We don’t even know who's stepping through the studio next. ''Song Machine'' feeds on the unknown, runs on pure chaos. So whatever the hell’s coming, we’re primed and ready to produce like there’s no tomorrow.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/song-machine-gorillaz-team-up-with-slowthai-and-slaves-for-new-online-series-2602750|title=Song Machine: Gorillaz team up with Slowthai and Slaves for new online series|date=January 29, 2020}}</ref>

Until recently, most studies on [[time travel]] are based upon [[classical physics|classical]] [[general relativity]]. Coming up with a quantum version of time travel requires us to figure out the time evolution equations for [[density state]]s in the presence of [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTC).

However, it has been noted such solutions are not unique in general, in violation of [[determinism]], [[unitarity]] and [[linearity]].

The application of self-consistency to quantum mechanical time machines has taken two main routes. [[Novikov self-consistency principle|Novikov's rule]] applied to the density matrix itself gives the Deutsch prescription. Applied instead to the state vector, the same rule gives nonunitary physics with a dual description in terms of post-selection.

</ref> came up with a proposal for the time evolution equations, with special note as to how it resolves the [[grandfather paradox]] and nondeterminism. However, his resolution to the grandfather paradox is considered unsatisfactory to some people, because it states the time traveller reenters another [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universe]], and that the actual [[quantum state]] is a [[quantum superposition]] of states where the time traveller does and does not exist.

He made the simplifying assumption that we can split the quantum system into a subsystem A external to the closed timelike curve, and a CTC part. Also, he assumed that we can combine all the time evolution between the exterior and the CTC into a single [[unitary operator]] ''U''. This presupposes the [[Schrödinger picture]]. We have a [[tensor product]] for the combined state of both systems. He makes the further assumption there is no correlation between the initial density state of A and the density state of the CTC. This assumption is not time-symmetric, which he tried to justify by appealing to measurement theory and the second law of thermodynamics. He proposed that the density state restricted to the CTC is a fixed-point of
:<math>\\rho_{\\text{CTC}} = \\text{Tr}_A \\left[ U \\left( \\rho_A \\otimes \\rho_{\\text{CTC}} \\right) U^\\dagger\\right]</math>.
He showed that such [[Renormalization group|fixed points]] always exist. He justified this choice by noting the [[expectation value]] of any CTC observable will match after a loop. However, this could lead to \"multivalued\" histories if memory is preserved around the loop. In particular, his prescription is incompatible with [[path integral formulation|path integrals]] unless we allow for multivalued fields. Another point to note is in general, we have more than one fixed point, and this leads to [[Indeterminism|nondeterminism]] in the time evolution. He suggested the solution use is the one with the [[maximum entropy principle|maximum entropy]]. The final external state is given by <math>\\text{Tr}_{\\text{CTC}} \\left[ U \\left( \\rho_A \\otimes \\rho_{\\text{CTC}} \\right) U^\\dagger\\right]</math>. Pure states can evolve into mixed states.

This leads to seemingly paradoxical resolutions to the grandfather paradox. Assume the external subsystem is irrelevant, and only a qubit travels in the CTC. Also, assume during the course around the time machine, the value of the qubit is flipped according to the unitary operator
:<math>U = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>.
The most general fixed-point solution is given by
:<math>\\rho_{\\text{CTC}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{2} & a\\\\a & \\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}</math>
where ''a'' is a real number between <math>-1/2</math> and <math>1/2</math>. This is an example of the nonuniqueness of solutions. The solution maximizing the [[von Neumann entropy]] is given by <math>a=0</math>. We can think of this as a mixture (not superposition) between the states <math>\\left( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\right)/\\sqrt{2}</math> and <math>\\left( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle - \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\right)/\\sqrt{2}</math>. This leads to an interesting interpretation that if the qubit starts off with a value of 0, it will end up with a value of 1, and vice versa, but this should not be problematic according to Deutsch because the qubit ends up in a different parallel universe in the [[many worlds interpretation]].

Later researchers have noted that if his prescription turned out to be right, computers in the vicinity of a time machine can solve [[PSPACE-complete]] problems.<ref>{{cite journal

However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of [[general relativity]].<ref>{{cite journal

The final external state is given by <math>\\text{Tr}_{\\text{CTC}} \\left[ U \\left( \\rho_A \\otimes \\rho_{\\text{CTC}} \\right) U^\\dagger\\right]</math>. Pure states can evolve into mixed states.

This leads to seemingly paradoxical resolutions to the grandfather paradox. Assume the external subsystem is irrelevant, and only a qubit travels in the CTC. Also assume during the course around the time machine, the value of the qubit is flipped according to the unitary operator
:<math>U = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>.
The most general fixed-point solution is given by
:<math>\\rho_{\\text{CTC}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{2} & a\\\\a & \\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}</math>
where ''a'' is a real number between <math>-1/2</math> and <math>1/2</math>. This is an example of the nonuniqueness of solutions. The solution maximizing the [[von Neumann entropy]] is given by <math>a=0</math>. We can think of this as a mixture (not superposition) between the states <math>\\left( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\right)/\\sqrt{2}</math> and <math>\\left( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle - \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\right)/\\sqrt{2}</math>. This leads to an interesting interpretation that if the qubit starts off with a value of 0, it will end up with a value of 1, and vice versa, but this should not be problematic according to Deutsch because the qubit ends up in a different parallel universe in the [[many worlds interpretation]].

Later researchers have noted that if his prescription turned out to be right, computers in the vicinity of a time machine can solve [[PSPACE-complete]] problems.<ref>{{cite journal

However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of [[general relativity]].<ref>{{cite journal

He assumed it is ill-defined to speak of the actual density state of the CTC itself, and we should only focus upon the density state outside the CTC. His proposal for the time evolution of the external density state is
:<math>\\rho_f = \\frac{C\\rho_i C^\\dagger}{\\text{Tr}\\left[ C\\rho_i C^\\dagger\\right]}</math>, where <math>C = \\text{Tr}_{\\text{CTC}}\\left[ U \\right]</math>.
If <math>\\text{Tr}\\left[ C\\rho_i C^\\dagger\\right]=0</math>, no solution exists due to [[destructive interference]] in the path integral. For instance, the grandfather paradox has no solution, and leads to an inconsistent state. If a solution exists, it is clearly unique. Now, [[quantum computer]]s using time machines can only solve [[PP (complexity)#Complete problems and other properties|PP-complete]] problems.

}}</ref> The same model with the introduction of a noise term allowing for inexact periodicity, allows the grandfather paradox to be resolved, and clarifies the computational power of a time machine assisted computer. Each time traveling qubit has an associated [[negentropy]], given approximately by the logarithm of the noise of the communication channel. Each use of the time machine can be used to extract as much work from a thermal bath. In a brute force search for a randomly generated password, the entropy of the unknown string can be effectively reduced by a similar amount. Because the negentropy and computational power diverge as the noise term goes to zero, complexity class may not be the best way to describe the capabilities of time machines.
