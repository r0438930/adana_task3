The retroviral envelope serves three distinct functions: protection from the extracellular environment via the [[lipid bilayer]], enabling the retrovirus to enter/exit host cells through [[endosomal membrane trafficking]], and the ability to directly enter cells by fusing with their membranes.\n* [[RNA]]: consists of a [[dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] RNA. It has a cap at the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|5']] end and a poly(A) tail at the 3' end. The RNA genome also has terminal noncoding regions, which are important in replication, and internal regions that encode [[virion]] proteins for [[gene expression]]. The 5' end includes four regions, which are R, U5, PBS, and L.  The R region is a short repeated sequence at each end of the genome used during the [[reverse transcription]]  to ensure correct end-to-end transfer in the growing chain. U5, on the other hand, is a short unique sequence between R and PBS. PBS (primer binding site) consists of 18 bases complementary to 3' end of tRNA primer. L region is an untranslated leader region that gives the signal for packaging of the genome RNA. The 3' end includes 3 regions, which are PPT (polypurine tract), U3, and R. The PPT is a primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis during [[reverse transcription]]. U3 is a sequence between PPT and R, which serves as a signal that the provirus can use in [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. R is the terminal repeated sequence at 3' end.\n* [[Protein]]s: consisting of gag proteins, [[protease]] (PR), pol proteins, and env proteins.\n**[[Group-specific antigen]] (gag) proteins are major components of the viral [[capsid]], which are about 2000\u20134000 copies per virion. Gag possesses two nucleic acid binding domains, including matrix (MA) and nucleocapsid (NC). Specifically recognizing, binding, and packaging the retroviral genomic RNA into assembling virions is one of the important functions of Gag protein.

There are two strands of RNA within the cell that have three enzymes: protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase (1). The first step of replication is the binding of the glycoprotein to the receptor protein (2). Once these have been bound, the cell membrane degrades, becoming part of the host cell, and the RNA strands and enzymes enter the cell (3). Within the cell, reverse transcriptase creates a complementary strand of DNA from the retrovirus RNA and the RNA is degraded; this strand of DNA is known as cDNA (4). The cDNA is then replicated, and the two strands form a weak bond and enter the nucleus (5). Once in the nucleus, the DNA is integrated into the host cell's DNA with the help of integrase (6). This cell can either stay dormant, or RNA may be synthesized from the DNA and used to create the proteins for a new retrovirus (7). Ribosome units are used to translate the mRNA of the virus into the amino acid sequences which can be made into proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This step will also make viral enzymes and capsid proteins (8). Viral RNA will be made in the nucleus. These pieces are then gathered together and are pinched off of the cell membrane as a new retrovirus (9).]]\nWhen retroviruses have integrated their own genome into the [[germline|germ line]], their genome is [[inheritance|passed on]] to a following generation. These [[endogenous retrovirus]]es (ERVs), contrasted with [[exogenous DNA|exogenous]] ones, now make up 5-8% of the human genome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Belshaw R, Pereira V, Katzourakis A, Talbot G, Paces J, Burt A, Tristem M | title = Long-term reinfection of the human genome by endogenous retroviruses | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 14 | pages = 4894\u20139 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15044706 | pmc = 387345 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0307800101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.4894B }}</ref> Most insertions have no known function and are often referred to as \"[[junk DNA]]\".

The term \"retro\" in retrovirus refers to this reversal (making DNA from RNA) of the usual direction of transcription.  It still obeys the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which states that information can be transferred from nucleic acid to nucleic acid but cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid. Reverse transcriptase activity outside of retroviruses has been found in almost all [[eukaryote]]s, enabling the generation and insertion of new copies of [[retrotransposon]]s into the host genome. These inserts are transcribed by enzymes of the host into new RNA molecules that enter the cytosol. Next, some of these RNA molecules are translated into viral proteins. For example, the ''gag'' gene is translated into molecules of the capsid protein, the ''pol'' gene is translated into molecules of reverse transcriptase, and the ''env'' gene is translated into molecules of the envelope protein. It is important to note that a retrovirus must \"bring\" its own reverse transcriptase in its [[capsid]], otherwise it is unable to utilize the enzymes of the infected cell to carry out the task, due to the unusual nature of producing DNA from RNA.\n\nIndustrial drugs that are designed as protease and [[reverse-transcriptase inhibitor]]s are made such that they target specific sites and sequences within their respective enzymes.  However these drugs can quickly become ineffective due to the fact that the gene sequences that code for the protease and the reverse transcriptase quickly mutate. These changes in bases cause specific codons and sites with the enzymes to change and thereby avoid drug targeting by losing the sites that the drug actually targets.\n\nBecause reverse transcription lacks the usual [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] of DNA replication, a retrovirus [[mutate]]s very often. This enables the virus to grow [[immunology|resistant]] to antiviral pharmaceuticals quickly, and impedes the development of effective [[vaccines]] and inhibitors for the retrovirus.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Svarovskaia ES, Cheslock SR, Zhang WH, Hu WS, Pathak VK | title = Retroviral mutation rates and reverse transcriptase fidelity | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 8 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = d117-34 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12456349 | doi = 10.2741/957 }}</ref>\n\nOne difficulty faced with some retroviruses, such as the Moloney retrovirus, involves the requirement for cells to be actively dividing for transduction.

This gives rise to a concern that insertional mutagenesis due to integration into the host genome might lead to cancer or leukemia. This is unlike ''[[Lentivirus]]'', a genus of ''Retroviridae'', which are able to integrate their RNA into the genome of non-dividing host cells.\n\n===Recombination===\n\nTwo [[RNA]] [[genome]]s are packaged into each retrovirus particle, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one [[provirus]].<ref name = Rawson2018>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rawson JM, Nikolaitchik OA, Keele BF, Pathak VK, Hu WS | title = Recombination is required for efficient HIV-1 replication and the maintenance of viral genome integrity | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 46 | issue = 20 | pages = 10535\u201310545 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30307534 | pmc = 6237782 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gky910 }}</ref>  After infection, [[reverse transcriptase|reverse transcription]] occurs and this process is accompanied by [[homologous recombination|recombination]].

The retroviral envelope serves three distinct functions: protection from the extracellular environment via the [[lipid bilayer]], enabling the retrovirus to enter/exit host cells through [[endosomal membrane trafficking]], and the ability to directly enter cells by fusing with their membranes.\n* [[RNA]]: consists of a [[dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] RNA. It has a cap at the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|5']] end and a poly(A) tail at the 3' end. The RNA genome also has terminal noncoding regions, which are important in replication, and internal regions that encode [[virion]] proteins for [[gene expression]]. The 5' end includes four regions, which are R, U5, PBS, and L.  The R region is a short repeated sequence at each end of the genome used during the [[reverse transcription]]  to ensure correct end-to-end transfer in the growing chain. U5, on the other hand, is a short unique sequence between R and PBS. PBS (primer binding site) consists of 18 bases complementary to 3' end of tRNA primer. L region is an untranslated leader region that gives the signal for packaging of the genome RNA. The 3' end includes 3 regions, which are PPT (polypurine tract), U3, and R. The PPT is a primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis during [[reverse transcription]]. U3 is a sequence between PPT and R, which serves as a signal that the provirus can use in [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. R is the terminal repeated sequence at 3' end.\n* [[Protein]]s: consisting of gag proteins, [[protease]] (PR), pol proteins, and env proteins.\n**[[Group-specific antigen]] (gag) proteins are major components of the viral [[capsid]], which are about 2000\u20134000 copies per virion.

There are two strands of RNA within the cell that have three enzymes: protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase (1). The first step of replication is the binding of the glycoprotein to the receptor protein (2). Once these have been bound, the cell membrane degrades, becoming part of the host cell, and the RNA strands and enzymes enter the cell (3). Within the cell, reverse transcriptase creates a complementary strand of DNA from the retrovirus RNA and the RNA is degraded; this strand of DNA is known as cDNA (4). The cDNA is then replicated, and the two strands form a weak bond and enter the nucleus (5). Once in the nucleus, the DNA is integrated into the host cell's DNA with the help of integrase (6). This cell can either stay dormant, or RNA may be synthesized from the DNA and used to create the proteins for a new retrovirus (7). Ribosome units are used to translate the mRNA of the virus into the amino acid sequences which can be made into proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This step will also make viral enzymes and capsid proteins (8). Viral RNA will be made in the nucleus. These pieces are then gathered together and are pinched off of the cell membrane as a new retrovirus (9).]]\nWhen retroviruses have integrated their own genome into the [[germline|germ line]], their genome is [[inheritance|passed on]] to a following generation.

The term \"retro\" in retrovirus refers to this reversal (making DNA from RNA) of the usual direction of transcription.  It still obeys the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which states that information can be transferred from nucleic acid to nucleic acid but cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid. Reverse transcriptase activity outside of retroviruses has been found in almost all [[eukaryote]]s, enabling the generation and insertion of new copies of [[retrotransposon]]s into the host genome. These inserts are transcribed by enzymes of the host into new RNA molecules that enter the cytosol. Next, some of these RNA molecules are translated into viral proteins. For example, the ''gag'' gene is translated into molecules of the capsid protein, the ''pol'' gene is translated into molecules of reverse transcriptase, and the ''env'' gene is translated into molecules of the envelope protein. It is important to note that a retrovirus must \"bring\" its own reverse transcriptase in its [[capsid]], otherwise it is unable to utilize the enzymes of the infected cell to carry out the task, due to the unusual nature of producing DNA from RNA.\n\nIndustrial drugs that are designed as protease and [[reverse-transcriptase inhibitor]]s are made such that they target specific sites and sequences within their respective enzymes.  However these drugs can quickly become ineffective due to the fact that the gene sequences that code for the protease and the reverse transcriptase quickly mutate. These changes in bases cause specific codons and sites with the enzymes to change and thereby avoid drug targeting by losing the sites that the drug actually targets.\n\nBecause reverse transcription lacks the usual [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] of DNA replication, a retrovirus [[mutate]]s very often. This enables the virus to grow [[immunology|resistant]] to antiviral pharmaceuticals quickly, and impedes the development of effective [[vaccines]] and inhibitors for the retrovirus.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Svarovskaia ES, Cheslock SR, Zhang WH, Hu WS, Pathak VK | title = Retroviral mutation rates and reverse transcriptase fidelity | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 8 | issue = 1\u20133 | pages = d117-34 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12456349 | doi = 10.2741/957 }}</ref>\n\nOne difficulty faced with some retroviruses, such as the Moloney retrovirus, involves the requirement for cells to be actively dividing for transduction.

Some provirus remains latent in the cell for a long period of time before it is activated by the change in cell environment.\n\n==Early evolution==\nStudies of retroviruses led to the first demonstrated synthesis of DNA from RNA templates, a fundamental mode for transferring genetic material that occurs in both [[eukaryote]]s and [[prokaryote]]s. It has been speculated that the RNA to DNA transcription processes used by retroviruses may have first caused DNA to be used as genetic material. In this model, the [[RNA world hypothesis]], cellular organisms adopted the more chemically stable DNA when retroviruses evolved to create [[DNA]] from the [[RNA]] templates.\n\nAn estimate of the date of evolution of the foamy-like endogenous retroviruses placed the time of the most recent common ancestor at > {{Ma|450}}.<ref name=Aiewsakun>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aiewsakun P, Katzourakis A | title = Marine origin of retroviruses in the early Palaeozoic Era | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | pages = 13954 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28071651 | pmc = 5512871 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13954 | bibcode = 2017NatCo...813954A }}</ref>\n\n==Gene therapy==\n[[Gammaretrovirus|Gammaretroviral]] and [[lentiviral]] [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] for [[gene therapy]] have been developed that mediate stable genetic modification of treated cells by chromosomal integration of the transferred vector genomes.

Cancer can be triggered by proto-oncogenes that were mistakenly incorporated into proviral DNA or by the disruption of cellular proto-oncogenes. Rous sarcoma virus contains the [[Src (gene)|src gene]] that triggers tumor formation. Later it was found that a similar gene in cells is involved in cell signaling, which was most likely excised with the proviral DNA. Nontransforming viruses can randomly insert their DNA into proto-oncogenes, disrupting the expression of proteins that regulate the cell cycle. The promoter of the provirus DNA can also cause over expression of regulatory genes.\n\n==Classification==\n[[Image:Phylogeny of Retroviruses.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Phylogeny of Retroviruses]]\n\n===Exogenous===\n\nThese are infectious RNA- or DNA-containing viruses which are transmitted from person to person.\n\nReverse-transcribing viruses fall into 2 groups of the [[Virus classification#Baltimore classification|Baltimore classification]].{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n====Group VI viruses====\nAll members of [[Virus classification#Baltimore classification|Group VI]] use virally encoded [[reverse transcriptase]], an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, to produce DNA from the initial virion RNA genome.
