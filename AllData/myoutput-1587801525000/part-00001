The border runs as a fairly irregular line from the shore of the [[Dollart]] bay which is part of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river estuary in the north to the Belgium-Germany-Netherlands [[tripoint]] at [[Vaalserberg]]. The length of the border is around {{convert|570|km|abbr=on}} in length, although the straight distance between the two border end points is {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe border runs along portions of rivers, including for {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} along the large [[Rhine]] river. It also runs for about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} along the Meuse valley, although most of the time a few km to the east of the [[Meuse]] river rather than along it, before leaving the valley at the last portion of border to the border tripoint located at [[Vaalserberg]] about {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Aachen]].\n\nThe German states which share the international border are (from north to south) [[Lower Saxony]] and North Rhine Palatinate while on the Dutch side, the provinces are [[Groningen]], [[Drente]], [[Overijssel]], [[Gelderland]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. \n\n==Border crossings==\nThere are at least 60 official road crossings and six railway crossings of the border. Both countries are part of the [[Schengen Area]] and the [[European Union]], so there are minimal or non-existent border controls.\n\nMotorways crossing the border:\n{| class=wikitable\n|Dutch name || German name || European route\n|-\n| [[A7 motorway (Netherlands)|A7]] || [[Bundesautobahn 280|A280]] || [[European route E22|E22]]\n|-\n| [[A37 motorway (Netherlands)|A37]] || B402 || [[European route E233|E233]]\n|-\n| [[A1 motorway (Netherlands)|A1]] || [[Bundesautobahn 30|A30]] || [[European route E30|E30]]\n|-\n| [[A12 motorway (Netherlands)|A12]] || [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] || [[European route E35|E35]]\n|-\n| [[A77 motorway (Netherlands)|A77]] || [[Bundesautobahn 57|A57]] || [[European route E31|E31]]\n|-\n| [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] || [[Bundesautobahn 40|A40]] || [[European route E34|E34]]\n|-\n| [[A74 motorway (Netherlands)|A74]] || [[Bundesautobahn 61|A61]] || -\n|-\n| N280 || [[Bundesautobahn 52|A52]] || -\n|-\n| [[A76 motorway (Netherlands)|A76]] || [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] || [[European route E314|E314]]\n|}\n\nRailways crossing the border:\n*[[Ihrhove\u2013Nieuweschans railway]]\n*[[Almelo\u2013Salzbergen railway]]\n*[[Dortmund\u2013Enschede railway]]\n*[[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]]\n*[[Viersen\u2013Venlo railway]]\n*[[Sittard\u2013Herzogenrath railway]]\n\n==Border Treaties==\nThe modern border today is the result of centuries of border negotiations and agreements between the states and other political entities in the region, such as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Hannover]] and the  [[United Provinces of the Netherlands]], of which Germany and the Netherlands ultimately became the modern day [[successor states]].

This is based on interpretations of old treaties. Germany relies on a bill of enfeoffment from 1464, when German Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] raised [[Ulrich I, Count of East Frisia|Ulrich I]], the son of a local chieftain to the status of Imperial Count, in which the [[County of East Frisia]] Is described as  \"von der Westeremse osterwards\" (thus including the Ems). According to the Netherlands, this has lapsed in the [[French period]] - after the incorporation in France of both areas of [[West Frisia]] (now part of the Dutch provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Friesland]]) and [[East Frisia]] (now part of the German state of [[Lower Saxony]]).
