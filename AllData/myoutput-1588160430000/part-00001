M. Stirling]]. It was released in the United States and Canada on February 1, 1998 and in the United Kingdom a month later on March 1.\n\n==Plot summary==\nAt 9:15 pm [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|EST]] on March 17, 1998, the island of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]] and the [[United States Coast Guard]] cutter ''[[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|Eagle]]'', are transported by an unknown phenomenon (called \"The Event\") back in time to the [[Bronze Age]] circa 1250s B.C. (corresponding to the late [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]] of the [[Trojan War]]).\n\nAs the truth of what has happened sinks in, panic grips the island. Chief of Police Jared Cofflin is given emergency powers and begins organizing the people to help produce food for the island so they can feed themselves. Meanwhile, Captain Marian Alston takes the ''Eagle'' to [[Great Britain|Britain]], with Ian Arnstein and Doreen Rosenthal as interpreters, where they trade Nantucket-made goods with the Iraiina, which translates as \"noble ones\", a tribe that has been steadily invading the island, for grain. The Iraiina are just one of the many Sun People Tribes. As a gift, the Iraiina chief gives Marian a slave, Swindapa, a captured female \"Earth People\" warrior. Swindapa is freed and decides to stay with Marian. The ''Eagle'' leaves for Nantucket but takes with them Isketerol, a [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] merchant who hopes to learn from the Americans.\n\nWhile the people of Nantucket work for their survival, the ambitious and ruthless Lieutenant William Walker of the USCGC ''Eagle'' decides that with modern technology he could become a king in this time. With the help of Isketerol and others, Walker convinces some naive environmentalists to steal a ship and kidnap Cofflin's wife so they can give the benefits of modern culture to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s. Meanwhile, Walker and Isketerol steal another ship and return to Britain to recruit soldiers for their eventual takeover of [[Helladic period|Greece]]. Marian decides to rescue Cofflin's wife first and saves her after defeating an [[Olmec]] army. The bloodthirsty Olmecs proceed to gruesomely kill the modern Americans who sought to help them.\n\nTime passes as Walker solidifies his control over the Sun People and Nantucket creates a new government and prepares to take down Walker. Marian returns to Britain with a small army and uses Swindapa, who has become her lover, to convince the Earth People to fight with them to defeat Walker. Both sides meet at the Battle of the Downs and though Nantucket and its allies are victorious, Walker manages to escape with his followers to Greece.\n\n==Characters in ''Island in the Sea of Time''==\n\n{{main article|Nantucket series#Significant Characters}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels|Speculative fiction}}\n*''[[Dies the Fire]]'' \u2013 \"The Event\" that sends Nantucket back in time also changes the law of physics in the [[Emberverse]] series\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsite.com/04a/isl30.htm |title=SF Site Featured Review: Island In the Sea of Time |accessdate=2008-09-04 |author= [[Steven H Silver]]|work=Book Review |publisher=SF Site |year=1998 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080706062504/http://hem.bredband.net/b104699/books/brucebaugh/preview.html Sample Chapters]\n*{{isfdb title|11724}}\n\n{{S.
