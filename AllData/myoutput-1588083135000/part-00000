In humans, coronaviruses cause [[respiratory tract infection]]s that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the [[common cold]] (which is caused also by certain other viruses, predominantly [[rhinovirus]]es), while more lethal varieties can cause [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome|MERS]], and [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]]. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an [[upper respiratory tract infection|upper respiratory tract disease]], while in cows and pigs they cause [[diarrhea]]. There are as yet no [[vaccine]]s or [[antiviral drug]]s to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.\n\nCoronaviruses constitute the [[subfamily]] '''''Orthocoronavirinae''''', in the family ''[[Coronaviridae]]'', order ''[[Nidovirales]]'', and realm ''[[Riboviria]]''.<ref name=\"groot\">{{Cite book |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123846846000689|title=Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|vauthors=de Groot RJ, Baker SC, Baric R, Enjuanes L, Gorbalenya AE, Holmes KV, Perlman S, Poon L, Rottier PJ, Talbot PJ, Woo PC, Ziebuhr J|publisher=Elsevier|year=2011|isbn=978-0-12-384684-6|veditors=King AM, Lefkowitz E, Adams MJ, Carstens EB, ((International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses)), ((International Union of Microbiological Societies.
