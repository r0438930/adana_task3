As of 1 January 2019, the municipality had a population of 156,286, making it the second-largest of the province and fifteenth-largest of the country. Amersfoort is also one of the largest Dutch railway junctions with its three stations\u2014[[Amersfoort Centraal railway station|Amersfoort Centraal]], [[Amersfoort Schothorst railway station|Schothorst]] and [[Amersfoort Vathorst railway station|Vathorst]]\u2014due to its location on two of the Netherlands' main east to west and north to south railway lines. The city was used during the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] as a venue for the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] events. Amersfoort marked its 750th anniversary as a city in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.amersfoort750.nl/|title= Home Page|publisher= Amersfoort 750|language= Dutch|accessdate= 24 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202024759/http://amersfoort750.nl/| archivedate= 2 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Population centres ==\nThe municipality of Amersfoort consists of the following cities, towns, villages and districts: Bergkwartier, Bosgebied, Binnenstad, [[Hoogland]], Hoogland-West, Kattenbroek, Kruiskamp, de Koppel, Liendert, Rustenburg, [[Nieuwland, Amersfoort|Nieuwland]], Randenbroek, Schuilenburg, [[Schothorst]], Soesterkwartier, Vathorst, [[Hooglanderveen]], Vermeerkwartier, Leusderkwartier, Zielhorst and Stoutenburg-Noord.\n\n== History ==\n[[Hunter-gatherer|Hunter gatherers]] set up camps in the Amersfoort region in the [[Mesolithic]] period. Archaeologists have found traces of these camps, such as the remains of hearths, and sometimes microlithic flint objects, to the north of the city.\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Koppelpoort Amersfoort 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Koppelpoort]]]]\n[[File:Amersfoort, de Monnikendam RM8053 positie1 2012-12-08 11.14.jpg|Monnikendam|thumb|left]]\nRemains of settlements in the Amersfoort area from around 1000&nbsp;BC have been found, but the name Amersfoort, after a [[ford (river)|ford]] in the Amer River, today called the [[Eem]], did not appear until the 11th century. The city grew around what is now known as the central square, the ''Hof'', where the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695\u20131580)|Bishops of Utrecht]] established a court in order to control the \"{{Interlanguage link multi|Gelderse Vallei|nl}}\" area. It was granted city rights in 1259 by the bishop of Utrecht, [[Henry I van Vianden]]. A first defensive wall, made out of brick, was finished around 1300. Soon after, the need for enlargement of the city became apparent and around 1380 the construction of a new wall was begun and completed around 1450. The famous [[Koppelpoort]], a combined land and water gate, is part of this second wall. The first wall was demolished and houses were built in its place. Today's ''Muurhuizen'' (wallhouses) Street is at the exact location of the first wall; the fronts of the houses are built on top of the first city wall's foundations.\n\nThe ''[[Onze Lieve Vrouwetoren|Onze-Lieve-Vrouwentoren]]'' (Tower of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]])<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.skyscrapercity.info/100.php?id=4&bid=1185 |title= Onze Lieve Vrouwentoren |accessdate= 26 March 2008 |publisher= SkyscraperCity |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003736/http://www.skyscrapercity.info/100.php?id=4&bid=1185 |archivedate= 28 September 2007 |df= dmy-all}}</ref> is one of the tallest medieval church towers in the Netherlands at {{convert|98|m|ft|0}}. When it was built, it was the middle point of The Netherlands,<ref>{{cite web |title=Wat te doen in Amersfoort? |url=https://www.wearetravellers.nl/europa/wat-te-doen-in-amersfoort-10-tips/ |publisher=Ro\u00eblle}}</ref> it was exactly built in the center and a reference for the Dutch grid system. The nickname of the tower is Lange Jan (\u2018Long John\u2019).<ref>{{cite web |title=Amersfoort - Middle point of the Netherlands |url=http://www.onzelievevrouwetoren.nl/english/ |publisher=OnzeLieveVrouwenToren}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the tower and the church was started in 1444. The church was destroyed by an explosion in 1787, but the tower survived, and the layout of the church still can be discerned today through the use of different types of stone in the pavement of the open space that was created. It is now the reference point of the [[Geography of the Netherlands|RD coordinate system]], the coordinate grid used by the Dutch topographical service: the RD coordinates are (155.000, 463.000).\n\nThe inner city of Amersfoort has been preserved well since the [[Middle Ages]]. Apart from the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwetoren, the [[Koppelpoort]], and the ''Muurhuizen'' (Wall-houses), there is also the Sint-Joriskerk (Saint George's church), the canal-system with its bridges, as well as medieval and other old buildings; many are designated as national monuments. In the Middle Ages, Amersfoort was an important centre for the textile industry, and there were a large number of breweries. [[Jews]] also lived in Amersfoort in the Middle Ages, before being expelled from the province in 1546 and beginning to return to the city in 1655.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Amersfoort |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/amersfoort |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin of the ''Keistad'' ===\n[[Image:Amersfoort, de Amersfoortse Kei foto6 2012-12-08 10.47.jpg|thumb|''Amersfoortse Kei'']]\nThe nickname for Amersfoort, ''Keistad'' (boulder-city), originates in the ''Amersfoortse Kei'', a {{convert|9|t|lb|0|lk=on|adj=on}} [[boulder]] that was dragged from the [[Soest, Netherlands|Soest]] moors into the city in 1661 by 400 people because of a bet between two landowners. The people got their reward when the winner bought everyone [[beer]] and [[pretzels]]. Other nearby towns then nicknamed the people of Amersfoort ''Keientrekker'' (boulder-puller). This story embarrassed the inhabitants, and they buried the boulder in the city in 1672, but after it was found again in 1903 it was placed in a prominent spot as a monument. There are not many boulders in the Netherlands, so it can be regarded as an icon.\n\n=== Nieuw Amersfoort ===\n[[File:RM8067 Westsingel 49 ab.jpg|thumb|The historic [[brasserie]] of Amersfoort, nowadays a [[Rijksmonument]]]]\n[[File:Netherlands, Amersfoort, map of 1865.JPG|thumb|left|Amersfoort in 1865]]\nOne of the six Dutch towns established in the 17th Century in what is now [[Brooklyn]] was called \"Nieuw Amersfoort\" (New  Amersfoort).

See the [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/vasmer/43178/%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0 dictionary of Max Vasmer.]</ref> but from about 1800 onwards began to decline.\n\nThe decline was halted by the establishment of the first railway connection in 1863, and, some years later, by the building of a substantial number of [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]] [[barracks]], which were needed to defend the western cities of the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the 1920s growth stalled again, until in 1970 the national government designated Amersfoort, then numbering some 70,000 inhabitants, as a \"growth city\".\n\n=== Second World War ===\n[[File:Amersfoort-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Amersfoort, 2014]]\nSince Amersfoort was the largest garrison town in the Netherlands before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], with eight barracks, and part of the [[Grebbe line|main line of defence]], the whole population of then 43,000 was evacuated at the start of the invasion by the Germans in May 1940. After four days of battle, the population was allowed to return.\n\nThere was a functioning Jewish community in the town, at the beginning of the war numbering about 700 people. Half of them were deported and killed, mainly in [[Auschwitz]] and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]]. In 1943, the [[synagogue]], dating from 1727, was severely damaged on the orders of the then Nazi-controlled city government. It was restored and opened again after the war, and has been served since by a succession of [[rabbi]]s.\n\nThere was a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] near the city of Amersfoort during the war. The camp, officially called ''Polizeiliches Durchgangslager Amersfoort'' (Police Transit Camp Amersfoort), better known as ''[[Kamp Amersfoort]]'', was actually located in the neighbouring municipality of [[Leusden]].\n\nAfter the war the leader of the camp, Joseph Kot\u00e4lla, served a life sentence in prison. He died in captivity in 1979. Some of the victims of the camp are buried in [[Rusthof cemetery]] near the town.\n\nAmong the victims were prisoners of war from the [[Soviet Union]], including 101 [[Central Asia]]ns, mostly [[Uzbeks]] or citizens of [[Samarqand]]. Locals would commemorate them, but the identity of the 101 soldiers was not known, until journalist Remco Reiding started investigating this case in 1999, after hearing about the cemetery. Amongst the few remaining people who witnessed the 101 soldiers is Henk Broekhuizen.<ref name=Soldat>[http://www.soldat.ru/search/f_glory/soldiers.html \"Soviet Field of Glory\"] {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC2017CentralAsians\">{{cite news |author=Rustam Qobil |publisher=BBC |title=Why were 101 Uzbeks killed in the Netherlands in 1942? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-39849088 |date=9 May 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Museums ===\n[[Image:Lieve Vrouwekerkhof, 3811 Amersfoort, Netherlands - panoramio (12).jpg|Amersfoort city centre|thumb]]\n[[File:20140513Eemhuis43rx.JPG|thumb|Culture House ''Eemhuis'']]\n[[File:Amersfoort,_stier_op_het_verkeersplein_bij_het_Kamp_foto10_2012-12-08_11.43.jpg|thumb|'The Bull']]\n\n* [[The Mondriaan House]]: birthplace of the painter [[Piet Mondriaan]].

As of 1 January 2019, the municipality had a population of 156,286, making it the second-largest of the province and fifteenth-largest of the country. Amersfoort is also one of the largest Dutch railway junctions with its three stations\u2014[[Amersfoort Centraal railway station|Amersfoort Centraal]], [[Amersfoort Schothorst railway station|Schothorst]] and [[Amersfoort Vathorst railway station|Vathorst]]\u2014due to its location on two of the Netherlands' main east to west and north to south railway lines. The city was used during the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] as a venue for the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] events. Amersfoort marked its 750th anniversary as a city in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.amersfoort750.nl/|title= Home Page|publisher= Amersfoort 750|language= Dutch|accessdate= 24 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202024759/http://amersfoort750.nl/| archivedate= 2 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Population centres ==\nThe municipality of Amersfoort consists of the following cities, towns, villages and districts: Bergkwartier, Bosgebied, Binnenstad, [[Hoogland]], Hoogland-West, Kattenbroek, Kruiskamp, de Koppel, Liendert, Rustenburg, [[Nieuwland, Amersfoort|Nieuwland]], Randenbroek, Schuilenburg, [[Schothorst]], Soesterkwartier, Vathorst, [[Hooglanderveen]], Vermeerkwartier, Leusderkwartier, Zielhorst and Stoutenburg-Noord.\n\n== History ==\n[[Hunter-gatherer|Hunter gatherers]] set up camps in the Amersfoort region in the [[Mesolithic]] period. Archaeologists have found traces of these camps, such as the remains of hearths, and sometimes microlithic flint objects, to the north of the city.\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Koppelpoort Amersfoort 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Koppelpoort]]]]\n[[File:Amersfoort, de Monnikendam RM8053 positie1 2012-12-08 11.14.jpg|Monnikendam|thumb|left]]\nRemains of settlements in the Amersfoort area from around 1000&nbsp;BC have been found, but the name Amersfoort, after a [[ford (river)|ford]] in the Amer River, today called the [[Eem]], did not appear until the 11th century. The city grew around what is now known as the central square, the ''Hof'', where the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695\u20131580)|Bishops of Utrecht]] established a court in order to control the \"{{Interlanguage link multi|Gelderse Vallei|nl}}\" area. It was granted city rights in 1259 by the bishop of Utrecht, [[Henry I van Vianden]]. A first defensive wall, made out of brick, was finished around 1300. Soon after, the need for enlargement of the city became apparent and around 1380 the construction of a new wall was begun and completed around 1450. The famous [[Koppelpoort]], a combined land and water gate, is part of this second wall. The first wall was demolished and houses were built in its place. Today's ''Muurhuizen'' (wallhouses) Street is at the exact location of the first wall; the fronts of the houses are built on top of the first city wall's foundations.\n\nThe ''[[Onze Lieve Vrouwetoren|Onze-Lieve-Vrouwentoren]]'' (Tower of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]])<ref>\n{{cite web|url= http://www.skyscrapercity.info/100.php?id=4&bid=1185|title= Onze Lieve Vrouwentoren|accessdate= 26 March 2008|publisher= SkyscraperCity|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003736/http://www.skyscrapercity.info/100.php?id=4&bid=1185|archivedate= 28 September 2007|df= dmy-all}}</ref> is one of the tallest medieval church towers in the Netherlands at {{convert|98|m|ft|0}}. When it was built, it was the middle point of The Netherlands<ref>{{cite web |title=Wat te doen in Amersfoort? |url=https://www.wearetravellers.nl/europa/wat-te-doen-in-amersfoort-10-tips/ |publisher=Ro\u00eblle}}</ref>, it was exactly built in the center and a reference for the Dutch grid system. The nickname of the tower is Lange Jan (\u2018Long John\u2019). <ref>{{cite web |title=Amersfoort - Middle point of the Netherlands |url=http://www.onzelievevrouwetoren.nl/english/ |publisher=OnzeLieveVrouwenToren}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the tower and the church was started in 1444. The church was destroyed by an explosion in 1787, but the tower survived, and the layout of the church still can be discerned today through the use of different types of stone in the pavement of the open space that was created. It is now the reference point of the [[Geography of the Netherlands|RD coordinate system]], the coordinate grid used by the Dutch topographical service: the RD coordinates are (155.000, 463.000).\n\nThe inner city of Amersfoort has been preserved well since the [[Middle Ages]]. Apart from the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwetoren, the [[Koppelpoort]], and the ''Muurhuizen'' (Wall-houses), there is also the Sint-Joriskerk (Saint George's church), the canal-system with its bridges, as well as medieval and other old buildings; many are designated as national monuments. In the Middle Ages, Amersfoort was an important centre for the textile industry, and there were a large number of breweries. [[Jews]] also lived in Amersfoort in the Middle Ages, before being expelled from the province in 1546 and beginning to return to the city in 1655.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Amersfoort |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/amersfoort |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin of the ''Keistad'' ===\n[[Image:Amersfoort, de Amersfoortse Kei foto6 2012-12-08 10.47.jpg|thumb|''Amersfoortse Kei'']]\nThe nickname for Amersfoort, ''Keistad'' (boulder-city), originates in the ''Amersfoortse Kei'', a {{convert|9|t|lb|0|lk=on|adj=on}} [[boulder]] that was dragged from the [[Soest, Netherlands|Soest]] moors into the city in 1661 by 400 people because of a bet between two landowners. The people got their reward when the winner bought everyone [[beer]] and [[pretzels]]. Other nearby towns then nicknamed the people of Amersfoort ''Keientrekker'' (boulder-puller). This story embarrassed the inhabitants, and they buried the boulder in the city in 1672, but after it was found again in 1903 it was placed in a prominent spot as a monument. There are not many boulders in the Netherlands, so it can be regarded as an icon.\n\n=== Nieuw Amersfoort ===\n[[File:RM8067 Westsingel 49 ab.jpg|thumb|The historic [[brasserie]] of Amersfoort, nowadays a [[Rijksmonument]]]]\n[[File:Netherlands, Amersfoort, map of 1865.JPG|thumb|left|Amersfoort in 1865]]\nOne of the six Dutch towns established in the 17th Century in what is now [[Brooklyn]] was called \"Nieuw Amersfoort\" (New  Amersfoort).

See the [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/vasmer/43178/%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0 dictionary of Max Vasmer.]</ref> but from about 1800 onwards began to decline.\n\nThe decline was halted by the establishment of the first railway connection in 1863, and, some years later, by the building of a substantial number of [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]] [[barracks]], which were needed to defend the western cities of the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the 1920s growth stalled again, until in 1970 the national government designated Amersfoort, then numbering some 70,000 inhabitants, as a \"growth city\".\n\n=== Second World War ===\n[[File:Amersfoort-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Amersfoort, 2014]]\nSince Amersfoort was the largest garrison town in the Netherlands before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], with eight barracks, and part of the [[Grebbe line|main line of defence]], the whole population of then 43,000 was evacuated at the start of the invasion by the Germans in May 1940. After four days of battle, the population was allowed to return.\n\nThere was a functioning Jewish community in the town, at the beginning of the war numbering about 700 people. Half of them were deported and killed, mainly in [[Auschwitz]] and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]]. In 1943, the [[synagogue]], dating from 1727, was severely damaged on the orders of the then Nazi-controlled city government. It was restored and opened again after the war, and has been served since by a succession of [[rabbi]]s.\n\nThere was a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] near the city of Amersfoort during the war. The camp, officially called ''Polizeiliches Durchgangslager Amersfoort'' (Police Transit Camp Amersfoort), better known as ''[[Kamp Amersfoort]]'', was actually located in the neighbouring municipality of [[Leusden]].\n\nAfter the war the leader of the camp, Joseph Kot\u00e4lla, served a life sentence in prison. He died in captivity in 1979. Some of the victims of the camp are buried in [[Rusthof cemetery]] near the town.\n\nAmong the victims were prisoners of war from the [[Soviet Union]], including 101 [[Central Asia]]ns, mostly [[Uzbeks]] or citizens of [[Samarqand]]. Locals would commemorate them, but the identity of the 101 soldiers was not known, until journalist Remco Reiding started investigating this case in 1999, after hearing about the cemetery. Amongst the few remaining people who witnessed the 101 soldiers is Henk Broekhuizen.<ref name=Soldat>[http://www.soldat.ru/search/f_glory/soldiers.html \"Soviet Field of Glory\"] {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC2017CentralAsians\">{{cite news |author=Rustam Qobil |publisher=BBC |title=Why were 101 Uzbeks killed in the Netherlands in 1942? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-39849088 |date=9 May 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Museums ===\n[[Image:Lieve Vrouwekerkhof, 3811 Amersfoort, Netherlands - panoramio (12).jpg|Amersfoort city centre|thumb]]\n[[File:20140513Eemhuis43rx.JPG|thumb|Culture House ''Eemhuis'']]\n[[File:Amersfoort,_stier_op_het_verkeersplein_bij_het_Kamp_foto10_2012-12-08_11.43.jpg|thumb|'The Bull']]\n\n* [[The Mondriaan House]]: birthplace of the painter [[Piet Mondriaan]].
