He was born after eight years of childless marriage.\n\n==Life==\nRupert's father died in 1364, leaving him and his four siblings under the guardianship of his uncle [[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]]. One year later, with his cousin [[Henry VII of Brzeg|Henry VII with a Scar]] -Louis's son-, Rupert joined to the [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]]'s trip to be crowned King of [[Arles]].

Despite the inclusion of his brother [[Wenceslaus II of Legnica|Wenceslaus II]] as a co-rule, Rupert maintain the full government over the Duchy, but always with the close cooperation of his uncle. Thanks to the pressure of Louis, Rupert signed an agreement with his younger brothers on 2 December 1372, under which they accepted not divided the Duchy of Legnica between them for the next ten years.
