Continued growth through the 1990s and 2000s in North Conway and the villages nearby made Conway the most populous community in [[Carroll County, New Hampshire|Carroll County]]. Traffic congestion led to an overhaul of the road system, including widening [[New Hampshire Route 16|Route 16]] through North Conway village and constructing a road parallel to Route 16 to allow traffic to move between [[Redstone, New Hampshire|Redstone]] and [[Intervale, New Hampshire|Intervale]] uninterrupted. A [[Conway Bypass (New Hampshire)|bypass]] of the area is being developed.\n\nNorth Conway remains a popular destination due to its shopping, recreation, and attractions.\n\n[[Image:ConwayScenic.jpg|center|thumb|350px|[[North Conway Depot and Railroad Yard|North Conway Station]]]]\n\n==Recreation==\n[[Image:Echo Lake, North Conway, NH.jpg|thumb|left|Cathedral Ledge in 1914]]\nNorth Conway and its surrounding towns offer [[hiking]] in the [[White Mountain National Forest]]. The area is a major [[rock climbing]] destination in the [[northeastern United States]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~doc/climbing/cathedralwhitehorse/| title=Cathedral and Whitehorse Ledges| publisher=Dartmouth Outing Club| accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref> particularly Cathedral Ledge in Echo Lake State Park. The {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} cliff overlooks [[Echo Lake (North Conway)|Echo Lake]] and North Conway from the west. Unlike nearby White Horse Ledge, another rock climbing site, Cathedral Ledge has an automobile road to the summit, which provides fine views of the Saco River Valley.\n\nIn late September through early October, tourists arrive to see the [[autumn foliage]] on the surrounding mountains and forests. The [[Conway Scenic Railroad]] features train rides that leave from the village's [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] station. In the winter, the village is the nighttime destination for [[skiing|skiers]] visiting the area resorts, including North Conway's own [[Cranmore Mountain Resort|Cranmore Mountain]] as well as nearby [[Attitash]] Resort, [[Black Mountain Ski Area (New Hampshire)|Black Mountain]] and [[Wildcat Mountain Ski Area|Wildcat Mountain]].\n\n==Geography==\nNorth Conway is located at {{Coord|44|3|6|N|71|7|22|W|type:city}} (44.051534, -71.122752),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in the northern part of the town of [[Conway, New Hampshire|Conway]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village, a census-designated place (CDP), has a total area of {{convert|11.2|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|11.1|sqkm|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.1|km2|disp=flip}}, or 1.29%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> North Conway is drained by the [[Saco River]].\n\n==Demographics==\n[[Image:White Horse Ledge, North Conway, NH.jpg|thumb|left|White Horse Ledge and Echo Lake c. 1908]]\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 2,349 people, 1,105 households, and 547 families residing in the CDP.
