Manufactured by [[Gerstlauer]], it opened in 2013 as the world's first Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster. With 14 [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]], The Smiler holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Record-AmusementToday\" /> However, it has experienced a series of incidents. A malfunction at a press preview event delayed the official opening date by two weeks, and in 2015, a major collision left five riders seriously injured. An investigation by the UK government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] was initiated, and the ride eventually reopened the following season with revamped safety standards.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-35851291|title=Alton Towers' Smiler ride reopens nine months after horror crash|website=BBC News|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPlans to build The Smiler were submitted to the local authority in December 2011.

Ride engineers decided to add a fifth train to the circuit to increase capacity, due to it being a busy day. The trains ahead, now cleared of riders, were dispatched in turn until this fifth train could enter the station to be dispatched for a routine test run. However, one of these empty trains failed to engage properly with the second lift, causing the control system to automatically shut down the ride. The ride engineers attended the train to resolve the issue, allowing the ride to restart.<ref name=\"HSE Incident Report\"></ref>\n\nThe fifth train was then sent for its test run.

Manufactured by [[Gerstlauer]], it opened in 2013 as the world's first Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster. With 14 [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]], The Smiler holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Record-AmusementToday\" /> However, it has experienced a series of incidents. A malfunction at a press preview event delayed the official opening date by two weeks, and in 2015, a major collision left five riders seriously injured. An investigation by the UK government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] was initiated, and the ride eventually reopened the following season with revamped safety standards.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-35851291|title=Alton Towers' Smiler ride reopens nine months after horror crash|website=BBC News|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPlans to build The Smiler were submitted to the local authority in December 2011.

The trains ahead, now cleared of riders, were dispatched in turn until this fifth train could enter the station to be dispatched for a routine test run.
