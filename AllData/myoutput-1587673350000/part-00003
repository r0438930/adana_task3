The University of Rio Grande do Norte, installed in a solemn session held at Teatro Alberto Maranh\u00e3o, on March 21, 1959, it was formed from colleges and schools of higher education already existing in Natal, such as the College of Pharmacy and Dentistry; the College of Law; the College of Medicine; the College of Engineering, among others.\n\nFrom 1968, with the university reform, UFRN went through a reorganization process that marked the end of the faculties and the consolidation of the current structure, that is, the grouping of several departments that, depending on the nature of the courses and disciplines, organized in Academic Centers.\n\nIn the 1970s, the construction of the Central Campus began, in an area of 123 hectares. The campus currently houses a bold architectural complex, surrounded by a ring road that integrates it with the urban fabric of the city of Natal.\n\nThe UFRN structure was modified, again, by means of a 1974 Decree (N \u00b0 74,211), constituting, also, from then on, the University Council (CONSUNI), the Teaching, Research and Extension Council (CONSEPE), Board of Trustees (CONCURA) and Rectory.\n\nA reform of the UFRN Statute, completed in 1996, established the structure in force today at the University, adding to the existing councils the Board of Directors (CONSAD) and creating, in the academic structure, the Specialized Academic Units and the Interdisciplinary Studies Centers. In addition to the various classes, laboratories and libraries, the Central Campus has a Community Center with a restaurant, bank branches, bookstores, art gallery and post office. The Rector's Office, the Pro-Rectories and all sectors of the Central Administration function in the Rectory building. \n\nUFRN's major events usually take place in Pra\u00e7a C\u00edvica, designed in the form of a large open-air amphitheater, where great shows also take place. For sports events and practices, the campus has a multi-sport park, with an Olympic gymnasium, soccer field, athletics track and Olympic pools.\n\nCurrently, UFRN offers, between undergraduate and graduate courses, more than 200 training opportunities. Its academic community is made up of more than 43,000 students and around 5,500 civil servants, including technical-administrative and permanent teachers, in addition to substitute and visiting professors.\n\n== CERES ==\n[[File:Escola Multicampi de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas de Caic\u00f3-RN.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|196x196px|EMCM entrance in the [[Caic\u00f3]] campus]]\n\nThe Serid\u00f3 Higher Education Center (CERES) of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte is formed by the university campuses of Caic\u00f3 and Currais Novos. Its academic structure is formed by eight Departments that offer thirteen on-campus undergraduate courses and two master's courses - Professional Masters in Letters - PROFLETRAS and the Professional Master in Geography - GEOPROF.\n\nIn Caic\u00f3, the academic departments are: Department of Law, Department of Education, Department of History, Department of Geography, Department of Exact and Applied Sciences and the Department of Computing and Technology. In Currais Novos, the Department of Social and Human Sciences and the Department of Letters operate.\n\nThe undergraduate courses in the face-to-face modality are: in Caic\u00f3, degrees in Geography, History, Mathematics and Pedagogy, and in Currais Novos Letras / Spanish and Letras Portugu\u00eas / Literatura. Within the scope of the bachelor's degree, we have 07 courses, of which 05 work in Caic\u00f3: Accounting, Law, Geography, History and Information Systems and 02 work in Currais Novos: Administration and Tourism.\n\nCERES also has support centers from the Secretariat of Distance Education (SEDIS) that offer distance learning courses. There are 17 undergraduate courses, of which 08 work in Caic\u00f3 and 09 work in Currais Novos. Thus, on the campus of Caic\u00f3, there are degrees in Biological Sciences, Physical Education, Geography, Literature, Pedagogy and Chemistry, and bachelor's degrees in Administration and Technologist in Public Management. On the campus of Currais Novos, there are degrees in Biological Sciences, Physical Education, Physics, Literature, Mathematics, Pedagogy and Chemistry and bachelor's degrees in Public Administration and Technologist in Public Management.\n\n=== EMCM ===\nThe Multicampi School of Medical Sciences of Rio Grande do Norte's mission is to promote medical training of excellence, supported by the social commitment to contribute to the innovation of health services and the progressive improvement of the population's quality of life. It is proposed to train doctors inserted in the health network in the countryside of the state, linked to the social reality of the population, capable of combining qualified technical-scientific training with ethical-humanistic attitudes that enable them to work as a team and positively impact the current reality. The course seeks to train suitable professionals to work effectively in the labor market, particularly in the rural context and outside large urban centers, valuing the health needs of our population and their ethical and cultural value.\n\n== School of Agriculture and Technology of Jundia\u00ed ==\n[[File:Escola agr\u00edcola de jundia\u00ed.jpg|left|thumb|262x262px|Main entrance of the School of Agriculture and Technology of Jundia\u00ed]]\nThe Escola Agr\u00edcola de Jundia\u00ed was created by law No. 202 of December 1949, as \"Escola Pr\u00e1tica de Agricultura\", located in the former Fazenda Jundia\u00ed, 3 km from the municipality of [[Maca\u00edba]], and 25 km from the State capital [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal.]]\n\nThe Escola Pr\u00e1tica de Agricultura was transformed into \"Escola Agrot\u00e9cnica de Jundia\u00ed\", by the agreement signed between the state of [[Rio Grande do Norte]] and the Ministry of Agriculture, on April 9, 1954, being subordinate to the Ministry of Agricultural and Veterinary Education of that Ministry .\n\nPursuant to Decree No. 61,162, of August 16, 1967, it was incorporated into the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte]], later renaming it Col\u00e9gio Agr\u00edcola de Jundia\u00ed - CAJ.\n\nThe transfer of the School to the UFRN aimed, among other objectives, at implementing the Agronomy Course on its physical basis, which did not happen.\n\nWith Resolution No. 006/2002 - CONSUNI, of August 16, 2002, which approved modifications and alterations to the UFRN General Regulation, the Unit receives the current name of Escola Agr\u00edcola de Jundia\u00ed.\n\nOn December 19, 2007, through Resolution No. 11/2007 - CONSUNI, the Escola Agr\u00edcola de Jundia\u00ed changed from being a Supplementary Organ to a Specialized Academic Unit in Agrarian Sciences, integrated with the academic and administrative structure of UFRN.\n\nIt is defined under the terms of Art. 9 of the UFRN Statute, as a unit of teaching, research and extension activities in Agrarian Sciences, and aims at the integration between its various sub-areas of knowledge by improving the teaching provided, which requires structuring bases and groups and research aimed especially at the technological development of agro-food and agro-industrial production chains.\n\nThe intention expressed in Art. 2 of the aforementioned Resolution is that the Academic Unit will become, in the medium and long term, a Center of Excellence in Agricultural Sciences, which requires the implementation of new technological training courses at medium levels, undergraduate and graduate courses in the same area of knowledge.\n<br />\n== Academics ==\n[[File:Mapa do Campus.png|thumb|Map of the [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] Campus|303x303px|alt=]]In the 1970s, construction began on the Central Campus between the districts of Lagoa Nova, Capim Macio and Nova Descoberta, which houses most of the university's facilities in the capital.
