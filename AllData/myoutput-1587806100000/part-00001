It was designed to replace the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] chambered [[Heckler & Koch G3]] and the G3 based [[.223 Remington|.223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm]] and later 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambered [[Heckler & Koch HK33]] service rifles providing a more modern weapon compatible with than recently introduced [[NATO]] standards.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">Wo\u017aniak, Ryszard.

The two-piece bolt mechanism consists of a bolt head that contains two cylindrical locking rollers and a wedge-shaped locking piece, attached to a heavy bolt head carrier. Based on the geometric relationship arising from the angles of the roller contact surfaces of the wedge-shaped locking piece locking piece and the barrel extension recesses, the rearward motion of the bolt head is delayed by a predetermined ratio. Thus during the same period of time, the bolt head carrier moves significantly faster than the bolt head by the predetermined ratio. This ratio is continued until the locking rollers have been withdrawn from the barrel extension recesses. After the rollers retract entirely behind the bolt head, the locking recesses of the barrel extension are cleared, and all parts continue moving rearward together, opening the breech and actuating the extraction and feeding cycles. The chamber is opened under high pressure, thus the chamber received a series of flutes in order to increase extraction reliability and prevent sticking of the spent casing to the chamber walls.\n\nLike the G3 and G33 bolts the HK41 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The \"bolt head locking lever\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt).\n\n===Features===\nThe G41 [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] is [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] from a smooth {{convert|1.0|mm|abbr=on|2}} [[Sheet metal|sheet]] of high-tensile [[steel]] rather than the {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on|2}} thick sheet steel used by the HK33.\n\nThe HK41 also had a redesigned bolt assembly. It was designed around 5.56\u00d745mm NATO ammunition with revised geometries between the bolt mechanism components to work with NATO STANAG magazines. It could also use older .223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm M193 ammunition.\nThe reliable functioning of roller-delayed blowback mechanisms is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwith arms Heckler & Koch offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and pressure curve progression as the locking pieces act in unison with the bolt head carrier.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback]</ref><ref>[http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/08/actions-blowback-action-roller-delayed.html Actions: Blowback Action: Roller Delayed Blowback ]</ref><ref>[https://www.internationalsportsman.com/how-roller-delayed-firearms-work-and-why-it-matters/ How Roller-Delayed Firearms Work and Why it Matters]</ref>\nThe HK41 bolt assembly is lighter than the G33 bolt assembly. The redesigned bolt was paired with a new recoil spring which consisted of five wound strands around a central coil. This reduced recoil.\n\nThe revised buttstock on the G41 is held in place by two pins. Unlike the earlier HK33, the G41\u2019s pistol grip assembly is not retained by a pin at the front of the assembly behind the magazine well housing and can be removed by the user during a field strip.\n\nThe spent cartridge casing extractor is installed inside the bolt head, while the tilting lever ejector is contained in the trigger housing. The rifle is hammer-fired and has a trigger group with a fire control selector that enables selecting safe, semi-automatic, burst and continuous fire modes. The fire selector's positions are marked with bullet [[pictogram]]s and it also serves as a manual safety against unintentional discharge. The selector is ambidextrous and its lever is mirrored on both sides of the trigger housing. In the \"safe\" position, the trigger and sear are disabled.\n\nThe G41 uses NATO [[STANAG magazine]]s (from the [[M16 rifle]]) with a capacity of 30 rounds. The magazine release is located on the left side of the rifle, above the magazine well.\n\nThe weapon incorporates a manual [[forward assist]] that can be used to positively close the bolt, similar to the one used on the American [[M16_rifle#XM16E1_and_M16A1_(Colt_Model_603)|M16A1]] rifle, and a side-folding heavy-gauge wire carrying handle near its point of balnce which resembles that of the [[FN FAL]]. It also has a \"hold-open\" bolt catch which holds the bolt open after the last round in the magazine has been fired (the bolt release button is just above the magazine release) and has a spring-loaded polymer dust cover that seals the ejection port from debris.\n\nDespite reducing the weight of some components the weight of the HK41 exceeded the weight of the preceding G33, making the HK41 relatively heavy compared to other 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambered assault rifles of its era.\n\n===Barrel===\nThe cold hammer-forged barrel has a hexagonal [[polygonal rifling|polygonal]] bore. It comes rifled for either the NATO-standard, Belgian SS109 62 grain bullet with a twist of 178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) or in a 305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) twist for use with American .223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm ammunition with the M193 55 grain projectile. The bore chamber is fluted to assist in the extraction of spent cartridges.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\" /> The barrel is equipped with a [[flash suppressor]] that is also designed to launch [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\n===Sights===\n[[File:Heckler & Koch rotating drum sight pictures.png|thumb|''Drehvisier'' rotating drum sight pictures]]\n\nThe firearm is equipped with a relatively low [[iron sight]] line that consists of a ''Drehvisier'' a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the help of tools. This deliberately prevents non-armorers to (re)zero the iron sight line. The rotary drum features an open V-notch (numbered 1) for rapid target acquisition, close range, low light and impaired visibility use and three apertures (numbered 2, 3 and 4) used for: {{convert|200|-|400|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments for more precise aiming. The 1 V-notch and 2 or {{convert|200|m|yd|0}} aperture settings have an identical point of aim. The V-notch and apertures are calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.\n\nThe [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] housing has a NATO pattern optics mount (meeting [[Picatinny rail|STANAG 2324]]) that replaced HK\u2019s claw-mount system sed to mount day (typically the Hensoldt 4\u00d724 telescopic sight) or night aiming optics.\nThe Hensoldt Fero 4\u00d724 [[telescopic sight]] and mount assembly were developed for designated marksman use. The Fero elevation knob features [[Telescopic sight#Bullet Drop Compensation|Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings]] for {{convert|100|-|600|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drzero.org/cetme/pdf/g3sm.pdf|title=Fero Z24 4\u00d724 telescopic sight for G3 rifle instruction manual|accessdate=25 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823233055/http://www.drzero.org/cetme/pdf/g3sm.pdf|archive-date=23 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nMany accessories are based on NATO standard or previously issued items.\n\nThe rifle can be fitted with a barrel-mounted [[bipod]] based on the one issued with the M16A1's cleaning kit. It also uses the [[bayonet]] from the G3. It also can mount the '''FERO Z24-G 4\u00d724''' optical sight on a proprietary detachable bracket on the receiver and a clip-on winter trigger.\n\nThe G41 can also mount a detachable [[40 mm]] [[Heckler & Koch HK69A1|HK79]] [[grenade launcher]] that replaces the synthetic forearm. The weapon in this configuration is known as the '''G41TGS''', or '''''\"Tactical Group Support\"'''''.\n\n==Variants==\nNote: the 1:178mm (1:7 in) rifling was compatible with the European-standard SS109 round and the 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling was compatible with the US-standard M193 Ball round.\n*'''G41''': This is the standard model with a fixed stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A1''': This model has a fixed stock and 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A2''': This model has a telescoping shoulder stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A3''': This model features a telescopic stock and a 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling pitch.\n*'''G41K''': This is a [[carbine]] (K\u2014''Karabiner'') variant of the G41A2 with a shortened {{convert|380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} barrel (reduced in length to the base of the foresight), 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate and a telescopic stock. The G41K is too short to accept the HK79 or fire rifle grenades.\n*'''G41TGS''': The \"Tactical Group Support\" model adds a HK79 [[grenade launcher]].\n*'''LF G41''': [[Luigi Franchi]] made a sample run of the G41, G41A2 and G41K in 1988 for possible production under license; these were later modified for trials by the Italian Army. It differed from the Heckler & Koch model in that it had a polygonal 4-groove barrel with a chromed bore. When the G41 was rejected by the German [[Bundeswehr]] in 1989, it was dropped from consideration and the improved [[Beretta AR70/90]] was chosen instead in 1990. The LF G41 however entered use with the [[Italian commando frogmen]] (COMSUBIN).\n*'''LF Mod. 641''': A modified variant of the G41 also intended to replace the BM59. It lost out to the AR70/90.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only. Please do not add entries into this list without a citation from a reliable source.

The selector is ambidextrous and its lever is mirrored on both sides of the trigger housing. In the \"safe\" position, the trigger and sear are disabled.\n\nThe G41 uses NATO [[STANAG magazine]]s (from the [[M16 rifle]]) with a capacity of 30 rounds. The magazine release is located on the left side of the rifle, above the magazine well.\n\nThe weapon incorporates a manual [[forward assist]] that can be used to positively close the bolt, similar to the one used on the American [[M16_rifle#XM16E1_and_M16A1_(Colt_Model_603)|M16A1]] rifle, and a side-folding heavy-gauge wire carrying handle near its point of balnce which resembles that of the [[FN FAL]]. It also has a \"hold-open\" bolt catch which holds the bolt open after the last round in the magazine has been fired (the bolt release button is just above the magazine release) and has a spring-loaded polymer dust cover that seals the ejection port from debris.\n\nDespite reducing the weight of some components the weight of the HK41 exceeded the weight of the preceeding G33, making the HK41 relatively heavy compared to other 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambered assault rifles of its era.\n\n===Barrel===\nThe cold hammer-forged barrel has a hexagonal [[polygonal rifling|polygonal]] bore. It comes rifled for either the NATO-standard, Belgian SS109 62 grain bullet with a twist of 178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) or in a 305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) twist for use with American .223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm ammunition with the M193 55 grain projectile. The bore chamber is fluted to assist in the extraction of spent cartridges.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\" /> The barrel is equipped with a [[flash suppressor]] that is also designed to launch [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\n===Sights===\n[[File:Heckler & Koch rotating drum sight pictures.png|thumb|''Drehvisier'' rotating drum sight pictures]]\n\nThe firearm is equipped with a relatively low [[iron sight]] line that consists of a ''Drehvisier'' a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the help of tools. This deliberately prevents non-armorers to (re)zero the iron sight line. The rotary drum features an open V-notch (numbered 1) for rapid target acquisition, close range, low light and impaired visibility use and three apertures (numbered 2, 3 and 4) used for: {{convert|200|-|400|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments for more precise aiming. The 1 V-notch and 2 or {{convert|200|m|yd|0}} aperture settings have an identical point of aim. The V-notch and apertures are calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.\n\nThe [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] housing has a NATO pattern optics mount (meeting [[Picatinny rail|STANAG 2324]]) that replaced HK\u2019s claw-mount system sed to mount day (typically the Hensoldt 4\u00d724 telescopic sight) or night aiming optics.\nThe Hensoldt Fero 4\u00d724 [[telescopic sight]] and mount assembly were developed for designated marksman use. The Fero elevation knob features [[Telescopic sight#Bullet Drop Compensation|Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings]] for {{convert|100|-|600|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drzero.org/cetme/pdf/g3sm.pdf|title=Fero Z24 4\u00d724 telescopic sight for G3 rifle instruction manual|accessdate=25 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823233055/http://www.drzero.org/cetme/pdf/g3sm.pdf|archive-date=23 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nMany accessories are based on NATO standard or previously issued items.\n\nThe rifle can be fitted with a barrel-mounted [[bipod]] based on the one issued with the M16A1's cleaning kit. It also uses the [[bayonet]] from the G3. It also can mount the '''FERO Z24-G 4\u00d724''' optical sight on a proprietary detachable bracket on the receiver and a clip-on winter trigger.\n\nThe G41 can also mount a detachable [[40 mm]] [[Heckler & Koch HK69A1|HK79]] [[grenade launcher]] that replaces the synthetic forearm. The weapon in this configuration is known as the '''G41TGS''', or '''''\"Tactical Group Support\"'''''.\n\n==Variants==\nNote: the 1:178mm (1:7 in) rifling was compatible with the European-standard SS109 round and the 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling was compatible with the US-standard M193 Ball round.\n*'''G41''': This is the standard model with a fixed stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A1''': This model has a fixed stock and 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A2''': This model has a telescoping shoulder stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A3''': This model features a telescopic stock and a 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling pitch.\n*'''G41K''': This is a [[carbine]] (K\u2014''Karabiner'') variant of the G41A2 with a shortened {{convert|380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} barrel (reduced in length to the base of the foresight), 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate and a telescopic stock. The G41K is too short to accept the HK79 or fire rifle grenades.\n*'''G41TGS''': The \"Tactical Group Support\" model adds a HK79 [[grenade launcher]].\n*'''LF G41''': [[Luigi Franchi]] made a sample run of the G41, G41A2 and G41K in 1988 for possible production under license; these were later modified for trials by the Italian Army. It differed from the Heckler & Koch model in that it had a polygonal 4-groove barrel with a chromed bore. When the G41 was rejected by the German [[Bundeswehr]] in 1989, it was dropped from consideration and the improved [[Beretta AR70/90]] was chosen instead in 1990. The LF G41 however entered use with the [[Italian commando frogmen]] (COMSUBIN).\n*'''LF Mod. 641''': A modified variant of the G41 also intended to replace the BM59. It lost out to the AR70/90.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only. Please do not add entries into this list without a citation from a reliable source.
