In January 1976 he was appointed Permanent Secretary of the foreign ministry, and played a leading role in ensuring the US military withdrawal from Thailand. Following that year's October coup, Anand was branded a communist by the military during the subsequent political witch hunts,<ref>{{cite book|title=Angels and Devils|author=David Murray|publisher=White Orchid Press (1996)}}</ref> presumably for the Foreign Ministry's role in the normalisation of diplomatic relations between Thailand and the People's Republic of China.

As in previous Thai coups, the military formed a [[National Peace Keeping Council]] (NPKC) to run the country. To shore up its image and gain the trust of King [[Bhumibol]], the NPKC appointed Anand as interim prime minister.<ref>{{cite book|title=The King Never Smiles|author=Paul M. Handley|publisher=Yale University Press (2006)}}</ref>\n\nAnand, closely linked to the palace and held in respect by both the bureaucracy and the business community, proved acceptable to the people and the international community. He was regarded as being astute and disciplined, and had never been associated with any financial scandal.<ref name=autogenerated3>Murray</ref>\n\nUpon accepting the position of prime minister, Anand was quick to declare that he did not agree with everything the junta had done and that he intended to follow an independent course. He further angered the NPKC by suggesting that the imprisoned Chatichai be released immediately upon a cabinet being appointed.<ref>''Bangkok Post'', 3 March 1991</ref>\n\n===Formation===\nThe interim constitution that was promulgated on 1 March reconfirmed the intention of the NKPC to retain substantial control.<ref>''The Nation'', 11 March 1991</ref> However, Anand was allowed relative freedom to select his own cabinet members. For the entire period of his premiership Anand faced constant pressure from the junta leaders, who tried to influence government decisions in order to gain financial benefits.<ref name=autogenerated1>Handley</ref>\n\nAnand filled his cabinet with well-known academics, technocrats, and ex-bureaucrats with proven records. Various commentators, ranging from the president of the prestigious [[Thailand Development Research Institute]] to the mass-circulation newspaper ''[[Thai Rath]]'', described the cabinet as the most impressive Thailand had ever had.<ref>''Bangkok Post'', 7 March 1991</ref><ref>''The Nation'', 7 March 1991</ref> The strong guiding hand of privy councillor [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] could be seen.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Amongst those selected by Anand were Prem's previous finance minister and economic advisor. A senior diplomat during the years Prem served as prime minister became foreign minister. The [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] orientation of the cabinet substantially diminished the fears of foreign investors.<ref name=Praagh-1996>{{cite book|title=Thailand's Struggle for Democracy|url=https://archive.org/details/thailandsstruggl00vanp|url-access=registration|author=David van Praagh|publisher=Holmes & Meier (1996)}}</ref>\n\n===Reforms===\nAnand's administration proved more hard-working than his predecessors.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The administration worked on its task of implementing a long list of much-needed reforms. Its emphasis on education, public health, exports, agriculture, industry, environment, and improvement in living conditions, met with widespread approval. In a Bangkok poll in late-July 1991, 61 percent of respondents felt that the Anand government was more honest than previous administrations.<ref>''Bangkok Post'' Weekly Review, 2 August 1991</ref>\n\nArguably the most significant of the reforms was a restructuring of the taxation system, which saw the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) and a reduction in corporate and income taxation. Several measures were taken to free up the flow of funds into and out of the country. Thai nationals were allowed to invest abroad without the approval of the [[Bank of Thailand]]. Regulations were altered for foreign banks to open branches and the ceiling on bank interest rates was lifted.<ref>''The Nation'', 16 April 1992</ref> In addition, the process for obtaining official operating licences for factories was greatly simplified, while the method of allocating textile and tapioca quotas was made more apparent. In the energy sector, price control barriers were dismantled.\n\nThe government was also able to successfully conclude agreements for a number of large-scale infrastructure projects initiated by the Chatichai administration. A regulatory board to oversee the privatisation and private investment in infrastructure projects was established. The projects themselves were also to be independently approved and monitored by agencies outside the government in order to minimise the opportunities for corruption.\n\nIn an attempt to spread the benefits of the country's economic growth, civil servants were given a 23 percent raise in wages, state employers a 20 percent wage rise, and the minimum wage was raised by 15 percent.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In addition to this, the Anand government allocated six  billion baht in the 1992 fiscal budget to be distributed to villages for their own discretionary spending.\n\nKey accomplishments of Anand's government include:\n* The establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)<ref name=\"NAR-20181111\">{{cite news |last1=Faulder |first1=Dominic |title=A low-key meeting in 1991 gave rise to the ASEAN Free Trade Area |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-Relations/A-low-key-meeting-in-1991-gave-rise-to-the-ASEAN-Free-Trade-Area |accessdate=2018-11-12 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=11 November 2018}}</ref>\n* A highly effective anti-AIDS/HIV policy.<ref>{{cite web |title=HIV and AIDS in Thailand |url=http://www.avert.org/aidsthai.htm |website=AVERT |accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>\n* Electricity market reform, including the introduction of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the initiation of a 10-year liberalisation and privatisation plan for [[EGAT]].  Many have noted that Saha-Union Group, which Anand chaired, won a major bid to build a large coal-fired power plant while Anand was in power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eprf.ca/probeint/mekong/reports/EGAT.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 April 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929033350/http://www.eprf.ca/probeint/mekong/reports/EGAT.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}</ref>\n* Award of a multi-billion baht concession to Telecom Asia (today known as [[True Corporation|True]]) to build and operate two million telephone lines in Bangkok.<ref>[http://www.anandp.in.th/en_speech/e020003.html \u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e19\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c \u0e1b\u0e31\u0e19\u0e22\u0e32\u0e23\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e19<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  It was noted by many that General Suchinda, the coup leader who installed Anand as Prime Minister, was appointed chairman of Telecom Asia after he was toppled from power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcita.gov.au/crf/papers98/lewis.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919065617/http://www.dcita.gov.au/crf/papers98/lewis.doc |archivedate=19 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Suspension of the [[Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System|Hopewell]] rail-train airport link project.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&id=50326&usrsess= Bangkok's Independent Newspaper<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111210822/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&id=50326&usrsess=|date=11 November 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nOn the international front Anand performed well. Despite international concern over the coup, foreign administrations had sufficient confidence to resume relations quickly. Anand made visits to [[China]] in September 1991 and [[Japan]] in December 1991, and went on to meetings with President [[George H. W. Bush]] in the United States. He was able to shake off the stigma of being a junta-installed prime minister, instead successfully presenting the image of an administration determined to deregulate, cut red tape, and create an environment conductive to free enterprise.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThe Anand government's policies to its neighbours followed the lead of his predecessor Chatichai. Relationships with [[Laos]] improved significantly, with Thailand allocating one-half of its 200 million baht aid budget to the nation.<ref>''Bangkok Post'', 20 February 1992</ref> Thailand under Anand became deeply involved in the [[Modern Cambodia#Peace efforts and the free elections|Cambodian peace process]], while relations with [[Vietnam]] went through a period of fence-mending and confidence-building.\n\nThe only foreign relations area where there were serious reasons for criticising Anand's administration was Thailand's soft stance towards the repressive military junta of [[Burma]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n===Disagreements with the NPKC===\nAnand disagreed with the military junta's plans to increase the defence budget. Anand denied the military's request for supplemental funding that would have totalled 53 billion baht.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Junta member Air Chief Marshal [[Kaset Rojananil]] criticised the government for being too \"inefficient\" and calling for it to resign.<ref>''Bangkok Post'', 2 October 1991</ref> Suchinda justified the military's request by stating that there were still communist fighters in the Indochina region.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In November and December Anand publicly repeated his views that the country's security did not lie in military might, but in its economic and political development, on one occasion stating, \"Military might is no longer a guarantee of national security. No nation can feel secure as long as its citizens are deprived of freedom of political expression and of the opportunities for a better and more meaningful life.\"<ref>''The Nation'', 5 November 1991</ref>\n\nAnand also voiced disagreement with the junta's draft constitution, although the constitution was ultimately promulgated. At first, he refused to comment as the Constitution Scrutinising Committee, hand-picked by Sunthorn, made changes to what became the final draft constitution.<ref name=autogenerated3 />  Then on 16 November, Anand spoke out against clauses that gave the appointed 360 member Senate the same powers as elected members of the House of Representatives as well as a clause allowing permanent public officials and military officers to hold political posts. Anand suggested that the Senate be reduced in size. The military-dominated Constitution Drafting Assembly refused to accept his suggestions and voted unanimously to pass the draft.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Anand's response was simple: \"I'm disappointed\".<ref>''The Nation'', 22 November 1991</ref>\n\n===Human rights===\nAnand's refusal to interfere with the junta's actions meant that his administration failed to come to grips with human rights issues. He had a comprehensive environmental bill passed, but it was ignored by the military, which continued to conduct its corrupt activities. Not long after it had taken power, the NPKC announced a huge rural development project that would help solve the problems of rural landlessness and encroachment on protected forests, issues that had for decades occupied the king's attention.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The military had promised to resettle more than 1.2 million people to permanent farmlands, but instead callously evicted villagers from forest reserves, where they had lived in some cases for generations, and transferred the lands to corporate plantations.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>Occasional Paper No. 21, Indian Ocean Centre for Peace Studies, University of Western Australia</ref> In almost all cases, the army failed to provide new homes and food supplies. When an activist monk led villagers to protest, he and his followers were attacked and arrested.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn mid-June 1991, the outspoken president of the Labour Congress of Thailand, Thanong Phoarn, mysteriously disappeared. The deputy defence minister, a military man, casually brushed the matter aside, claiming that Thanong had probably fled his wife.<ref>''Bangkok Post'' Weekly Review, 12 July 1991</ref> He has not been seen since.\n\nWith respect to the freedom of information, the Anand administration also disappointed many. With the NPKC in full control of the media, blatant censorship was practised of any issue that was critical of the military. Thus, rallies and demonstrations on a wide range of issues of public concern were kept from the public. The transparency of the denials of censorship by the military-dominated Interior Ministry must have been apparent to Anand, but he chose to do nothing about them.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nAnand was succeeded by General Suchinda, who was appointed by parliament after general elections.\n\n==Second government==\nSuchinda resigned on 24 May 1992, following an intervention by the king that ended the violent military crackdown on massive popular protests against his government. The five coalition parties that made up his administration still attempted to cling to power, however, despite calls for their resignation by the opposition and the press, and nominated Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, leader of the [[Chart Thai]] Party, for the premiership.<ref name=\"Praagh-1996\" /> At the time it looked as if House Speaker Arthit Urairat was set to submit Somboon's name to the king.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Arthit however held back the nomination of Somboon following a meeting with privy councillor Prem, who was thought to have been exerting pressure on behalf of the king.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The House Speaker instead announced that no decision would be made until the constitutional amendments were passed on 10 June, adding that the next prime minister would be a civilian.\n\nOn 10 June, Arthit surprised the country by recommending Anand's name instead of Somboon's to the king. The announcement was greeted with almost universal approval and even relief. Only the coalition parties of the previous government were dismayed, turning at first on Arthit, who they saw as having betrayed them.<ref name=\"Praagh-1996\" />\n\nFour days later Anand announced the formation of his cabinet, which included twenty respected technocrats who had held ministerial portfolios during his previous tenure as prime minister.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The top tasks of Anand's government were the rehabilitation of the economy, the organisation of free and fair elections, and the removal of top armed forces commanders from their posts.\n\nThe Internal Peacekeeping Law, which allowed for the use of military force against demonstrators, was abolished on 29 June, and on 1 August, he removed Air Chief Marshal Kaset, General Issarapong, and General Chainarong, the First Regional Army Commander, from their posts.\n\nAnand was succeeded by democratically-elected [[Chuan Leekpai]] later in 1992.\n\n==Post-political career==\nAnand rejoined the Saha-Union Group as chairman after the general elections of 1992.  His government had awarded Saha-Union a major [[Independent Power Producer]] concession. He resigned from Saha-Union Group in 2002.\n\n===Constitution Drafting Assembly===\nIn 1996, Anand was elected as a member of the Constitution Drafting Assembly and was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee. He oversaw the drafting of what became known as the \"Peoples' Constitution\" of 1997.  The constitution was abrogated in 2006 after a [[2006 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] against [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] that Anand supported. The People's Constitution instituted several important reforms,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/Niyom_ThaiUpdate%20Apr03.rtf |title=The 1997 Constitution: the path of reform; A Presentation for the Thai Update 2003 Conference in Canberra |accessdate=4 November 2016 |format=PDF |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320082620/http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/Niyom_ThaiUpdate%20Apr03.rtf |archivedate=20 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/804/65/ |title=Unknown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527170104/http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/804/65/ |archivedate=27 May 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kpi.ac.th/kpi/en/democratization.htm |title=Unknown |accessdate= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref> including:\n* Decentralisation of government, including the establishment of elected Tambon Administrative Organisations (TAOs) and Provincial Administrative Organisations (PAOs).

A fierce critic of the [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin]]-government, Anand frequently criticised his handling of the southern unrest, and in particular the State of Emergency Decree. He has been quoted to have said, \"The authorities have worked inefficiently.  They have arrested innocent people instead of the real culprits, leading to mistrust among locals. So, giving them broader power may lead to increased violence and eventually a real crisis.\" Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated from 2005 to 2006, with escalating violence, especially among teachers and civilians.  Despite much criticism of the Thaksin-government's policies, Anand refused to submit the NRC's final report, choosing instead to wait for the results of the 2006 legislative election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.net/News/21Mar2006_news14.php |title=Unknown|accessdate= |format= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnand finally submitted the NRC's recommendations on 5 June 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bangkokpost.net/News/06Jun2006_news01.php |title=Unknown|accessdate= |format= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>  Among them were\n* Introducing [[Sharia|Islamic law]]\n* Making ethnic [[Yawi language|Pattani-Malay (Yawi)]] an official language of the region\n* Establishing an unarmed peacekeeping force\n* Establishing a Peaceful Strategic Administrative Centre for southern border provinces\n\nThe recommendations were rejected by Privy Council President Prem, who stated, \"We cannot accept that [proposal] as we are Thai.

During November 2003 and December 2004, Anand was requested by then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to chair the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change [http://www.globalpolicy.org/un-reform/un-reform-initiatives/highlevel-panels/32369.html] [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/150/32629.html] of the United Nations. The panel of former presidents, prime ministers, and scholars was tasked to prepare recommendations for possible UN reform.\n\n==Support for the 2006 military coup==\nAnand supported the 2006 military coup that abrogated the People's Constitution and overthrew the government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].  Anand had been a sharp critic of Thaksin for several years prior to the coup, and he blamed the coup on Thaksin.  He also stated fears that the military junta would fail and that Thaksin could make a comeback.  \"When the [Chatichai] government disappeared from the scene [after the 1991 coup] there was no fear it could make a comeback. But over the past five years Thaksin and his party have become too powerful. They have consolidated their hold over the government machinery and certain sectors of the armed forces and parliament. So I think it's a more precarious situation.\" Anand claimed that the coup was well received by the people and that the military junta's ban against opposition or political activity would not last long.  He also noted surprise at the international community's condemnation to the coup.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/29/politics/politics_30014940.php Our coup is different: Anand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063023/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/29/politics/politics_30014940.php |date=31 October 2006 }}, 29 September 2006</ref>\n\n==Criticism of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn==\nIn a private meeting with US Ambassador [[Ralph Boyce]], whose post-meeting report was leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], Anand was critical of Crown Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]]. Anand noted that although the Crown Prince would succeed his father according to the law, the kingdom would be better off if other arrangements could be made. However, Anand noted that King Bhumibol would not likely change the succession. Anand also said that the Prince's succession would face \"complicating factors\" he continued interfering in politics or could not avoid embarrassing financial transactions, and that it was the consensus view among many Thai was that the Crown Prince could not stop either, nor would he be able, at age 57, to rectify his behaviour.  Anand neither confirmed nor denied that he made the statements. Anand's alleged negative opinion of the Crown Prince was repeated by Privy Counsellor [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] and [[Siddhi Savetsila]] in their meetings with the US Ambassador, the reports of which were all leaked by Wikileaks.<ref>FT, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/77990ce8-094b-11e0-ada6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1DiRZ0qhi Cables breach taboo on Thai royal family], 16 December</ref>  Criticism of the royal family is illegal in Thailand.\n\n== Royal decorations ==\nAnand has received the following royal decorations in the [[Thai Honours Order of Precedence|Honours System]] of Thailand:<ref name=decorations>[http://www.anandp.in.th/en_bio_details.html Biographical data of Mr. Anand Panyacharun].

As in previous Thai coups, the military formed a [[National Peace Keeping Council]] (NPKC) to run the country. To shore up its image and gain the trust of King [[Bhumibol]], the NPKC appointed Anand as interim prime minister.<ref>{{cite book|title=The King Never Smiles|author=Paul M. Handley|publisher=Yale University Press (2006)}}</ref>\n\nAnand, closely linked to the palace and held in respect by both the bureaucracy and the business community, proved acceptable to the people and the international community. He was regarded as being astute and disciplined, and had never been associated with any financial scandal.<ref name=autogenerated3>Murray</ref>\n\nUpon accepting the position of prime minister, Anand was quick to declare that he did not agree with everything the junta had done and that he intended to follow an independent course. He further angered the NPKC by suggesting that the imprisoned Chatichai be released immediately upon a cabinet being appointed.<ref>''Bangkok Post'', 3 March 1991</ref>\n\n===Formation===\nThe interim constitution that was promulgated on 1 March reconfirmed the intention of the NKPC to retain substantial control.<ref>''The Nation'', 11 March 1991</ref> However, Anand was allowed relative freedom to select his own cabinet members. For the entire period of his premiership Anand faced constant pressure from the junta leaders, who tried to influence government decisions in order to gain financial benefits.<ref name=autogenerated1>Handley</ref>\n\nAnand filled his cabinet with well-known academics, technocrats, and ex-bureaucrats with proven records. Various commentators, ranging from the president of the prestigious [[Thailand Development Research Institute]] to the mass-circulation newspaper ''[[Thai Rath]]'', described the cabinet as the most impressive Thailand had ever had.<ref>''Bangkok Post'', 7 March 1991</ref><ref>''The Nation'', 7 March 1991</ref> The strong guiding hand of privy councillor [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] could be seen.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Amongst those selected by Anand were Prem's previous finance minister and economic advisor.

Its emphasis on education, public health, exports, agriculture, industry, environment, and improvement in living conditions, met with widespread approval. In a Bangkok poll in late-July 1991, 61 percent of respondents felt that the Anand government was more honest than previous administrations.<ref>''Bangkok Post'' Weekly Review, 2 August 1991</ref>\n\nArguably the most significant of the reforms was a restructuring of the taxation system, which saw the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) and a reduction in corporate and income taxation. Several measures were taken to free up the flow of funds into and out of the country. Thai nationals were allowed to invest abroad without the approval of the [[Bank of Thailand]]. Regulations were altered for foreign banks to open branches and the ceiling on bank interest rates was lifted.<ref>''The Nation'', 16 April 1992</ref> In addition, the process for obtaining official operating licences for factories was greatly simplified, while the method of allocating textile and tapioca quotas was made more apparent. In the energy sector, price control barriers were dismantled.\n\nThe government was also able to successfully conclude agreements for a number of large-scale infrastructure projects initiated by the Chatichai administration. A regulatory board to oversee the privatisation and private investment in infrastructure projects was established. The projects themselves were also to be independently approved and monitored by agencies outside the government in order to minimise the opportunities for corruption.\n\nIn an attempt to spread the benefits of the country's economic growth, civil servants were given a 23 percent raise in wages, state employers a 20 percent wage rise, and the minimum wage was raised by 15 percent.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In addition to this, the Anand government allocated six  billion baht in the 1992 fiscal budget to be distributed to villages for their own discretionary spending.\n\nKey accomplishments of Anand's government include:\n* The establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)<ref name=\"NAR-20181111\">{{cite news |last1=Faulder |first1=Dominic |title=A low-key meeting in 1991 gave rise to the ASEAN Free Trade Area |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-Relations/A-low-key-meeting-in-1991-gave-rise-to-the-ASEAN-Free-Trade-Area |accessdate=2018-11-12 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=11 November 2018}}</ref>\n* A highly effective anti-AIDS/HIV policy.<ref>{{cite web |title=HIV and AIDS in Thailand |url=http://www.avert.org/aidsthai.htm |website=AVERT |accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>\n* Electricity market reform, including the introduction of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the initiation of a 10-year liberalisation and privatisation plan for [[EGAT]].

Despite international concern over the coup, foreign administrations had sufficient confidence to resume relations quickly. Anand made visits to [[China]] in September 1991 and [[Japan]] in December 1991, and went on to meetings with President [[George H. W. Bush]] in the United States. He was able to shake off the stigma of being a junta-installed prime minister, instead successfully presenting the image of an administration determined to deregulate, cut red tape, and create an environment conductive to free enterprise.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThe Anand government's policies to its neighbours followed the lead of his predecessor Chatichai. Relationships with [[Laos]] improved significantly, with Thailand allocating one-half of its 200 million baht aid budget to the nation.<ref>''Bangkok Post'', 20 February 1992</ref> Thailand under Anand became deeply involved in the [[Modern Cambodia#Peace efforts and the free elections|Cambodian peace process]], while relations with [[Vietnam]] went through a period of fence-mending and confidence-building.\n\nThe only foreign relations area where there were serious reasons for criticising Anand's administration was Thailand's soft stance towards the repressive military junta of [[Burma]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n===Disagreements with the NPKC===\nAnand disagreed with the military junta's plans to increase the defence budget. Anand denied the military's request for supplemental funding that would have totalled 53 billion baht.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Junta member Air Chief Marshal [[Kaset Rojananil]] criticised the government for being too \"inefficient\" and calling for it to resign.<ref>''Bangkok Post'', 2 October 1991</ref> Suchinda justified the military's request by stating that there were still communist fighters in the Indochina region.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In November and December Anand publicly repeated his views that the country's security did not lie in military might, but in its economic and political development, on one occasion stating, \"Military might is no longer a guarantee of national security. No nation can feel secure as long as its citizens are deprived of freedom of political expression and of the opportunities for a better and more meaningful life.\"<ref>''The Nation'', 5 November 1991</ref>\n\nAnand also voiced disagreement with the junta's draft constitution, although the constitution was ultimately promulgated. At first, he refused to comment as the Constitution Scrutinising Committee, hand-picked by Sunthorn, made changes to what became the final draft constitution.<ref name=autogenerated3 />  Then on 16 November, Anand spoke out against clauses that gave the appointed 360 member Senate the same powers as elected members of the House of Representatives as well as a clause allowing permanent public officials and military officers to hold political posts. Anand suggested that the Senate be reduced in size. The military-dominated Constitution Drafting Assembly refused to accept his suggestions and voted unanimously to pass the draft.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Anand's response was simple: \"I'm disappointed\".<ref>''The Nation'', 22 November 1991</ref>\n\n===Human rights===\nAnand's refusal to interfere with the junta's actions meant that his administration failed to come to grips with human rights issues. He had a comprehensive environmental bill passed, but it was ignored by the military, which continued to conduct its corrupt activities. Not long after it had taken power, the NPKC announced a huge rural development project that would help solve the problems of rural landlessness and encroachment on protected forests, issues that had for decades occupied the king's attention.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The military had promised to resettle more than 1.2 million people to permanent farmlands, but instead callously evicted villagers from forest reserves, where they had lived in some cases for generations, and transferred the lands to corporate plantations.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>Occasional Paper No. 21, Indian Ocean Centre for Peace Studies, University of Western Australia</ref> In almost all cases, the army failed to provide new homes and food supplies. When an activist monk led villagers to protest, he and his followers were attacked and arrested.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn mid-June 1991, the outspoken president of the Labour Congress of Thailand, Thanong Phoarn, mysteriously disappeared. The deputy defence minister, a military man, casually brushed the matter aside, claiming that Thanong had probably fled his wife.<ref>''Bangkok Post'' Weekly Review, 12 July 1991</ref> He has not been seen since.\n\nWith respect to the freedom of information, the Anand administration also disappointed many. With the NPKC in full control of the media, blatant censorship was practised of any issue that was critical of the military. Thus, rallies and demonstrations on a wide range of issues of public concern were kept from the public. The transparency of the denials of censorship by the military-dominated Interior Ministry must have been apparent to Anand, but he chose to do nothing about them.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nAnand was succeeded by General Suchinda, who was appointed by parliament after general elections.\n\n==Second government==\nSuchinda resigned on 24 May 1992, following an intervention by the king that ended the violent military crackdown on massive popular protests against his government. The five coalition parties that made up his administration still attempted to cling to power, however, despite calls for their resignation by the opposition and the press, and nominated Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, leader of the [[Chart Thai]] Party, for the premiership.<ref name=\"Praagh-1996\" /> At the time it looked as if House Speaker Arthit Urairat was set to submit Somboon's name to the king.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Arthit however held back the nomination of Somboon following a meeting with privy councillor Prem, who was thought to have been exerting pressure on behalf of the king.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The House Speaker instead announced that no decision would be made until the constitutional amendments were passed on 10 June, adding that the next prime minister would be a civilian.\n\nOn 10 June, Arthit surprised the country by recommending Anand's name instead of Somboon's to the king. The announcement was greeted with almost universal approval and even relief. Only the coalition parties of the previous government were dismayed, turning at first on Arthit, who they saw as having betrayed them.<ref name=\"Praagh-1996\" />\n\nFour days later Anand announced the formation of his cabinet, which included twenty respected technocrats who had held ministerial portfolios during his previous tenure as prime minister.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The top tasks of Anand's government were the rehabilitation of the economy, the organisation of free and fair elections, and the removal of top armed forces commanders from their posts.\n\nThe Internal Peacekeeping Law, which allowed for the use of military force against demonstrators, was abolished on 29 June, and on 1 August, he removed Air Chief Marshal Kaset, General Issarapong, and General Chainarong, the First Regional Army Commander, from their posts.\n\nAnand was succeeded by democratically-elected [[Chuan Leekpai]] later in 1992.\n\n==Post-political career==\nAnand rejoined the Saha-Union Group as chairman after the general elections of 1992.  His government had awarded Saha-Union a major [[Independent Power Producer]] concession. He resigned from Saha-Union Group in 2002.\n\n===Constitution Drafting Assembly===\nIn 1996, Anand was elected as a member of the Constitution Drafting Assembly and was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee. He oversaw the drafting of what became known as the \"Peoples' Constitution\" of 1997.  The constitution was abrogated in 2006 after a [[2006 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] against [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] that Anand supported. The People's Constitution instituted several important reforms,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/Niyom_ThaiUpdate%20Apr03.rtf |title=The 1997 Constitution: the path of reform; A Presentation for the Thai Update 2003 Conference in Canberra |accessdate=4 November 2016 |format=PDF |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320082620/http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/Niyom_ThaiUpdate%20Apr03.rtf |archivedate=20 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/804/65/ |title=Unknown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527170104/http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/804/65/ |archivedate=27 May 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kpi.ac.th/kpi/en/democratization.htm |title=Unknown |accessdate= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref> including:\n* Decentralisation of government, including the establishment of elected Tambon Administrative Organisations (TAOs) and Provincial Administrative Organisations (PAOs).

A fierce critic of the [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin]]-government, Anand frequently criticised his handling of the southern unrest, and in particular the State of Emergency Decree. He has been quoted to have said, \"The authorities have worked inefficiently.  They have arrested innocent people instead of the real culprits, leading to mistrust among locals. So, giving them broader power may lead to increased violence and eventually a real crisis.\" Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated from 2005 to 2006, with escalating violence, especially among teachers and civilians.  Despite much criticism of the Thaksin-government's policies, Anand refused to submit the NRC's final report, choosing instead to wait for the results of the 2006 legislative election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.net/News/21Mar2006_news14.php |title=Unknown|accessdate= |format= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnand finally submitted the NRC's recommendations on 5 June 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bangkokpost.net/News/06Jun2006_news01.php |title=Unknown|accessdate= |format= |work=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>  Among them were\n* Introducing [[Sharia|Islamic law]]\n* Making ethnic [[Yawi language|Pattani-Malay (Yawi)]] an official language of the region\n* Establishing an unarmed peacekeeping force\n* Establishing a Peaceful Strategic Administrative Centre for southern border provinces\n\nThe recommendations were rejected by Privy Council President Prem, who stated, \"We cannot accept that [proposal] as we are Thai. The country is Thai and the language is Thai... We have to be proud to be Thai and have the Thai language as the sole national language\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/25/headlines/headlines_30007268.php |title=Unknown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605044334/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/25/headlines/headlines_30007268.php |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Other positions===\nAnand is a member of the [[Trilateral Commission]] and the International Advisory Board of [[American International Group]] (AIG). Anand is a member of the [[Carlyle Group]] and sits on the [[Carlyle Group]]'s advisory board for Asia-Pacific.<ref>''The Nation'', [http://members.tripod.com/thanong/03072001.htm Anand outlines ties to group of giants], 7 March 2001</ref>\n\nHe served as UNICEF Ambassador for Thailand since 1996. During November 2003 and December 2004, Anand was requested by then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to chair the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change [http://www.globalpolicy.org/un-reform/un-reform-initiatives/highlevel-panels/32369.html] [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/150/32629.html] of the United Nations. The panel of former presidents, prime ministers, and scholars was tasked to prepare recommendations for possible UN reform.\n\n==Support for the 2006 military coup==\nAnand supported the 2006 military coup that abrogated the People's Constitution and overthrew the government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].  Anand had been a sharp critic of Thaksin for several years prior to the coup, and he blamed the coup on Thaksin.  He also stated fears that the military junta would fail and that Thaksin could make a comeback.  \"When the [Chatichai] government disappeared from the scene [after the 1991 coup] there was no fear it could make a comeback. But over the past five years Thaksin and his party have become too powerful. They have consolidated their hold over the government machinery and certain sectors of the armed forces and parliament. So I think it's a more precarious situation.\" Anand claimed that the coup was well received by the people and that the military junta's ban against opposition or political activity would not last long.  He also noted surprise at the international community's condemnation to the coup.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/29/politics/politics_30014940.php Our coup is different: Anand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063023/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/29/politics/politics_30014940.php |date=31 October 2006 }}, 29 September 2006</ref>\n\n==Criticism of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn==\nIn a private meeting with US Ambassador [[Ralph Boyce]], whose post-meeting report was leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], Anand was critical of Crown Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]]. Anand noted that although the Crown Prince would succeed his father according to the law, the kingdom would be better off if other arrangements could be made. However, Anand noted that King Bhumibol would not likely change the succession. Anand also said that the Prince's succession would face \"complicating factors\" he continued interfering in politics or could not avoid embarrassing financial transactions, and that it was the consensus view among many Thai was that the Crown Prince could not stop either, nor would he be able, at age 57, to rectify his behaviour.  Anand neither confirmed nor denied that he made the statements. Anand's alleged negative opinion of the Crown Prince was repeated by Privy Counsellor [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] and [[Siddhi Savetsila]] in their meetings with the US Ambassador, the reports of which were all leaked by Wikileaks.<ref>FT, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/77990ce8-094b-11e0-ada6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1DiRZ0qhi Cables breach taboo on Thai royal family], 16 December</ref>  Criticism of the royal family is illegal in Thailand.\n\n== Royal decorations ==\nAnand has received the following royal decorations in the [[Thai Honours Order of Precedence|Honours System]] of Thailand:<ref name=decorations>[http://www.anandp.in.th/en_bio_details.html Biographical data of Mr. Anand Panyacharun].
