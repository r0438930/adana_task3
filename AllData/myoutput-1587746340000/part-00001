S. Ravikumar]] and written by [[Crazy Mohan]]. The film stars [[Kamal Haasan]] in the title role, while [[Jayaram]], [[Devayani (actress)|Devayani]] and [[Jyothika]] did the supporting roles. The film's music was composed by [[A. R. Rahman]]. The film's cinematography and editing was handled by Priyan and K. Thanigachalam respectively.\n\nThe film revolves around a senior psychiatrist who is jealous of his junior doctor Kailash getting all attention sends Thenali Soman, a disturbed Sri Lankan Tamil to prove his methods a failure. Kailash who is annoyed by the presence of Thenali tries various ways to throw him out of home, the rest of the film shows whether he succeeds or not.\n\nThe film opened in 26 October 2000 to positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success at the Tamil Nadu box-office. The film won three [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]], including a [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize|Special Jury]] award for Jayaram's performance as Dr. Kailash. The story of the film was inspired by the <abbr>1991</abbr> American film ''[[What About Bob?]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nThenali Soman is a [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan Tamil]] refugee who has come to [[Chennai]] for psychiatric treatment. This is because of numerous [[phobia]]s he has developed due to the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. Panchabhootham and his assistant, the doctors treating Thenali, are jealous of a relatively junior doctor Kailash getting all the media attention. They send Thenali over to him, believing his failure to cure Thenali of his phobias will derail his success. Soon after their first appointment, Kailash heads to his home in [[Kodaikanal]] on a vacation with his wife Jalaja and his two children Arjun and Aishwarya. Kailash tells Thenali to wait until after the vacation before his therapy can begin, but Panchabhootham asks for Thenali to go meet Kailash while on vacation.\n\nRajinikanth played a supporting role.\n\nThenali reaches Kailash's Kodaikanal home. He falls in love with Janaki, Kailash's younger sister, which is vehemently opposed by the latter. The whole film is about how Kailash goes mad with Thenali's antics and even begins to suspect that his wife has an affair with Thenali, as she has a soft corner for the latter. He even tries to kill Thenali by tying him to a tree with a [[time bomb]]. Thenali, thinking it is a fake bomb used only to relieve him from his fears, removes it and puts it in Kailash's house where it explodes. Seeing this, Kailash suffers a paralytic attack. Thenali later marries Janaki.\n\nWhile Thenali, Kailash, and family are at a picnic, Thenali's long-lost wife shows up and reunites with him. Enraged, Kailash jumps out of his wheelchair and berates Thenali for ruining Janaki's life, but soon realises this was all a set-up by Thenali to cure Kailash's paralysis through [[Shock therapy (psychiatry)|shock treatment]], which succeeded; the woman was actually actress [[Meena (actress)|Meena]], who Thenali hired to pose as his wife.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Thenali Soman\n* [[Jayaram]] as Kailash\n* [[Devayani (actress)|Devayani]] as Jalaja\n* [[Jyothika]] as Janaki\n* [[Delhi Ganesh]] as Dr. Panchabhootham\n* [[Charle]] as Guide Kanthaswamy\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Dr. Panchabhootham's assistant\n* [[Madhan Bob]] as \"Diamond\" Babu\n* Master Suraj as Arjun, Kailash's son\n* Baby Taj Nisha as Aishwarya, Kailash's daughter\n* [[Crane Manohar]] as Servant\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Raj TV Reporter\n* Bayilvan Ranganathan as Inspector\n* [[Meena Durairaj|Meena]] as Meena (cameo)\n* [[C.
