The program has seen success throughout the years, culminating in a national championship in 1959 under coach [[Pete Newell]], and the team has reached the final four two other times, in 1946 and 1960. The current head coach is [[Mark Fox (basketball)| Mark Fox]], who began his tenure at Cal in 2019.\n\nThe team plays its home games at [[Haas Pavilion]], which was long known as Harmon Gym before being heavily renovated with money donated in part by the owners of Levi Strauss & Co.<ref>{{cite web|title=Haas Pavilion|url=http://www.calbears.com/sports/2013/4/17/208212524.aspx|publisher=California Golden Bears|date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref> The arena was originally known as Men's Gymnasium and then later Harmon Gymnasium until the late 1990s when it went through renovations which displaced the team for two seasons.\n\n==History==\nThe Golden Bears first played basketball intercollegiately in 1907 and began full conference play in 1915. The 1920s was the dominant decade for Cal basketball, as the Bears won 6 conference titles under coaches E.H. Wright and [[Nibs Price]]. Cal was retroactively recognized as the pre-[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] national champion for the 1926\u201327 season by the [[Premo-Porretta Power Poll]].<ref>{{cite book|title=ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game|editor-last=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Books|location=New York, NY|year=2009|pages=538|ISBN=978-0-345-51392-2}}</ref>\n\nNibs Price would coach Cal with great success for 30 years from 1924 to 1954, earning a 449-294 total record, many single season winning records, and an additional 3 conference titles in the 1930s and 1940s.{{refn|group=n|Price was also Cal's football coach from 1926 to 1930, leading the 1926 and 1927 [[History of California Golden Bears football#Nibs_Price,_Smith's successor|Wonder Teams]] to undefeated seasons.}}\n\nCal reached the pinnacle of the sport during the tenure of [[Pete Newell]], who was head coach from 1955 to 1960. The Golden Bears earned the conference title four out of his five years and in 1959, won the [[1959 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA title]]. In Newell's last year, Cal came close to another NCAA title, but lost to [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] in the final.\n\nThe fortunes of Cal men's basketball would never be the same after Newell. The next quarter-century would mostly be a dreary one for the program, despite having players such as [[Butch Hays]] (1981\u20131984) and [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]] (1983\u20131987) who would both set school records for assists. From 1960 to 1985, the Bears tallied only two winning seasons in conference play. [[Lou Campanelli]] served as head coach from 1986 - 1993. The highlight of this era was a 75&ndash;67 victory over UCLA in 1986 that ended a 25-year, 52 game losing streak to the Bruins. Campanelli in his first season took the Golden Bears to the [[1986 National Invitation Tournament]], the first post season appearance of any sort since 1960.  In 1990, Campanelli led the Golden Bears to their first NCAA Tournament in 30 years.\n\nCal achieved much better success in the 1990s, qualifying for the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] five times with future NBA players [[Jason Kidd]] (the Golden Bears all-time assists leader) and [[Lamond Murray]], as well as future perennial All-Pro NFL tight end [[Tony Gonzalez]] in the early and mid 1990s and [[Sean Lampley]] and [[Shareef Abdur-Rahim]] in the late 1990s. Cal also won the 1999 [[National Invitation Tournament]], with a thrilling 61-60 victory over [[Clemson University|Clemson]] in the title game.\n\nThis success came amid a brief period of turmoil in the mid-1990s. Campanelli was fired midway through the 1992-93 season after athletic director Bob Bockrath heard Campanelli berate his players with obscenity-laden tirades following two losses. Assistant [[Todd Bozeman]] finished out the season, and was named permanent head coach after leading the Bears to an upset of two-time defending champion Duke in the NCAA Tournament. Bozeman himself was pushed out two months before the 1996-97 season after it emerged that he'd funneled $30,000 over two years to the parents of star recruit [[Jelani Gardner]] so they could make the drive to see their son play. Ultimately, the Bears were docked four scholarships over two years and forfeited the entire 1994-95 season and all but one game of the 1995-96 season.\n\nIn 2006, the Golden Bears reached their first [[Pacific Life]] Pac-10 Men's Basketball Tournament championship game. Power forward [[Leon Powe]] grabbed a tournament-record 20 rebounds against USC in the first round and then scored a tournament-record 41 points in a double-overtime victory versus Oregon in the semi-finals. Despite California's 71-52 loss to UCLA in the final game, Powe was named Most Valuable Player for the tournament.\n\n[[Ben Braun]] took over for Bozeman just before the 1996-97 season. Inheriting a team expected to be barely competitive in the Pac-10, Braun led the Bears to a second-place finish and took them all the way to the Sweet 16. During Braun's 12-year tenure, Cal qualified for the NCAA tournament three straight times in the 2000s and six times overall. However, after finishing near the bottom of the Pac-10 for the second straight year, Braun was dismissed in late March 2008. The former coach of rival Stanford, [[Mike Montgomery]], succeeded Braun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/|title=Sporting News - NFL - NCAA - NBA - MLB - NASCAR - UFC - WWE|website=Sporting News}}</ref> In his first year the Bears finished tied for third in the Pac-10 and made it to the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where they were eliminated in the first round to the [[Maryland Terrapins]].\n\nIn Montgomery's second season, the Bears won their first conference title in 50 years. The team, featuring four seniors as starters, only lost one game at Haas Pavilion but had a rough non-conference schedule featuring losses to elite teams such as [[University of Kansas|Kansas]], [[Ohio State]], and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]], which quickly knocked them out of the national rankings after being ranked #13 in the pre-season. Despite losing the Pac-10 tournament, and questions on whether even the conference champion of a down Pac-10 conference would receive an at-large bid to the tournament, the Bears qualified for their second straight NCAA bid as a #8 seed. They were able to one-up their previous season by winning their first round matchup against the [[Louisville Cardinals]] but fell to the eventual national champions, [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]], in the second round. Senior [[Jerome Randle]] finished the season and his career as Cal's all-time leading scorer. The highlight of Montgomery's last season as the head coach for Cal was the signature win at home against then undefeated, No. 1 [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]]. In thrilling fashion, senior guard [http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/2488934/justin-cobbs Justin Cobbs] hits the game-winning jumper with 0.9 on the clock for a 60\u201358 victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400506083|title=Arizona vs. California - Game Recap - February 1, 2014 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nMike Montgomery announced his retirement shortly after the 2013-14 season's culmination, resulting in the hiring of [[Cuonzo Martin]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209449392 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025004242/http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209449392 |archive-date=2014-10-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Bears went 18-15 in Martin's first season as head coach.  On April 13, 2015, 5-star [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Ivan Rabb]] of [[Bishop O'Dowd High School]] announced he would be attending Cal. A little more than 2 weeks later, 5-star [[small forward]] [[Jaylen Brown]] announced he too would attend Cal, making this recruiting class the best in Cal history. While the team had a solid regular season, earning a #4 seed in the [[2016 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], they would be upset in the first round by Hawaii.  After three seasons, Martin announced his resignation to become the head coach at [[University of Missouri|Missouri]].  Shortly thereafter, Martin's assistant coach [[Wyking Jones]] became Cal's 17th head basketball coach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.calbears.com/news/2017/3/24/wyking-jones-named-mens-basketball-head-coach.aspx?path=mbball|title=Wyking Jones Named Men's Basketball Head Coach|access-date=2017-03-30}}</ref> Jones coached for only two years, with the team finishing in the last place of the [[Pac-12 Conference men's basketball|Pac-12]] during both seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/collegesports/article/Cal-reverses-field-fires-basketball-coach-Wyking-13712829.php|title=Cal reverses field, fires head coach Wyking Jones|author=Rusty Simmons|date=2019-03-24|publisher=SFChronicle.com|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref>  Former Georgia head coach [[Mark Fox (basketball)| Mark Fox]] was named Cal's 18th head basketball coach in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://calbears.com/news/2019/3/29/mark-fox-named-mens-basketball-coach.aspx |title=Mark Fox Named Men\u2019s Basketball Coach |date=March 29, 2019 |work=Cal Athletics}}</ref>\n\n==Season-by-season results==\n{{CBB Yearly Record Start | type = team | conference =  | postseason = | poll = both}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = No Coach | conference = no | startyear = 1907 | endyear = 1915}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship = | season = 1907\u201308 | name =No Coach | overall = 1\u20130 | conference = \u2014 | confstanding = \u2014 | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship = | season = 1908\u201309 | name =No Coach | overall = 8\u20130 | conference = \u2014 | confstanding = \u2014 | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship = | season = 1911\u201312 | name =No Coach | overall = 2\u20130 | conference = \u2014 | confstanding = \u2014 | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship = | season = 1912\u201313 | name =No Coach | overall = 2\u20130 | conference = \u2014 | confstanding = \u2014 | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship = | season = 1913\u201314 | name =No Coach | overall = 2\u20130 | conference = \u2014 | confstanding = \u2014 | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship = | season = 1914\u201315 | name =No Coach | overall = 6\u20130 | conference = \u2014 | confstanding = \u2014 | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subtotal | name = No Coach | overall = 21\u20130 ''(1.000)'' | confrecord = }} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Kilduff | conference = <small>[[Pac-12 Conference|PCC]]</small> | startyear = 1915 | endyear = 1916}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship = conference | season = 1915\u201316 | name =Patrick Kilduff | overall = 11\u20135 | conference = 5\u20133 | confstanding = 1st | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 = no}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subtotal | name = Kilduff | overall = 11\u20135 ''(.688)'' | confrecord = 5\u20133 ''(.625)'' }} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Ben Cherrington | conference = <small>[[Pac-12 Conference|PCC]]</small> | startyear = 1916 | endyear = 1917}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship =  | season = 1916\u201317 | name =Ben Cherrington | overall = 15\u20131 | conference = 5\u20131 | confstanding = 2nd | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 = no}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subtotal | name = Ben Cherrington | overall = 15\u20131 ''(.938)'' | confrecord = 5\u20131 ''(.833)'' }} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Walter Christie | conference = no | startyear = 1917 | endyear = 1918}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship =  | season = 1917\u201318 | name =Walter Christie | overall = 8\u20132 | conference = \u2014 | confstanding = \u2014 | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Subtotal | name = Walter Christie | overall = 8\u20132 ''(.800)'' | confrecord =  }} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = William Hollender | conference = <small>[[Pac-12 Conference|PCC]]</small> | startyear = 1918 | endyear = 1920}}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship =  | season = 1918\u201319 | name =William Hollender | overall = 6\u20133 | conference = 2\u20132 | confstanding = 3rd | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Entry | championship =  | season = 1919\u201320 | name =William Hollender | overall = 8\u20132 | conference = 5\u20135 | confstanding = 2nd | postseason = \u2014 | ranking = no| ranking2 =no}} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Subtotal | name = William Hollender | overall = 14\u20138 ''(.636)'' | confrecord = 7\u20137 ''(.500)'' }} \n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = E.

The program has seen success throughout the years, culminating in a national championship in 1959 under coach [[Pete Newell]], and the team has reached the final four two other times, in 1946 and 1960. The current head coach is [[Mark Fox (basketball)| Mark Fox]], who began his tenure at Cal in 2019.\n\nThe team plays its home games at [[Haas Pavilion]], which was long known as Harmon Gym before being heavily renovated with money donated in part by the owners of Levi Strauss & Co.<ref>{{cite web|title=Haas Pavilion|url=http://www.calbears.com/sports/2013/4/17/208212524.aspx|publisher=California Golden Bears|date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref> The arena was originally known as Men's Gymnasium and then later Harmon Gymnasium until the late 1990s when it went through renovations which displaced the team for two seasons.\n\n==History==\nThe Golden Bears first played basketball intercollegiately in 1907 and began full conference play in 1915. The 1920s was the dominant decade for Cal basketball, as the Bears won 6 conference titles under coaches E.H. Wright and [[Nibs Price]]. Cal was retroactively recognized as the pre-[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] national champion for the 1926\u201327 season by the [[Premo-Porretta Power Poll]].<ref>{{cite book|title=ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game|editor-last=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Books|location=New York, NY|year=2009|pages=538|ISBN=978-0-345-51392-2}}</ref>\n\nNibs Price would coach Cal with great success for 30 years from 1924 to 1954, earning a 449-294 total record, many single season winning records, and an additional 3 conference titles in the 1930s and 1940s.{{refn|group=n|Price was also Cal's football coach from 1926 to 1930, leading the 1926 and 1927 [[History of California Golden Bears football#Nibs_Price,_Smith's successor|Wonder Teams]] to undefeated seasons.}}\n\nCal reached the pinnacle of the sport during the tenure of [[Pete Newell]], who was head coach from 1955 to 1960. The Golden Bears earned the conference title four out of his five years and in 1959, won the [[1959 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA title]]. In Newell's last year, Cal came close to another NCAA title, but lost to [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] in the final.\n\nThe fortunes of Cal men's basketball would never be the same after Newell. The next quarter-century would mostly be a dreary one for the program, despite having players such as [[Butch Hays]] (1981\u20131984) and [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]] (1983\u20131987) who would both set school records for assists. From 1960 to 1985, the Bears tallied only two winning seasons in conference play. [[Lou Campanelli]] served as head coach from 1986 - 1993. The highlight of this era was a 75&ndash;67 victory over UCLA in 1986 that ended a 25-year, 52 game losing streak to the Bruins. Campanelli in his first season took the Golden Bears to the [[1986 National Invitation Tournament]], the first post season appearance of any sort since 1960.  In 1990, Campanelli led the Golden Bears to their first NCAA Tournament in 30 years.\n\nCal achieved much better success in the 1990s, qualifying for the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] five times with future NBA players [[Jason Kidd]] (the Golden Bears all-time assists leader) and [[Lamond Murray]], as well as future perennial All-Pro NFL tight end [[Tony Gonzalez]] in the early and mid 1990s and [[Sean Lampley]] and [[Shareef Abdur-Rahim]] in the late 1990s. Cal also won the 1999 [[National Invitation Tournament]], with a thrilling 61-60 victory over [[Clemson University|Clemson]] in the title game.\n\nThis success came amid a brief period of turmoil in the mid-1990s. Campanelli was fired midway through the 1992-93 season after athletic director Bob Bockrath heard Campanelli berate his players with obscenity-laden tirades following two losses. Assistant [[Todd Bozeman]] finished out the season, and was named permanent head coach after leading the Bears to an upset of two-time defending champion Duke in the NCAA Tournament. Bozeman himself was pushed out two months before the 1996-97 season after it emerged that he'd funneled $30,000 over two years to the parents of star recruit [[Jelani Gardner]] so they could make the drive to see their son play. Ultimately, the Bears were docked four scholarships over two years and forfeited the entire 1994-95 season and all but one game of the 1995-96 season.\n\nIn 2006, the Golden Bears reached their first [[Pacific Life]] Pac-10 Men's Basketball Tournament championship game. Power forward [[Leon Powe]] grabbed a tournament-record 20 rebounds against USC in the first round and then scored a tournament-record 41 points in a double-overtime victory versus Oregon in the semi-finals. Despite California's 71-52 loss to UCLA in the final game, Powe was named Most Valuable Player for the tournament.\n\n[[Ben Braun]] took over for Bozeman just before the 1996-97 season. Inheriting a team expected to be barely competitive in the Pac-10, Braun led the Bears to a second-place finish and took them all the way to the Sweet 16. During Braun's 12-year tenure, Cal qualified for the NCAA tournament three straight times in the 2000s and six times overall. However, after finishing near the bottom of the Pac-10 for the second straight year, Braun was dismissed in late March 2008. The former coach of rival Stanford, [[Mike Montgomery]], succeeded Braun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/|title=Sporting News - NFL - NCAA - NBA - MLB - NASCAR - UFC - WWE|website=Sporting News}}</ref> In his first year the Bears finished tied for third in the Pac-10 and made it to the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where they were eliminated in the first round to the [[Maryland Terrapins]].\n\nIn Montgomery's second season, the Bears won their first conference title in 50 years. The team, featuring four seniors as starters, only lost one game at Haas Pavilion but had a rough non-conference schedule featuring losses to elite teams such as [[University of Kansas|Kansas]], [[Ohio State]], and [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]], which quickly knocked them out of the national rankings after being ranked #13 in the pre-season. Despite losing the Pac-10 tournament, and questions on whether even the conference champion of a down Pac-10 conference would receive an at-large bid to the tournament, the Bears qualified for their second straight NCAA bid as a #8 seed. They were able to one-up their previous season by winning their first round matchup against the [[Louisville Cardinals]] but fell to the eventual national champions, [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]], in the second round. Senior [[Jerome Randle]] finished the season and his career as Cal's all-time leading scorer. The highlight of Montgomery's last season as the head coach for Cal was the signature win at home against then undefeated, No. 1 [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]]. In thrilling fashion, senior guard [http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/2488934/justin-cobbs Justin Cobbs] hits the game-winning jumper with 0.9 on the clock for a 60\u201358 victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400506083|title=Arizona vs. California - Game Recap - February 1, 2014 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nMike Montgomery announced his retirement shortly after the 2013-14 season's culmination, resulting in the hiring of [[Cuonzo Martin]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209449392 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025004242/http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209449392 |archive-date=2014-10-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Bears went 18-15 in Martin's first season as head coach.

A little more than 2 weeks later, 5-star [[small forward]] [[Jaylen Brown]] announced he too would attend Cal, making this recruiting class the best in Cal history. While the team had a solid regular season, earning a #4 seed in the [[2016 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], they would be upset in the first round by Hawaii.  After three seasons, Martin announced his resignation to become the head coach at [[University of Missouri|Missouri]].
