The series replaced the outgoing [[TVR Vixen]] and [[TVR Tuscan (1967)|Tuscan]] models, and is characterized by a common [[chassis]] and shared body style. As with other TVR models before and since, the M-series cars use a [[front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout]] and [[body-on-frame]] construction. The bodies themselves were built from [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP). The era of the M series is commonly associated with Martin Lilley who, together with his father, took ownership of the company on 30 November 1965.<ref name=\"hayesr\">{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=Russel |title=TVR: Ever the Extrovert |publisher=Haynes Publishing |date=August 2009 |isbn=978-1-84425-507-8}}</ref>\n\nThe M series was regarded by contemporary reviewers as being loud and fast and having excellent roadholding. This came at the expense of unusual ergonomics, and heating and ventilation systems that were sometimes problematic.<ref>{{cite journal |title=TVR Taimar |journal=Motor |date=10 December 1977 }}</ref><ref name=\"roadtrack78\">{{cite journal |title=TVR Taimar Roadster - Spitting into the wind |journal=Road & Track |date=December 1978}}</ref>\n\nThe series includes the 1600M, 2500M, 3000M, 3000S, and Taimar, as well as [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] versions of the 3000M, 3000S, and Taimar. The first model to start production was the 2500M in March 1972, after being built as a prototype in 1971.<ref name=\"filby-passion\">{{cite book |last=Filby |first=Peter |title=TVR: A Passion to Succeed |publisher=Autocraft Books |date=July 2012 |isbn=978-0-9545729-2-1}}</ref> A small number of 5.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered cars were finished or converted by the TVR North America importer; these were sold as the 5000M.<ref name=\"mort_anglo-american\">{{cite book |last=Mort |first=Norm |title=Anglo-American Cars: From the 1930s to the 1970s |publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd. |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-84584-233-8}}</ref> A total of 2,465 M-series cars were built over the nine years of production. Because of the hand-built and low-volume nature of TVR production, there are many small and often-undocumented variations between cars of the same model that arise due to component availability and minor changes in the build process.\n\nThe American market was financially very important to TVR, and Gerry Sagerman oversaw import and distribution of the cars within the United States from his facility on [[Long Island]]. Approximately thirty dealers sold TVRs in the eastern part of the country. John Wadman handled distribution of the cars in [[Canada]] through his business, JAG Auto Enterprises.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n==Chassis==\nThe [[backbone chassis]] for the M-series cars was designed by automotive engineer and dealer Mike Bigland in 1971. Bigland had been hired by Lilley after demonstrating a number of suspension and steering improvements he had made to a 1967 TVR Tuscan SE owned by one John Burton. The chassis Bigland designed was of a central-backbone layout with perimeter tubes. Both round- and square-section 14-gauge and 16-gauge [[Hollow structural section|steel tube]] was used in the construction, with the square sections used to allow easier joining of the frame to the body. To facilitate production of the new chassis, Lilley upgraded TVR's workshop with [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]] that allowed two welders to produce five units per week. During testing, Bigland drove the gold-painted prototype car between his own workshop in [[Halesowen]] and the TVR factory several times per week.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nUnusual at the time, TVR offered a five-year guarantee against corrosion on the M-series chassis. Corrosion was prevented by leaving a film of oil from the manufacturing process on the metal, capping the ends of the tubes, and fastening components without driving fasteners through the tube walls.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n[[File:TVR Cabrio 1982.jpg|thumb|1979 TVR 3000S Convertible, with detachable sidescreens in place]]\nThe radiator selected for the M series was shallow enough to allow locating the spare wheel in front of the engine; this improved luggage space behind the seats (where the spare wheel had been stored on pre-M-series models) and also offered some additional crash protection for occupants. An M-series car was sent to the [[Motor Industry Research Association]] in 1971 for crash testing, and it was the only vehicle that remained steerable after a {{Convert|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front-end collision with a concrete wall.<ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\">{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=John |title=TVR: The Complete Story |publisher=The Crowood Press Ltd. |year=1994 |isbn=1-85223-796-1}}</ref> Indeed, the engine remained in position through the impact, the doors were still openable, and the steering column had actually moved forward (away from the driver.) This last fact almost caused the MIRA officials to require that the car be re-tested, as they presumed that such as result was not possible and was a result of a fault with their measurement instruments. Mike Bigland was able to demonstrate to the officials that the result was legitimate, and approval was granted.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nThe car's suspension was via [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbones]] and coil springs front and rear. Although the wishbones and aluminum hub carriers were an original TVR design, many components on the cars were sourced from other manufacturers. The brakes, which were 11-inch [[Disc brake|discs]] at the front and 9-inch [[Drum brakes|drums]] at the rear, came from the [[Triumph TR6]]. Steering on all cars was via [[Rack and pinion|rack-and-pinion]], with the rack manufactured by [[Alford & Alder]]. The steering column was a [[British Leyland]] part. Some components &mdash; such as the differential carrier and front suspension wishbones &mdash; were unique to TVR and manufactured in their own welding shop.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nBecause of production overlap between the M-series cars and earlier models, some earlier models were built with the pre-M bodywork over an M-series chassis. This includes the last series of the TVR 2500 (comprising ninety-six cars; known in the US as the Vixen 2500 and not to be confused with the 2500M), all twenty-three Vixen S4s, and the final six examples of the TVR 1300 (which used the 1296&nbsp;cc [[Standard SC engine]] from the [[Triumph Spitfire]]). The very last 1300 was also built with M-series bodywork, although it was not officially given the \"1300M\" designation.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n==Body and trim==\nThe M-series body was an evolution of the outgoing Vixen and Tuscan body. The doors, roof, forward bulkhead, and front windscreen were kept the same, leaving the bonnet and rear end to be restyled. At the start of M-series production, the fibreglass sections were baked at {{convert|140|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} after being moulded, then given an etch coat, six coats of [[Primer (paint)|primer]], and three coats of [[nitrocellulose]] [[lacquer]] paint. Partway through production, the paint shop changed to a two-pack acrylic paint process.<ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\"/> Graphic artist John Bailie designed the contrasting side stripe that was first introduced on the turbocharged cars in 1976 (and was available by customer request on all M-series cars in the following years.)<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nBigland styled the car's bonnet while Lilley styled the rear with the help of Joe Mleczek, who had been with the company since 1959 and who had experience in working with GRP. Lilley also designed the interior and trim. Initially, the 1600M, 2500M, and 3000M all featured vents on the bonnet and front wings. By 1975, the 1600M and 3000M were being built without the vents but they were retained on the 2500M due to its tendency to run hot.\n\nMany components were sourced from Ford models, including the [[Ford Consul|Consul]] windscreen that was used on all M-series variants apart from the 3000S. The taillights were initially the [[Ford Cortina#Mk2|Ford Cortina Mark II]] units as had been used on late Vixens and Tuscans, mounted upside down. These were later replaced by [[Triumph TR6]] lights, which were then replaced with smaller square [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] lamps in a 1976 facelift which also affected the front.<ref name=Pistonhead>{{cite web | url = http://www.pistonheads.com/tvr/m/3000m.asp | first = Jo | last = Hemelsoet | year = 2001 | title = TVR M Series: 3000M | publisher = Pistonheads.com | accessdate = 12 August 2012 }}</ref><ref name=Mgallery>{{cite web | url = http://www.tvr-m.com/gallery/Mbodies.htm | title = TVR M Fixed Head Coup\u00e9: Gallery | first = Chris | last = Howson | work = TVR M-Series Site }}</ref> Multiple styles of alloy wheels were offered on the cars over the course of production, including a design by Wolfrace and the \"T-slot\" design, which was created by Mike Bigland and manufactured by Telcast. [[Chrome plating|Chrome-plated]] steel bumpers, adapted from those used on the [[Triumph 2000]], were used until September 1974, at which point they were replaced with black [[foam rubber]] bumpers.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nThe [[corduroy]]-covered seats used in the M series were finished by Callow & Maddox Ltd., a car trimming and [[Upholstery|upholstering]] company then located in [[Exhall]], [[Coventry]]. The foam padding used in the seats has a tendency to crumble and disintegrate, which prompts some owners to find suitable replacements. Most aftermarket seats will not fit in the glassfibre tub; only unusually low and narrow seats (such as those from the 1984 to 1988 [[Pontiac Fiero]]) can accommodate the car's bodyshell. During M-series production, TVR was dealing with more than two hundred external suppliers, and stored approximately three months' worth of components to reduce sensitivity to outside production variation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bowler |first=Michael |title=TVR Travels Very Rapidly |journal=Motor |date=29 July 1972 }}</ref>\n\nAfter production of the M series ended, TVR sold the production rights and tooling for many M-series components (including GRP bodies) to David Gerald TVR Sportscars Ltd.\n\n==1600M==\n[[File:Tvr 1600 ar.jpg|thumb|1977 TVR 1600M, with the third and last taillight configuration]]\nThe 1600M, introduced in June 1972, used the 1.6L [[Ford Kent]] engine as found in the [[Ford Capri]] GT. Power was transmitted via a four-speed Ford gearbox and a Triumph Spitfire differential. The 1600M was discontinued in April 1973, only to be revived for the 1975 model year to meet increased demand for fuel-efficient vehicles in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In October 1972, it cost [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1980.

Also borrowed from the TR6 were its gearbox, [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], and front suspension uprights.\n\nThe 2500M was only offered in the UK home market until 1973, after which point it was no longer sold there due to the availability of the 3000M, which featured significantly better performance. Later, with the introduction of the [[Triumph TR7|TR7]], Triumph stopped production of the 2.5&nbsp;L TR6 engine, and TVR discontinued the 2500M completely when supplies of the engine were exhausted in 1977. The 2.5L Triumph engine had an inherent fault when fitted to the 2500M. It would continually over heat in traffic or at high revs.{{cn|date=December 2015}}\n\n\nIn October 1972, the 2500M cost \u00a32151.

This would prove to be a one-off exercise (due to the difficulty of acquiring brand new Rover V8s at the time.)<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n[[File:TVR Taimar Heck.jpg|Rear of a Taimar, showing the separate hatch|thumb|left]]\nThe first major alteration to the M-series body was the [[hatchback]] Taimar, introduced at the October 1976 British International Motor Show and using the same mechanicals as the 3000M. The name was inspired by the name of Martin's friend's girlfriend, Tayma.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/> The opening hatchback alleviated the previous difficulty of maneuvering luggage over the seats to stow it in the cargo area, and the hatch itself was opened electrically via a [[solenoid]]-actuated latch triggered by a button on the driver's doorjamb. Over its three-year production, a total of 395 normally aspirated Taimars were built.<ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\"/>\n\nTo commemorate the first decade of Lilley's ownership of TVR, twelve 3000M anniversary cars where produced. Because the company had originally planned to build exactly ten, the first ten of these cars were individually numbered (\"Martin 1\" through \"Martin 10\").<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/> Each car had a pair of special kick plates.<ref name=\"sprint-sep95\">{{cite journal |last=Larner |first=Mervyn |date=Sep 1995 |title=Model Register - Martin Lilley Era |journal=TVR Sprint}}</ref> The cars were painted Rover Tobacco Leaf with a Rover Mexico Brown model band and finished with a brown vinyl roof with a lighter brown vinyl sunroof. The cars were fitted with all the extras available, including Wolfrace alloy wheels.

Only the nose of the car was the same as the previous coupes, as the windscreen, doors, and rear end had all been reworked. The redesign of the doors precluded the possibility of using wind-up windows, so sliding sidecurtains were instead fitted. These could be removed entirely and stowed in the boot, which, for the first time on a TVR, was a separate compartment with its own lid. The boot lid was operated electrically in a manner similar to the Taimar's hatch. Its design was not finalised by the time the first cars entered production, so the first several cars (including the prototype) were built with no cutout for boot access. The final styling tweaks and the production of moulds for the fibreglass were done by Topolec Ltd. of [[Norfolk]].<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/> The styling of the 3000S was revived in a somewhat modernised form later, with the 1987 introduction of the [[TVR S series]] (although the S series shared almost no components with the M-series cars.)\n\nThe windscreen and convertible top had been adapted from those used on the [[Jensen-Healey]] roadster. Because [[Jensen Motors]] had ceased operation in 1976, the windscreen and sidecurtain designs were done by a company named Jensen Special Products, which was run by former Jensen employees. The design for the convertible top was finalised by Car Hood Company in Coventry.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nOne of the minor undocumented variations found on M-series cars is the presence of a map light built into the upper windscreen surround of the 3000S. It appears to have been included only on a very small number of cars built near the end of the production run.\n\nWhen production of the 3000S ended (with 258 cars built<ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\"/>), it cost \u00a38,730. Reportedly, 67 of these cars were in a [[left-hand drive]] configuration,<ref name=\"belmog\">{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/belmog/prijslijst/auto.html|title=PRIVATE COLLECTION FOR SALE|accessdate=9 June 2008|publisher=Belmog}}</ref> and 49 were exported to [[North America]].<ref name=\"conceptcarz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/chassisNum.aspx?carID=13697&iDNumID=1843|title=Concept Carz - TVR 3000S|accessdate=9 June 2008|publisher=conceptcarz.com}}</ref>\n\n===US emissions certification===\nUS rules meant that Triumph's federally certified 2.5&nbsp;L inline-six engine could be installed in TVRs for US sale with less rigorous testing, even though Triumph themselves stopped offering this engine in 1976. Aware that supplies of the Triumph 2.5&nbsp;L engine would eventually be exhausted, TVR had contracted Californian company Olson Engineering, Inc. to design modifications to the Essex V6 such that it could be [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]-certified in 1976.{{efn|In several books on the topic, the name of Olson Engineering is misspelled \"Olsen\".}} A legislative change also meant that the Essex engine could now be certified with the less onerous process.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Spitting into the wind | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January\u2013February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | pages = 198-199 }}</ref> They were successful in this effort, and imports of the {{convert|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Essex-engined M-series cars began late in 1977 (for 1978).

The new company was to be headed by an American, Pierre Arquin. A shipment of approximately twenty 3000Ss arrived in September 1979, and were marked by the import company as being emissions compliant without the Olson Engineering emissions kit actually having been fit. Dealers were made aware of this fact, but were each apparently coerced into buying at least two of the non-compliant cars with the threat of withholding spare parts for other TVR models. One dealer explained the situation to a customer who happened to work for the US government in an emissions-regulation capacity, and he reported the violation to the authorities. The cars were then impounded. During the long period of time during which Martin Lilley attempted to communicate with US customs officials to resolve the situation, the cars were neglected and stored outside, where they deteriorated and were vandalized. The cars were eventually re-exported, repaired, and sold in Germany, but the short-term financial impact of the unsalable cars (worth over \u00a3100,000 in total) was damaging to the development of the M-series replacement, the Tasmin.<ref name=\"hayesr\"/><ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\"/><ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n===Specifications===\n\n[[File:TVR 3000M engine compartment.jpg|Engine compartment in a TVR 3000M (right-hand drive)|thumb|right]]\n*Top speed - {{Convert|121|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Acceleration:\n:0-60 mph: 7.7 sec\n:30-50 mph in top: 6.6 sec\n:50-70 mph in top: 6.1 sec\n*Engine displacement - 2,994&nbsp;cc (bore and stroke: {{Convert|93.6|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} x {{Convert|72.4|mm|in|1|abbr=on}})\n*Engine type - Normally aspirated [[cast-iron]] [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)|V6]] with [[pushrod]]-operated two-valve cast-iron [[Cylinder head|heads]]\n*Compression ratio - 9.0:1\n*Fueling - Twin-choke Weber 38 non-progressive carburettor\n*Peak power - {{Convert|138|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm\n*Peak torque - {{Convert|192|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 3,000&nbsp;rpm\n*Transmission - 4-speed manual, optional [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]]\n*Numbers built:\n:3000M: 654\n:Taimar: 395\n:3000S: 258\n*Chassis numbers:\n:3000M: 2410FM through 4940FM\n:Taimar: 3838FM through 4966FM\n:3000S: 4286FM through 4968FM\n\n==Turbos==\nTo further increase the performance of the 3000M, TVR contracted Ralph Broad's engine tuning company, [[Broadspeed]], to develop a turbocharging system for the Essex engine. The resultant 3000M Turbo prototype was unveiled at the 1975 [[British International Motor Show]] at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]], and subsequently went into production. In lieu of [[fuel injection]], a carburettor was run inside a pressurized box atop the engine, and the turbocharger itself was mounted low and forward in the engine compartment, requiring the exhaust manifolds to exit forward. The compression ratio was lowered to reduce the engine's internal stresses. The turbocharged cars were fitted with Koni dampers and wider tyres than on the naturally aspirated model. Ultimately, TVR also produced small numbers of the Taimar Turbo and 3000S Turbo.\n\nAmong all the Turbo cars, four were built with the \"Special Equipment\" (SE) specification, which included a leather interior, flared wheel arches, large Compomotive split-rim alloy wheels, and a limited-slip differential. Of these four cars, three were Taimar Turbo SEs and one was a 3000S Turbo SE. The single 3000S Turbo SE was used by Martin Lilley as his personal transport until he sold it. The SE specification was also available for the normally aspirated cars, although estimates vary on the number built. Some cars that were originally built with the standard specifically were repaired with SE-style wheel arch flares by customer request.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nThe chassis numbers for the turbocharged cars were within the number ranges used by their normally aspirated counterparts.\n\n===Specifications===\n\n*Top speed - {{Convert|140|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}\n*Acceleration:\n:0-60 mph: 5.7 sec\n:30-50 mph in top: 7.1 sec\n:50-70 mph in top: 6.4 sec\n*Compression ratio - 8.0:1\n*Fueling - Twin-choke Weber carburetter\n*Peak power - {{Convert|230|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm\n*Peak torque - {{Convert|273|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 3500 rpm\n*Numbers built:\n:3000M Turbo: 20\n:Taimar Turbo: 30\n:3000S Turbo: 13\n\n==5000M==\n[[File:'78 TVR 5000M (Hudson).JPG|A TVR 5000M|thumb|right]]\nIn 1974, John Wadman (the president of the Canada-based import company TVR North America) began a project to replace the Triumph 2.5&nbsp;L engine in a yellow 2500M with a Ford [[Ford Windsor engine#302|302 cu in Windsor V8]]. Wadman handled the engineering of the conversion, which involved the use of different engine mounts, radiator, and springs. The Ford V8 was mated to a [[BorgWarner]] T-4 gearbox with a rear differential from the [[Chevrolet Corvette]], and the resultant \"5000M\" was shown at the 1975 Toronto International Auto Show.<ref name=\"mort_anglo-american\"/>\n\nFollowing the 1975 fire that damaged the TVR factory in Blackpool, TVR NA ordered and pre-paid six cars from the manufacturer. This gesture helped to secure future support from TVR for Wadman's V8 conversions: the factory eventually supplied five M-series coupes without engines or transmissions, specifically for the purpose of V8 installations. TVR NA also converted three cars that were originally equipped with the Ford Essex V6, but that arrived from the factory with cracks in the [[cylinder block]]. In 1978, the factory built a car (painted white with a brown stripe) that was designated \"5000M\"; this was also shipped to Canada for a V8 installation. Since 1980, six Taimars have been converted to the Ford V8 as well.<ref name=\"mort_anglo-american\"/>\n[[File:TVR5000M Stripe.JPG|thumb|Portion of the side stripe painted by the TVR factory on one of the M-series TVRs shipped to TVR North America Canada.]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|TVR M-series}}\n* [http://nwarner.worldonline.co.uk/tvr3000s.htm Nigel Warner's 3000S rebuild]\n* [http://tvr.m-fix.co.uk/ M-Fix (M-Series technical library)]\n* [http://www.tvr-m.com/rebuild/rebuild.htm Chris Howson's 3000S rebuild]\n* [http://www.hemmings.com/hsx/stories/2006/01/01/hmn_feature18.html Hemming Motor News feature on Martin Lilley]\n* [http://www.tvr-3000m.co.uk/ Project M - TVR 3000M Restoration]\n{{TVR}}\n{{TVR road car timeline}}\n\n[[Category:TVR vehicles|M series]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1971]]\n[[Category:Automobiles with backbone chassis]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image=TVR M Series at British Invasion 2009.jpg\n| name=TVR M Series\n| manufacturer=[[TVR]]\n| production=1972&ndash;1979\n| predecessor=[[TVR Vixen]]<br />[[TVR Tuscan (1967)]]\n| successor=[[TVR Tasmin]]\n| class=[[Sports Car]] / [[Roadster (automobile)|Roadster]]\n| layout=[[Front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|FMR]]\n| assembly=[[Blackpool]], [[England]]\n| length = {{convert|155|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|64|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|47|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe) or {{convert|44|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (roadster)\n| weight = {{convert|1972|lb|abbr=on}} - {{convert|2250|lb|abbr=on}}\n| engine = [[Ford Kent engine|Ford Kent]] 1.6L [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Triumph I6|Triumph 2.5L]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)|Ford Essex 3.0L]] [[V6 engine|V6]]\n}}\n\nThe '''TVR M series''' is a line of [[sports car]]s built by automaker [[TVR]] between 1972 and 1979. The series replaced the outgoing [[TVR Vixen]] and [[TVR Tuscan (1967)|Tuscan]] models, and is characterized by a common [[chassis]] and shared body style. As with other TVR models before and since, the M-series cars use a [[front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout]] and [[body-on-frame]] construction. The bodies themselves were built from [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP). The era of the M series is commonly associated with Martin Lilley who, together with his father, took ownership of the company on 30 November 1965.<ref name=\"hayesr\">{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=Russel |title=TVR: Ever the Extrovert |publisher=Haynes Publishing |date=August 2009 |isbn=978-1-84425-507-8}}</ref>\n\nThe M series was regarded by contemporary reviewers as being loud and fast and having excellent roadholding. This came at the expense of unusual ergonomics, and heating and ventilation systems that were sometimes problematic.<ref>{{cite journal |title=TVR Taimar |journal=Motor |date=10 December 1977 }}</ref><ref name=\"roadtrack78\">{{cite journal |title=TVR Taimar Roadster - Spitting into the wind |journal=Road & Track |date=December 1978}}</ref>\n\nThe series includes the 1600M, 2500M, 3000M, 3000S, and Taimar, as well as [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] versions of the 3000M, 3000S, and Taimar. The first model to start production was the 2500M in March 1972, after being built as a prototype in 1971.<ref name=\"filby-passion\">{{cite book |last=Filby |first=Peter |title=TVR: A Passion to Succeed |publisher=Autocraft Books |date=July 2012 |isbn=978-0-9545729-2-1}}</ref> A small number of 5.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered cars were finished or converted by the TVR North America importer; these were sold as the 5000M.<ref name=\"mort_anglo-american\">{{cite book |last=Mort |first=Norm |title=Anglo-American Cars: From the 1930s to the 1970s |publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd. |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-84584-233-8}}</ref> A total of 2,465 M-series cars were built over the nine years of production. Because of the hand-built and low-volume nature of TVR production, there are many small and often-undocumented variations between cars of the same model that arise due to component availability and minor changes in the build process.\n\nThe American market was financially very important to TVR, and Gerry Sagerman oversaw import and distribution of the cars within the United States from his facility on [[Long Island]]. Approximately thirty dealers sold TVRs in the eastern part of the country. John Wadman handled distribution of the cars in [[Canada]] through his business, JAG Auto Enterprises.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n==Chassis==\nThe [[backbone chassis]] for the M-series cars was designed by automotive engineer and dealer Mike Bigland in 1971. Bigland had been hired by Lilley after demonstrating a number of suspension and steering improvements he had made to a 1967 TVR Tuscan SE owned by one John Burton. The chassis Bigland designed was of a central-backbone layout with perimeter tubes. Both round- and square-section 14-gauge and 16-gauge [[Hollow structural section|steel tube]] was used in the construction, with the square sections used to allow easier joining of the frame to the body. To facilitate production of the new chassis, Lilley upgraded TVR's workshop with [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]] that allowed two welders to produce five units per week. During testing, Bigland drove the gold-painted prototype car between his own workshop in [[Halesowen]] and the TVR factory several times per week.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nUnusual at the time, TVR offered a five-year guarantee against corrosion on the M-series chassis. Corrosion was prevented by leaving a film of oil from the manufacturing process on the metal, capping the ends of the tubes, and fastening components without driving fasteners through the tube walls.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n[[File:TVR Cabrio 1982.jpg|thumb|1979 TVR 3000S Convertible, with detachable sidescreens in place]]\nThe radiator selected for the M series was shallow enough to allow locating the spare wheel in front of the engine; this improved luggage space behind the seats (where the spare wheel had been stored on pre-M-series models) and also offered some additional crash protection for occupants. An M-series car was sent to the [[Motor Industry Research Association]] in 1971 for crash testing, and it was the only vehicle that remained steerable after a {{Convert|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front-end collision with a concrete wall.<ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\">{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=John |title=TVR: The Complete Story |publisher=The Crowood Press Ltd. |year=1994 |isbn=1-85223-796-1}}</ref> Indeed, the engine remained in position through the impact, the doors were still openable, and the steering column had actually moved forward (away from the driver.) This last fact almost caused the MIRA officials to require that the car be re-tested, as they presumed that such as result was not possible and was a result of a fault with their measurement instruments. Mike Bigland was able to demonstrate to the officials that the result was legitimate, and approval was granted.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nThe car's suspension was via [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbones]] and coil springs front and rear. Although the wishbones and aluminum hub carriers were an original TVR design, many components on the cars were sourced from other manufacturers. The brakes, which were 11-inch [[Disc brake|discs]] at the front and 9-inch [[Drum brakes|drums]] at the rear, came from the [[Triumph TR6]]. Steering on all cars was via [[Rack and pinion|rack-and-pinion]], with the rack manufactured by [[Alford & Alder]]. The steering column was a [[British Leyland]] part. Some components &mdash; such as the differential carrier and front suspension wishbones &mdash; were unique to TVR and manufactured in their own welding shop.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nBecause of production overlap between the M-series cars and earlier models, some earlier models were built with the pre-M bodywork over an M-series chassis. This includes the last series of the TVR 2500 (comprising ninety-six cars; known in the US as the Vixen 2500 and not to be confused with the 2500M), all twenty-three Vixen S4s, and the final six examples of the TVR 1300 (which used the 1296&nbsp;cc [[Standard SC engine]] from the [[Triumph Spitfire]]). The very last 1300 was also built with M-series bodywork, although it was not officially given the \"1300M\" designation.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n==Body and trim==\nThe M-series body was an evolution of the outgoing Vixen and Tuscan body. The doors, roof, forward bulkhead, and front windscreen were kept the same, leaving the bonnet and rear end to be restyled. At the start of M-series production, the fibreglass sections were baked at {{convert|140|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} after being moulded, then given an etch coat, six coats of [[Primer (paint)|primer]], and three coats of [[nitrocellulose]] [[lacquer]] paint. Partway through production, the paint shop changed to a two-pack acrylic paint process.<ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\"/> Graphic artist John Bailie designed the contrasting side stripe that was first introduced on the turbocharged cars in 1976 (and was available by customer request on all M-series cars in the following years.)<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nBigland styled the car's bonnet while Lilley styled the rear with the help of Joe Mleczek, who had been with the company since 1959 and who had experience in working with GRP. Lilley also designed the interior and trim. Initially, the 1600M, 2500M, and 3000M all featured vents on the bonnet and front wings. By 1975, the 1600M and 3000M were being built without the vents but they were retained on the 2500M due to its tendency to run hot.\n\nMany components were sourced from Ford models, including the [[Ford Consul|Consul]] windscreen that was used on all M-series variants apart from the 3000S. The taillights were initially the [[Ford Cortina#Mk2|Ford Cortina Mark II]] units as had been used on late Vixens and Tuscans, mounted upside down. These were later replaced by [[Triumph TR6]] lights, which were then replaced with smaller square [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] lamps in a 1976 facelift which also affected the front.<ref name=Pistonhead>{{cite web | url = http://www.pistonheads.com/tvr/m/3000m.asp | first = Jo | last = Hemelsoet | year = 2001 | title = TVR M Series: 3000M | publisher = Pistonheads.com | accessdate = 12 August 2012 }}</ref><ref name=Mgallery>{{cite web | url = http://www.tvr-m.com/gallery/Mbodies.htm | title = TVR M Fixed Head Coup\u00e9: Gallery | first = Chris | last = Howson | work = TVR M-Series Site }}</ref> Multiple styles of alloy wheels were offered on the cars over the course of production, including a design by Wolfrace and the \"T-slot\" design, which was created by Mike Bigland and manufactured by Telcast. [[Chrome plating|Chrome-plated]] steel bumpers, adapted from those used on the [[Triumph 2000]], were used until September 1974, at which point they were replaced with black [[foam rubber]] bumpers.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nThe [[corduroy]]-covered seats used in the M series were finished by Callow & Maddox Ltd., a car trimming and [[Upholstery|upholstering]] company then located in [[Exhall]], [[Coventry]]. The foam padding used in the seats has a tendency to crumble and disintegrate, which prompts some owners to find suitable replacements. Most aftermarket seats will not fit in the glassfibre tub; only unusually low and narrow seats (such as those from the 1984 to 1988 [[Pontiac Fiero]]) can accommodate the car's bodyshell. During M-series production, TVR was dealing with more than two hundred external suppliers, and stored approximately three months' worth of components to reduce sensitivity to outside production variation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bowler |first=Michael |title=TVR Travels Very Rapidly |journal=Motor |date=29 July 1972 }}</ref>\n\nAfter production of the M series ended, TVR sold the production rights and tooling for many M-series components (including GRP bodies) to David Gerald TVR Sportscars Ltd.\n\n==1600M==\n[[File:Tvr 1600 ar.jpg|thumb|1977 TVR 1600M, with the third and last taillight configuration]]\nThe 1600M, introduced in June 1972, used the 1.6L [[Ford Kent]] engine as found in the [[Ford Capri]] GT. Power was transmitted via a four-speed Ford gearbox and a Triumph Spitfire differential. The 1600M was discontinued in April 1973, only to be revived for the 1975 model year to meet increased demand for fuel-efficient vehicles in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In October 1972, it cost [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1980.

Also borrowed from the TR6 were its gearbox, [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], and front suspension uprights.\n\nThe 2500M was only offered in the UK home market until 1973, after which point it was no longer sold there due to the availability of the 3000M, which featured significantly better performance. Later, with the introduction of the [[Triumph TR7|TR7]], Triumph stopped production of the 2.5&nbsp;L TR6 engine, and TVR discontinued the 2500M completely when supplies of the engine were exhausted in 1977. The 2.5L Triumph engine had an inherent fault when fitted to the 2500M. It would continually over heat in traffic or at high revs.{{cn|date=December 2015}}\n\n\nIn October 1972, the 2500M cost \u00a32151.

This would prove to be a one-off exercise (due to the difficulty of acquiring brand new Rover V8s at the time.)<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n[[File:TVR Taimar Heck.jpg|Rear of a Taimar, showing the separate hatch|thumb|left]]\nThe first major alteration to the M-series body was the [[hatchback]] Taimar, introduced at the October 1976 British International Motor Show and using the same mechanicals as the 3000M. The name was inspired by the name of Martin's friend's girlfriend, Tayma.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/> The opening hatchback alleviated the previous difficulty of maneuvering luggage over the seats to stow it in the cargo area, and the hatch itself was opened electrically via a [[solenoid]]-actuated latch triggered by a button on the driver's doorjamb.

Only the nose of the car was the same as the previous coupes, as the windscreen, doors, and rear end had all been reworked. The redesign of the doors precluded the possibility of using wind-up windows, so sliding sidecurtains were instead fitted. These could be removed entirely and stowed in the boot, which, for the first time on a TVR, was a separate compartment with its own lid. The boot lid was operated electrically in a manner similar to the Taimar's hatch. Its design was not finalised by the time the first cars entered production, so the first several cars (including the prototype) were built with no cutout for boot access. The final styling tweaks and the production of moulds for the fibreglass were done by Topolec Ltd. of [[Norfolk]].<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/> The styling of the 3000S was revived in a somewhat modernised form later, with the 1987 introduction of the [[TVR S series]] (although the S series shared almost no components with the M-series cars.)\n\nThe windscreen and convertible top had been adapted from those used on the [[Jensen-Healey]] roadster. Because [[Jensen Motors]] had ceased operation in 1976, the windscreen and sidecurtain designs were done by a company named Jensen Special Products, which was run by former Jensen employees. The design for the convertible top was finalised by Car Hood Company in Coventry.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nOne of the minor undocumented variations found on M-series cars is the presence of a map light built into the upper windscreen surround of the 3000S. It appears to have been included only on a very small number of cars built near the end of the production run.\n\nWhen production of the 3000S ended (with 258 cars built<ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\"/>), it cost \u00a38,730. Reportedly, 67 of these cars were in a [[left-hand drive]] configuration,<ref name=\"belmog\">{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/belmog/prijslijst/auto.html|title=PRIVATE COLLECTION FOR SALE|accessdate=9 June 2008|publisher=Belmog}}</ref> and 49 were exported to [[North America]].<ref name=\"conceptcarz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/chassisNum.aspx?carID=13697&iDNumID=1843|title=Concept Carz - TVR 3000S|accessdate=9 June 2008|publisher=conceptcarz.com}}</ref>\n\n===US emissions certification===\nUS rules meant that Triumph's federally certified 2.5&nbsp;L inline-six engine could be installed in TVRs for US sale with less rigorous testing, even though Triumph themselves stopped offering this engine in 1976. Aware that supplies of the Triumph 2.5&nbsp;L engine would eventually be exhausted, TVR had contracted Californian company Olson Engineering, Inc. to design modifications to the Essex V6 such that it could be [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]-certified in 1976.{{efn|In several books on the topic, the name of Olson Engineering is misspelled \"Olsen\".}} A legislative change also meant that the Essex engine could now be certified with the less onerous process.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Spitting into the wind | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January\u2013February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | pages = 198-199 }}</ref> They were successful in this effort, and imports of the {{convert|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Essex-engined M-series cars began late in 1977 (for 1978).

The new company was to be headed by an American, Pierre Arquin. A shipment of approximately twenty 3000Ss arrived in September 1979, and were marked by the import company as being emissions compliant without the Olson Engineering emissions kit actually having been fit. Dealers were made aware of this fact, but were each apparently coerced into buying at least two of the non-compliant cars with the threat of withholding spare parts for other TVR models. One dealer explained the situation to a customer who happened to work for the US government in an emissions-regulation capacity, and he reported the violation to the authorities. The cars were then impounded. During the long period of time during which Martin Lilley attempted to communicate with US customs officials to resolve the situation, the cars were neglected and stored outside, where they deteriorated and were vandalized. The cars were eventually re-exported, repaired, and sold in Germany, but the short-term financial impact of the unsalable cars (worth over \u00a3100,000 in total) was damaging to the development of the M-series replacement, the Tasmin.<ref name=\"hayesr\"/><ref name=\"tiplerj_complete\"/><ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\n===Specifications===\n\n[[File:TVR 3000M engine compartment.jpg|Engine compartment in a TVR 3000M (right-hand drive)|thumb|right]]\n*Top speed - {{Convert|121|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Acceleration:\n:0-60 mph: 7.7 sec\n:30-50 mph in top: 6.6 sec\n:50-70 mph in top: 6.1 sec\n*Engine displacement - 2,994&nbsp;cc (bore and stroke: {{Convert|93.6|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} x {{Convert|72.4|mm|in|1|abbr=on}})\n*Engine type - Normally aspirated [[cast-iron]] [[Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)|V6]] with [[pushrod]]-operated two-valve cast-iron [[Cylinder head|heads]]\n*Compression ratio - 9.0:1\n*Fueling - Twin-choke Weber 38 non-progressive carburettor\n*Peak power - {{Convert|138|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm\n*Peak torque - {{Convert|192|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 3,000&nbsp;rpm\n*Transmission - 4-speed manual, optional [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]]\n*Numbers built:\n:3000M: 654\n:Taimar: 395\n:3000S: 258\n*Chassis numbers:\n:3000M: 2410FM through 4940FM\n:Taimar: 3838FM through 4966FM\n:3000S: 4286FM through 4968FM\n\n==Turbos==\nTo further increase the performance of the 3000M, TVR contracted Ralph Broad's engine tuning company, [[Broadspeed]], to develop a turbocharging system for the Essex engine. The resultant 3000M Turbo prototype was unveiled at the 1975 [[British International Motor Show]] at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]], and subsequently went into production. In lieu of [[fuel injection]], a carburettor was run inside a pressurized box atop the engine, and the turbocharger itself was mounted low and forward in the engine compartment, requiring the exhaust manifolds to exit forward. The compression ratio was lowered to reduce the engine's internal stresses. The turbocharged cars were fitted with Koni dampers and wider tyres than on the naturally aspirated model. Ultimately, TVR also produced small numbers of the Taimar Turbo and 3000S Turbo.\n\nAmong all the Turbo cars, four were built with the \"Special Equipment\" (SE) specification, which included a leather interior, flared wheel arches, large Compomotive split-rim alloy wheels, and a limited-slip differential. Of these four cars, three were Taimar Turbo SEs and one was a 3000S Turbo SE. The single 3000S Turbo SE was used by Martin Lilley as his personal transport until he sold it. The SE specification was also available for the normally aspirated cars, although estimates vary on the number built. Some cars that were originally built with the standard specifically were repaired with SE-style wheel arch flares by customer request.<ref name=\"filby-passion\"/>\n\nThe chassis numbers for the turbocharged cars were within the number ranges used by their normally aspirated counterparts.\n\n===Specifications===\n\n*Top speed - {{Convert|140|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}\n*Acceleration:\n:0-60 mph: 5.7 sec\n:30-50 mph in top: 7.1 sec\n:50-70 mph in top: 6.4 sec\n*Compression ratio - 8.0:1\n*Fueling - Twin-choke Weber carburetter\n*Peak power - {{Convert|230|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm\n*Peak torque - {{Convert|273|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 3500 rpm\n*Numbers built:\n:3000M Turbo: 20\n:Taimar Turbo: 30\n:3000S Turbo: 13\n\n==5000M==\n[[File:'78 TVR 5000M (Hudson).JPG|A TVR 5000M|thumb|right]]\nIn 1974, John Wadman (the president of the Canada-based import company TVR North America) began a project to replace the Triumph 2.5&nbsp;L engine in a yellow 2500M with a Ford [[Ford Windsor engine#302|302 cu in Windsor V8]]. Wadman handled the engineering of the conversion, which involved the use of different engine mounts, radiator, and springs. The Ford V8 was mated to a [[BorgWarner]] T-4 gearbox with a rear differential from the [[Chevrolet Corvette]], and the resultant \"5000M\" was shown at the 1975 Toronto International Auto Show.<ref name=\"mort_anglo-american\"/>\n\nFollowing the 1975 fire that damaged the TVR factory in Blackpool, TVR NA ordered and pre-paid six cars from the manufacturer. This gesture helped to secure future support from TVR for Wadman's V8 conversions: the factory eventually supplied five M-series coupes without engines or transmissions, specifically for the purpose of V8 installations. TVR NA also converted three cars that were originally equipped with the Ford Essex V6, but that arrived from the factory with cracks in the [[cylinder block]]. In 1978, the factory built a car (painted white with a brown stripe) that was designated \"5000M\"; this was also shipped to Canada for a V8 installation. Since 1980, six Taimars have been converted to the Ford V8 as well.<ref name=\"mort_anglo-american\"/>\n[[File:TVR5000M Stripe.JPG|thumb|Portion of the side stripe painted by the TVR factory on one of the M-series TVRs shipped to TVR North America Canada.]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|TVR M-series}}\n* [http://nwarner.worldonline.co.uk/tvr3000s.htm Nigel Warner's 3000S rebuild]\n* [http://tvr.m-fix.co.uk/ M-Fix (M-Series technical library)]\n* [http://www.tvr-m.com/rebuild/rebuild.htm Chris Howson's 3000S rebuild]\n* [http://www.hemmings.com/hsx/stories/2006/01/01/hmn_feature18.html Hemming Motor News feature on Martin Lilley]\n* [http://www.tvr-3000m.co.uk/ Project M - TVR 3000M Restoration]\n{{TVR}}\n{{TVR road car timeline}}\n\n[[Category:TVR vehicles|M series]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1971]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Automobiles with backbone chassis]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed redundant category as per WP:Subcat.
