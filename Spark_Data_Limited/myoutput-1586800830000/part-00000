Adorjan stated 'The main thing is not the score, but the trend, which, in my opinion is favourable'.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 41</ref> Adorjan's statement came true in game 11, which was won by Kasparov in just 25 moves, following an oversight by Karpov on move 22.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 42-46</ref><ref>[http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2010/09/kasparov-karpov-game-analysis-video-by.html#links Video about the game]</ref>\n\nGames 12, 13 and 15 were all drawn quickly.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 47-52, 57-59</ref>  '''Game 14''' also ended in a draw after forceful and accurate play on both sides.

Karpov was the first to deviate, but Kasparov had analysed the position deeply in his preparation before the match, and was able to take the initiative, despite playing with the black pieces.\n\nKasparov's positioning of a knight deep in his opponent's position as early as move 16 (see first diagram) was spectacular and ultimately decisive.  The knight remained in place until move 34, when Karpov was forced to [[sacrifice]] his [[queen (chess)|queen]] to remove it.\n\n''[[Chess Informant]]'' readers selected this game as the best game of the first 64 issues.<ref name = \"MW\" />\n\nThe game progressed as follows (notes based on Kasparov's analysis):\n\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|'''Karpov - Kasparov, Game 16'''\n<!-- generated by WikiChessDiagram 2.01 by Bubba73 -->\n|rd|  |  |qd|rd|  |kd|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |pd|pd|pd\n|pd|  |  |  |  |nd|  |  \n|  |pd|bd|pl|  |bd|bl|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|nl|  |nl|nd|  |bl|  |  \n|pl|pl|  |ql|  |pl|pl|pl\n|  |  |  |rl|  |rl|kl|  \n| (after 16 ...

Kasparov won the game in 42 moves, to extend his lead to 2 points.

His playing style did not lend itself to playing for a draw, so he decided to accept an open battle, with chances on both sides.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 89</ref>\n\nKarpov began a direct attack on Kasparov's king as early as move 15, and had chances to build up a strong attack.  Kasparov sacrificed a pawn to blunt the attack and then a second pawn to launch a blistering counterattack. Under pressure from the clock, Karpov made decisive errors on move 36<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 94</ref>  and move 40. Kasparov won the World Championship after Karpov resigned on move 42.\n\n==Results==\n\nThe match was played as the best of 24 games.

Adorjan stated 'The main thing is not the score, but the trend, which, in my opinion is favourable'.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 41</ref> Adorjan's statement came true in game 11, which was won by Kasparov in just 25 moves, following an oversight by Karpov on move 22.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 42-46</ref><ref>[http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2010/09/kasparov-karpov-game-analysis-video-by.html#links Video about the game]</ref>\n\nGames 12, 13 and 15 were all drawn quickly.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 47-52, 57-59</ref>  '''Game 14''' also ended in a draw after forceful and accurate play on both sides.  Kasparov later rated game 14 as \"perhaps the 'cleanest' game of the match\".<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 56</ref>\n\nSo the scores after 15 games were level at 7\u00bd - 7\u00bd, and the match was already past the halfway point.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Game 16 - Kasparov's masterpiece===\nThe first 10 moves of '''game 16''' were identical to those from game 12.  Karpov was the first to deviate, but Kasparov had analysed the position deeply in his preparation before the match, and was able to take the initiative, despite playing with the black pieces.\n\nKasparov's positioning of a knight deep in his opponent's position as early as move 16 (see first diagram) was spectacular and ultimately decisive.  The knight remained in place until move 34, when Karpov was forced to [[sacrifice]] his [[queen (chess)|queen]] to remove it.\n\n''[[Chess Informant]]'' readers selected this game as the best game of the first 64 issues.<ref name = \"MW\" />\n\nThe game progressed as follows (notes based on Kasparov's analysis):\n\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|'''Karpov - Kasparov, Game 16'''\n<!-- generated by WikiChessDiagram 2.01 by Bubba73 -->\n|rd|  |  |qd|rd|  |kd|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |pd|pd|pd\n|pd|  |  |  |  |nd|  |  \n|  |pd|bd|pl|  |bd|bl|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|nl|  |nl|nd|  |bl|  |  \n|pl|pl|  |ql|  |pl|pl|pl\n|  |  |  |rl|  |rl|kl|  \n| (after 16 ...

Kasparov won the game in 42 moves, to extend his lead to 2 points.  With Kasparov now needing only four draws from five games to become World Champion, Karpov needed to start winning games.\n\nIn '''Game 20''', Karpov fought hard to force a victory, but was unable to win the game, and a draw was agreed after 85 moves.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 74-77</ref>  '''Game 21''' also ended in a draw, this time with Kasparov generally in the ascendancy for the majority of the game.<ref>\"In this game I had a very real chance of gaining my twelfth point\" Kasparov 1986, p. 81</ref>\n\nIn '''Game 22''', Kasparov made a serious mistake from a good position, and lost the game after further mistakes from both sides.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 82-85</ref>\n\n'''Game 23''' ended in a draw, leaving Kasparov on 12 points against Karpov's 11.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 86-88</ref>  Karpov needed to win with the white pieces to retain the title.\n\n===Game 24 - Karpov's must-win game===\nKasparov called '''game 24''' the \"game of his life\" and has stated that working out the strategy for this encounter was difficult for him.  His playing style did not lend itself to playing for a draw, so he decided to accept an open battle, with chances on both sides.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 89</ref>\n\nKarpov began a direct attack on Kasparov's king as early as move 15, and had chances to build up a strong attack.  Kasparov sacrificed a pawn to blunt the attack and then a second pawn to launch a blistering counterattack. Under pressure from the clock, Karpov made decisive errors on move 36<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 94</ref>  and move 40. Kasparov won the World Championship after Karpov resigned on move 42.\n\n==Results==\n\nThe match was played as the best of 24 games.
