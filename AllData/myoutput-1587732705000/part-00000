The name of the rank is always the full phrase and is never shortened to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]], which is a rank in various naval forces.\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE NATO OF CODES. THEY GO FROM 1 TO 10 AND ARE NOT THE SAME AS UNITED STATES O CODES WHICH RANK FROM 1 TO 11. OF-1 COVERS BOTH O-1 AND O-2-->\nAir commodore is a [[one-star rank]] and the most junior air officer rank, being immediately senior to [[group captain]] and immediately subordinate to [[air vice-marshal]]. It has a [[NATO]] ranking code of OF-6 and is equivalent to a [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]] in the [[Royal Navy]] or a [[brigadier]] in the [[British Army]] or the [[Royal Marines]]. Unlike these two ranks, however, it has always been a substantive rank. Additionally, air commodores have always been considered to be air officers whilst Royal Navy commodores have not since the Napoleonic Wars been classified as officers of flag rank, and British Army brigadiers have not been considered to be general officers since 1922 when they ceased to be titled as brigadier-generals. In other NATO forces, such as the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], the equivalent one-star rank is [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].\n\nThe equivalent rank in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]], [[Women's Royal Air Force]] (until 1968) and [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]] (until 1980) was \"air commandant\".\n\n==Royal Air Force use and history==\nIn the present-day RAF, air commodores typically hold senior appointments within [[Group (air force)|groups]], acting directly in support of the [[air officer commanding]]. However, during the inter-war period, and in the case of the contemporary [[No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group (United Kingdom)|No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group]], the air officer commanding held or holds air commodore rank.  In the [[Air Training Corps]], an appointed air commodore holds ultimate authority over the cadet organisation as the [[Commandant Air Cadets]].\n\n===Origins===\nOn 1 April 1918, the newly created RAF adopted its officer rank titles from the [[British Army]], with officers at what is now air commodore holding the rank of [[brigadier-general]]. In response to the proposal that the RAF should use its own rank titles, it was suggested that the RAF might use the [[Royal Navy officer rank insignia|Royal Navy's officer ranks]], with the word \"air\" inserted before the naval rank title. Although the [[Admiralty]] objected to this simple modification of their rank titles, it was agreed that the RAF might base many of its officer rank titles on Navy officer ranks with differing pre-modifying terms. It was also suggested that [[air officer|air-officer]] ranks could be based on the term \"ardian\", which was derived from a combination of the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] words for \"chief\" (''ard'') and \"bird\" (''eun''), with the term \"fourth ardian\" or \"flight ardian\" being used for the equivalent to brigadier-general and commodore. However, the rank title based on the Navy rank was preferred and air commodore was adopted on 1 August 1919.\n\n===RAF insignia, command flag and star plate===\nThe rank insignia is a light-blue band on a broad black band worn on both the lower sleeves of the tunic or on the shoulders of the flying suit or the casual uniform. On the [[Mess dress|mess uniform]], air commodores wear a broad gold ring on both lower sleeves.\n\nThe command flag of an air commodore has one narrow red band running through the centre and is rectangular with a cut-away section giving it two tails. It is the only RAF command flag of this shape and it is similar in shape to that of a Royal Navy commodore's [[broad pennant]]. The vehicle star plate for an air commodore depicts a single white star (air commodore is equivalent to a one-star rank) on an air force blue background. RAF air commodores are classed as [[air officer]]s and as such have two rows of [[Scrambled egg (uniform)|gold oak leaves]] on the peak of their service dress hats.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:File-UK-Air-OF6-mess-insignia.svg|An RAF air commodore's sleeve mess insignia\nFile:RAF-Air Cdre-OF-6.png            |An RAF air commodore's sleeve on No. 1 service dress uniform\nImage:UK-Air-OF6-Flag.svg             |An air commodore's command flag\n</gallery>\n\n===Honorary air commodores, air commodores-in-chief and air commandants===\n{{See also|:Category:Honorary air commodores}}\n[[Image:Churchil at the Tehran Conference 1943.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|Churchill in his air commodore's uniform at the 1943 Tehran Conference]]\nThe [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] may appoint honorary air commodores for RAF flying squadrons and stations.

In official French Canadian usage, the rank title was ''commodore de l'air''. The position of honorary air commodore still exists in the [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs with the RAF, large air force organisations or formations in the other [[Commonwealth realms]] may be honoured by having an [[air commodore-in-chief]] appointed in their name.

(A [[free translation]] of the army rank of ''taxiarchis'', which originated in ancient Greece, is \"one who orders\" and the Greek root \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 ''taxis'' is also the basis of the aviation term [[taxiing|taxi]] \u2013 that is, to move one or more aircraft on the ground.)

Such a rank often has essentially the same rank insignia as that of an RAF air commodore.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Comodoro FACH.png                  |A [[Chilean Air Force|Chilean (CAF)]] ''Comodoro'' rank insignia.\nImage:Hellenic Air Force OF-6.svg       |A [[Hellenic Air Force|Greek (HAF)]] ''[[taxiarch]]os'' rank insignia.\nFile:Marsma pdh au.png                  |An [[Indonesian Air Force|Indonesian (IAF)]] air commodore's rank insignia.\nFile:Nl-luchtmacht-commodore.svg        |A [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|Netherlands (RNAF)]] commodore's rank insignia.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|United Kingdom|War|Aviation}}}}\n* [[Air force officer rank insignia]]\n* [[Comparison of United Kingdom and United States military ranks]]\n* [[List of comparative military ranks]]\n* [[RAF officer ranks]]\n* [[Ranks of the Royal Australian Air Force]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<br /><!-- White space to separate table from text -->\n{{UK officer ranks}}\n{{Military ranks by country}}\n{{Star officer ranks}}\n{{Highest Military Ranks}}\n\n[[Category:Military ranks of the Commonwealth]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of Australia]]\n[[Category:Former military ranks of Canada]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of India]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of the Royal Air Force]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of Bangladesh]]\n[[Category:Military ranks of Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Air force ranks]]\n[[Category:1 star officers]]\n", "name_user": "ViceAdmiral", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCommonwealth of Nations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_commodore"}
