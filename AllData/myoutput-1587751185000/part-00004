It is the site of an unusually intense collection of man-made [[marine debris]], known as the [[Great Pacific garbage patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].\n\nThe North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the much smaller [[North Pacific Subpolar Gyre]] make up the two major gyre systems in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Pacific Ocean.

This current influences the water column all the way to the bottom. The Kuroshio current flows in a northerly direction, then eventually flows further from the westward boundary where it then takes an eastward direction into the North Pacific. This eastward flowing current is then called the Kuroshio Extension. The [[North Pacific Current]] is located just north of the Subtropical Gyre and flows in an easterly direction.
