'''Dirk Johannes Hendrik (Dick) Dreux''' (27 May 1913 – 1978) was a Dutch writer of historical literature.

==Biography==
Dick Dreux was born in Amsterdam as a child of Hendrik Johannes Wilhelm Dreux and Cornelia Hendrika Johanna Lucke who divorced in 1921. He grew up with his grandparents from his mother's side. He attended the [[Hogere Burger School]] and in 1929, at age 16, joined the merchant navy. His adventurous life led him around the world and finally to Spain, where he fought against Franco's fascists in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He returned to the Netherlands just before the start of [[World War II]] in order to fulfill his military duty and keep his Dutch citizenship. He was interned in [[Amersfoort concentration camp]], and then labored in a work camp on the German island of [[Borkum]].<ref name=vondel>{{cite web|url=http://www.bertvanvondel.nl/dick-dreux-1913-78-kritisch-auteur/|accessdate=20 February 2019|language=nl|title=Dick Dreux, 1913-’78, kritisch auteur|date=29 October 2017|first=Bert|last=van Vondel}}</ref>

After the end of the war, he became an author, writing historical literature from a critical point of view, many of it published by the [[Arbeiderspers]], then a socialist publishing house. Dreux and his wife lived in Amsterdam, and later moved to a houseboat in [[Bussum]]. He free-lanced for magazines and newspapers and then worked for [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]], writing over 450 [[radio play]]s between 1959 and 1970. He also wrote [[Serial (literature)|serial stories]] for children's magazines like ''[[Donald Duck (Dutch comic book)|Donald Duck]]'' starting in the 1950s, and a number of his stories were illustrated by [[Hans Kresse]] and published as comic books. His style was accessible and conversational, for which he credited his grandfather, a \"born storyteller\".<ref name=vondel/>

Dreux died on 6 December 1978 in hospital in Naarden, and was buried in Bussum.<ref name=vondel/>

[[File:Josef Jirecek ZlataPraha 1888.png|thumb|right|150px|Josef Jireček (1888)]]
'''Josef Jireček''' (9 October 1825, in [[Vysoké Mýto]] – 25 November 1888, in [[Prague]]) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] scholar.

He was born in Vysoké Mýto (then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]).
He entered the Prague bureau of education in 1850, and became minister of the department in the [[Karl Sigmund von Hohenwart|Hohenwart]] cabinet in 1871. His efforts to secure equal educational privileges for the Slav nationalities in the Austrian dominions brought him into disfavour with the German element. He became a member of the Bohemian [[Landtag]] in 1878, and of the Austrian [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]] in 1879. His merits as a scholar were recognized in 1875 by his election as president of the [[Royal Czech Society of Sciences]]. He died in Prague on 25 November 1888.

In 1862, he and his brother [[Hermenegild Jirecek|Hermenegild Jireček]] strove to defend the genuineness of the [[Manuscripts of the Queen's Court and Green Mountain|Königinhof Manuscript]] discovered by [[Václav Hanka]]. He published in the [[Czech language]] an anthology of Czech literature (3&nbsp;volumes, 1858–1861), a biographical dictionary of Czech writers (2&nbsp;volumes, 1875–1876), a Czech hymnology, editions of [[Jan Blahoslav]]'s ''Czech grammar'' and of some Czech classics, and of the works of his father-in-law [[Pavel Josef Safarik]] (1795–1861).

His son was slavist [[Konstantin Josef Jireček]], his brother was historian [[Hermenegild Jireček]].
