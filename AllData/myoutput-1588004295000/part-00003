At the start of the conflict, the usefulness of aerial photography was not fully appreciated, with reconnaissance being accomplished with map sketching from the air.\n\nGermany adopted the first aerial camera, a [[Goerz (company)|G\u00f6rz]], in 1913. The French began the war with several squadrons of Bl\u00e9riot observation aircraft equipped with cameras for reconnaissance. The French Army developed procedures for getting prints into the hands of field commanders in record time.\n\n[[Frederick Charles Victor Laws]] started aerial photography experiments in 1912 with No.1 Squadron of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (later [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]]), taking photographs from the British dirigible [[British Army airship Beta|''Beta'']]. He discovered that vertical photos taken with a 60% overlap could be used to create a [[stereoscopic]] effect when viewed in a stereoscope, thus creating a perception of depth that could aid in cartography and in intelligence derived from aerial images. The Royal Flying Corps recon pilots began to use cameras for recording their observations in 1914 and by the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915, the entire system of German trenches was being photographed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://northstargallery.com/aerialphotography/history%20aerial%20photography/history.htm|title=A Brief History of Aerial Photography}}</ref> In 1916 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy made vertical camera axis aerial photos above Italy for map-making.\n\n[[File:Rumpler Taube monoplane.jpg|thumb|left|A German observation plane, the [[Rumpler Taube]].]]\nThe first purpose-built and practical aerial camera was invented by Captain [[John Moore-Brabazon]] in 1915 with the help of the [[Thornton-Pickard]] company, greatly enhancing the efficiency of aerial photography. The camera was inserted into the floor of the aircraft and could be triggered by the pilot at intervals. Moore-Brabazon also pioneered the incorporation of stereoscopic techniques into aerial photography, allowing the height of objects on the landscape to be discerned by comparing photographs taken at different angles.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/royal-flying-corps-founded|title=Royal Flying Corps Founded|magazine=History Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J06OFiCSBroC|title=How It Works: Science and Technology|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2003|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|page=33|isbn=9780761473145}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, aerial cameras had dramatically increased in size and [[optical power|focal power]] and were used increasingly frequently as they proved their pivotal military worth; by 1918 both sides were photographing the entire front twice a day and had taken over half a million photos since the beginning of the conflict. In January 1918, [[General Allenby]] used five Australian pilots from [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Squadron AFC]] to photograph a {{convert|624|sqmi|km2}} area in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] as an aid to correcting and improving maps of the Turkish front.

Although this seems obvious now, with modern reconnaissance tasks performed by fast, high flying aircraft, at the time it was radical thinking.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThey proposed the use of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] with their armament and [[radio]]s removed and replaced with extra fuel and cameras.  This led to the development of the [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)#PR Mk I \u2013 Early Reconnaissance Versions|Spitfire PR]] variants.  Spitfires proved to be extremely successful in their reconnaissance role and there were many variants built specifically for that purpose. They served initially with what later became [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU). In 1928, the [[RAF]] developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera. This allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/edgerton/www/pre-hee.html#aerial|title=Photography Before Edgerton}}</ref>  Based at [[RAF Medmenham]], the collection and interpretation of such photographs became a considerable enterprise.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cotton, Sidney|title=Aviator Extraordinary: The Sidney Cotton Story|publisher=Chatto & Windus|year=1969|page=169|isbn=0-7011-1334-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TUHbAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nCotton's aerial photographs were far ahead of their time. Together with other members of the 1 PRU, he pioneered the techniques of high-altitude, high-speed [[stereoscopic]] photography that were instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets. According to [[Reginald Victor Jones|R.V. Jones]], photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and the [[V-2 rocket]]. Cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment. At the peak, the British flew over 100 reconnaissance flights a day, yielding 50,000 images per day to interpret. Similar efforts were taken by other countries.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Abalone point ..

Pictures that will be used in photogrammetry are traditionally taken with special large format cameras with [[Calibration|calibrated]] and documented geometric properties.\n\n[[File:Night-time vertical aerial thermogram of a former kiln site.jpg|thumb| A vertical still from a kite aerial thermal video of part of a former brickworks site captured at night. http://www.armadale.org.uk/aerialthermography.htm]]\n\n===Combinations===\nAerial photographs are often combined.  Depending on their purpose it can be done in several ways, of which a few are listed below.\n* [[Panorama]]s can be made by [[Image stitching|stitching]] several photographs taken in different angles from one spot (e.g. with a hand held camera) or from different spots at the same angle (e.g. from a plane).\n* [[Stereo photography techniques]] allow for the creation of 3D-images from several photographs of the same area taken from different spots.\n* In [[pictometry]] five rigidly mounted cameras provide one vertical and four low oblique pictures that can be used together.\n* In some digital cameras for aerial photogrammetry images from several imaging elements, sometimes with separate lenses, are geometrically corrected and combined to one image in the camera.\n\n===Orthophotos===\nVertical photographs are often used to create [[orthophoto]]s, alternatively known as [[orthophotomap]]s, photographs which have been geometrically \"corrected\" so as to be usable as a map. In other words, an orthophoto is a simulation of a photograph taken from an infinite distance, looking straight down to [[nadir]]. Perspective must obviously be removed, but variations in terrain should also be corrected for. Multiple geometric transformations are applied to the image, depending on the perspective and terrain corrections required on a particular part of the image.\n\nOrthophotos are commonly used in [[geographic information system]]s, such as are used by mapping agencies (e.g. [[Ordnance Survey]]) to create maps. Once the images have been aligned, or \"registered\", with known real-world coordinates, they can be widely deployed.\n\nLarge sets of orthophotos, typically derived from multiple sources and divided into \"tiles\" (each typically 256 x 256 pixels in size), are widely used in online map systems such as [[Google Maps]]. [[OpenStreetMap]] offers the use of similar orthophotos for deriving new map data. [[Google Earth]] overlays orthophotos or [[satellite imagery]] onto a [[digital elevation model]] to simulate 3D landscapes.\n\n==Aerial video==\n[[File:Cliffs of Moher drone-video.webm|thumb|The [[Cliffs of Moher]], filmed with a drone (2014)]]\nWith advancements in video technology, [[aerial video]] is becoming more popular. Orthogonal video is shot from aircraft mapping pipelines, crop fields, and other points of interest.  Using GPS, video may be embedded with meta data and later synced with a video mapping program.\n\nThis \"Spatial Multimedia\" is the timely union of digital media including still photography, motion video, stereo, panoramic imagery sets, immersive media constructs, audio, and other data with location and date-time information from the GPS and other location designs.\n\nAerial videos are emerging Spatial Multimedia which can be used for scene understanding and object tracking. The input video is captured by low flying aerial platforms and typically consists of strong parallax from non-ground-plane structures. The integration of digital video, global positioning systems (GPS) and automated image processing will improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction. Several different aerial platforms are under investigation for the data collection.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Aerial archaeology]]\n* [[Aerial landscape art]]\n* [[:Category:Aerial photographers|Aerial photographers category]]\n* [[Aerial survey]]\n* [[Aerofilms]] Ltd., the first commercial aerial photography company in the UK, founded in 1919\n* [[Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance]]\n* [[Astrocam]]\n* [[Aviation photography]]\n* [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]]\n* [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton]] 1932 photo flight over [[Mount Everest]]\n* [[Fairchild K-20]] A WWII era aerial camera\n* [[Federal Aviation Regulations]]\n* [[Geoinformatics]]\n* [[Harvey Lloyd]]\n* [[Historic England Archive]] \u2013 the public archive of English Heritage, who hold one of the largest collections of aerial photographs of England\n* [[Kite aerial photography]]\n* [[Lidar]]\n* [[Oracle (rocket)|Oracle]] model photographic rocket\n* [[Photogrammetry]]\n* [[Pictometry]]\n* [[Pigeon photography]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[Satellite imagery]]\n* [[Scheimpflug principle]]\n* [[TopoFlight]]\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Price, Alfred (2003).

At the start of the conflict, the usefulness of aerial photography was not fully appreciated, with reconnaissance being accomplished with map sketching from the air.\n\nGermany adopted the first aerial camera, a [[Goerz (company)|G\u00f6rz]], in 1913. The French began the war with several squadrons of Bl\u00e9riot observation aircraft equipped with cameras for reconnaissance. The French Army developed procedures for getting prints into the hands of field commanders in record time.\n\n[[Frederick Charles Victor Laws]] started aerial photography experiments in 1912 with No.1 Squadron of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (later [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]]), taking photographs from the British dirigible [[British Army airship Beta|''Beta'']]. He discovered that vertical photos taken with a 60% overlap could be used to create a [[stereoscopic]] effect when viewed in a stereoscope, thus creating a perception of depth that could aid in cartography and in intelligence derived from aerial images. The Royal Flying Corps recon pilots began to use cameras for recording their observations in 1914 and by the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915, the entire system of German trenches was being photographed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://northstargallery.com/aerialphotography/history%20aerial%20photography/history.htm|title=A Brief History of Aerial Photography}}</ref> In 1916 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy made vertical camera axis aerial photos above Italy for map-making.\n\n[[File:Rumpler Taube monoplane.jpg|thumb|left|A German observation plane, the [[Rumpler Taube]].]]\nThe first purpose-built and practical aerial camera was invented by Captain [[John Moore-Brabazon]] in 1915 with the help of the [[Thornton-Pickard]] company, greatly enhancing the efficiency of aerial photography. The camera was inserted into the floor of the aircraft and could be triggered by the pilot at intervals. Moore-Brabazon also pioneered the incorporation of stereoscopic techniques into aerial photography, allowing the height of objects on the landscape to be discerned by comparing photographs taken at different angles.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/royal-flying-corps-founded|title=Royal Flying Corps Founded|magazine=History Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J06OFiCSBroC|title=How It Works: Science and Technology|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2003|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|page=33|isbn=9780761473145}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, aerial cameras had dramatically increased in size and [[optical power|focal power]] and were used increasingly frequently as they proved their pivotal military worth; by 1918 both sides were photographing the entire front twice a day and had taken over half a million photos since the beginning of the conflict. In January 1918, [[General Allenby]] used five Australian pilots from [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Squadron AFC]] to photograph a {{convert|624|sqmi|km2}} area in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] as an aid to correcting and improving maps of the Turkish front.

Fraser, [[Edward Patrick Kenny]], and L. W. Rogers photographed a block of land stretching from the Turkish front lines {{convert|32|mi|km}} deep into their rear areas. Beginning 5 January, they flew with a fighter escort to ward off enemy fighters. Using [[Royal Aircraft Factory BE.12]] and [[Martinsyde]] airplanes, they not only overcame enemy air attacks, but also had to contend with {{convert|65| mph|kph|abbr=on}} winds, antiaircraft fire, and malfunctioning equipment to complete their task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southsearepublic.org/2002_1999/afc_aces_taplin.htm#top |title=Lieutenant Leonard T.E.

Although this seems obvious now, with modern reconnaissance tasks performed by fast, high flying aircraft, at the time it was radical thinking.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThey proposed the use of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] with their armament and [[radio]]s removed and replaced with extra fuel and cameras.  This led to the development of the [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)#PR Mk I \u2013 Early Reconnaissance Versions|Spitfire PR]] variants.  Spitfires proved to be extremely successful in their reconnaissance role and there were many variants built specifically for that purpose. They served initially with what later became [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU). In 1928, the [[RAF]] developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera. This allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/edgerton/www/pre-hee.html#aerial|title=Photography Before Edgerton}}</ref>  Based at [[RAF Medmenham]], the collection and interpretation of such photographs became a considerable enterprise.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cotton, Sidney|title=Aviator Extraordinary: The Sidney Cotton Story|publisher=Chatto & Windus|year=1969|page=169|isbn=0-7011-1334-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TUHbAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nCotton's aerial photographs were far ahead of their time. Together with other members of the 1 PRU, he pioneered the techniques of high-altitude, high-speed [[stereoscopic]] photography that were instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets. According to [[Reginald Victor Jones|R.V. Jones]], photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and the [[V-2 rocket]]. Cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment.

Miniature vehicles do not replace full size aircraft, as full size aircraft are capable of longer flight times, higher altitudes, and greater equipment payloads.  They are, however, useful in any situation in which a full-scale aircraft would be dangerous to operate.  Examples would include the inspection of transformers atop power transmission lines and slow, low-level flight over agricultural fields, both of which can be accomplished by a large-scale radio controlled helicopter.  Professional-grade, gyroscopically stabilized camera platforms are available for use under such a model; a large model helicopter with a 26cc gasoline engine can hoist a payload of approximately seven kilograms (15&nbsp;lbs). In addition to gyroscopically stabilized footage, the use of RC copters as reliable aerial photography tools increased with the integration of FPV (first-person-view) technology. Many radio-controlled aircraft are now capable of utilizing Wi-Fi to stream live video from the aircraft's camera back to the pilot's or pilot in command's (PIC) ground station.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Regulations==\n\n===Australia===\nIn Australia Civil Aviation Safety Regulation 101 (CASR 101)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F1998B00220 |title=Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 |publisher=Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority |date=2002-12-19 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref> allows for commercial use of radio control aircraft.

Pictures that will be used in photogrammetry are traditionally taken with special large format cameras with [[Calibration|calibrated]] and documented geometric properties.\n\n[[File:Night-time vertical aerial thermogram of a former kiln site.jpg|thumb| A vertical still from a kite aerial thermal video of part of a former brickworks site captured at night. http://www.armadale.org.uk/aerialthermography.htm]]\n\n===Combinations===\nAerial photographs are often combined.  Depending on their purpose it can be done in several ways, of which a few are listed below.\n* [[Panorama]]s can be made by [[Image stitching|stitching]] several photographs taken in different angles from one spot (e.g. with a hand held camera) or from different spots at the same angle (e.g. from a plane).\n* [[Stereo photography techniques]] allow for the creation of 3D-images from several photographs of the same area taken from different spots.\n* In [[pictometry]] five rigidly mounted cameras provide one vertical and four low oblique pictures that can be used together.\n* In some digital cameras for aerial photogrammetry images from several imaging elements, sometimes with separate lenses, are geometrically corrected and combined to one image in the camera.\n\n===Orthophotos===\nVertical photographs are often used to create [[orthophoto]]s, alternatively known as [[orthophotomap]]s, photographs which have been geometrically \"corrected\" so as to be usable as a map. In other words, an orthophoto is a simulation of a photograph taken from an infinite distance, looking straight down to [[nadir]]. Perspective must obviously be removed, but variations in terrain should also be corrected for. Multiple geometric transformations are applied to the image, depending on the perspective and terrain corrections required on a particular part of the image.\n\nOrthophotos are commonly used in [[geographic information system]]s, such as are used by mapping agencies (e.g. [[Ordnance Survey]]) to create maps. Once the images have been aligned, or \"registered\", with known real-world coordinates, they can be widely deployed.\n\nLarge sets of orthophotos, typically derived from multiple sources and divided into \"tiles\" (each typically 256 x 256 pixels in size), are widely used in online map systems such as [[Google Maps]]. [[OpenStreetMap]] offers the use of similar orthophotos for deriving new map data. [[Google Earth]] overlays orthophotos or [[satellite imagery]] onto a [[digital elevation model]] to simulate 3D landscapes.\n\n==Aerial video==\n[[File:Cliffs of Moher drone-video.webm|thumb|The [[Cliffs of Moher]], filmed with a drone (2014)]]\nWith advancements in video technology, [[aerial video]] is becoming more popular. Orthogonal video is shot from aircraft mapping pipelines, crop fields, and other points of interest.  Using GPS, video may be embedded with meta data and later synced with a video mapping program.\n\nThis \"Spatial Multimedia\" is the timely union of digital media including still photography, motion video, stereo, panoramic imagery sets, immersive media constructs, audio, and other data with location and date-time information from the GPS and other location designs.\n\nAerial videos are emerging Spatial Multimedia which can be used for scene understanding and object tracking. The input video is captured by low flying aerial platforms and typically consists of strong parallax from non-ground-plane structures. The integration of digital video, global positioning systems (GPS) and automated image processing will improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction. Several different aerial platforms are under investigation for the data collection.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Aerial archaeology]]\n* [[Aerial landscape art]]\n* [[:Category:Aerial photographers|Aerial photographers category]]\n* [[Aerial survey]]\n* [[Aerofilms]] Ltd., the first commercial aerial photography company in the UK, founded in 1919\n* [[Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance]]\n* [[Astrocam]]\n* [[Aviation photography]]\n* [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]]\n* [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton]] 1932 photo flight over [[Mount Everest]]\n* [[Fairchild K-20]] A WWII era aerial camera\n* [[Federal Aviation Regulations]]\n* [[Geoinformatics]]\n* [[Harvey Lloyd]]\n* [[Historic England Archive]] \u2013 the public archive of English Heritage, who hold one of the largest collections of aerial photographs of England\n* [[Kite aerial photography]]\n* [[Lidar]]\n* [[Oracle (rocket)|Oracle]] model photographic rocket\n* [[Photogrammetry]]\n* [[Pictometry]]\n* [[Pigeon photography]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[Satellite imagery]]\n* [[Scheimpflug principle]]\n* [[TopoFlight]]\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Price, Alfred (2003).
