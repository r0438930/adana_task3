They have been described from fossil remains. The genus was created by [[Pierce Brodkorb]] in 1971 to place a fossil species known until that time as ''Protostrix mimica''.\n\nThe following species are recognised:\n* ''E. mimica'' described in 1938 by [[Alexander Wetmore]] using hindlimb elements in Eocene strata in Wyoming.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=P_TB72RBLLMC&pg=PA164&dq=Eostrix&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIpaGn1p3lAhWETd8KHaAKDFsQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=Eostrix&f=false</ref>\n* ''E. martinellii'' was described in 1972 from a left [[tarsometatarsus]] (lower leg bone) recovered from an escarpment above the southeastern bank of Cottonwood Creek in [[Fremont County, Wyoming]] by Jorge Martinelli on a field trip in 1970 under the auspices of the University of Kansas. The strata was a Lysite member of the Wind River Formation. Martinelli was studying paleontology at the University of Barcelona. Paleontologists Larry D. Martin and [[Craig Call Black]] from the [[University of Kansas Natural History Museum]] named it in his honour. The smaller of the two species, it was similar in size to the living [[long-eared owl]] (''Asio otus''). Differences in the [[Tarsometatarsus|trochleas]] (grooves) of the lower end of the tarsometatarsus set it apart from living owls, namely a groove in the trochlea for digit 2, a deeper posterior groove in a relatively narrow trochlea for digit 3, and an unusually rounded trochlea for digit 4.<ref name=martinblack>{{cite journal|year=1972|title=A new owl from the Eocene of Wyoming|journal=Auk|volume=89|issue=4|pages=887\u201388|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v089n04/p0887-p0888.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2010|doi=10.2307/4084122|last1=Martin|first1=Larry D.|last2=Black|first2=Craig C.}}</ref>\n* ''E. vincenti'' described in 1980 by [[Colin Harrison (ornithologist)|Colin Harrison]] from the early Eocene [[London Clay]] in England, known from [[Phalanx bone|pedal phalanx]] and proximal [[tarsometatarsus]] bones.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=C.
