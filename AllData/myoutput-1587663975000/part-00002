[[John Ritter]] stars as a father of a terminally ill 16-year-old girl portrayed by [[Anna Chlumsky]].\n\n==Plot==\nRitter portrays Ed Chandler, a father who is fired from his job for taking time off to tend to his 16-year-old daughter Missy (Chlumsky), who is battling [[cancer]]. Rather than accepting his dismissal, Ed decides to fight back. With the help of a [[United States Senate|United States senator]], he lobbies the [[United States Congress]] and is the stimulus to passage of the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]]. Because Missy's cancer is life-threatening, she is visited by the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], and she wishes to go to the [[White House]], visit the [[Oval Office]], and hopefully see President [[Bill Clinton]]. Although Make-A-Wish is not so sure if they can grant her wish, in the end she does in fact get to visit the Oval Office and meet President [[Bill Clinton]], playing himself in a cameo appearance.\n\nMissy is based on the merging of two women, Melissa Weaver and Dixie Yandle. Ed Chandler's character is very closely related to George Yandle, who with his wife Vicki, helped push the Family Medical Leave Act through Congress after being fired from their jobs to care for their daughter that suffered with cancer. In real life, Vicki Yandle was on stage with President Clinton when the law was signed.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/04/garden/family-leave-bill-peace-of-mind-issue.html Family-Leave Bill: Peace of Mind Issue] New York Times, 4 February 1993</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Ritter]] as Ed Chandler \n*[[Tess Harper]] as Joanna Chandler \n*[[Anna Chlumsky]] as Missy Chandler \n*[[Sarah Chalke]] as Melinda \n*Karl David-Djerf as Scott \n*Kevin McNulty as Robbie \n*[[U.S. President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] as himself \n*David Lewis as Rick \n*Janine Cox as Karen \n*Aurelio Dinunzio as Hank \n*Merrilyn Gann as Dr. Cross \n*Eva De Viveiros as Jenny \n*Freda Perry as Lucille \n*Michael St. John Smith as Bailey \n*[[Teryl Rothery]] as Donna\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0118846}}\n*http://www.hollywood.com/movie/A_Childs_Wish/6152737\n\n{{Waris Hussein}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Child's Wish, A}}\n[[Category:1997 television films]]\n[[Category:1997 drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Waris Hussein]]\n[[Category:CBS network films]]\n\n\n{{US-tv-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = A Child's Wish\n| image                = \n| image_upright        = 1.0\n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = \n| creator              = \n| based_on             = \n| writer               = Susan Nanus\n| screenplay           = \n| story                = \n| director             = [[Waris Hussein]]\n| starring             = [[John Ritter]] <br/> [[Tess Harper]] <br/> [[Anna Chlumsky]] <br/> [[Sarah Chalke]] <br/> [[U.S. President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]\n| narrated             = \n| music                = \n| country              = \n| language             = \n| num_episodes         = \n| producer             = \n| editor               = \n| cinematography       = \n| runtime              = 96 minutes\n| company              = \n| distributor          = [[CBS]] network\n| budget               = \n| network              = \n| released             = {{Film date|TV=y|1997|01|21}}\n| website              = \n}}\n\n'''''A Child's Wish''''' is a 1997 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on actual events.
