After his death, his widow, [[Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans]], donated his collection of books to [[Duke University]]. Today, this collection forms the foundation of the History of Medicine Collections in the [[Duke University Libraries|David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nJosiah Charles Trent was born in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, on 7 August 1914, the youngest of four children. His father, Josiah Charles Trent, was from [[Arkansas]] and a merchant who did business with both [[settler]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. His mother, Mary Simpson Trent, was born in [[Mississippi]] and was a music teacher.\n\n===Education===\nAs a child, Trent attended the public schools in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and was graduated from high school with honors at the age of sixteen. He then attended [[Duke University]], and received his A.B. degree with honors in 1934 at the age of 19. He then began studying medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received an M.D. with honors in 1938. While there, he developed an interest in surgical pathology and the history of medicine. Following his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania, Trent began a one-year medical internship at the [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].\n\n===Career===\nIn 1939, he began a residency at the [[Duke University School of Medicine]], which lasted six years. At its completion, Trent was offered two positions at Duke: become a junior member of the Department of Surgery in general surgery or develop, as head, a Division of Thoracic Surgery. He chose the latter option, but asked for two years to gain additional experience. During that period, he served as instructor in thoracic surgery at the [[University of Michigan]]. There, he worked under Dr. John Alexander, who was the University's first Head of Thoracic Surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History & Development - University of Michigan Thoracic Surgery, Ann Arbor, Michigan|url = http://surgery.med.umich.edu/thoracic/education/residency/history.shtml|website = surgery.med.umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}</ref> While at Michigan, he gained experience in the operation and administration of thoracic surgical case management. However, he only stayed there a year. At his request, he left his position at Michigan and returned to Duke to begin the Division of Thoracic Surgery.\nAs part of his professional service, Trent was a member of the ''North Carolina Medical Journal'' and the ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' editorial boards. Between 1944 and 1947, he edited a column called \"Thumbnail Sketches of Eminent Physicians\" for the ''North Carolina Medical Journal''; many of the articles were also written by Trent.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last = Fulton|first = John|date = 1948|journal = Journal of the History of Medicine|volume = III|issue = 4|pages = 467\u2013472|doi = 10.1093/jhmas/III.4.467|pmid = |title = Josiah C.

In 1946, he underwent surgery to relieve intracranial pressure resulting from the lymphosarcoma. However, by November 1948, the disease became widely disseminated and he died in December in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriage and children===\nIn 1938, at the age of 24, Trent married Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans.
