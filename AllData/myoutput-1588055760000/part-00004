By 1957, CAUT represented about 78 percent of Canadian university teachers with 26 member associations and 3,400 full-time faculty. However, the organization struggled financially. It continued to operate without a national office and was staffed entirely by volunteers.<ref>Neil Tudiver, ''Universities for Sale'' (Toronto: James Lorimer and Company, 1999), p. 40.</ref>\n\nIn 1958, CAUT was confronted with one of the most prominent academic freedom cases in Canada. The Board of Regents of [[United College, Winnipeg|Winnipeg's United College]], a [[Presbyterian]] institution that is today the [[University of Winnipeg]], dismissed Professor [[Harry S. Crowe]] for a letter he wrote to a colleague. The letter, obtained by the Principal of the college, was critical of the administration and made disparaging comments about the religious influence over the institution. CAUT was asked to investigate the matter and appointed a committee that included V.C. Fowke of the [[University of Saskatchewan]] and [[Bora Laskin]] of the [[University of Toronto]]. In its [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174809/http://www.crowefoundation.ca/documents/CroweReport.pdf final report], the committee concluded that Crowe's dismissal violated [[due process]], [[natural justice]] and academic freedom. The committee recommended that Crowe be reinstated. Following the release of the report, three of Crowe's colleagues stated they planned to resign unless Crowe was re-hired. The Board of Regents eventually agreed to reinstate Crowe, but refused to reconsider the three resignations. In protest, Crowe and 13 other professors left the college.<ref>Donald C. Savage and Christopher Holmes, \"The CAUT, the Crowe Case, and the Development of the Idea of Academic Freedom in Canada,\" CAUT Bulletin, 24, 3 (December, 1975), pp. 22-27.</ref>\n\nEven though Crowe and his colleagues lost their jobs, the case proved to be a seminal moment in CAUT's history. The time, effort, and expenditure demanded by the case demonstrated the need for a permanent office which was established in [[Ottawa]] in the fall of 1959. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070703182739/http://stewartreid.caut.ca/English/who.htm Stewart Reid], a colleague of Crowe's, was appointed the first secretary of CAUT. Reid oversaw the development of policy statements on governance, academic freedom and tenure, and throughout the 1960s CAUT focused much of its work on ensuring stronger protections for academic freedom.<ref>Horn, ''op. cit''., pp. 244-245.</ref>\n\nIn this early period, CAUT member associations were not trade unions. The unionization of Canadian academics did not begin until the 1970s. Pay and benefits had increased during the boom period of the 1960s when government funding increased and new universities and colleges were established. By the early 1970s, however, the tide had turned. The academic community was now facing a protracted period of restraint. Many academics argued that collective organizing was now needed to protect their pay and professional rights.\n\nAcademic staff associations in [[Quebec]] were the first to certify as trade unions beginning in 1971 with L'Association des Ingenieurs Professeurs en Science Appliques de l'Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke. By 1975, more than 60 percent of academic staff in Quebec were unionized. In [[English Canada]], 25 percent of professors were union members. CAUT increasingly encouraged member associations to certify, and by 1980 over 50 percent of faculty were unionized.<ref>Tudiver, ''op. cit''., pp. 84-85.</ref> Today, the unionization rate of academic staff is approximately 79 percent, well above the average of 30 percent for all occupations in Canada.<ref>David Robinson, ''[http://www.caut.ca/uploads/ei_study_final.pdf The Status of Higher Education Teaching Personnel in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States: Report Prepared for Education International] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906112003/http://www.caut.ca/uploads/ei_study_final.pdf |date=2015-09-06 }}'', March 2006</ref>\n\nIn recent years, CAUT's membership has grown as part-time and contract academic staff have been organized. In addition, provincial college faculty associations from [[British Columbia]], [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]] have joined. Today, CAUT represents 86 associations with approximately 70,000 individual members.\n\n==Academic freedom==\n\nWhile collective bargaining occupies a much more central place in CAUT's operations today, the defense of [[academic freedom]] remains a core priority. According to the CAUT policy statement, the association defines academic freedom as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nAcademic freedom includes the right, without restriction by prescribed doctrine, to freedom of teaching and discussion; freedom in carrying out research and disseminating and publishing the results thereof; freedom in producing and performing creative works; freedom to engage in service to the institution and the community; freedom to express freely one\u2019s opinion about the institution, its administration, or the system in which one works; freedom from institutional censorship; freedom to acquire, preserve, and provide access to documentary material in all formats; and freedom to participate in professional and representative academic bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caut.ca/about-us/caut-policy/lists/caut-policy-statements/policy-statement-on-academic-freedom|title=Academic Freedom - CAUT|website=www.caut.ca}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nCAUT continues to investigate cases of alleged violations of academic freedom as in the Crowe case.
