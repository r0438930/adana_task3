They leave together from the bar and decide to spend the night together at Veer's home but Veer stops Zoe from continuing their act. He tells her that the time is not right. Zoe leaves, infuriated. Veer keeps following Zoe, who finally confronts him and asks him not to follow her. \n\nThere is a flashback scene where Leena and Raghuvendra \"Raghu\" Singh have the same conversation back in the 1990s in Udaipur.\n\nBack to present day, Veer drops her for an interview at the office of the Mehta Group and they slowly begin their relationship. The group's owner, Raj Mehta, also owns the place where Zoe hangs out very often. Raj, who is good friends with Zoe, tells her the story of his childhood sweetheart, Leena, thus implying that he is a grown up Raghu. He tells her that he used to behave with Leena just as Veer behaves with Zoe, and recites his own childhood memories with Leena to Zoe and tells her how he asked Leena for a dance together.\n\nIn the flashback, it is seen that Raghu and Leena used to meet each other secretly and how Raghu left everything for Leena and moved for her to Delhi, discotinuing his studies to be with Leena. Zoe walks in on Raj and his wife, assuming she is Leena, but realizes it's not the case. Raghu reveals that he left Leena. Zoe is convinced by her mother that she can't possibly have both her love and career together. She goes to meet Veer's parents, but leaves crying. Veer relays to Raj what Zoe did, and Raj, convinced that he influenced Zoe towards behaving this way, responds by getting her the job. \n\nSome days later, Zoe sees Veer with another girl. Heartbroken, she hangs out with multiple people but doesn't happen to like any of them. She goes to a bar with a guy and gets drunk but he refuses to drop her at her home. Veer picks her and drops at her house. He tells that he can't enter a relationship of compromises with Zoe and breaks up with her. The next day he informs her about a new job in the Himalayas and is leaving for 2 years, explaining that he has as much right to be focused on his career as does she, and bids her goodbye. Zoe gets a proposal from the Mehta family to marry Rishabh, but she refuses. When Zoe goes to meet Raj, he tells her that he met Leena one last time, when he realized she was pregnant. He starts crying and Zoe comforts him. Raj tells her that she shouldn't make the same mistake he made. Zoe leaves for the Himalayas to reunite with Veer. She sees Veer sleeping outside. She goes and rests atop him. Veer asks whether she will take a leap with him, to which she agrees, and they reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kartik Aaryan]] as Veer Srivastava / Raghuvendra \"Raghu\" Singh<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/features/meet-kartik-aaryan-veer-raghu-imtiaz-alis-love-aaj-kal/|website=Bollywood Hungama|title=Meet Kartik Aaryan as Veer and Raghu in Imtiaz Ali\u2019s Love Aaj Kal|date=21 January 2020|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Sara Ali Khan]] as Zoe Chauhan\n* [[Randeep Hooda]] as Raj Singh /   Raghuvendra \"Raghu\" Singh (before changing name) <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/five-years-after-highway-randeep-hooda-to-reunite-with-imtiaz-ali-for-his-next/369041|website= Times Now News 18|title=Five years after Highway, Randeep Hooda to reunite with Imtiaz Ali for his next?|date=20 February 2019|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Aarushi Sharma]] as Leena Sharma\n* [[Simone Singh]] as Zoe's mother\n* Kavita Ghai as Veer's mother\n\n==Production==\nOn 17 January 2019, it was reported that Ali was considering his next venture with Khan and Aaryan, a romantic film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/cant-reveal-imtiaz-ali-on-working-with-kartik-aryan-and-sara-ali-khan-in-his-next/articleshow/67575015.cms|title=Imtiaz Ali on working with Kartik Aaryan and Sara Ali Khan in his next|date=17 January 2019|access-date=21 March 2019|newspaper=Times of India}}</ref> On 1 March 2019, it was confirmed that the pair has been teamed up in directorial venture of Ali and the filming is starting in [[Delhi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abplive.in/movies/luka-chhupi-star-kartik-aryan-sara-ali-khan-in-imtiaz-alis-love-aaj-kal-2-931342|title=CONFIRMED!
