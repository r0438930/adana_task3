It is situated along Malviya Nagar near [[Jaipur International Airport|Sanganer Airport]] on Jawaharlal Nehru Marg. (though the same claim of being the largest circle in Asia, is also claimed by Swaraj Road, Thrissur in Kerala ignoring the fact that the largest Traffic Circle or Round about in the world with a diameter of more than 3.5&nbsp;km is situated in PutraJaya Malaysia.)\n\nThe diameter of the circle is 452&nbsp;m and the circumference measures 1420&nbsp;m. This park was fully developed by JDA ([[Jaipur Development Authority]]), and is one of Jaipur's favorite leisure places. There are multiple concentric tracks in the park. It is surrounded by Rose Gardens.\n\nA number of attractive features like musical fountains, modern play equipment, jogging tracks are being added to it.<ref name=\"jda\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.jaipurjda.org/page.aspx?pid=83 |title=Jawahar Circle - JDA |access-date=11 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726201054/http://www.jaipurjda.org/page.aspx?pid=83 |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nJDA has spent 170 lacs for the development of this circle. The money has been judiciously spent on jogging tracks, walkways, parking, landscaping, benches and a musical fountain.\n\nThe Fountain has been installed in a water-body in the center of the park. Every evening at 7 pm a show is held for 30 minutes, when the water sprays dance to the music & are illuminated by colored lights all adding up to a rare experience. Taking a hint from the Si-Fi world they even show music video\u2019s on a wall of spray. And after the show you can have some chaat or Saras [[Lassi]] or Custard [[Kulfi]] in the [[Chaat]] Bazaar.\n\nRadius of the water body is 47&nbsp;m. There are 290 effects. Height of the fountain is 25&nbsp;m. Water screen size is 27&nbsp;m wide by 9&nbsp;m height.  There are 316 colored lights. The video  projector is 15,000 lumens.\n\nA fact worth appreciating here is that Rajasthan is a desert state and to maintain such big gardens & fountains with drinking water would be foolhardy so the government is using re-cycled water which though safe for the garden & the fountain is definitely not safe for drinking or for bathing with. So it is a good idea to stay away from the water in the fountain.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://wikimapia.org/108614/Jawahar-Circle-Jaipur Jawahar Circle - Map]\n\n[[Category:Roundabouts and traffic circles]]\n[[Category:Gardens in Rajasthan]]\n[[Category:Road junctions in India]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Jaipur]]\n[[Category:Parks in Jaipur]]\n[[Category:Monuments and memorials to Jawaharlal Nehru]]\n[[Category:Areas of Jaipur]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=January 2019}}\n{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}\n\n{{Infobox park\n| name = Jawahar Circle\n| photo = | photo_width = \n| photo_caption = \n| mapframe_zoom = 13\n| mapframe_caption = Location in [[Jaipur]]\n| type = \n| location = [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]]\n| nearest_city = \n| coords    = {{coord|26.840425|N|75.800349|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| area = \n| created = \n| operator = \n| visitation_num = \n| status = \n| designation = \n| open = \n}}\n'''Jawahar Circle''' is a garden situated in [[Jaipur]] city in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]], built by the [[Jaipur Development Authority]].\n==Overview==\nJawahar Circle is claimed by Locals to be the biggest circular park in Asia developed on a highway traffic circle.
