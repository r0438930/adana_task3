Approved for production shortly following the [[Empire of Japan]]'s entry into the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Boomerang was rapidly designed as to meet the urgent demands for fighter aircraft to equip the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). It was the first combat aircraft designed and constructed in Australia.<ref>Dennis et al. 2008, p. 98.</ref>\n\nDifferent variants of the Boomerang were manufactured under a series of corresponding production contract numbers '''CA-12''', '''CA-13''', '''CA-14''' and '''CA-19''', the aircraft supplied under each subsequent contract would incorporate various modifications, typically aimed at improving the aircraft's performance. The Boomerang was handicapped by the available engine variant, which gave low power at altitude and resulted in the aircraft proving to be slower than contemporary fighter aircraft. The Boomerang rarely engaged in aerial combat. During early wartime operations, the Boomerang was mainly dispatched to equip home-based squadrons, freeing up other fighters for use overseas. In later service, the Boomerang would commonly be used for [[close air support|ground support]] duties, cooperating with Allied army units, in addition to secondary roles such as [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[air sea rescue]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Development==\n\n===Background===\nDuring the mid 1930s, some political leaders observed that both the [[Empire of Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] appeared to be preparing for war, which in turn led to several other countries commencing their own preparations in response.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> However, in the case of Australia, the nation had no domestic aircraft industry, partially due to a historical preference for the procurement of both civil and military-oriented aircraft to be sourced overseas from manufacturers based in the United Kingdom, which had come about through strong political and cultural ties between the two nations. On 17 October 1936, with the encouragement of the [[Government of Australia]], three companies came together to form a joint venture, registered as the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] (CAC), which had the goal of assessing the viability of the development of a self-sufficient aircraft industry.<ref name = \"francil 3\">Francillon 1967, p. 3.</ref>\n\nEarly on, CAC set about planning for the establishment of both engine and aircraft manufacturing and testing facilities at [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Fishermans Bend]], [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], purchasing tooling and equipment from manufacturers in both Britain and the United States.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> While the company initially pursued the development and production of the [[CAC Wirraway]], a single-engine armed advanced trainer aircraft which was a [[licensed production|licence-built]] version of the [[North American NA-16]], the firm would promptly be presented with a strong demand for the provision of large quantities of military aircraft, in particular fighter aircraft, to equip the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> In July 1940, at which point the United Kingdom was the sole European nation fighting against Germany in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Australian Government issued a statement advising that \"from this date onward Australia can rely on England for no further supplies of any aircraft materials or equipment of any kind.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/>\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the [[Pacific War]] broke out with a series of near-simultaneous surprise attacks that were launched by Japanese forces; these attacks included the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Japanese Invasion of Thailand]], the [[Battle of Malaya]] and the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941\u201342)|Battle of the Philippines]]. In this new climate, Australia quickly found itself in a precarious position as, within the space of a few months, Japan had conquered and seized control over vast areas of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[South East Asia]].<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> Upon the outbreak of the war, Australia had two of its squadrons stationed in England and the [[Mediterranean]] theatres along with a further four squadrons in [[Malaysia]], two of these being equipped with [[Lockheed Hudson]] bombers, one with Wirraway general purpose aircraft, and another with aging [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]] fighters \u2013 there was a distinct lack of a strong Australian fighter force at that time.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/>\n\nWhile British manufacturers were the main source of RAAF aircraft, by 1942, the British aircraft industry had long been hard-pressed to meet the needs of the RAF for the ongoing [[European theatre of World War II|War in Europe]].<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> Although United States companies possessed enormous aircraft manufacturing capacity, their output was at this point destined for the air units of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), which were themselves engaged in the conflict. Even where capacity was found for new aircraft to be built overseas, their delivery would involve them being shipped over long distances in wartime conditions, with consequent delays and risking considerable losses, in particular due to the German [[U-boat]] threat.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> While USAAF fighters \u2013 such as the [[Curtiss P-40|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk]] and [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] \u2013 that were damaged during service in Australia could be rebuilt by Australian workshops and loaned to RAAF units, they were not available in sufficient numbers either.\n\n===Origins===\nIn late 1941, [[Lawrence Wackett]], Manager and Chief Designer of CAC, began examining the possibility of designing and building a new domestically-designed fighter aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> The main challenge to this ambition was the fact that fighter aircraft had never been manufactured before in Australia; according to aviation author Rene J. Francillon, many experts considered that the licensed manufacture of a complete fighter aircraft would be beyond the capabilities of Australia's industry at that time.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> Wackett quickly made the decision to use elements of aircraft which were already being produced in Australia. Only two military aircraft were in production at the time: the CAC Wirraway, based on the [[North American NA-16]], and the [[Bristol Beaufort]] bomber.<ref name = \"francil 3 4\">Francillon 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nOverseas, the NA-16 had already become the basis of the [[North American P-64|North American NA-50]] fighter (also known as the P-64), which had been used by the [[Peruvian Air Force]] in the 1941 [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]]. Crucially, CAC's licence to manufacture the Wirraway already contained a clause allowing the design to be modified.<ref name = \"francil 3 4\"/> Accordingly, Wackett decided to use the airframe of the Wirraway as a starting point for the design of the new domestic fighter; this choice had the advantage of requiring little additional tooling; it also had the effect of reducing the timescales that would be involved in the design phase and to establish the manufacturing of the new aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 4\">Francillon 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nAlthough British designers had reworked the twin-engined Beaufort into a successful [[attack aircraft]] \u2013 the [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] \u2013 this was not a suitable basis for the sought-after single-engine interceptor aircraft. However, Australian-made Beauforts used 1,200 horsepower (890&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp]] engines, which were made under license at the CAC plant in [[Lidcombe, New South Wales|Lidcombe]], [[Sydney]].<ref name = \"francil 4\"/> Another factor in favour of the engine was that it was already in use to power the [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters of the United States Navy, which helped make the Twin Wasp a logical choice to power the domestic fighter design.<ref name = \"francil 4\"/>\n\nWackett promptly recruited designer [[Fred David]], an Austrian [[Jew]] who had recently arrived in Australia as a [[refugee]] and, as David was technically an [[enemy alien]], he had been [[internment|interned]] by Australian immigration officials. David was well-suited to the CAC project, since he had previously worked for [[Heinkel]] in pre-Nazi Germany, as well as [[Mitsubishi]] and [[Aichi D3A|Aichi]] in Japan.<ref>Ross 1995, p. 316.</ref><ref>Sunderland, Gary. [http://dbdesignbureau.buckmasterfamily.id.au/FAC65_elliptical_wings.htm \"Elliptical Wings Part 2: The Fred David Story.\"] ''Small Scale Squadron Down Under'', v.6 no.3, September 2002.</ref> As a result of this past, David possessed an excellent understanding of advanced fighter designs, including the [[A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M (\"Zero\")]] (used by the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service]]) and the [[Heinkel He 112]] (a contemporary of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and used in small numbers by Axis air forces in Europe).\n\nIn December 1941, the management of CAC issued its authorisation to proceed with the detailed design of the new fighter aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 4\"/> The aircraft, which had received the internal designation of ''CA-12'', used the wing, tail assembly, undercarriage, and center section of the Wirraway in combination with a new forward fuselage, which housed the larger Twin Wasp engine. It had a new single seat cockpit complete with a sliding hood, and carried an armament of two 20&nbsp;mm [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]] [[Autocannon#Second World War|cannon]]s along with four [[M1919 Browning machine gun#Browning .303 Mark II|.303 machine gun]]s.<ref name = \"francil 4\"/> The proposal was presented to the Australian Government, which promptly gave its approval; the government viewed the CA-12 as an appropriate insurance against the delay or cancellation of its order for US-built P-40 fighters, as well as a desire to maintain work at CAC; the ready availability of usable Wirraway components for the CA-12, the latter of which would greatly speed up any manufacturing program, was also viewed favourably.<ref name = \"francil 4 5\">Francillon 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, on 18 February 1942, the Australian War Cabinet authorised an order for 105 ''CA-12'' aircraft; shortly thereafter, the name ''Boomerang'' was selected for the aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 4\"/> The ordering of production aircraft had been made in advance of any prototype being produced or [[maiden flight]] performed, thus the Boomerang had been effectively ordered 'off the drawing board'.\n\n===Prototypes and early production===\n\n[[File:Boomerang construction (AWM 043183).jpg|thumb|Boomerangs under construction at CAC's factory at [[Fisherman's Bend]]]]\nOn 29 May 1942, the prototype Boomerang, ''A46-1'', conducted its [[maiden flight]] from Fisherman's Bend, flown by CAC pilot Ken Frewin.<ref name = \"francil 5\"/> This initial prototype had been completed within only three months of having received the order to proceed, which was a considerably rare accomplishment for the era. A46-1 was quickly put to use for a series of test flights, being flown either by Frewin or by RAAF pilot John Harper; these tests reportedly went smoothly, with the prototype proving to be easy to handle and quite manoeuvrable.<ref name=\"adf-serials\">[http://www.adf-serials.com/2a46.htm adf-serials.com RAAF Museum 2007, \"A46 CAC Boomerang\"] (access: 10 April 2013).</ref> An issue with engine cooling was encountered, which led to a revision of the oil cooler intake and the addition of a [[Spinner (aeronautics)|spinner]] to the propeller upon ''A46-3'' onwards.<ref name = \"francil 5\"/> On 15 July, [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No. 1 Aircraft Depot]] (1 AD) of the RAAF formally received A46-1 (bu. no. ''824'') from CAC.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/>\n\nComparison flight tests were undertaken by 1 AD, pitting the CA-12 against a [[Brewster Buffalo]] (''A51-6'') that had been lightened and re-weighted to approximate the flight characteristics of a Zero, as well as a [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40E/Kittyhawk Mk I]] (''A29-129'') and a [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|Bell P-400/Airacobra Mk Ia]] (''BW127''). It was found that the Boomerang was faster in level flight than the Buffalo, although the Buffalo out-maneuvred it.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/> The Boomerang was superior in armament, with two 20&nbsp;mm cannon and four [[.303 British|.303 calibre]] (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, all mounted in the short, thick wings. Its pilots were better protected, with generous armour plating, than Japanese fighter pilots. While the CA-12 was lively at low level, its performance fell away rapidly above altitudes of 15,000&nbsp;ft (4,600 m), and its maximum speed of 265 knots (490&nbsp;km/h) was not sufficient to make it an effective counter to Japanese fighters like the Zero and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japanese Army]]'s [[Nakajima Ki 43]] (\"Oscar\"). Similarly, the best European fighters were reaching almost 350 knots (650&nbsp;km/h), and even relatively sluggish contemporary fighters \u2013 like the [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] and the Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk I \u2013 were substantially faster than the Boomerang.<ref name = \"francil 6\">Francillon 1967, p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom March 1942, there was less pressure to place the CA-12 into production as multiple USAAF units, operating a mixture of P-40 and P-39 fighters, were being deployed in strength to northern Australia; the RAAF had also begun to receive new Kittyhawk fighters as well. In June 1943, manufacturing work upon the original order for 105 CA-12s was completed.<ref name = \"francil 7\">Francillon 1967, p. 7.</ref> During production of this batch, several modifications and improvements were incorporated onto the CA-12, these included the strengthening of the spinner back plates and belly tank locating pins, the installation of underwing night flying identification lights, and a revised electrical starter system; many of these modifications would be retrofitted onto early production models at operational bases as well.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/>\n\nIn the face of difficulties experienced by CAC on the development of the [[CAC Woomera]], a twin-engine bomber aircraft which was ultimately cancelled in September 1944, the Australian government elected to extend the production arrangement for the Boomerang, extending its orders from 105 to 250 aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 8\">Francillon 1967, p. 8.</ref> These additional 145 aircraft were manufactured in four distinct versions, the ''CA-13'', the ''CA-14'', ''CA-14A'' and ''CA-19''.<ref name = \"francil 8 9 12\">Francillon 1967, pp. 8\u20139, 12.</ref> 95 ''CA-13''s and 49 ''CA-19''s, were completed, while only one prototype of the supercharged Boomerang ''CA-14'' and its modified ''CA-14A'' form would be produced.<ref name = \"francil 8 9\"/> In February 1945, the final Boomerang to be manufactured, ''A46-249'', a CA-19 model, was completed.<ref name = \"francil 8\"/> [[File:A46-89e.jpg|thumb|A46-89 Fuselage]]\n\n===Further development===\nDuring the flight testing phase of development work upon the initial CA-12 model, CAC commenced work upon a new variant which featured performance improvements in terms of speed, climb and ceiling.<ref name = \"francil 8 9\">Francillon 1967, pp. 8\u20139.</ref><ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> Designated ''CA-14'', this aircraft was designed around an order for 145 U.S.-built, 1,700&nbsp;hp (1,268&nbsp;kW) [[Wright R-2600|Wright Cyclone R-2600]] engines. The Wright engines ordered were not delivered as scheduled, and in mid-1942 Wackett authorised use of the 1,850&nbsp;hp (1,380&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800]], which was available from the CAC factory in Lidcombe.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\">Ross 1995, p. 321.</ref> Due to the layout of the Boomerang's compact fuselage, the supercharger for the engine was installed in the rear fuselage, while a new three-bladed [[variable pitch]] [[Curtiss-Wright|Curtiss]]-built propeller was also initially adopted.<ref name = \"francil 9\">Francillon 1967, p. 9.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, the addition of significantly greater weight of this powerplant imposed an unacceptable risk of undercarriage failure.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> (The R-2800 engine would later be the basis of design work on the Boomerang's successor: the [[CAC CA-15]] \"Kangaroo\".) CAC eventually returned to the Twin Wasp, to which it added a General Electric B-2 [[turbocharger|turbo-supercharger]] mounted inside the rear part of the fuselage, new propellor gear, a [[gear]]ed cooling fan (influenced by intelligence reports from Europe regarding captured German [[BMW 801]] twin-row radial engines, which were used by the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]A) and a larger, squared-off tailfin and rudder.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/><ref name = \"francil 9\"/>\n\nBy July 1943, the significantly re-worked CA-14 prototype, now known as the CA-14A, had a top speed that was 25\u201330% better than the CA-12, and an operational ceiling 4,000&nbsp;ft (1,200 m) higher.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> Testing of the later Boomerang variants found that they compared favourably, under some conditions, with the [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)#Mk V .28Types 331.2C 349 .26 352.29|Spitfire Mk V]], as well as early variants of the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|Republic Thunderbolt]] (P-47) and [[North American P-51 Mustang|North American Mustang]] (P-51).<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> By that time, however, the Spitfire had filled the interceptor role and CAC was on the verge of commencing the manufacture of [[North American P-51 Mustang variants#Australian Production|Mustangs under licence]] to meet the sought bomber escort, air superiority and close air support roles.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> Accordingly, the CA-14 never entered production.<ref name = \"francil 9\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Wing Commander Cook of 5 Squadron RAAF at Mareeba March 1944 AWM NEA0367.jpg|thumb|Pilot in the cockpit of a CAC Boomerang fighter]]\nThe Boomerang was a small single-engine [[monoplane]] fighter aircraft, designed with an emphasis on high manoeuvrability. It had a stubby appearance, which had resulted from the structure being derived from the smaller Wirraway being paired with a considerably larger engine in the form of a 1,200 horsepower (890&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp]] [[radial engine]], which drove a three-bladed Hamilton Standard Hydromatic [[propeller]], license-built by [[de Havilland Propellers|de Havilland]] .<ref name = \"francil 5\">Francillon 1967, p. 5.</ref> The engine was closely cowled with two air scoops fixed to the upper and lower sides, the upper being for the [[carburettor]] and the lower for the oil cooler.<ref name = \"francil 5\"/> Fuel was divided between one fuselage-housed 70 gallon [[self-sealing fuel tank]] and a pair of 45-gallon tanks within the center section of the wing.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/>\n\nAlthough the original intention during development had been to use as many Wirraway components as possible, the final design of the Boomerang had substantially differed from the source, having adopted shorter wings along with a shorter, wood-sheathed, aluminium-framed fuselage, which had increased strength in order to withstand combat stresses, and an original centre section.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/> The low-mounted [[cantilever]] wing consisted of five sections, these being a central section, a pair of outer sections, and two detachable wing tips; the outer sections had a swept-back [[leading edge]] along with a straight [[trailing edge]].<ref name = \"francil 5\"/> The wing used a single [[Spar (aeronautics)|spar]] and a [[stressed skin]] construction, along with fabric-covered [[aileron]]s, aluminium [[trim tab]]s and split trailing edge [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s. The main [[landing gear|undercarriage]] [[hydraulics|hydraulically]] retracted into wheelwells forward of the main spar.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/>\n\nThe Boomerang had a new single seat cockpit located directly over the centre of the wing, which was furnished with a sliding canopy which had 1.5-inch bulletproof glass and armor protection.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/> Common to many of the latest fighters at the time, the Boomerang was equipped with [[Autocannon|automatic cannons]]; as no such weapons had previously been manufactured in Australia, a pair of British-made [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano-Suiza 20 mm]] were used.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/> Allegedly, an example which an Australian airman had collected as a souvenir in the Middle East was [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Other armament fitted included four [[M1919 Browning machine gun#Browning .303 Mark II|Browning .303 machine gun]]s along with provision for up to four 20&nbsp;lb smoke bombs; all of these were mounted within the wings.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Boomerang 4sqn (AWM PO2531.013).jpg|thumb|A No. 4 Squadron Boomerang and ground crew at Nadzab, New Guinea in October 1943]]\n\nOn 19 October 1942, CA-12 ''A46-6'' (bu. no. ''829'') became the first Boomerang to reach a training/conversion unit, it was immediately put to use training pilots when it was transferred to [[No. 2 Operational Training Unit RAAF|No. 2 OTU]], from 1 AD.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/><ref name = \"francil 9\"/> In the training role, while generally being considered to be a success according to Rene, pilots without previous operational experience had difficulty transitioning from the Wirraway to the Boomerang due to its poor forward visibility, the reflector gun sight was subsequently relocated in order to improve pilot vision.<ref name = \"francil 9\"/>\n\n[[No. 83 Squadron RAAF|No. 83 Squadron]] became the first fighter unit to receive Boomerangs, when several were delivered to it \u2013 replacing Airacobras \u2013 at Strathpine Airfield, in [[Strathpine, Queensland]], on 10 April 1943.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/> A few weeks afterward, CA-12s were also received by a frontline air defence unit, [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|No. 84 Squadron]] which was stationed on [[Horn Island Airport#World War II|Horn Island Airfield]], in [[Torres Strait]]. The third Boomerang fighter unit, [[No. 85 Squadron RAAF|No. 85 Squadron]] \u2013 like No. 83 Squadron \u2013 was performing home defence duties, at [[Perth Airport|RAAF Guildford]] (known later as Perth Airport); the Boomerangs replaced the squadron's Buffaloes.\n\nOn 16 May 1943, the first encounter between the Boomerang while on aerial patrol duties and Japanese aircraft occurred; a pair of Boomerangs, flown by Flying Officer Johnstone and Sergeant Stammer, spotted three [[Mitsubishi G4M|Mitsubishi G4M 'Betty']] bombers and opened fire upon them at 250 yards, resulting in little apparent damage and the enemy's withdrawal.<ref name = \"francil 10\"/> On the evening of 20 May 1943, Flight Lieutenant [[Roy Goon]] became the first Boomerang pilot to [[Scrambling (military)|scramble]] on the Australian mainland against Japanese bombers.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/> Goon, part of a No. 85 Squadron detachment at [[RAAF Learmonth]], near [[Exmouth, Western Australia]], undertaking air defence of the Allied naval base at [[Exmouth Gulf]] (codenamed \"Potshot\"), took off to intercept Japanese bombers.<ref>[http://www.anzac.dpc.wa.gov.au/TellUsYourStory/Pages/JohnCBailey.aspx Government of Western Australia, 2013, \"John C.

The Boomerang's low top speed and poor high altitude performance meant that No. 84 could drive off enemy attacks but rarely could get close enough to Japanese aircraft to bring their guns to bear.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} There were not many air raids in this area, and after using Boomerangs for eight months, No. 84 Squadron upgraded to the Kittyhawk. In addition to its air defence operations, No. 84 also provided cover for all shipping in the area during this time, including within 20 miles of [[Merauke]], [[Papua (province)|Papua Province]].<ref name = \"francil 10\">Francillon 1967, p. 10.</ref>\n\nWhile RAAF records show that the Boomerang was never recorded as having destroyed any enemy aircraft, the type proved to be more useful in its capacity as a light [[close air support|ground attack]] aircraft used by Army co-operation squadrons, often replacing the lightly armed Wirraway in this role.<ref name = \"francil 10\"/> In this vital mission, the Boomerang directly contributed to the extensive ground war in the jungles of the [[South West Pacific theatre]] was often characterised by widely dispersed, small unit actions, which typically fought at close quarters and with uncertain front lines. In addition to strafing Japanese ground forces with cannon and machine gun fire, Boomerangs would often deploy smoke bombs to mark valuable targets for other units to attack.<ref name = \"francil 10\"/> The aircraft was also used for artillery spotting, aerial supply drops, tactical reconnaissance, and anti-[[malaria]]l spraying.<ref name = \"francil 10\"/>\n\nThe aircraft proved to be ideal in this ground attack role due to a number of qualities that it possessed. The Boomerang had the range to go wherever it was needed when it was based close to ground operations; had heavy armament; was agile and easy to fly, meaning that pilots could get close to ground targets, avoid ground fire and rough terrain; and featured extensive armour plating along with a wood and aluminium airframe that could withstand significant battle damage. Some of the aircraft were shot down, including two accidental \"kills\" by US forces, and many were damaged during accidents while landing, often because the Boomerang was prone to [[Ground loop (aviation)|ground looping]].<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/><ref name = \"francil 10\"/>\n\n[[File:Australia aviation factory LOC fsa 8e01090.jpg|thumb|CAC Boomerang during assembly]]\n[[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No. 4 Squadron]] and [[No. 5 Squadron RAAF|No. 5 Squadron]] flew Boomerangs in New Guinea, the [[Solomon Islands Campaign]] and [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo Campaign]], also in the close support role, with marked success.<ref name = \"francil 10 12\">Francillon 1967, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> Flying in pairs (one to observe the ground, the other to observe the air around them), their tasks included bombing, strafing, close infantry support and artillery spotting. When attacking larger enemy formations, Boomerangs often operated in conjunction with larger aircraft. In this role, the Boomerang would get in close to confirm the identity of the target and mark it with a 20&nbsp;lb (9&nbsp;kg) smoke bomb with the \"cooperating\" aircraft delivering the major ordnance from a safer distance.

Approved for production shortly following the [[Empire of Japan]]'s entry into the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Boomerang was rapidly designed as to meet the urgent demands for fighter aircraft to equip the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). It was the first combat aircraft designed and constructed in Australia.<ref>Dennis et al. 2008, p. 98.</ref>\n\nDifferent variants of the Boomerang were manufactured under a series of corresponding production contract numbers '''CA-12''', '''CA-13''', '''CA-14''' and '''CA-19''', the aircraft supplied under each subsequent contract would incorporate various modifications, typically aimed at improving the aircraft's performance. The Boomerang was handicapped by the available engine variant, which gave low power at altitude and resulted in the aircraft proving to be slower than contemporary fighter aircraft. The Boomerang rarely engaged in aerial combat. During early wartime operations, the Boomerang was mainly dispatched to equip home-based squadrons, freeing up other fighters for use overseas. In later service, the Boomerang would commonly be used for [[close air support|ground support]] duties, cooperating with Allied army units, in addition to secondary roles such as [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[air sea rescue]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Development==\n\n===Background===\nDuring the mid 1930s, some political leaders observed that both the [[Empire of Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] appeared to be preparing for war, which in turn led to several other countries commencing their own preparations in response.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> However, in the case of Australia, the nation had no domestic aircraft industry, partially due to a historical preference for the procurement of both civil and military-oriented aircraft to be sourced overseas from manufacturers based in the United Kingdom, which had come about through strong political and cultural ties between the two nations. On 17 October 1936, with the encouragement of the [[Government of Australia]], three companies came together to form a joint venture, registered as the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] (CAC), which had the goal of assessing the viability of the development of a self-sufficient aircraft industry.<ref name = \"francil 3\">Francillon 1967, p. 3.</ref>\n\nEarly on, CAC set about planning for the establishment of both engine and aircraft manufacturing and testing facilities at [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Fishermans Bend]], [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], purchasing tooling and equipment from manufacturers in both Britain and the United States.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> While the company initially pursued the development and production of the [[CAC Wirraway]], a single-engine armed advanced trainer aircraft which was a [[licensed production|licence-built]] version of the [[North American NA-16]], the firm would promptly be presented with a strong demand for the provision of large quantities of military aircraft, in particular fighter aircraft, to equip the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> In July 1940, at which point the United Kingdom was the sole European nation fighting against Germany in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Australian Government issued a statement advising that \"from this date onward Australia can rely on England for no further supplies of any aircraft materials or equipment of any kind.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/>\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the [[Pacific War]] broke out with a series of near-simultaneous surprise attacks that were launched by Japanese forces; these attacks included the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Japanese Invasion of Thailand]], the [[Battle of Malaya]] and the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941\u201342)|Battle of the Philippines]]. In this new climate, Australia quickly found itself in a precarious position as, within the space of a few months, Japan had conquered and seized control over vast areas of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[South East Asia]].<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> Upon the outbreak of the war, Australia had two of its squadrons stationed in England and the [[Mediterranean]] theatres along with a further four squadrons in [[Malaysia]], two of these being equipped with [[Lockheed Hudson]] bombers, one with Wirraway general purpose aircraft, and another with aging [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]] fighters \u2013 there was a distinct lack of a strong Australian fighter force at that time.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/>\n\nWhile British manufacturers were the main source of RAAF aircraft, by 1942, the British aircraft industry had long been hard-pressed to meet the needs of the RAF for the ongoing [[European theatre of World War II|War in Europe]].<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> Although United States companies possessed enormous aircraft manufacturing capacity, their output was at this point destined for the air units of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), which were themselves engaged in the conflict. Even where capacity was found for new aircraft to be built overseas, their delivery would involve them being shipped over long distances in wartime conditions, with consequent delays and risking considerable losses, in particular due to the German [[U-boat]] threat.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> While USAAF fighters \u2013 such as the [[Curtiss P-40|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk]] and [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] \u2013 that were damaged during service in Australia could be rebuilt by Australian workshops and loaned to RAAF units, they were not available in sufficient numbers either.\n\n===Origins===\nIn late 1941, [[Lawrence Wackett]], Manager and Chief Designer of CAC, began examining the possibility of designing and building a new domestically-designed fighter aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> The main challenge to this ambition was the fact that fighter aircraft had never been manufactured before in Australia; according to aviation author Rene J. Francillon, many experts considered that the licensed manufacture of a complete fighter aircraft would be beyond the capabilities of Australia's industry at that time.<ref name = \"francil 3\"/> Wackett quickly made the decision to use elements of aircraft which were already being produced in Australia. Only two military aircraft were in production at the time: the CAC Wirraway, based on the [[North American NA-16]], and the [[Bristol Beaufort]] bomber.<ref name = \"francil 3 4\">Francillon 1967, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nOverseas, the NA-16 had already become the basis of the [[North American P-64|North American NA-50]] fighter (also known as the P-64), which had been used by the [[Peruvian Air Force]] in the 1941 [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]]. Crucially, CAC's licence to manufacture the Wirraway already contained a clause allowing the design to be modified.<ref name = \"francil 3 4\"/> Accordingly, Wackett decided to use the airframe of the Wirraway as a starting point for the design of the new domestic fighter; this choice had the advantage of requiring little additional tooling; it also had the effect of reducing the timescales that would be involved in the design phase and to establish the manufacturing of the new aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 4\">Francillon 1967, p. 4.</ref>\n\nAlthough British designers had reworked the twin-engined Beaufort into a successful [[attack aircraft]] \u2013 the [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] \u2013 this was not a suitable basis for the sought-after single-engine interceptor aircraft. However, Australian-made Beauforts used 1,200 horsepower (890&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp]] engines, which were made under license at the CAC plant in [[Lidcombe, New South Wales|Lidcombe]], [[Sydney]].<ref name = \"francil 4\"/> Another factor in favour of the engine was that it was already in use to power the [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters of the United States Navy, which helped make the Twin Wasp a logical choice to power the domestic fighter design.<ref name = \"francil 4\"/>\n\nWackett promptly recruited designer [[Fred David]], an Austrian [[Jew]] who had recently arrived in Australia as a [[refugee]] and, as David was technically an [[enemy alien]], he had been [[internment|interned]] by Australian immigration officials. David was well-suited to the CAC project, since he had previously worked for [[Heinkel]] in pre-Nazi Germany, as well as [[Mitsubishi]] and [[Aichi D3A|Aichi]] in Japan.<ref>Ross 1995, p. 316.</ref><ref>Sunderland, Gary. [http://dbdesignbureau.buckmasterfamily.id.au/FAC65_elliptical_wings.htm \"Elliptical Wings Part 2: The Fred David Story.\"] ''Small Scale Squadron Down Under'', v.6 no.3, September 2002.</ref> As a result of this past, David possessed an excellent understanding of advanced fighter designs, including the [[A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M (\"Zero\")]] (used by the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service]]) and the [[Heinkel He 112]] (a contemporary of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and used in small numbers by Axis air forces in Europe).\n\nIn December 1941, the management of CAC issued its authorisation to proceed with the detailed design of the new fighter aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 4\"/> The aircraft, which had received the internal designation of ''CA-12'', used the wing, tail assembly, undercarriage, and center section of the Wirraway in combination with a new forward fuselage, which housed the larger Twin Wasp engine. It had a new single seat cockpit complete with a sliding hood, and carried an armament of two 20&nbsp;mm [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]] [[Autocannon#Second World War|cannon]]s along with four [[M1919 Browning machine gun#Browning .303 Mark II|.303 machine gun]]s.<ref name = \"francil 4\"/> The proposal was presented to the Australian Government, which promptly gave its approval; the government viewed the CA-12 as an appropriate insurance against the delay or cancellation of its order for US-built P-40 fighters, as well as a desire to maintain work at CAC; the ready availability of usable Wirraway components for the CA-12, the latter of which would greatly speed up any manufacturing program, was also viewed favourably.<ref name = \"francil 4 5\">Francillon 1967, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, on 18 February 1942, the Australian War Cabinet authorised an order for 105 ''CA-12'' aircraft; shortly thereafter, the name ''Boomerang'' was selected for the aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 4\"/> The ordering of production aircraft had been made in advance of any prototype being produced or [[maiden flight]] performed, thus the Boomerang had been effectively ordered 'off the drawing board'.\n\n===Prototypes and early production===\n\n[[File:Boomerang construction (AWM 043183).jpg|thumb|Boomerangs under construction at CAC's factory at [[Fisherman's Bend]]]]\nOn 29 May 1942, the prototype Boomerang, ''A46-1'', conducted its [[maiden flight]] from Fisherman's Bend, flown by CAC pilot Ken Frewin.<ref name = \"francil 5\"/> This initial prototype had been completed within only three months of having received the order to proceed, which was a considerably rare accomplishment for the era. A46-1 was quickly put to use for a series of test flights, being flown either by Frewin or by RAAF pilot John Harper; these tests reportedly went smoothly, with the prototype proving to be easy to handle and quite manoeuvrable.<ref name=\"adf-serials\">[http://www.adf-serials.com/2a46.shtml adf-serials.com RAAF Museum 2007, \"A46 CAC Boomerang\"] (access: 10 April 2013).</ref> An issue with engine cooling was encountered, which led to a revision of the oil cooler intake and the addition of a [[Spinner (aeronautics)|spinner]] to the propeller upon ''A46-3'' onwards.<ref name = \"francil 5\"/> On 15 July, [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No. 1 Aircraft Depot]] (1 AD) of the RAAF formally received A46-1 (bu. no. ''824'') from CAC.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/>\n\nComparison flight tests were undertaken by 1 AD, pitting the CA-12 against a [[Brewster Buffalo]] (''A51-6'') that had been lightened and re-weighted to approximate the flight characteristics of a Zero, as well as a [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40E/Kittyhawk Mk I]] (''A29-129'') and a [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|Bell P-400/Airacobra Mk Ia]] (''BW127''). It was found that the Boomerang was faster in level flight than the Buffalo, although the Buffalo out-maneuvred it.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/> The Boomerang was superior in armament, with two 20&nbsp;mm cannon and four [[.303 British|.303 calibre]] (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, all mounted in the short, thick wings. Its pilots were better protected, with generous armour plating, than Japanese fighter pilots. While the CA-12 was lively at low level, its performance fell away rapidly above altitudes of 15,000&nbsp;ft (4,600 m), and its maximum speed of 265 knots (490&nbsp;km/h) was not sufficient to make it an effective counter to Japanese fighters like the Zero and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japanese Army]]'s [[Nakajima Ki 43]] (\"Oscar\"). Similarly, the best European fighters were reaching almost 350 knots (650&nbsp;km/h), and even relatively sluggish contemporary fighters \u2013 like the [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] and the Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk I \u2013 were substantially faster than the Boomerang.<ref name = \"francil 6\">Francillon 1967, p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom March 1942, there was less pressure to place the CA-12 into production as multiple USAAF units, operating a mixture of P-40 and P-39 fighters, were being deployed in strength to northern Australia; the RAAF had also begun to receive new Kittyhawk fighters as well. In June 1943, manufacturing work upon the original order for 105 CA-12s was completed.<ref name = \"francil 7\">Francillon 1967, p. 7.</ref> During production of this batch, several modifications and improvements were incorporated onto the CA-12, these included the strengthening of the spinner back plates and belly tank locating pins, the installation of underwing night flying identification lights, and a revised electrical starter system; many of these modifications would be retrofitted onto early production models at operational bases as well.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/>\n\nIn the face of difficulties experienced by CAC on the development of the [[CAC Woomera]], a twin-engine bomber aircraft which was ultimately cancelled in September 1944, the Australian government elected to extend the production arrangement for the Boomerang, extending its orders from 105 to 250 aircraft.<ref name = \"francil 8\">Francillon 1967, p. 8.</ref> These additional 145 aircraft were manufactured in four distinct versions, the ''CA-13'', the ''CA-14'', ''CA-14A'' and ''CA-19''.<ref name = \"francil 8 9 12\">Francillon 1967, pp. 8\u20139, 12.</ref> 95 ''CA-13''s and 49 ''CA-19''s, were completed, while only one prototype of the supercharged Boomerang ''CA-14'' and its modified ''CA-14A'' form would be produced.<ref name = \"francil 8 9\"/> In February 1945, the final Boomerang to be manufactured, ''A46-249'', a CA-19 model, was completed.<ref name = \"francil 8\"/> [[File:A46-89e.jpg|thumb|A46-89 Fuselage]]\n\n===Further development===\nDuring the flight testing phase of development work upon the initial CA-12 model, CAC commenced work upon a new variant which featured performance improvements in terms of speed, climb and ceiling.<ref name = \"francil 8 9\">Francillon 1967, pp. 8\u20139.</ref><ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> Designated ''CA-14'', this aircraft was designed around an order for 145 U.S.-built, 1,700&nbsp;hp (1,268&nbsp;kW) [[Wright R-2600|Wright Cyclone R-2600]] engines. The Wright engines ordered were not delivered as scheduled, and in mid-1942 Wackett authorised use of the 1,850&nbsp;hp (1,380&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800]], which was available from the CAC factory in Lidcombe.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\">Ross 1995, p. 321.</ref> Due to the layout of the Boomerang's compact fuselage, the supercharger for the engine was installed in the rear fuselage, while a new three-bladed [[variable pitch]] [[Curtiss-Wright|Curtiss]]-built propeller was also initially adopted.<ref name = \"francil 9\">Francillon 1967, p. 9.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, the addition of significantly greater weight of this powerplant imposed an unacceptable risk of undercarriage failure.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> (The R-2800 engine would later be the basis of design work on the Boomerang's successor: the [[CAC CA-15]] \"Kangaroo\".) CAC eventually returned to the Twin Wasp, to which it added a General Electric B-2 [[turbocharger|turbo-supercharger]] mounted inside the rear part of the fuselage, new propellor gear, a [[gear]]ed cooling fan (influenced by intelligence reports from Europe regarding captured German [[BMW 801]] twin-row radial engines, which were used by the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]A) and a larger, squared-off tailfin and rudder.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/><ref name = \"francil 9\"/>\n\nBy July 1943, the significantly re-worked CA-14 prototype, now known as the CA-14A, had a top speed that was 25\u201330% better than the CA-12, and an operational ceiling 4,000&nbsp;ft (1,200 m) higher.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> Testing of the later Boomerang variants found that they compared favourably, under some conditions, with the [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)#Mk V .28Types 331.2C 349 .26 352.29|Spitfire Mk V]], as well as early variants of the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|Republic Thunderbolt]] (P-47) and [[North American P-51 Mustang|North American Mustang]] (P-51).<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> By that time, however, the Spitfire had filled the interceptor role and CAC was on the verge of commencing the manufacture of [[North American P-51 Mustang variants#Australian Production|Mustangs under licence]] to meet the sought bomber escort, air superiority and close air support roles.<ref name= \"Ross p. 321\"/> Accordingly, the CA-14 never entered production.<ref name = \"francil 9\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Wing Commander Cook of 5 Squadron RAAF at Mareeba March 1944 AWM NEA0367.jpg|thumb|Pilot in the cockpit of a CAC Boomerang fighter]]\nThe Boomerang was a small single-engine [[monoplane]] fighter aircraft, designed with an emphasis on high manoeuvrability. It had a stubby appearance, which had resulted from the structure being derived from the smaller Wirraway being paired with a considerably larger engine in the form of a 1,200 horsepower (890&nbsp;kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp]] [[radial engine]], which drove a three-bladed Hamilton Standard Hydromatic [[propeller]], license-built by [[de Havilland Propellers|de Havilland]] .<ref name = \"francil 5\">Francillon 1967, p. 5.</ref> The engine was closely cowled with two air scoops fixed to the upper and lower sides, the upper being for the [[carburettor]] and the lower for the oil cooler.<ref name = \"francil 5\"/> Fuel was divided between one fuselage-housed 70 gallon [[self-sealing fuel tank]] and a pair of 45-gallon tanks within the center section of the wing.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/>\n\nAlthough the original intention during development had been to use as many Wirraway components as possible, the final design of the Boomerang had substantially differed from the source, having adopted shorter wings along with a shorter, wood-sheathed, aluminium-framed fuselage, which had increased strength in order to withstand combat stresses, and an original centre section.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/> The low-mounted [[cantilever]] wing consisted of five sections, these being a central section, a pair of outer sections, and two detachable wing tips; the outer sections had a swept-back [[leading edge]] along with a straight [[trailing edge]].<ref name = \"francil 5\"/> The wing used a single [[Spar (aeronautics)|spar]] and a [[stressed skin]] construction, along with fabric-covered [[aileron]]s, aluminium [[trim tab]]s and split trailing edge [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s. The main [[landing gear|undercarriage]] [[hydraulics|hydraulically]] retracted into wheelwells forward of the main spar.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/>\n\nThe Boomerang had a new single seat cockpit located directly over the centre of the wing, which was furnished with a sliding canopy which had 1.5-inch bulletproof glass and armor protection.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/> Common to many of the latest fighters at the time, the Boomerang was equipped with [[Autocannon|automatic cannons]]; as no such weapons had previously been manufactured in Australia, a pair of British-made [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano-Suiza 20 mm]] were used.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/> Allegedly, an example which an Australian airman had collected as a souvenir in the Middle East was [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Other armament fitted included four [[M1919 Browning machine gun#Browning .303 Mark II|Browning .303 machine gun]]s along with provision for up to four 20&nbsp;lb smoke bombs; all of these were mounted within the wings.<ref name = \"francil 7\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Boomerang 4sqn (AWM PO2531.013).jpg|thumb|A No. 4 Squadron Boomerang and ground crew at Nadzab, New Guinea in October 1943]]\n\nOn 19 October 1942, CA-12 ''A46-6'' (bu. no. ''829'') became the first Boomerang to reach a training/conversion unit, it was immediately put to use training pilots when it was transferred to [[No. 2 Operational Training Unit RAAF|No. 2 OTU]], from 1 AD.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/><ref name = \"francil 9\"/> In the training role, while generally being considered to be a success according to Rene, pilots without previous operational experience had difficulty transitioning from the Wirraway to the Boomerang due to its poor forward visibility, the reflector gun sight was subsequently relocated in order to improve pilot vision.<ref name = \"francil 9\"/>\n\n[[No. 83 Squadron RAAF|No. 83 Squadron]] became the first fighter unit to receive Boomerangs, when several were delivered to it \u2013 replacing Airacobras \u2013 at Strathpine Airfield, in [[Strathpine, Queensland]], on 10 April 1943.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/> A few weeks afterward, CA-12s were also received by a frontline air defence unit, [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|No. 84 Squadron]] which was stationed on [[Horn Island Airport#World War II|Horn Island Airfield]], in [[Torres Strait]]. The third Boomerang fighter unit, [[No. 85 Squadron RAAF|No. 85 Squadron]] \u2013 like No. 83 Squadron \u2013 was performing home defence duties, at [[Perth Airport|RAAF Guildford]] (known later as Perth Airport); the Boomerangs replaced the squadron's Buffaloes.\n\nOn 16 May 1943, the first encounter between the Boomerang while on aerial patrol duties and Japanese aircraft occurred; a pair of Boomerangs, flown by Flying Officer Johnstone and Sergeant Stammer, spotted three [[Mitsubishi G4M|Mitsubishi G4M 'Betty']] bombers and opened fire upon them at 250 yards, resulting in little apparent damage and the enemy's withdrawal.<ref name = \"francil 10\"/> On the evening of 20 May 1943, Flight Lieutenant [[Roy Goon]] became the first Boomerang pilot to [[Scrambling (military)|scramble]] on the Australian mainland against Japanese bombers.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/> Goon, part of a No. 85 Squadron detachment at [[RAAF Learmonth]], near [[Exmouth, Western Australia]], undertaking air defence of the Allied naval base at [[Exmouth Gulf]] (codenamed \"Potshot\"), took off to intercept Japanese bombers.<ref>[http://www.anzac.dpc.wa.gov.au/TellUsYourStory/Pages/JohnCBailey.aspx Government of Western Australia, 2013, \"John C.

The Boomerang's low top speed and poor high altitude performance meant that No. 84 could drive off enemy attacks but rarely could get close enough to Japanese aircraft to bring their guns to bear.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} There were not many air raids in this area, and after using Boomerangs for eight months, No. 84 Squadron upgraded to the Kittyhawk. In addition to its air defence operations, No. 84 also provided cover for all shipping in the area during this time, including within 20 miles of [[Merauke]], [[Papua (province)|Papua Province]].<ref name = \"francil 10\">Francillon 1967, p. 10.</ref>\n\nWhile RAAF records show that the Boomerang was never recorded as having destroyed any enemy aircraft, the type proved to be more useful in its capacity as a light [[close air support|ground attack]] aircraft used by Army co-operation squadrons, often replacing the lightly armed Wirraway in this role.<ref name = \"francil 10\"/> In this vital mission, the Boomerang directly contributed to the extensive ground war in the jungles of the [[South West Pacific theatre]] was often characterised by widely dispersed, small unit actions, which typically fought at close quarters and with uncertain front lines. In addition to strafing Japanese ground forces with cannon and machine gun fire, Boomerangs would often deploy smoke bombs to mark valuable targets for other units to attack.<ref name = \"francil 10\"/> The aircraft was also used for artillery spotting, aerial supply drops, tactical reconnaissance, and anti-[[malaria]]l spraying.<ref name = \"francil 10\"/>\n\nThe aircraft proved to be ideal in this ground attack role due to a number of qualities that it possessed. The Boomerang had the range to go wherever it was needed when it was based close to ground operations; had heavy armament; was agile and easy to fly, meaning that pilots could get close to ground targets, avoid ground fire and rough terrain; and featured extensive armour plating along with a wood and aluminium airframe that could withstand significant battle damage. Some of the aircraft were shot down, including two accidental \"kills\" by US forces, and many were damaged during accidents while landing, often because the Boomerang was prone to [[Ground loop (aviation)|ground looping]].<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/><ref name = \"francil 10\"/>\n\n[[File:Australia aviation factory LOC fsa 8e01090.jpg|thumb|CAC Boomerang during assembly]]\n[[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No. 4 Squadron]] and [[No. 5 Squadron RAAF|No. 5 Squadron]] flew Boomerangs in New Guinea, the [[Solomon Islands Campaign]] and [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo Campaign]], also in the close support role, with marked success.<ref name = \"francil 10 12\">Francillon 1967, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> Flying in pairs (one to observe the ground, the other to observe the air around them), their tasks included bombing, strafing, close infantry support and artillery spotting. When attacking larger enemy formations, Boomerangs often operated in conjunction with larger aircraft. In this role, the Boomerang would get in close to confirm the identity of the target and mark it with a 20&nbsp;lb (9&nbsp;kg) smoke bomb with the \"cooperating\" aircraft delivering the major ordnance from a safer distance. A partnership between No. 5 Squadron Boomerangs and [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]] fighter bombers during the [[Bougainville Campaign]] was said to be particularly effective.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nOn 14 August 1945, the wartime role of the Boomerang came to an end when the suspension of all offensive operations against land targets, except for direct support of Allied ground forces in contact with the enemy, was issued.<ref name = \"francil 12\"/>\n\nNo. 8 Communications Unit operated a number of Boomerangs to assist with [[air sea rescue]] operations in New Guinea.<ref>RAAF Historical Section 1995, p. 137.</ref>\n\nThe sole CA-14A was used for research by No. 1 Aircraft Performance Unit RAAF, and was also seconded to the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] for a period after the war ended.<ref name=\"adf-serials\"/>\n\n==Variants==\n;CA-12 (Mark I)\n:The first single-seat fighter version, 105 built.<ref name=\"Aero816 p103\">Kightly ''Aeroplane'' August 2016, p. 103.</ref>\n;CA-13 (Mark II)\n:Improved version of the CA-12, 95 built.<ref name=\"Aero816 p103\"/>\n;CA-14\n:One aircraft fitted with a turbo-supercharged engine, did not enter production.
