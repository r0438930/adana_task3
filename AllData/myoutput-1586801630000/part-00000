During splicing, [[intron]]s (Non-coding regions) are removed and [[exon]]s (Coding Regions) are joined together. For [[nuclear genes|nuclear-encoded genes]], splicing takes place within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] either during or immediately after [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]]. For those [[eukaryotic transcription|eukaryotic genes]] that contain introns, splicing is usually required in order to create an mRNA molecule that can be [[translation (biology)|translated into protein]].  For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the [[spliceosome]], a complex of small nuclear ribonucleo proteins ([[snRNP]]s). [[Self-splicing intron]]s, or [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own excision from their parent RNA molecule, also exist.\n[[File:Splicesome.svg|thumb|Process of RNA splicing]]\n\n==Splicing pathways==\nSeveral methods of RNA splicing occur in nature; the type of splicing depends on the structure of the spliced intron and the [[catalyst]]s required for splicing to occur.\n\n===Spliceosomal complex===\n\n====Introns====\nThe word ''intron'' is derived from the terms ''intragenic region'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert W | title = Why genes in pieces? | journal = Nature | volume = 271 | issue = 5645 | pages = 501 | date = February 1978 | pmid = 622185 | doi = 10.1038/271501a0 | bibcode = 1978Natur.271..501G }}</ref> and ''intracistron'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonegawa S, Maxam AM, Tizard R, Bernard O, Gilbert W | title = Sequence of a mouse germ-line gene for a variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 1485\u201389 | date = March 1978 | pmid = 418414 | pmc = 411497 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.75.3.1485 | bibcode = 1978PNAS...75.1485T }}</ref> that is, a segment of DNA that is located between two exons of a [[gene]].

There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, ''[[Group I catalytic intron|Group I]]'', ''[[Group II intron|Group II]]'' and ''[[Group III intron|Group III]]''.  Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein.  This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome.  Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an [[RNA world]] present before protein.\n\nTwo transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:\n# 3'OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site.\n# 3'OH of the 5' exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.\n\nThe mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:\n# The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the ''lariat''\n# The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site, thereby joining the exons together.\n\n===tRNA splicing===\n[[tRNA]] (also tRNA-like) splicing is another rare form of splicing that usually occurs in tRNA.

Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein.  This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome.  Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an [[RNA world]] present before protein.\n\nTwo transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:\n# 3'OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site.\n# 3'OH of the 5' exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.\n\nThe mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:\n# The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the ''lariat''\n# The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site, thereby joining the exons together.\n\n===tRNA splicing===\n[[tRNA]] (also tRNA-like) splicing is another rare form of splicing that usually occurs in tRNA.  The splicing reaction involves a different biochemistry than the spliceosomal and self-splicing pathways.\n\nIn the [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', a yeast tRNA splicing [[endonuclease]] heterotetramer, composed of [[TSEN54]], [[TSEN2]], [[TSEN34]], and [[TSEN15]], cleaves pre-tRNA at two sites in the acceptor loop to form a 5'-half tRNA, terminating at a 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester group, and a 3'-half tRNA, terminating at a 5'-hydroxyl group, along with a discarded intron.<ref name=trotta1997>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trotta CR, Miao F, Arn EA, Stevens SW, Ho CK, Rauhut R, Abelson JN | title = The yeast tRNA splicing endonuclease: a tetrameric enzyme with two active site subunits homologous to the archaeal tRNA endonucleases | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 849\u201358 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9200603 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80270-6 }}</ref>  Yeast tRNA kinase then phosphorylates the 5'-hydroxyl group using [[adenosine triphosphate]].

[[Eukaryote]]s splice many protein-coding [[mRNA|messenger RNA]]s and some [[non-coding RNA]]s. [[Prokaryote]]s, on the other hand, splice rarely and mostly non-coding RNAs. Another important difference between these two groups of organisms is that prokaryotes completely lack the spliceosomal pathway.\n\nBecause spliceosomal introns are not conserved in all species, there is debate concerning when spliceosomal splicing evolved.

These proteins and their respective binding elements promote or reduce the usage of a particular splice site. The binding specificity comes from the sequence and structure of the cis-elements, e.g. in HIV-1 there are many donor and acceptor splice sites. Among the various splice sites, ssA7, which is 3' acceptor site, folds into three stem loop structures, i.e. Intronic splicing silencer (ISS), Exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), and Exonic splicing silencer (ESSE3).
