He is the current manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nBorn in [[Corbridge]], Northumberland, he was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by several professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered a trial with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. Bruce was offered an apprenticeship and went on to play more than 200&nbsp;games for the club before joining [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1984, winning the [[1985 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 1985]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with whom he achieved great success, winning twelve trophies including three [[Premier League]] titles, three [[FA Cup]]s, one [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He also became the first English player of the 20th century to captain a team to [[Double (association football)|the Double]]. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.\n\nBruce began his managerial career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and spent short periods of time managing [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan. At the end of the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309 season]] he resigned to take over as manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the [[2014 FA Cup Final]], before leaving in July 2016. He took over at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] four months later but was dismissed in October 2018. He took over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday in February 2019 and left in July that year to take over at Newcastle United.<ref name=\"newcastle-appoint\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/17/newcastle-appoint-steve-bruce-manager-rafael-benitez|title=Newcastle appoint Steve Bruce as manager to succeed Rafael Ben\u00edtez|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 July 2019|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:corbridge uk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Corbridge]], Bruce's place of birth]]\n\nBruce was born in [[Corbridge]] in Northumberland, the elder of two sons of Joe and Sheenagh Bruce.<ref>Bruce (1994), p. 33.</ref> His father was local, and his mother had been born in [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"Ireland\">{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Parkes |title=Blues defender Bruce opts for green shirt of Ireland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/23/newsstory.sport3 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 February 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Vital\">{{cite news |title=Bruce in the middle |newspaper=Evening Star |location=Ipswich |url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/sport/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=estonline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=IPED04%20Sep%202007%2009%3A37%3A27%3A587 |date=4 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610191103/http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/sport/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=estonline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=IPED04%20Sep%202007%2009%3A37%3A27%3A587 |archivedate=10 June 2008}}</ref> The family lived in Daisy Hill near [[Wallsend]],<ref>Bruce (1994), p. 34.</ref> and Bruce attended [[Benfield School]].<ref name=\"SB38\">Bruce (1994), p. 38.</ref>\n\nBruce, a boyhood fan of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], said that he sneaked into [[St James' Park]] without paying to watch the team play, saying \"I have always been a [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a [[Shilling|bob]] or whatever it was.

He is the current manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nBorn in [[Corbridge]], Northumberland, he was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by several professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered a trial with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. Bruce was offered an apprenticeship and went on to play more than 200&nbsp;games for the club before joining [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1984, winning the [[1985 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 1985]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with whom he achieved great success, winning twelve trophies including three [[Premier League]] titles, three [[FA Cup]]s, one [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He also became the first English player of the 20th century to captain a team to [[Double (association football)|the Double]]. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.\n\nBruce began his managerial career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and spent short periods of time managing [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan. At the end of the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309 season]] he resigned to take over as manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the [[2014 FA Cup Final]], before leaving in July 2016. He took over at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] four months later but was dismissed in October 2018. He took over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday in February 2019 and left in July that year to take over at Newcastle United.<ref name=\"newcastle-appoint\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/17/newcastle-appoint-steve-bruce-manager-rafael-benitez|title=Newcastle appoint Steve Bruce as manager to succeed Rafael Ben\u00edtez|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 July 2019|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:corbridge uk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Corbridge]], Bruce's place of birth]]\n\nBruce was born in [[Corbridge]] in Northumberland, the elder of two sons of Joe and Sheenagh Bruce.<ref>Bruce (1994), p. 33.</ref> His father was local, and his mother had been born in [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"Ireland\">{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Parkes |title=Blues defender Bruce opts for green shirt of Ireland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/23/newsstory.sport3 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 February 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Vital\">{{cite news |title=Bruce in the middle |newspaper=Evening Star |location=Ipswich |url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/sport/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=estonline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=IPED04%20Sep%202007%2009%3A37%3A27%3A587 |date=4 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610191103/http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/sport/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=estonline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=IPED04%20Sep%202007%2009%3A37%3A27%3A587 |archivedate=10 June 2008}}</ref> The family lived in Daisy Hill near [[Wallsend]],<ref>Bruce (1994), p. 34.</ref> and Bruce attended [[Benfield School]].<ref name=\"SB38\">Bruce (1994), p. 38.</ref>\n\nBruce, a boyhood fan of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], said that he sneaked into [[St James' Park]] without paying to watch the team play, saying \"I have always been a [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a [[Shilling|bob]] or whatever it was.
