It is one of several species known as [[friarbird]]s whose heads are bare of feathers. It is brown-grey in colour, with a prominent knob on its bare black-skinned head. It feeds on insects and nectar.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe noisy friarbird was first described by ornithologist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in 1790.
