It is located off Belsize Avenue and can also be accessed from Glenloch Road. It is one of the many purpose built mansion blocks on Haverstock Hill between [[Chalk Farm]] and [[Hampstead]]. It is close to the amenities near [[Belsize Park tube station]], as well as the shops of Belsize Village, South End Green and Hampstead.\n\n== Site history ==\n\nHillfield Court sits on what was once a large country estate known as the Belsize Estate. The first recorded building on the site of what today is Hillfield Court was built in around 1646. It was known as the ''Blue House'' and was one of many rural abodes in the area belonging to wealthy merchants, who wanted a country residence within easy reach of London. The Blue House was accessed directly from Haverstock Hill. Little is known about the residents of the Blue House but evidence suggests that in 1650 it was occupied by one John Mascall and in 1679 by Thomas Butler. Between 1761 and 1773, the house was rebuilt and extended by merchant William Horsley.\n\nIn 1808, the Belsize Estate was split into 9 leasehold estates. The Hillfield leasehold, as well as the adjoining Belsize House leasehold (around {{convert|19|acre|m2}} in total) were bought by James Abel.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compid=22638&filename=fig09.gif]\n\nIn 1841 Basil Woodd, a [[Bond Street]] brandy merchant bought the lease from Abel, a {{convert|19|acre|m2|adj=on}} estate set within the boundaries of [[Belsize Avenue]], [[Belsize Park Gardens]] and [[Belsize Grove]]. By this time, the area to the west of Haverstock Hill was dotted with many country abodes. The former ''Blue House'' had by this stage been renovated, modernised and renamed ''Heathfield House'', a stuccoed 6-bedroom house with a library. Woodd acquired the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] of the land in 1857 and renamed the house ''Hillfield''. Sometime between 1864 and 1867 he built another house on the south end of the estate for his son Robert Ballard Woodd - This house was called Woodlands. Whilst Woodlands was demolished in 1901 to make way for higher density housing, Hillfield remained until 1928 when it was demolished.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22638 Hampstead - Belsize | British History Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The land was bought by Hillfield Estates Ltd, a company formed in 1933 by FL, WJ and AG Griggs (Frank, William and Alfred).\n\nThe activities of Griggs & Son Ltd of Victoria St, London included land development in Pinner, building theatres<ref>http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk</ref> for the Astoria group in London and in [[Astoria Theatre, Brighton|Brighton (1933)]] and building at least two other theatres in the West End. Griggs & Son developed the Hillfield site to cater for the high demand for mansion blocks. The destruction of the old house and the development of the estate was met with some local opposition, however.\n\n== The building ==\n\nHillfield Court, so named in commemoration of the grand house, was just one part of the development. The scheme also included two other mansion blocks - Tudor Close (1935) to the back of the estate; and on Haverstock Hill, a parade of shops with Hillfield Mansions above (1934), which remained in the ownership of Hillfield Estates Ltd for many years. The parade incorporated an Odeon cinema, one of the first in London, which opened in September 1934.<ref>http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/15082</ref> The flagship of the Odeon chain for several years, it was demolished in the 1970s. It was replaced by the highly regarded Screen on the Hill cinema (since changed hands & renamed the Everyman Belsize Park).\n\nThe architect for the flats (and the cinema) was [[Tp bennett]]; he also designed the block of flats on nearby Finchley Road, above what is now a Waitrose store. The practice he founded continues today. His design for Hillfield Court provided 113 flats over six storeys, in seven different layouts and intended to suit a variety of tenants. Bennett had given much thought to the planning of apartment buildings for London.<ref>Architectural Design and Construction, May\u2013June 1935</ref> At Hillfield Court, he adopted the 'dining-hall' in some layouts, for more efficient use of the available space. There were hand-operated hoists from the ground floor so groceries, etc. could be delivered direct to every kitchen. A boiler room provides hot water to all flats and heating to common parts. Originally there was a central store for tenants' own coal, carried up by porters to be burned on the open fires. From its inception Hillfield Court was considered a very prestigious block, not least because of its magnificent, spacious gardens.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] a [[barrage balloon]] was anchored on the Hillfield Court lawn. [[Royal Air Force]] personnel were housed in a ground floor flat ready to launch the balloon when necessary. These large, airborne barriers protected important installations against low-level air attack. A brick bunkhouse built for the crew remains, now used as the garden shed.\n\nThe flats were rented out on short leases until in 1969, [[inflation]] saw tenants for the first time being given the opportunity to purchase their flats on a 99-year [[lease]]. For a while the family firm continued to manage the block directly but in the mid-1970s, the building was placed in the hands of managing agents. By that stage the principal shareholder was FE (Francis) Griggs and when he died in 1977, control of the freehold passed to Mrs JL Griggs. Eventually, according to various residents, there came the shattering news that Hillfield Court had been sold - unfortunately, to \"unscrupulous experts at [[asset stripping]]\".<ref>Hillfield Court newsletter, 1998</ref> The twenty one flats that were still rented out were then sold on long leases to a property company. There was talk of building townhouses with garages and an access road on the much-loved gardens.\n\nFighting back vigorously, the [[Residents Association]] organised speeches, TV interviews and meetings with [[Camden Council (New South Wales)|Camden Council]] in the hope of saving their garden. Eventually they prevailed \u2013 a preservation order was placed on every tree. Camden Council effectively refused permission to build and the residents were elated.\n\nBy 1985 residents had ensured that the landlord's potential for making money was small. A group of leaseholders established Hillfield Court Limited to buy the freehold, an agreement was reached, 84 residents subscribed and they became the new owners. While the management of Hillfield Court has provided many highs and lows, the residents have always been very proud of their block and its garden with its high level of community spirit. Maintenance and improvement work continues year on year, still preserving the building's essential character.\n\n== Notable former residents ==\nAlthough no [[blue plaque]] appears on the building, Hillfield Court has been home to many interesting and famous people over the years. These include actress [[Diana Wynyard]], author [[Barnaby Williams]], novelist [[Kay Dick]] and the photographer [[Bill Brandt]]. The wet-stamp of many of Brandt's photos reads ''\"Bill Brandt, 58 Hillfield Court, Belsize Avenue, NW3\"'' and have sold at [[Christie's]] for many thousands of pounds. Additionally, directors of many films as well as one of the leading actresses in the [[West End theatre|West End]] [[Musical theatre|Musical]] [[Miss Saigon]] have also lived there. [[Sophie Turner]], the English actor who rose to international fame playing [[Sansa Stark]] in the [[HBO]] series [[Game of Thrones]] lived in the block in the early 2010s, as did media personality and paparazzo [[Darryn Lyons]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{coord|51.55039|N|0.16684|W|type:landmark_region:GB|display=title|format=dms}}\n\n[[Category:Art Deco architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Camden]]\n[[Category:Residential buildings completed in 1932]]\n[[Category:Apartment buildings in London]]\n[[Category:Belsize Park]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:Hillfield Court in the winter.jpg|thumb|right|Hillfield Court on a winter's morning]]\n\n'''Hillfield Court''' is a prominent [[art deco]] residential [[mansion block]] in [[Belsize Park]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], built in 1934.
