Rationality is relative: if one accepts a model in which benefitting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior that is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a model in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is deemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also specifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed and formulated.\n\n==Theories of rational thinking==\n===Max Weber===\nThe German scholar [[Max Weber]] proposed an interpretation of [[Social actions|social action]] that distinguished between four different [[ideal type|idealized types]] of rationality.<ref name=kalberg/>\n\nThe first, which he called ''Zweckrational'' or purposive/[[instrumental rationality]], is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were \"rationally pursued and calculated.\" The second type, Weber called ''Wertrational'' or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motives, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion\u2014to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered \"meaningfully oriented.\" The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.\n\nThe advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that ground or motive can be given\u2014for religious or affect reasons, for example\u2014that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the ''Zweckrational'' orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are ''Wertrational''.\n\nWeber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermasian]] (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power)<ref>[[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] (1984) ''The Theory of Communicative Action Volume&nbsp;1; Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', Cambridge: Polity Press.</ref> and also from a [[feminist]] perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power.<ref>Eagleton, M.

Grayling]]) that a good rationale must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis, that may be called rational, is expected to be highly objective, logical and \"mechanical\". If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been, even slightly, influenced by personal emotions, feelings, instincts, or culturally specific moral codes and norms, then the analysis may be termed irrational, due to the injection of subjective bias.\n\nModern [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] show that studying the role of emotion in mental function (including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans), that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example, an individual with a massively damaged [[amygdala]] or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Theoretical and practical==\n[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jes\u00fas Moster\u00edn]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.<ref>Moster\u00edn, Jes\u00fas (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acci\u00f3n humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.</ref> Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.\n\nThe distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.\n\nTheoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to [[consistency|logical consistency]] and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Moster\u00edn distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moster\u00edn |first1=Jes\u00fas |title=Acceptance without belief |journal=Manuscrito |date=2002 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313\u2013335 |url=https://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/manuscrito/article/view/8644540 }}</ref> Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one's best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.\n\n==Examples in different fields==\n\n===Logic===\n{{main|Logic and rationality}}\nAs the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.\n\n===Economics===\nRationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this.<ref>{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality\u2014basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational\u2014that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information\u2014in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.\n\nDebates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are \"really\" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.\n\nOthers think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nWithin [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of \"performance\", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].<ref>Johnson-Laird, P.N. & Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''.

Some scholars hold it indispensable.<ref>Bueno De Mesquita, Bruce (2010) Foreign Policy Analysis and Rational Choice Models.

Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to \"foreign policy\" allude to \"rationality\"\u2014and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on \"malpractice\": rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of \"rationality\" they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between \"us and them.\"<ref name=Abulof/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Cognitive bias]]\n* [[Coherence (linguistics)]]\n* [[Counterintuitive]]\n* [[Dysrationalia]]\n* [[Flipism]]\n* [[Homo economicus]]\n* [[Imputation (game theory)]] (individual rationality)\n* [[Instinct]]\n* [[Intelligence]]\n* [[Irrationality]]\n* [[Law of thought]]\n* [[LessWrong]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n* [[Principle of rationality]]\n* [[Rational emotive behavior therapy]]\n* [[Rational pricing]]\n* [[Rationalism]]\n* [[Rationalization (making excuses)]]\n* [[Satisficing]]\n* [[Superrationality]]\n* [[Von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added above categories/infobox footers by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151031091523/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ArchiveFolder/Research%20Group/Publications/Reason/ReasonRationality.htm Reason and Rationality], by Richard Samuels, Stephen Stich, Luc Faucher on the broad field of reason and rationality from descriptive, normative, and evaluative points of view\n* [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-historicist/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Historicist Theories of Rationality]\n* [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/leglreas.htm Legal Reasoning After Post-Modern Critiques of Reason], by Peter Suber\n*{{cite journal |last1=Spohn |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Many Facets of the Theory of Rationality |journal=Croatian Journal of Philosophy |date=2002 |volume=II |issue=6 |pages=249\u2013264 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1019.3269 }}\n* [[Lucy Suchman]] (2007).

However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Theoretical and practical==\n[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jes\u00fas Moster\u00edn]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.<ref>Moster\u00edn, Jes\u00fas (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acci\u00f3n humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.</ref> Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.\n\nThe distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.\n\nTheoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to [[consistency|logical consistency]] and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Moster\u00edn distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moster\u00edn |first1=Jes\u00fas |title=Acceptance without belief |journal=Manuscrito |date=2002 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313\u2013335 |url=https://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/manuscrito/article/view/8644540 }}</ref> Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one's best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.\n\n==Examples in different fields==\n\n===Logic===\n{{main|Logic and rationality}}\nAs the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.\n\n===Economics===\nRationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this.<ref>{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality\u2014basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational\u2014that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information\u2014in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.\n\nDebates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are \"really\" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.\n\nOthers think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nWithin [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of \"performance\", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].<ref>Johnson-Laird, P.N. & Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum.</ref>\n\n===International relations===\nThere is an ongoing debate over the merits of using \u201crationality\u201d in the study of [[international relations]] (IR). Some scholars hold it indispensable.<ref>Bueno De Mesquita, Bruce (2010) Foreign Policy Analysis and Rational Choice Models. In The International Studies Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Allen Denemark. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Others are more critical.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walt |first1=Stephen M. |title=Rigor or Rigor Mortis?

Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to \"foreign policy\" allude to \"rationality\"\u2014and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on \"malpractice\": rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of \"rationality\" they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between \"us and them.\"<ref name=Abulof/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Cognitive bias]]\n* [[Coherence (linguistics)]]\n* [[Counterintuitive]]\n* [[Dysrationalia]]\n* [[Flipism]]\n* [[Homo economicus]]\n* [[Imputation (game theory)]] (individual rationality)\n* [[Instinct]]\n* [[Intelligence]]\n* [[Irrationality]]\n* [[Law of thought]]\n* [[LessWrong]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n* [[Perfect rationality]]\n* [[Principle of rationality]]\n* [[Rational emotive behavior therapy]]\n* [[Rational pricing]]\n* [[Rationalism]]\n* [[Rationalization (making excuses)]]\n* [[Satisficing]]\n* [[Superrationality]]\n* [[Von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added above categories/infobox footers by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151031091523/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ArchiveFolder/Research%20Group/Publications/Reason/ReasonRationality.htm Reason and Rationality], by Richard Samuels, Stephen Stich, Luc Faucher on the broad field of reason and rationality from descriptive, normative, and evaluative points of view\n* [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-historicist/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Historicist Theories of Rationality]\n* [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/leglreas.htm Legal Reasoning After Post-Modern Critiques of Reason], by Peter Suber\n*{{cite journal |last1=Spohn |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Many Facets of the Theory of Rationality |journal=Croatian Journal of Philosophy |date=2002 |volume=II |issue=6 |pages=249\u2013264 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1019.3269 }}\n* [[Lucy Suchman]] (2007).
