Initially raised as an infantry battalion of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]], it transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1942. It served as the LAA component of [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Division]] in the [[Tunisian Campaign]], at the [[Operation Avalanche|Salerno]] landings, and through the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] until it was disbanded in 1945.\n\n==8th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment==\n::''For the [[World War I]] equivalent, see [[8th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment]]''\nThe unit was originally formed in May 1940 as '''50th (Holding) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment''', as part of the rapid expansion of the Army with wartime conscripts.

The division concentrated at [[Bizerte]] from its training areas in mid-August.{{efn|Among the AA defences planned for the beachheads were smokescreens. There was an air raid alert while 46th Division carried out a practice landing at Bizerte and the smokescreen was activated. A low-flying German fighter flew through the screen firing at random, and seriously wounded the corps commander, Lt-Gen [[Brian Horrocks]].<ref>Horrocks, p. 175.</ref> The smoke screen did, however, protect 46th Division's convoy when it was bombed while laying at anchor in Bizerte Bay on the night of 6/7 September.<ref>Molony, Vol V, p. 273.</ref>}} The division was to land a brigade on beaches at the northern (left hand) end of the landing area. The beaches would be secured by specialist 'Beach Bricks' including heavy and light AA batteries, and the infantry division's own LAA batteries would then assist with beach defence as they arrived, paying particular attention to exit routes and assembly areas. In 46th Division's sector this worked reasonably well: although the invasion convoy was bombed during the preceding night and the leading infantry and Beach Brick troops landed under shellfire and into immediate firefights, the AA guns got ashore and long-range [[P-38 Lightning]] fighters kept off most ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' air attacks by day. By 23.00 46th Division was landing in waves and no counter-attack had yet developed. However, a week-long battle for Salerno and its hinterland developed, with more and more reinforcements squeezing onto the beaches, and the ''Luftwaffe'' concentrating its attacks on the beaches and shipping. Finally, on 16 September the Germans withdrew and 46th Division swung northwards towards [[Naples]].<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 259\u201360, 274, 278\u201380, 284\u20137, 292, 318, 331.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp. 270\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Naples to the Garigliano===\n46th Division fought its way through the high ground north of Salerno, and then the armour drove across the Plain of Naples to the city itself on 1 October.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 337\u201344.</ref> Next the force moved up for the assault crossing of the [[Volturno]]. The division's attack on the night of 12/13 October was almost unopposed except in one sector, and it had two brigade bridgeheads by nightfall on 13 October. However, this was partly because the Germans had chosen to defend the wide marshy area across the river, and meanwhile their aircraft were very active in attempting to deny the other crossings and to disrupt the bridging operations, with frequent attacks using [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] [[Fighter-bomber]]s.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 438, 443\u20134.</ref><ref>Routledge, p. 283.</ref>\n[[File:The_British_Army_in_Italy_1944_NA10708.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bofors gun of 379 Bty, 115 LAA Rgt, in Italy, 7 January 1944.]]\nAfter the Volturno, the ''Luftwaffe'' was rarely seen and AA engagements became uncommon as 46th Division worked its way up the coastal plain past Monte Camino to the German [[Winter Line]].<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Routledge, p. 281.</ref><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 445\u20136, 450.</ref> The division's next major operation was a failed assault crossing of the [[Garigliano]] on the night of 19/20 January 1944 intended to assist [[II Corps (United States)|II US Corps]] crossing of the [[Battle of the Rapido River|Rapido]] (part of the attacks on [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]).<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 616\u20137.</ref> Afterwards the division was involved in hill fighting between 26 January and 9 February, taking Monte Furlito and Monte Purgatorio but failing at Monte Faito. The attacks were then called off in rain, sleet and snow.<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 634\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Rest and retraining===\nIn early 1944 [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI) instituted a procedure of shipping exhausted British formations (without their equipment) to [[Middle East Command]] for rest and retraining. The first of these was 46th Division, which embarked on 16 March, arriving in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] on 22 March and moving up into [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] at the end of the month. Rested and reinforced, the division retraced its journey in June, landing back in Italy on 3 July and taking over [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]]'s guns and vehicles. However, because of AAI's increasing manpower shortage, many of the infantry reinforcements were former AA gunners who had been redeployed. Even divisional LAA units like 115th LAA Rgt had to give up one troop per battery, reducing the number of guns from 54 to 36 guns. This was made possible by the near total air supremacy now enjoyed by the Allies in Italy.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 13, 423, 448\u20139.</ref><ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 231.</ref><ref>Routledge, p. 278.</ref> Meanwhile, the lack of AA targets meant that the Bofors guns could be used for other purposes. They were incorporated into ground defence fireplans, and were also used to harass known enemy machine guns or mortar posts, or to engage buildings and bunkers. A useful role was to fire on fixed lines to mark boundaries in an advance, the troops being able to watch the lines of tracer. Some infantry commanders requested their LAA units to 'brown' an area from which an attack seemed imminent.<ref>Routledge, p. 280.</ref>\n\n===Gothic Line===\nOn its return 46th Division joined Eighth Army on the east side of Italy to take part in breaching the [[Gothic Line]] (Operation Olive). The initial operations starting on 26 August began well, with 46th Division taking the [[Montegridolfo]] village complex on 31 August and then continuing its advance to the [[Conca (river)|Conca]] and [[Morciano di Romagna|Morciano]]. It then moved to clear the Croce\u2013[[Gemmano]] high ground to protect Eighth Army's flank as it advanced on [[Coriano]], but here the division ran into stiff opposition in the [[Battle of Gemmano]]. Only on 17 September were the Germans cleared out of their defences and Eighth Army able to close up to the next line of defences, the [[Rimini Line]]. This was taken at a rush by 21 September.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 128\u201330, 225, 238, 243\u20134, 249\u201351, 266\u20139, 277\u201380, 288\u201396.</ref>\n\nEighth Army continued its advance, struggling as much with bad weather and swollen rivers as with stubborn enemy opposition. 46th Division was now due for a rest, having been in almost continuous operations for two months, and it was relieved in mid-October, though it was back in the line on 31 October.<ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 352\u20134, 400, 406\u20137, 409, 427.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nBy now the continuing manpower crisis and the near-total absence of the ''Luftwaffe'' meant that deeper cuts were made in AA provision. In November 1944 the British infantry divisions in Italy lost their LAA regiments, with 115th LAA Rgt leaving 46th Division on 8 November. It was then disbanded on 8 January 1945 and its personnel drafted to other roles.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref name = Frederick805/><ref name = FarnM/>{{efn|A new 115 LAA Rgt was reformed in April 1947 from the war-raised personnel of [[129th (First Surrey Rifles) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|129th (First Surrey Rifles) LAA Rgt]] (TA), but this only lasted a month before it was disbanded.<ref>Frederick, pp. 840, 963.</ref>}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/index.html Basil Collier, ''History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series: The Defence of the United Kingdom'', London: HM Stationery Office, 1957/Uckfield: Naval & Military, 2004] ISBN 978-1-84574-055-9.\n* Gen Sir [[Martin Farndale]], ''History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939\u20131941'', Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, ISBN 1-85753-080-2.\n* J.B.M.

Axis air attacks were maintained until 25 April, doing considerable damage, but tailed off thereafter.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 434\u20136, 440\u20131.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp 184\u20135.</ref>\n\nBy early May the Axis forces were crumbling, and a final thrust ([[Operation Strike]]) took the First Army into Tunis on 7 May; the Axis forces surrendered on 13 May.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 448\u201357.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp 185\u20136.</ref> At the end of the campaign 115th LAA Rgt claimed 58 enemy aircraft destroyed for the expenditure of 22,748 rounds (some of the rounds fired would have been against ground targets).<ref>Routledge, p. 187.</ref>\n\n==Italy==\n===Salerno===\n46th Division was assigned to Force 141 (later [[15th Army Group]]) for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] but was not employed.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Instead it was used to carry out the assault landing at [[Salerno]] on the Italian mainland ([[Operation Avalanche]]) on 9 September. The division concentrated at [[Bizerte]] from its training areas in mid-August.{{efn|Among the AA defences planned for the beachheads were smokescreens. There was an air raid alert while 46th Division carried out a practice landing at Bizerte and the smokescreen was activated. A low-flying German fighter flew through the screen firing at random, and seriously wounded the corps commander, Lt-Gen [[Brian Horrocks]].<ref>Horrocks, p. 175.</ref> The smoke screen did, however, protect 46th Division's convoy when it was bombed while laying at anchor in Bizerte Bay on the night of 6/7 September.<ref>Molony, Vol V, p. 273.</ref>}} The division was to land a brigade on beaches at the northern (left hand) end of the landing area. The beaches would be secured by specialist 'Beach Bricks' including heavy and light AA batteries, and the infantry division's own LAA batteries would then assist with beach defence as they arrived, paying particular attention to exit routes and assembly areas. In 46th Division's sector this worked reasonably well: although the invasion convoy was bombed during the preceding night and the leading infantry and Beach Brick troops landed under shellfire and into immediate firefights, the AA guns got ashore and long-range [[P-38 Lightning]] fighters kept off most ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' air attacks by day. By 23.00 46th Division was landing in waves and no counter-attack had yet developed. However, a week-long battle for Salerno and its hinterland developed, with more and more reinforcements squeezing onto the beaches, and the ''Luftwaffe'' concentrating its attacks on the beaches and shipping. Finally, on 16 September the Germans withdrew and 46th Division swung northwards towards [[Naples]].<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 259\u201360, 274, 278\u201380, 284\u20137, 292, 318, 331.</ref><ref>Routledge, pp. 270\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Naples to the Garigliano===\n46th Division fought its way through the high ground north of Salerno, and then the armour drove across the Plain of Naples to the city itself on 1 October.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 337\u201344.</ref> Next the force moved up for the assault crossing of the [[Volturno]]. The division's attack on the night of 12/13 October was almost unopposed except in one sector, and it had two brigade bridgeheads by nightfall on 13 October. However, this was partly because the Germans had chosen to defend the wide marshy area across the river, and meanwhile their aircraft were very active in attempting to deny the other crossings and to disrupt the bridging operations, with frequent attacks using [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] [[Fighter-bomber]]s.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 438, 443\u20134.</ref><ref>Routledge, p. 283.</ref>\n[[File:The_British_Army_in_Italy_1944_NA10708.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bofors gun of 379 Bty, 115 LAA Rgt, in Italy, 7 January 1944.]]\nAfter the Volturno, the ''Luftwaffe'' was rarely seen and AA engagements became uncommon as 46th Division worked its way up the coastal plain past Monte Camino to the German [[Winter Line]].<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Routledge, p. 281.</ref><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 445\u20136, 450.</ref> The division's next major operation was a failed assault crossing of the [[Garigliano]] on the night of 19/20 January 1944 intended to assist [[II Corps (United States)|II US Corps]] crossing of the [[Battle of the Rapido River|Rapido]] (part of the attacks on [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]).<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 616\u20137.</ref> Afterwards the division was involved in hill fighting between 26 January and 9 February, taking Monte Furlito and Monte Purgatorio but failing at Monte Faito. The attacks were then called off in rain, sleet and snow.<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 634\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Rest and retraining===\nIn early 1944 [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI) instituted a procedure of shipping exhausted British formations (without their equipment) to [[Middle East Command]] for rest and retraining. The first of these was 46th Division, which embarked on 16 March, arriving in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] on 22 March and moving up into [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] at the end of the month. Rested and reinforced, the division retraced its journey in June, landing back in Italy on 3 July and taking over [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]]'s guns and vehicles. However, because of AAI's increasing manpower shortage, many of the infantry reinforcements were former AA gunners who had been redeployed. Even divisional LAA units like 115th LAA Rgt had to give up one troop per battery, reducing the number of guns from 54 to 36 guns. This was made possible by the near total air supremacy now enjoyed by the Allies in Italy.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 13, 423, 448\u20139.</ref><ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 231.</ref><ref>Routledge, p. 278.</ref> Meanwhile the lack of AA targets meant that the Bofors guns could be used for other purposes. They were incorporated into ground defence fireplans, and were also used to harass known enemy machine guns or mortar posts, or to engage buildings and bunkers. A useful role was to fire on fixed lines to mark boundaries in an advance, the troops being able to watch the lines of tracer. Some infantry commanders requested their LAA units to 'brown' an area from which an attack seemed imminent.<ref>Routledge, p. 280.</ref>\n\n===Gothic Line===\nOn its return 46th Division joined Eighth Army on the east side of Italy to take part in breaching the [[Gothic Line]] (Operation Olive). The initial operations starting on 26 August began well, with 46th Division taking the [[Montegridolfo]] village complex on 31 August and then continuing its advance to the [[Conca (river)|Conca]] and [[Morciano di Romagna|Morciano]]. It then moved to clear the Croce\u2013[[Gemmano]] high ground to protect Eighth Army's flank as it advanced on [[Coriano]], but here the division ran into stiff opposition in the [[Battle of Gemmano]]. Only on 17 September were the Germans cleared out of their defences and Eighth Army able to close up to the next line of defences, the [[Rimini Line]]. This was taken at a rush by 21 September.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 128\u201330, 225, 238, 243\u20134, 249\u201351, 266\u20139, 277\u201380, 288\u201396.</ref>\n\nEighth Army continued its advance, struggling as much with bad weather and swollen rivers as with stubborn enemy opposition. 46th Division was now due for a rest, having been in almost continuous operations for two months, and it was relieved in mid-October, though it was back in the line on 31 October.<ref>Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 352\u20134, 400, 406\u20137, 409, 427.</ref>\n\n==Disbandment==\nBy now the continuing manpower crisis and the near-total absence of the ''Luftwaffe'' meant that deeper cuts were made in AA provision. In November 1944 the British infantry divisions in Italy lost their LAA regiments, with 115th LAA Rgt leaving 46th Division on 8 November. It was then disbanded on 8 January 1945 and its personnel drafted to other roles.<ref name = Joslen46/><ref name = Frederick805/><ref name = FarnM/>{{efn|A new 115 LAA Rgt was reformed in April 1947 from the war-raised personnel of [[129th (First Surrey Rifles) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|129th (First Surrey Rifles) LAA Rgt]] (TA), but this only lasted a month before it was disbanded.<ref>Frederick, pp. 840, 963.</ref>}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/index.html Basil Collier, ''History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series: The Defence of the United Kingdom'', London: HM Stationery Office, 1957/Uckfield: Naval & Military, 2004, ISBN 978-1-84574-055-9.]\n* Gen Sir [[Martin Farndale]], ''History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939\u20131941'', Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, ISBN 1-85753-080-2.\n* J.B.M.
