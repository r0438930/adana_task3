It stands on the [[River Trent]], the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] \u2013 on the route of the ancient [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] \u2013 and the [[East Coast Main Line]] railway. The origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], as it lies on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. The town grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place, now lined with historic buildings. It was a centre for the wool and cloth trades. In the [[English Civil War]], it was besieged by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary forces]] and [[Relief of Newark|relieved]] by [[Cavaliers|Royalist forces]] under [[Prince Rupert]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:UK NewarkonTrent.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost in Newark-on-Trent]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe place-name Newark is first attested in the [[Cartulary]] of [[Eynsham Abbey]] in Oxfordshire, where it appears as ''Newercha'' in about 1054\u20131057 and ''Niweweorche'' in about 1075\u20131092. It appears as ''Newerche'' in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]]. The name means 'New work', with the apparent meaning of \"New fort\".<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p. 339.</ref>\n\nThe origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], due to its position on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the [[Peterborough Cathedral|Abbey of Peterborough]] by King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]]. An [[Anglo-Saxon pagan]] cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent. There cremated remains were buried in pottery urns.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Millgate, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop [[Remigius de F\u00e9camp]]. After his death, control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. There were [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in Newark at the time of the [[Domesday]] survey, and in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] there is evidence that it had long been a [[borough]] by prescription. The [[Newark wapentake]] in the east of Nottinghamshire was established in the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] rule (10th\u201311th centuries).\n\n===Medieval to Stuart period===\n[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] was originally a [[Saxon]] fortified [[manor house]] founded by King Edward the Elder. In 1073, [[Robert Bloet]], Bishop of Lincoln, founded an [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[motte and bailey|motte-and-bailey]] fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] to establish a mint. [[John, King of England|King John]] died of [[dysentery]] in Newark Castle in 1216.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Greig |title=King John: Dysentery and the death that changed history |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111204955/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |archivedate=11 November 2017 |df=dmy-all|date=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town became a local centre for the wool and cloth trade \u2013 by the time of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] a major market was established.

The dissolution affected Newark's political landscape, and even more radical changes came in 1547, when the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] exchanged ownership of the town with the Crown. Newark was incorporated under an [[alderman]] and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] reincorporated the town under a [[mayor]] and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under [[James II of England|James II]], continued to govern the corporation until the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].\n\n===The Civil War===\n[[File:Siege piece shilling from Newark-on-Trent.JPG|thumb|right|A makeshift royalist [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]] (siege piece) made from silver plate during the siege]]\n{{See also|Relief of Newark|Siege money (Newark)}}\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Newark was a mainstay of the Royalist cause, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] having raised his standard in nearby [[Nottingham]]. \"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by [[Charles I of England|the King]] after his own surrender.\"<ref>[http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF Newark Civil War Trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195933/http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF |date=13 June 2011}}.</ref> It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided [[Nottingham]], [[Grantham]], [[Northampton]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. At the end of 1644 it was besieged by forces from Nottingham, [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Derby]], until relieved in March by [[Prince Rupert]].\n\nParliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]]. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Naseby]], near [[Leicester]] in June 1645.\n\nThe final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the [[Queen's Sconce]] to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2\u00bc miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in [[Sconce and Devon Park]].\n\n===Georgian era and early 19th century===\n[[File:Newark Castle and bridge London Published by J Deeley, 95 Bewick St Soho, 1812 Coloured aquatint.jpg|thumb|[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] c. 1812]]\nAround 1770 the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] around Newark (now the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr of York]] and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building. In 1775 the [[Duke of Newcastle]], at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today.\n\nA noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766\u20131799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the ''Nottinghamshire Historian'' journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9\u201315, with further detail in the autumn/winter edition of 2003, pp. 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).<ref>See the report in Cornelius BROWN 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the ''Times'' for 7 October 1829.

Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830\u20131840, contributed to ''The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax'' (London, 1904), a book about the [[Corn Laws]]: \"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\"\n\n===19th\u201321st centuries===\nMany new buildings and much industry appeared in the [[Victorian era]]. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836\u20131837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N. Nicholson Trent Ironworks (1840s), Northgate Railway Station (1851), North End Wesleyan Chapel (1868), St Leonard's Anglican Church (1873), the Baptist Chapel (1876), the Primitive Methodist Chapel (1878), [[Newark Hospital]] (1881), Ossington Coffee Palace (1882), Gilstrap Free Library (1883), the Market Hall (1884), the Unitarian Chapel (1884), the Fire Station (1889), the Waterworks (1898), and the School of Science and Art (1900). These changes and associated industrial expansion raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the 19th century.

A special plot was set aside in Newark Cemetery for RAF burials and this is now the war graves plot, where all but ten of the 90 Commonwealth and all of the 397 Polish burials were made. The cemetery also contains 49 scattered burials from the [[First World War]].

It stands on the [[River Trent]], the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] \u2013 on the route of the ancient [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] \u2013 and the [[East Coast Main Line]] railway. The origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], as it lies on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. The town grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place, now lined with historic buildings. It was a centre for the wool and cloth trades. In the [[English Civil War]], it was besieged by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary forces]] and [[Relief of Newark|relieved]] by [[Cavaliers|Royalist forces]] under [[Prince Rupert]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:UK NewarkonTrent.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost in Newark-on-Trent]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe place-name Newark is first attested in the [[Cartulary]] of [[Eynsham Abbey]] in Oxfordshire, where it appears as ''Newercha'' in about 1054\u20131057 and ''Niweweorche'' in about 1075\u20131092. It appears as ''Newerche'' in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]]. The name means 'New work', with the apparent meaning of \"New fort\".<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p. 339.</ref>\n\nThe origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], due to its position on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the [[Peterborough Cathedral|Abbey of Peterborough]] by King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]]. An [[Anglo-Saxon pagan]] cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent. There cremated remains were buried in pottery urns.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Millgate, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop [[Remigius de F\u00e9camp]]. After his death, control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. There were [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in Newark at the time of the [[Domesday]] survey, and in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] there is evidence that it had long been a [[borough]] by prescription. The [[Newark wapentake]] in the east of Nottinghamshire was established in the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] rule (10th\u201311th centuries).\n\n===Medieval to Stuart period===\n[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] was originally a [[Saxon]] fortified [[manor house]] founded by King Edward the Elder. In 1073, [[Robert Bloet]], Bishop of Lincoln, founded an [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[motte and bailey|motte-and-bailey]] fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] to establish a mint. [[John, King of England|King John]] died of [[dysentery]] in Newark Castle in 1216.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Greig |title=King John: Dysentery and the death that changed history |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111204955/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |archivedate=11 November 2017 |df=dmy-all|date=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town became a local centre for the wool and cloth trade \u2013 by the time of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] a major market was established.

The dissolution affected Newark's political landscape, and even more radical changes came in 1547, when the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] exchanged ownership of the town with the Crown. Newark was incorporated under an [[alderman]] and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] reincorporated the town under a [[mayor]] and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under [[James II of England|James II]], continued to govern the corporation until the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].\n\n===The Civil War===\n[[File:Siege piece shilling from Newark-on-Trent.JPG|thumb|right|A makeshift royalist [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]] (siege piece) made from silver plate during the siege]]\n{{See also|Relief of Newark|Siege money (Newark)}}\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Newark was a mainstay of the Royalist cause, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] having raised his standard in nearby [[Nottingham]]. \"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by [[Charles I of England|the King]] after his own surrender.\"<ref>[http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF Newark Civil War Trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195933/http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF |date=13 June 2011}}.</ref> It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided [[Nottingham]], [[Grantham]], [[Northampton]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. At the end of 1644 it was besieged by forces from Nottingham, [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Derby]], until relieved in March by [[Prince Rupert]].\n\nParliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]]. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Naseby]], near [[Leicester]] in June 1645.\n\nThe final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the [[Queen's Sconce]] to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2\u00bc miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in [[Sconce and Devon Park]].\n\n===Georgian era and early 19th century===\n[[File:Newark Castle and bridge London Published by J Deeley, 95 Bewick St Soho, 1812 Coloured aquatint.jpg|thumb|[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] c. 1812]]\nAround 1770 the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] around Newark (now the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr of York]] and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building. In 1775 the [[Duke of Newcastle]], at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today.\n\nA noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766\u20131799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the ''Nottinghamshire Historian'' journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9\u201315, with further detail in the autumn/winter edition of 2003, pp. 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).<ref>See the report in Cornelius BROWN 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the ''Times'' for 7 October 1829. A report in the ''Times'' of 10 September 1832 lists ten of the evicted people by name and address.</ref>\n\nJ. S. Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830\u20131840, contributed to ''The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax'' (London, 1904), a book about the [[Corn Laws]]: \"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\"\n\n===19th\u201321st centuries===\nMany new buildings and much industry appeared in the [[Victorian era]]. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836\u20131837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N. Nicholson Trent Ironworks (1840s), Northgate Railway Station (1851), North End Wesleyan Chapel (1868), St Leonard's Anglican Church (1873), the Baptist Chapel (1876), the Primitive Methodist Chapel (1878), [[Newark Hospital]] (1881), Ossington Coffee Palace (1882), Gilstrap Free Library (1883), the Market Hall (1884), the Unitarian Chapel (1884), the Fire Station (1889), the Waterworks (1898), and the School of Science and Art (1900). These changes and associated industrial expansion raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the 19th century.

A special plot was set aside in Newark Cemetery for RAF burials and this is now the war graves plot, where all but ten of the 90 Commonwealth and all of the 397 Polish burials were made. The cemetery also contains 49 scattered burials from the [[First World War]].

Earnings are 7 per cent above the average in the surrounding East Midlands.\n\n==Geography==\nNewark lies on the River Trent, with the [[River Devon, Nottinghamshire|River Devon]] also running through the town. Standing at the intersection of the Great North Road and the [[Fosse Way]], Newark originally grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place now lined with historic buildings.\n\nNewark forms a continuous built-up area with the neighbouring parish of [[Balderton]] to the south-east. To the south, along the [[A46 road]], is [[Farndon, Nottinghamshire|Farndon]], and to the north [[Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire|Winthorpe]].\n\nNewark's growth and development have both been enhanced by having one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the [[East Coast Main Line]] and the [[Nottingham]] to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] route. \"Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,\"<ref>Andrew Nicholson, [http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm ''Newark-on-Trent''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030075724/http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm |date=30 October 2009}} at Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway.</ref> though it industrialised to some extent in the Victorian era, and later with an ironworks, engineering, brewing, and a sugar refinery.\n\nThe A1 [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77611 bypass] was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, [[Ernest Marples]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1|title=The A1 By-Pass |website=Winthorpe Village, Nottinghamshire |accessdate=5 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043328/https://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1 |archivedate=28 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The single-carriageway, \u00a334-million A46 opened in October 1990.\n\n==Governance==\n{{main|Newark (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nNewark returned two representatives to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]] from 1673. It was the last borough to be created before the Reform Act. [[William Ewart Gladstone]], later [[Prime Minister]], became its [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, 1837 and 1841 (twice), but possibly due to his support of the [[repeal]] of the [[Corn Laws]] and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time.\n\nRecently, Newark elections have been central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to [[Harold Laski]], the Chairman of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led Laski to sue the ''[[Daily Express]]'' when it reported him as saying that Labour might take power through violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the libel action. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Newark returned [[Fiona Jones]] of the Labour Party. Jones and her election agent Des Whicher were convicted of submitting a fraudulent declaration of expenses, but the conviction was overturned on appeal.\n\nNewark's former MP<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27292214 |title=Helmer to fight Newark seat for UKIP|date=6 May 2014 |accessdate=5 May 2018 |via=www.bbc.co.uk |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210174625/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27292214 |archivedate=10 December 2014 |df=dmy-all|work=BBC News}}</ref> is [[Patrick Mercer]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].
