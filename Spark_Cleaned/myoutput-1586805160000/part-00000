She became a teacher, and was widowed when her husband Bedford Russell was killed in World War II. She remarried in 1946, with one son; her 1950 marriage to Art Wilkin, Jr. was her third.\n\nHer father, a baker, had been a fiddle player. From 1955 she toured with [[Red Foley]], and in 1956 her songs were recorded by [[Mitchell Torok]] and [[Wanda Jackson]]. In 1958, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and had major hits, written with [[John D. Loudermilk]], for [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] (the number one country hit \"[[Waterloo (Stonewall Jackson song)|Waterloo]]\", which made the pop top ten) and [[Jimmy C. Newman]].\n\nWilkin also wrote \"[[The Long Black Veil]]\" for [[Lefty Frizzell]] (with [[Danny Dill]]), \"[[Cut Across Shorty]]\" for [[Eddie Cochran]] (with Wayne P. Walker), and \"[[I Just Don't Understand]]\" which became a pop hit for  [[Ann-Margret]] and was covered by [[The Beatles]]. Although she was primarily a country songwriter, her songs have been recorded by several pop and rock acts, including [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Mick Jagger]]. Wilkin also recorded occasionally for [[Columbia Records]] and [[Dot Records]] in the 1960s and at times worked as a background vocalist.  he is billed simply as Marijohn on a few of her recordings. On DOT records, she recorded under the name Romi Spain.\n\nMarijohn Wilkin may be most famous for \"[[One Day at a Time (song)|One Day at a Time]]\", often considered the biggest gospel song of the 1970s. Wilkin wrote the song in 1973 with some assistance by her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Kris Kristofferson]]. The song won a [[Dove Award]] from the [[Gospel Music Association]] in 1975 (see also: [[Dove Award for Song of the Year]]). The song was a top 20 country single for [[Marilyn Sellars]] in 1974 and hit No. 37 on [[Billboard's Hot 100]] pop chart. It also launched a career as a gospel recording artist for Wilkin, who released several albums on [[Word Records]].  A remake became a No. 1 country hit for [[Cristy Lane]] in 1980 and has since been recorded more than 200 times.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=95996&messages=3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522071224/http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=95996&messages=3 |archive-date=2011-05-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Even though written as a personal worship song, it has also been recognized as \"One of the Top 50 Southern Gospel Songs.\" <ref name=CBN>{{cite book|last1=Terry|first1=Lindsay|title=Stories Behind 50 Southern Gospel Favorites|date=2005|publisher=Kregel Publications|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=9780825438851|pages=63\u201367|edition=First|url=http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/devotions/terry_one_day.aspx|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Johnny Duncan (country singer)|Johnny Duncan]] and [[Ed Bruce]] were among the many songwriters she helped get a foothold in the music business.
