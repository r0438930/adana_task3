The test used was [[Fisher's exact test]].\n\n== The experiment ==\n\nThe experiment provides a subject with 8 randomly ordered cups of tea &ndash; 4 prepared by first pouring the tea, then adding milk, 4 prepared by first pouring the milk, then adding the tea. The subject has to select 4 cups prepared by one method. Judging cups by direct comparison is allowed. The method employed in the experiment is fully disclosed to the subject.\n\nThe [[null hypothesis]] is that the subject has no ability to distinguish the teas. In Fisher's approach, there was no [[alternative hypothesis]],{{sfn|Fisher|1971|loc=Chapter II. The Principles of Experimentation, Illustrated by a Psycho-physical Experiment, Section 8. The Null Hypothesis}} unlike in the [[Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma|Neyman\u2013Pearson approach]].\n\nThe test statistic is a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups (the number of cups of the given type successfully selected). The distribution of possible numbers of successes, assuming the null hypothesis is true, can be computed using the number of combinations. Using the [[combination]] formula, with <math>n=8</math> total cups and <math>k=4</math> cups chosen, there are\n:<math>\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} = 70</math>\npossible combinations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Tea-Tasting Distribution Assuming the Null Hypothesis\n! scope=\"col\" | Success count\n! scope=\"col\" | Combinations of selection\n! scope=\"col\" | Number of Combinations\n|-\n| 0 || oooo || 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n|-\n| 1 || ooox, ooxo, oxoo, xooo || 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n|-\n| 2 || ooxx, oxox, oxxo, xoxo, xxoo, xoox || 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n|-\n| 3 || oxxx, xoxx, xxox, xxxo || 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n|-\n| 4 || xxxx || 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | Total\n| 70\n|}\n\nThe frequencies of the possible numbers of successes, given in the final column of this table, are derived as follows. For 0 successes, there is clearly only one set of four choices (namely, choosing all four incorrect cups) giving this result. For one success and three failures, there are four correct cups of which one is selected, which by the [[combination]] formula can occur in <math>\\binom 41 =4</math> different ways (as shown in column 2, with ''x'' denoting a correct cup that is chosen and ''o'' denoting a correct cup that is not chosen); and independently of that, there are four incorrect cups of which three are selected, which can occur in <math>\\binom 43 = 4</math> ways (as shown in the second column, this time with ''x'' interpreted as an incorrect cup which is not chosen, and ''o'' indicating an incorrect cup which is chosen). Thus a selection of any one correct cup and any three incorrect cups can occur in any of 4\u00d74 = 16 ways. The frequencies of the other possible numbers of successes are calculated correspondingly. Thus the number of successes is distributed according to the [[hypergeometric distribution]]. The distribution of combinations for making ''k'' selections out of the ''2k'' available selections corresponds to the ''k''th row of Pascal's triangle, such that each integer in the row is squared. In this case, <math>k = 4</math> because 4 teacups are selected from the 8 available teacups.\n\nThe critical region for rejection of the null of no ability to distinguish was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible, based on the conventional probability criterion <&nbsp;5%. This is the critical region because under the null of no ability to distinguish, 4 successes has 1 chance out of 70 (\u2248&nbsp;1.4% < 5%) of occurring, whereas at least 3 of 4 successes has a probability of (16+1)/70 (\u2248&nbsp;24.3% > 5%).\n\nThus, if and only if the lady properly categorized all 8 cups was Fisher willing to reject the null hypothesis &ndash; effectively acknowledging the lady's ability at a 1.4% significance level (but without quantifying her ability). Fisher later discussed the benefits of more trials and repeated tests.\n\n[[David Salsburg]] reports that a colleague of Fisher, [[H.
