However, during a high-pressure sales interview, Peter trades the boat for a mystery box, which turns out to contain tickets for a [[comedy club]]. At the club, Peter becomes drunk and attempts to tell jokes on stage. Before his brief performance, during which he mostly abuses the audience, he puts his beer bottle without the lid on in his pocket, which spills down his trousers, making it look like he wet himself. The audience, amused that Peter looks like he peed himself, laughs hysterically, making a drunk Peter to believe they liked his jokes. This leads Peter to believe his humor could be a hit.\n\nContinuing his [[hubris]], Peter tells a sexist joke at his job at the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory that offends female co-worker Sarah Bennett who sues Peter and the factory for sexual harassment. Her [[lawyer]], Gloria Ironbox, offers to drop the charges if Peter goes to a sensitivity-training program. But after he squeezes Gloria's breast which proves that the program has had no effect, he's further sent on a women's retreat, where he continues to make insensitive comments until he endures pain comparable to [[childbirth]]: taking his bottom lip and stretching it behind his head.\n\nBy the time he returns home, he has become very effeminate. At first, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] appreciates Peter's new sensitive nature, but she is soon tired of him spending more time in front of the mirror, doing pregnancy tests and scolding Lois for slavishly attending to her husband. She appeals to Peter's friends for help, even going to [[Glenn Quagmire]]'s house to confess that the \"new\" Peter is not meeting all her needs. Meanwhile, the other guys try to bring Peter back to normal by bringing him among his \"fellow men.\" [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] takes Peter to a black convention (a nod to the Million Man March) where Peter blames the assemblage for all the crime and problems and chides them that they should be ashamed for ruining society; they mistakenly believe he is a [[racist]] and chase him through the streets.\n\nBut when Peter and Lois attend a women's gala, Gloria insults Lois by saying that her current lifestyle is the reason for Peter's former disrespect for women. Lois reminds her that she is a woman and that she chooses to be a mother and housewife. When Gloria says Lois' children must be \"screwed up,\" Lois furiously punches her and they both get into a clothes-shredding [[catfight]] which turns Peter on. After Lois pins Gloria to the floor, Peter pulls Lois out and rushes her home to have [[sexual intercourse|sex]].  When they finish, Lois comments on how wonderful it was. Her voice startles Peter as he has already forgotten that she is still there, but since she is, he asks her to make him a sandwich. This pleases Lois because it means he is back to his old self.\n\n==Reception==\nIn his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]], rating the episode an 8.5/10, stated that the episode is \"cleverly written\" and features \"a couple of the best scenes in the entire series\".
