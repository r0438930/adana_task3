Despite having a larger range than the [[red ruffed lemur]], it has a much smaller population that is spread out, living in lower [[Population density|population densities]] and [[Reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]]. It also has less coverage and protection in large [[List of national parks of Madagascar|national parks]] than the red ruffed lemur.

Smaller percentages of leaves, nectar, seeds, and even fungi make up the remainder. Their diet is also influenced by the seasons, with certain plant parts and fruits only ripening or becoming available during certain times of the year. Water consumption also varies throughout the year and can be influenced by diet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Adam|title=Diet and Feeding Behaviour of the Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur (Varecia variegata variegata) in the Betampona Reserve, Eastern Madagascar|journal=Folia Primatologica|date=2000|volume=71|issue=3|pages=133\u2013141|doi=10.1159/000021741|pmid=10828690}}</ref> The number of tree species utilized by for food by the lemurs can range from 19-40 species depending on location. The larger part of fruit items in the diet is provided by four taxa of fruit trees: ''[[Ravensara]]'' species, ''[[Chrysophyllum boivinianum]]'', ''[[Protorhus]]'' species, and ''[[Harungana madagascariensis]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Balko|first1=Elizabeth A.|last2=Underwood|first2=H.

The rest of which is spent mostly on nectar and various other forage.  In general most male black and white ruffed lemurs will eat less than a female will during the hot dry seasons of [[Madagascar]]. Another difference between the diet of male and female ruffed lemurs is that when a female is pregnant and also lactating she will eat significantly more flowers and leaves than the male in order to supply her offspring and the high energy cost of reproduction. Studies recording ruffed lemurs in captivity and in the wild over the course of a year show that ruffed lemurs on an average spend around 28% of their time feeding, 53% resting, and the last 19% socializing and moving about.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Female dominance===\n\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs demonstrate the rare behavior of female social dominance both within and outside the context of feedings. This is also found in other ruffed lemurs as well as in ring-tailed lemurs and red ruffled lemurs. Aggressive interactions between males and females are usually won by the female even when they do not show aggressive behavior towards the male. Unlike other species of lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemur females occasionally show submission and more aggression needs to be maintained in order for the female to win the interaction instead of having an undecided interaction. Male aggression does not vary among seasons.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/fwhite/Rapps%20and%20White.pdf|author1=Raps, Stefan|author2=White, Frances J.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Female Social Dominance in Semi-Free-Ranging Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia Variegata'')|pmid=8792616|year=1995|volume=65|issue=3|pages=163\u20138|journal=Folia Primatologica|doi=10.1159/000156883|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915052023/http://pages.uoregon.edu/fwhite/Rapps%20and%20White.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOne of the main reasons that black-and-white ruffed lemurs exhibit dominance is for feeding purpose; that is they are able to establish priority over males in feeding. Reproductive females need more access to food because of the costs of carrying and caring for offspring which is why they establish this feeding priority. Energy demands in this species are particularly high. Female dominance in feeding is maintained through demonstrating some aggressive behavior and leading the group to food in order to have first access to the food. Dominance is not thought to be established in younger females so groups lacking a mature female may not have a dominant female. When a dominant female is present, she leads the group to the food source and eats more than the rest of the group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/erhart/contentParagraph/0/content_files/file5/Overdorff_et_al_2005.pdf |author=Overdorff, Deborah J. |author2=Erhart, Elizabeth M. |author3=Mutschler, Thomas |last-author-amp=yes |title=Does Female Dominance Facilitate Feeding Priority in Black-and-white Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia variegata'') in Southeastern Madagascar?|pmid=15898069|year=2005|volume=66|issue=1|pages=7\u201322|doi=10.1002/ajp.20125|journal=American Journal of Primatology}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\n\nThe black-and-white ruffed lemur demonstrates several different call types each of which last several seconds. Most lemurs of a group participate in any one chorus. These lemurs are particularly known for their loud roar/shriek choruses which have several purposes including group movement, spacing among different groups, and alarming other members of the group of predators. Unlike the calls of other species, the calls of the black-and-white ruffed lemur are not likely to be for the establishment of territory for a group. The calling behavior is participated in throughout the course of a day, not concentrated at any one point of the day; however calls are usually not heard at night.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://gibbons.de/main/non-gibbon/pdf_files/2006indri_varecia.pdf |author1=Geissmann, Thomas  |author2=Mutschler, Thomas  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Diurnal Distribution of Loud Calls in Sympatric Wild Indris (''Indri indri'') and Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia variegata''): Implications for Call Functions|pmid=16736264|year=2006|volume=47|issue=4|pages=393\u20136|doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0189-5|journal=Primates; Journal of Primatology}}</ref>\n\n===Interspecific interactions===\n\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs are known to form a natural hybrid zone with the red-ruffed lemur. This zone may have once been very large before humans came into contact with the two subspecies.

Groups have been shown to exhibit a range of [[Fission\u2013fusion society|fission fusion]] dynamics, meaning that group size can fluctuate based on resource availability. When resources (e.g. food) are plentiful, the environment can support a larger group of lemurs, but when resources are scarce, the group may split into smaller sub-groups to survive. The sub-groups can rejoin and split as needed with environmental and social cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baden|first=Andrea L.|last2=Webster|first2=Timothy H.|last3=Kamilar|first3=Jason M.|year=2016|title=Resource Seasonality and Reproduction Predict Fission\u2013Fusion Dynamics in Black-and-White Ruffed Lemurs (Varecia variegata)|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=78|issue=2|pages=256\u2013279|via=|doi=10.1002/ajp.22507|pmid=26606154}}</ref> Parenting in this species of lemurs is unique in that no single infant is invested in but instead, females bear litters of multiple offspring. Males also play a role in the parenting of the offspring especially in smaller groups where the certainty of paternity is high. In larger groups, the chance of a female mating with more than one male increases as does uncertainty in paternity. This tends to decrease the level of male care of offspring. Instead of clinging to the mother, offspring are placed into a nest which is guarded by both parents, described in detail below.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Kappeler | editor1-first = P.

Males exhibit testicular enlargement as they mature, which gradually increases over the months leading to their breeding window. After successfully breeding with a female, the male's testicles gradually reduce back to normal. When females become sexually mature and enter [[Estrous cycle#Estrus|estrus]] during the breeding season, their vagina begins to open slightly, starting with a small pink dot and line, which is easily visible because the skin around the vulva is black. The pink area gradually opens over the course of several days. Once fully opened, vaginal estrus lasts 2\u20133 days. During this time, there is an even smaller window of time (6\u201312 hours) when the female is in behavioral estrus, and breeding is only possible during this period. After breeding, the female's vulva gradually closes and remains black and closed for the remainder of the year. Gestation lasts an average of 102.5 days and typically results in a litter of 2-6 offspring that are unable to cling to their mother, as in other primates. The female builds a nest where infants remain until they can leave it on their own. For the first 2 weeks after birth, the female stays with the infants nearly 24 hours a day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foerg|first=R.|year=1982|title=Reproductive behavior in Varecia variegata.|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=38|issue=1\u20132|pages=108\u2013121|via=|doi=10.1159/000156047|pmid=7201444}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=ME|last2=Seeligson|first2=ML|last3=Macedonia|first3=JM|year=1988|title=The behavioral repertoire of the black-and-white ruffed lemur, Varecia variegata variegata (Primates: Lemuridae).|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1\u201332|via=|doi=10.1159/000156353|pmid=3251818}}</ref> Both males and females will guard the nest.

Smaller percentages of leaves, nectar, seeds, and even fungi make up the remainder. Their diet is also influenced by the seasons, with certain plant parts and fruits only ripening or becoming available during certain times of the year. Water consumption also varies throughout the year and can be influenced by diet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Adam|title=Diet and Feeding Behaviour of the Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur (Varecia variegata variegata) in the Betampona Reserve, Eastern Madagascar|journal=Folia Primatologica|date=2000|volume=71|issue=3|pages=133\u2013141|doi=10.1159/000021741|pmid=10828690}}</ref> The number of tree species utilized by for food by the lemurs can range from 19-40 species depending on location.

The rest of which is spent mostly on nectar and various other forage.  In general most male black and white ruffed lemurs will eat less than a female will during the hot dry seasons of [[Madagascar]]. Another difference between the diet of male and female ruffed lemurs is that when a female is pregnant and also lactating she will eat significantly more flowers and leaves than the male in order to supply her offspring and the high energy cost of reproduction. Studies recording ruffed lemurs in captivity and in the wild over the course of a year show that ruffed lemurs on an average spend around 28% of their time feeding, 53% resting, and the last 19% socializing and moving about.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Female dominance===\n\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs demonstrate the rare behavior of female social dominance both within and outside the context of feedings. This is also found in other ruffed lemurs as well as in ring-tailed lemurs and red ruffled lemurs. Aggressive interactions between males and females are usually won by the female even when they do not show aggressive behavior towards the male. Unlike other species of lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemur females occasionally show submission and more aggression needs to be maintained in order for the female to win the interaction instead of having an undecided interaction. Male aggression does not vary among seasons.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/fwhite/Rapps%20and%20White.pdf|author1=Raps, Stefan|author2=White, Frances J.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Female Social Dominance in Semi-Free-Ranging Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia Variegata'')|pmid=8792616|year=1995|volume=65|issue=3|pages=163\u20138|journal=Folia Primatologica|doi=10.1159/000156883|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915052023/http://pages.uoregon.edu/fwhite/Rapps%20and%20White.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOne of the main reasons that black-and-white ruffed lemurs exhibit dominance is for feeding purpose; that is they are able to establish priority over males in feeding. Reproductive females need more access to food because of the costs of carrying and caring for offspring which is why they establish this feeding priority. Energy demands in this species are particularly high. Female dominance in feeding is maintained through demonstrating some aggressive behavior and leading the group to food in order to have first access to the food. Dominance is not thought to be established in younger females so groups lacking a mature female may not have a dominant female. When a dominant female is present, she leads the group to the food source and eats more than the rest of the group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/erhart/contentParagraph/0/content_files/file5/Overdorff_et_al_2005.pdf |author=Overdorff, Deborah J. |author2=Erhart, Elizabeth M. |author3=Mutschler, Thomas |last-author-amp=yes |title=Does Female Dominance Facilitate Feeding Priority in Black-and-white Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia variegata'') in Southeastern Madagascar?|pmid=15898069|year=2005|volume=66|issue=1|pages=7\u201322|doi=10.1002/ajp.20125|journal=American Journal of Primatology}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\n\nThe black-and-white ruffed lemur demonstrates several different call types each of which last several seconds. Most lemurs of a group participate in any one chorus. These lemurs are particularly known for their loud roar/shriek choruses which have several purposes including group movement, spacing among different groups, and alarming other members of the group of predators. Unlike the calls of other species, the calls of the black-and-white ruffed lemur are not likely to be for the establishment of territory for a group. The calling behavior is participated in throughout the course of a day, not concentrated at any one point of the day; however calls are usually not heard at night.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://gibbons.de/main/non-gibbon/pdf_files/2006indri_varecia.pdf |author1=Geissmann, Thomas  |author2=Mutschler, Thomas  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Diurnal Distribution of Loud Calls in Sympatric Wild Indris (''Indri indri'') and Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia variegata''): Implications for Call Functions|pmid=16736264|year=2006|volume=47|issue=4|pages=393\u20136|doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0189-5|journal=Primates; Journal of Primatology}}</ref>\n\n===Interspecific interactions===\n\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs are known to form a natural hybrid zone with the red-ruffed lemur.

Groups have been shown to exhibit a range of [[Fission\u2013fusion society|fission fusion]] dynamics, meaning that group size can fluctuate based on resource availability. When resources (e.g. food) are plentiful, the environment can support a larger group of lemurs, but when resources are scarce, the group may split into smaller sub-groups to survive. The sub-groups can rejoin and split as needed with environmental and social cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baden|first=Andrea L.|last2=Webster|first2=Timothy H.|last3=Kamilar|first3=Jason M.|year=2016|title=Resource Seasonality and Reproduction Predict Fission\u2013Fusion Dynamics in Black-and-White Ruffed Lemurs (Varecia variegata)|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=78|issue=2|pages=256\u2013279|via=|doi=10.1002/ajp.22507|pmid=26606154}}</ref> Parenting in this species of lemurs is unique in that no single infant is invested in but instead, females bear litters of multiple offspring. Males also play a role in the parenting of the offspring especially in smaller groups where the certainty of paternity is high. In larger groups, the chance of a female mating with more than one male increases as does uncertainty in paternity. This tends to decrease the level of male care of offspring. Instead of clinging to the mother, offspring are placed into a nest which is guarded by both parents, described in detail below.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Kappeler | editor1-first = P.

Males exhibit testicular enlargement as they mature, which gradually increases over the months leading to their breeding window. After successfully breeding with a female, the male's testicles gradually reduce back to normal. When females become sexually mature and enter [[Estrous cycle#Estrus|estrus]] during the breeding season, their vagina begins to open slightly, starting with a small pink dot and line, which is easily visible because the skin around the vulva is black. The pink area gradually opens over the course of several days. Once fully opened, vaginal estrus lasts 2\u20133 days. During this time, there is an even smaller window of time (6\u201312 hours) when the female is in behavioral estrus, and breeding is only possible during this period. After breeding, the female's vulva gradually closes and remains black and closed for the remainder of the year. Gestation lasts an average of 102.5 days and typically results in a litter of 2-6 offspring that are unable to cling to their mother, as in other primates. The female builds a nest where infants remain until they can leave it on their own. For the first 2 weeks after birth, the female stays with the infants nearly 24 hours a day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foerg|first=R.|year=1982|title=Reproductive behavior in Varecia variegata.|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=38|issue=1\u20132|pages=108\u2013121|via=|doi=10.1159/000156047|pmid=7201444}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=ME|last2=Seeligson|first2=ML|last3=Macedonia|first3=JM|year=1988|title=The behavioral repertoire of the black-and-white ruffed lemur, Varecia variegata variegata (Primates: Lemuridae).|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1\u201332|via=|doi=10.1159/000156353|pmid=3251818}}</ref> Both males and females will guard the nest.
