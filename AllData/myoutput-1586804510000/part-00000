Serials typically follow main [[story arc]]s that span entire [[television season]]s or even the full run of the series, which distinguishes them from traditional episodic television that relies on more stand-alone episodes. Worldwide, the [[soap opera]] is the most prominent form of serial [[dramatic programming]].\n\nSerials rely on keeping the full nature of the story hidden and revealing elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more. Often these shows employ [[recapping]] segments at the beginning and [[cliffhanger]]s at the end of each episode. Such shows also place a demand on viewers to tune in to every episode to follow the plot.<ref name=\"nyt070724\">{{cite news | author = Alessandra Stanley | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/arts/television/24stan.html?fta=y | title = Smile and Smile and Still Be a Villain  | date = July 24, 2007 |work=The New York Times | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> The invention of recording devices such as [[VCR]]s and [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]] has made following this type of show easier, which has resulted in increased success and popularity. Prior to the advent of DVRs, television networks shunned serials in prime time as they made [[broadcast programming]] [[rerun]]s more difficult and television producers shunned them because they were tougher to go into [[broadcast syndication]] years down the road.\n\nSerials contrast with episodic television, with plots relying on a more independent stand-alone format. [[Procedural drama]] television programs are commonly episodic.<ref name=\"NYTimesEpisodic\">{{cite news|last=Hale|first=Mike|title=The, Yes, Upside of Broadcast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/arts/television/the-new-season-the-upside-of-broadcast-tv.html|accessdate=January 7, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|last=Poniewozik|first=James|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2008/12/04/i-have-seen-dollhouse/|title=Tuned In|date=December 4, 2008|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=December 6, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"ct090227\"/>\n\nShorter serial programs known as [[telenovela]]s (and earlier, [[radionovela]]s), originating and often produced in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking [[Latin America]], have become popular worldwide.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"serial\" refers to the intrinsic property of a series{{spaced ndash}}namely its [[sequence|order]]. In literature, the term is used as a noun to refer to a format (within a [[genre]]) by which a story is told in contiguous (typically [[chronological]]) installments in sequential issues of a single [[periodical]] publication.\n\nMore generally, \"serial\" is applied in [[library and information science]] to materials \"in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.\"<ref name=\"Reitz\">Reitz, Joan M. (2004). [http://lu.com/odlis/odlis_s.cfm ''Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science'']. Retrieved March 15, 2006</ref>\n\nThe term has been used for a radio or television production with a continuously evolving, unified plot and set of characters, spread over multiple episodes.  In the United States, daytime soap operas have long had a serial structure. Television [[mini-series]] also commonly come in a serial form. Starting in the mid-1970s, series with soap opera-like stories began to be aired in prime time (e.g. ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''). In the 1990s, shows like ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' began to use a more serial structure, and now there are a much wider range of shows in serial form.<ref>Jason Mittell. 2015.

With the emergence of television and subsequent decline of the movie-going audience, production of movie serials ceased due to the decreasing revenues. But the serial lived on, moving instead to the small screen and the world of [[Broadcast syndication]] television [[rerun]]s.\n\n===Soap operas===\nThe television serial format as known today originated in radio, in the form of children's adventure shows and daily 15-minute programs known as ''soap operas'' (so-called because many of these shows were [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by soap companies, such as [[Colgate-Palmolive]] and [[Procter & Gamble]]). Soap operas were specifically engineered to appeal to women (with the intention of increasing sale of soap). They usually ran from Monday through Friday at exactly the same time every day. A show called The Smith Family which ran only one night a week on WENR in Chicago during the early 1930s was credited as the \"great-granddaddy of the soap operas\" by radio historian Francis Chase, Jr. One of the other shows that helped pioneer the daytime soap opera/serial was ''The [[Guiding Light]]'', which debuted on [[NBC]] radio in 1937, and then switched to [[CBS]] Television in 1952. ''The Guiding Light''{{'s}} final episode aired on September 18, 2009, having a total of 15,762 episodes air on CBS. Some of the characters in soap operas have been portrayed as long-suffering (a common theme even in some of today's serials along with the social and economical issues of the day). Children's adventure serials were more like [[film serial]]s, with continuing characters involved in exploits with episodes that often ended in a cliffhanger situation; [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] were a particularly popular format for children's serials on the radio.\n\n''Guiding Light'' and such other daytime television program serials such as ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', ''[[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]]'', ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and ''[[All My Children]]'' were popular in the Golden and Silver Ages of television and still are today.\n\nAside from the social issues, the style and presentation of these shows have changed. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s the drama was underscored with traditional organ music, and in the 1970s and the 1980s a full orchestra provided the score, the daytime dramas of today use cutting-edged synth-driven music (in a way, music for soaps has come full-circle, from the keyboard to the keyboard).\n\nThe nighttime serials are a different story, though the concept is also nothing new. In the 1960s, ABC aired the first real breakthrough nighttime serial, ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', inspired by the novel and theatrical film of the same name. After its cancellation, the format went somewhat dormant until Norman Lear produced ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]'' in 1976. In 1977, ABC created another comedy soap (aptly called ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]''). Although the show was controversial for its time (with a homosexual character among its cast roster), it was (and still is today) a cult classic.\n\nThe success of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' popularized serial storylines on prime-time television. Its end-of-season [[cliffhanger]]s, such as \"[[Who shot J. R.?]]\" and \"Bobby in the Shower?\",<ref name=\"marshall201810\">{{Cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Max |date=2018-09-19 |title=\u2018Dallas\u2019 at 40: The Inside Story Behind the Show That Changed Texas Forever |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/dallas-at-40-the-inside-story-behind-the-show-that-changed-texas-forever/ |magazine=Texas Monthly |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> influenced other shows like ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (ABC's answer to ''Dallas''), ''[[Knots Landing]]'', ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[The Colbys]]'', ''[[Flamingo Road (TV series)|Flamingo Road]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[The Yellow Rose]]'', ''[[Bare Essence]]'', and ''[[Berrenger's]]''. There were some serial shows such as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' that did not officially fit into this category, but were nonetheless ratings hits season after season.\n\nWhile the last of the 1980s nighttime soaps ended during the first years of the following decade, then a second wave came with series like ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Models, Inc.]]'', ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'' and ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]''. But as the 1990s came to a close, the primetime soap as an official format gradually faded away, where it largely seems to remain as of the middle of the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.\n\n===Other dramas===\nSerialized storytelling can also be seen in other dramas. Heavily serialized dramas include  '' [[Star Trek Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Babylon 5]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'', and ''[[Downton Abbey]]''. Series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Streets]]'', ''[[The Good Wife]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]'' fall somewhere in-between, featuring a new case each week that is solved by the end of the episode, but also having an overarching mystery that receives focus in many episodes. The more serialized its storytelling, the less likely a show is to fare well in repeats. The format places a demand on episodes to be run in order, without which story arcs stretching over many episodes may be difficult for new viewers to delve into. ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' also falls into the category while each season involves a new mystery that spans an entire season (and on one occasion, half the season) while planting hints throughout the episodes until the climax in the finale.\n\nTo a lesser extent, series such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''<ref name=\"hybrid\">{{cite news | author = Rob Owen | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09032/943438-67.stm | title = Fox's 'House' celebrates its 100th episode | date = February 1, 2009 | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | accessdate = February 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"procedural at its core\">{{cite news | author = Michael Ausiello | url = http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | title = Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Grey's,' 'House,' 'Big Love,' 'Fringe,' 'NCIS,' '24,' 'Gossip Girl,' 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Heroes,' 'Smallville,' and more! | date = February 11, 2009 | work = Entertainment Weekly | accessdate = February 12, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110628171858/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | archivedate = June 28, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''<ref name=\"fringe\">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/oct/10/jjabrams-ustelevision | title = JJ Abrams live webchat here | date = October 10, 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate = February 2, 2009  | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}</ref> may also feature ongoing story arcs, but episodes are more self-encapsulated and so the series fall into a more conventional drama category. ''Fringe'' has experimented with \"myth-alones\", a hybrid that attempts to advance the story arc in a self-contained episode.<ref name=\"comiccon\"/>\n\nIn addition, it has been noted that the use of [[cliffhanger]]s is still prevalent in adventure shows; however, they are now typically used just before a commercial break and the viewer need only wait a few minutes to see its resolution. In addition, many series have also made extensive use of the traditional end-of-episode cliffhanger format. This is most common in [[season finale]]s which often end in a cliffhanger that would only be resolved in the next season's premiere.\n\nOver the course of its run, a show may change its focus. Matt Cherniss, executive vice president of programming at Fox says: \"Sometimes early on, being a little more episodic allows more people into the room. And as the show goes on, by its nature, it might find itself becoming a little more serialized.\"<ref name=\"ct090227\">{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/has-tv-lost-its-nerve-when-it-comes-to-complex-dramas.html | title = Has TV lost its nerve when it comes to complex dramas? | date = February 27, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> Early in their runs, shows such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',<ref name=\"ct090227\"/> ''Buffy'', ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''<ref name=\"indep090515\">{{cite news | author = Sarah Hughes | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html | title = Buffy's creator makes his valley of the dolls  | date = May 15, 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate = May 16, 2009 }}</ref> and ''[[Torchwood]]'' put greater emphasis on the \"story-of-the-week\", but over time story arcs begin to dominate.

Worldwide, the [[soap opera]] is the most prominent form of serial [[dramatic programming]].\n\nSerials rely on keeping the full nature of the story hidden and revealing elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more.

In literature, the term is used as a noun to refer to a format (within a [[genre]]) by which a story is told in contiguous (typically [[chronological]]) installments in sequential issues of a single [[periodical]] publication.\n\nMore generally, \"serial\" is applied in [[library and information science]] to materials \"in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.\"<ref name=\"Reitz\">Reitz, Joan M. (2004). [http://lu.com/odlis/odlis_s.cfm ''Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science'']. Retrieved March 15, 2006</ref>\n\nThe term has been used for a radio or television production with a continuously evolving, unified plot and set of characters, spread over multiple episodes.  In the United States, daytime soap operas have long had a serial structure. Television [[mini-series]] also commonly come in a serial form. Starting in the mid-1970s, series with soap opera-like stories began to be aired in prime time (e.g. ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''). In the 1990s, shows like ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' began to use a more serial structure, and now there are a much wider range of shows in serial form.<ref>Jason Mittell. 2015.

NYU Press. {{ISBN|9780814769607}}</ref>\n{{see also|Radio drama|Television program}}\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe serial beginning with the advent of\n[[Film|movie serials]] of the early 20th century. With the emergence of television and subsequent decline of the movie-going audience, production of movie serials ceased due to the decreasing revenues. But the serial lived on, moving instead to the small screen and the world of [[Broadcast syndication]] television [[rerun]]s.\n\n===Soap operas===\nThe television serial format as known today originated in radio, in the form of children's adventure shows and daily 15-minute programs known as ''soap operas'' (so-called because many of these shows were [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by soap companies, such as [[Colgate-Palmolive]] and [[Procter & Gamble]]). Soap operas were specifically engineered to appeal to women (with the intention of increasing sale of soap). They usually ran from Monday through Friday at exactly the same time every day. A show called The Smith Family which ran only one night a week on WENR in Chicago during the early 1930s was credited as the \"great-granddaddy of the soap operas\" by radio historian Francis Chase, Jr. One of the other shows that helped pioneer the daytime soap opera/serial was ''The [[Guiding Light]]'', which debuted on [[NBC]] radio in 1937, and then switched to [[CBS]] Television in 1952. ''The Guiding Light''{{'s}} final episode aired on September 18, 2009, having a total of 15,762 episodes air on CBS. Some of the characters in soap operas have been portrayed as long-suffering (a common theme even in some of today's serials along with the social and economical issues of the day). Children's adventure serials were more like [[film serial]]s, with continuing characters involved in exploits with episodes that often ended in a cliffhanger situation; [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] were a particularly popular format for children's serials on the radio.\n\n''Guiding Light'' and such other daytime television program serials such as ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', ''[[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]]'', ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and ''[[All My Children]]'' were popular in the Golden and Silver Ages of television and still are today.\n\nAside from the social issues, the style and presentation of these shows have changed. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s the drama was underscored with traditional organ music, and in the 1970s and the 1980s a full orchestra provided the score, the daytime dramas of today use cutting-edged synth-driven music (in a way, music for soaps has come full-circle, from the keyboard to the keyboard).\n\nThe nighttime serials are a different story, though the concept is also nothing new. In the 1960s, ABC aired the first real breakthrough nighttime serial, ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', inspired by the novel and theatrical film of the same name. After its cancellation, the format went somewhat dormant until Norman Lear produced ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]'' in 1976. In 1977, ABC created another comedy soap (aptly called ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]''). Although the show was controversial for its time (with a homosexual character among its cast roster), it was (and still is today) a cult classic.\n\nThe success of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' popularized serial storylines on prime-time television. Its end-of-season [[cliffhanger]]s, such as \"[[Who shot J. R.?]]\" and \"Bobby in the Shower?\",<ref name=\"marshall201810\">{{Cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Max |date=2018-09-19 |title=\u2018Dallas\u2019 at 40: The Inside Story Behind the Show That Changed Texas Forever |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/dallas-at-40-the-inside-story-behind-the-show-that-changed-texas-forever/ |magazine=Texas Monthly |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> influenced other shows like ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (ABC's answer to ''Dallas''), ''[[Knots Landing]]'', ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[The Colbys]]'', ''[[Flamingo Road (TV series)|Flamingo Road]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[The Yellow Rose]]'', ''[[Bare Essence]]'', and ''[[Berrenger's]]''. There were some serial shows such as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' that did not officially fit into this category, but were nonetheless ratings hits season after season.\n\nWhile the last of the 1980s nighttime soaps ended during the first years of the following decade, then a second wave came with series like ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Models, Inc.]]'', ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'' and ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]''. But as the 1990s came to a close, the primetime soap as an official format gradually faded away, where it largely seems to remain as of the middle of the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.\n\n===Other dramas===\nSerialized storytelling can also be seen in other dramas. Heavily serialized dramas include  '' [[Star Trek Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Babylon 5]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'', and ''[[Downton Abbey]]''. Series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Streets]]'', ''[[The Good Wife]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]'' fall somewhere in-between, featuring a new case each week that is solved by the end of the episode, but also having an overarching mystery that receives focus in many episodes. The more serialized its storytelling, the less likely a show is to fare well in repeats. The format places a demand on episodes to be run in order, without which story arcs stretching over many episodes may be difficult for new viewers to delve into. ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' also falls into the category while each season involves a new mystery that spans an entire season (and on one occasion, half the season) while planting hints throughout the episodes until the climax in the finale.\n\nTo a lesser extent, series such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''<ref name=\"hybrid\">{{cite news | author = Rob Owen | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09032/943438-67.stm | title = Fox's 'House' celebrates its 100th episode | date = February 1, 2009 | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | accessdate = February 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"procedural at its core\">{{cite news | author = Michael Ausiello | url = http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | title = Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Grey's,' 'House,' 'Big Love,' 'Fringe,' 'NCIS,' '24,' 'Gossip Girl,' 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Heroes,' 'Smallville,' and more! | date = February 11, 2009 | work = Entertainment Weekly | accessdate = February 12, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110628171858/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | archivedate = June 28, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''<ref name=\"fringe\">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/oct/10/jjabrams-ustelevision | title = JJ Abrams live webchat here | date = October 10, 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate = February 2, 2009  | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}</ref> may also feature ongoing story arcs, but episodes are more self-encapsulated and so the series fall into a more conventional drama category. ''Fringe'' has experimented with \"myth-alones\", a hybrid that attempts to advance the story arc in a self-contained episode.<ref name=\"comiccon\"/>\n\nIn addition, it has been noted that the use of [[cliffhanger]]s is still prevalent in adventure shows; however, they are now typically used just before a commercial break and the viewer need only wait a few minutes to see its resolution. In addition, many series have also made extensive use of the traditional end-of-episode cliffhanger format. This is most common in [[season finale]]s which often end in a cliffhanger that would only be resolved in the next season's premiere.\n\nOver the course of its run, a show may change its focus. Matt Cherniss, executive vice president of programming at Fox says: \"Sometimes early on, being a little more episodic allows more people into the room. And as the show goes on, by its nature, it might find itself becoming a little more serialized.\"<ref name=\"ct090227\">{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/has-tv-lost-its-nerve-when-it-comes-to-complex-dramas.html | title = Has TV lost its nerve when it comes to complex dramas? | date = February 27, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> Early in their runs, shows such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',<ref name=\"ct090227\"/> ''Buffy'', ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''<ref name=\"indep090515\">{{cite news | author = Sarah Hughes | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html | title = Buffy's creator makes his valley of the dolls  | date = May 15, 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate = May 16, 2009 }}</ref> and ''[[Torchwood]]'' put greater emphasis on the \"story-of-the-week\", but over time story arcs begin to dominate.
