Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south;[b] Iran to the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to the north; and China to the northeast. Occupying 652,000 square kilometers (252,000 sq mi), it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest. Kabul is the capital and largest city. The population is around 32 million, mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks. Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era, and the country's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns, including those by Alexander the Great, Mauryas, Muslim Arabs, Mongols, British, Soviets, and by the United States with allied countries. The land also served as the source from which the Kushans, Hephthalites, Samanids, Saffarids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Khaljis, Mughals, Hotaks, Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires. The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century, with Ahmad Shah Abdali being considered as the founder of the state. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the \"Great Game\" between British India and the Russian Empire. Its border with British India, the Durand Line, was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter's independence in 1947.[13][14] In the First Anglo-Afghan War, the British East India Company seized control of Afghanistan briefly, but following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence, eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan, until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established. In 1978, after a second coup Afghanistan first became a socialist state and then a Soviet protectorate. This evoked the Soviet\u2013Afghan War in the 1980s against mujahideen rebels. By 1996 most of Afghanistan was captured by the Islamic fundamentalist group the Taliban, who ruled as a totalitarian regime for over five years. Following the 9/11 attacks, an intervention by the US and its allies forcibly removed the Taliban from power, and a new democratically-elected government was formed, but the Taliban still control a significant portion of the country. Afghanistan is a unitary presidential Islamic republic. The country has high levels of terrorism, poverty, child malnutrition, and corruption. It is a member of the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Group of 77, the Economic Cooperation Organization, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018. \n\n'''Albania''' (/\u00e6l\u02c8be\u026ani\u0259, \u0254\u02d0l-/ (About this soundlisten) a(w)l-BAY-nee-\u0259; Albanian: Shqip\u00ebri or Shqip\u00ebria; Gheg Albanian: Shqipni or Shqipnia also Shqypni or Shqypnia),[6] officially the Republic of Albania (Albanian: Republika e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb, pronounced [\u027e\u025bpu\u02c8blika \u025b \u0283cip\u0259\u02c8\u027ei\u02d0s\u0259]), is a country in Southeast Europe on the Adriatic and Ionian Sea within the Mediterranean Sea. It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo[a] to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece, Montenegro and Italy to the west. Geographically, the country displays varied climatic, geological, hydrological and morphological conditions, defined in an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi). It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab, Skanderbeg, Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea. Historically, the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians, Thracians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Venetians and Ottomans. The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century. The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries. Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century, the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe. Between the 18th and 19th centuries, Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance. After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars, the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912.[7] In the 20th century, the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany.[8] Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation. The Revolutions of 1991 concluded the fall of communism in Albania and eventually the establishment of the current Republic of Albania. Politically, the country is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic and developing country with an upper-middle income economy dominated by the service sector, followed by manufacturing.[9] It went through a process of transition, following the end of communism in 1990, from centralized planning to a market-based economy.[10][11][12] Albania provides universal health care and free primary and secondary education to its citizens.[5] The country is a member of the United Nations, World Bank, UNESCO, NATO, WTO, COE, OSCE and OIC. It is an official candidate for membership in the European Union.[13] It is one of the founding members of the Energy Community, including the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and Union for the Mediterranean.  \n\n'''Algeria''' (/\u00e6l\u02c8d\u0292\u026a\u0259ri\u0259/ (About this soundlisten) al-JEER-ee-\u0259), officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. The capital and most populous city is Algiers, located in the far north of the country on the Mediterranean coast. With an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), Algeria is the tenth-largest country in the world, and the largest by area in the African Union and the Arab world.[10] With an estimated population of over 43 million, it is the eighth-most populous country in Africa. Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia, to the east by Libya, to the southeast by Niger, to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and the Western Saharan territory, to the west by Morocco, and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. It is a semi-presidential republic consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes (counties). Pre-1962 Algeria has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient Numidians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Idrisid, Aghlabid, Rustamid, Fatimids, Zirid, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads, Zayyanids, Spaniards, Ottomans and finally, the French colonial empire. Algeria is a regional and middle power. It has the highest human development index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the 16th largest oil reserves in the world and the second largest in Africa, while it has the ninth largest reserves of natural gas. Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe. Algeria has one of the largest militaries in Africa and the largest defence budget. It is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member. \n\n'''Andorra''' (/\u00e6n\u02c8d\u0254\u02d0r\u0259/ (About this soundlisten), also UK: /\u00e6n\u02c8d\u0252r\u0259/;[11] Catalan: [\u0259n\u02c8dor\u0259]), officially the Principality of Andorra (Catalan: Principat d'Andorra), also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra[12] (Catalan: Principat de les Valls d'Andorra), is a sovereign landlocked microstate on the Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern Pyrenees, bordered by France to the north and Spain to the south. Believed to have been created by Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell. The present principality was formed by a charter in 1278. It is known as a principality as it is a diarchy headed by two princes: the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain, and the President of the French Republic. Andorra is the sixth-smallest nation in Europe, having an area of 468 square kilometres (181 sq mi) and a population of approximately 77,006.[13][14] The Andorran people are a Romance ethnic group of originally Catalan descent.[15] Andorra is the 16th-smallest country in the world by land and the 11th-smallest by population.[16] Its capital, Andorra la Vella, is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of 1,023 metres (3,356 feet) above sea level.[17] The official language is Catalan, but Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.[2][18] Tourism in Andorra sees an estimated 10.2 million visitors annually.[19] Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is its official currency. It has been a member of the United Nations since 1993.[20] In 2013, Andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at 81 years, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study.[21] \n\n'''Angola''' (/\u00e6n\u02c8\u0261o\u028al\u0259/ (About this soundlisten); Portuguese: [\u0250\u0303\u02c8\u0261\u0254l\u0250]), officially the Republic of Angola (Portuguese: Rep\u00fablica de Angola), is a country on the west coast of Southern Africa. It is the seventh-largest country in Africa, bordered by Namibia to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Zambia to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Angola has an exclave province, the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda. The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era, hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups, tribes and kingdoms. The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation, which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the Kwanyama and the Mbunda. After a protracted anti-colonial struggle, independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist\u2013Leninist People's Republic of Angola, a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba. The civil war between the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa, lasted until 2002. The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary, presidential constitutional republic. Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves, and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war; however, the standard of living remains low for most of the population, and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world, while infant mortality is among the highest.[5] Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small sector of the population.[6] Angola is a member state of the United Nations, OPEC, African Union, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, and the Southern African Development Community. A highly multiethnic country, Angola's 25.8 million people span tribal groups, customs, and traditions. Angolan culture reflects centuries of Portuguese rule, in the predominance of the Portuguese language and of the Catholic Church. \n\n'''Antigua and Barbuda''' (/\u00e6n\u02c8ti\u02d0\u0261(w)\u0259\u2009...\u2009b\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8b(j)u\u02d0d\u0259/ (About this soundlisten); an-TEE-g(w)\u0259 ... bar-B(Y)OO-d\u0259) is an island sovereign state in the West Indies in the Americas, lying between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It consists of two major islands, Antigua and Barbuda (separated by 39 miles), and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guiana, Long, Maiden, Prickly Pear, York Islands and further south, the island of Redonda). The permanent population numbers about 95,900 (2018 est.), with 97% being resident on Antigua.[1] The capital and largest port and city is St. John's on Antigua, with Codrington being the largest town on Barbuda. Lying near each other (the main Barbuda airport is less than 0.5\u00b0 of latitude, or 56 kilometres (30 nautical miles), north of the main Antigua airport), Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the Leeward Islands, part of the Lesser Antilles, roughly at 17\u00b0N of the equator. The island of Antigua was explored by Christopher Columbus in 1493 and named for the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda La Antigua.[6] Antigua was colonized by Britain in 1632; Barbuda island was first colonised in 1678.[6] Antigua and Barbuda joined the West Indies Federation in 1958.[7] With the breakup of the federation, it became one of the West Indies Associated States in 1967.[8] Following by self-governing on its internal affairs, independence was granted from United Kingdom on 1 November 1981. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Commonwealth and Elizabeth II is the country's queen and head of state.[9] In September 2017, Hurricane Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of Barbuda's buildings and infrastructure and as a result, all the island's inhabitants were evacuated to Antigua, leaving Barbuda empty for the first time in modern history.[10] \n\n'''Argentina''' (Spanish: [a\u027exen\u02c8tina]), officially the Argentine Republic[A] (Spanish: Rep\u00fablica Argentina), is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi),[B] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the fourth largest in the Americas, the second largest in South America after Brazil, and the largest Spanish-speaking nation. The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (Spanish: provincias, singular provincia) and one autonomous city (ciudad aut\u00f3noma), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation (Spanish: Capital Federal) as decided by Congress.[17] The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas), and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period.[18] The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times. The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century.[19] Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata,[20] a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. The declaration and fight for independence (1810\u20131818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration, mainly Italians and Spaniards, radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry,[11][21] and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture.[22] The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest nation in the world by the early 20th century.[23][24][25] Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, Argentina descended into political instability and economic decline that pushed it back into underdevelopment,[26] though it remained among the fifteen richest countries for several decades.[23] Following the death of President Juan Per\u00f3n in 1974, his widow, Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n, ascended to the presidency. She was overthrown in 1976 by a U.S.-backed coup which installed a right-wing military dictatorship. The military government persecuted and murdered numerous political critics, activists, and leftists in the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism that lasted until the election of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn as President in 1983. Several of the junta's leaders were later convicted of their crimes and sentenced to imprisonment. Argentina is a developing country and ranks 48th on the Human Development Index, the second highest in Latin America after Chile.[16] It is a regional power in Latin America and retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs.[27][28][29] Argentina maintains the second largest economy in South America, the third-largest in Latin America, and is a member of G-15 and G-20. It is also a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization, Mercosur, Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States. \n\n'''Armenia''' (/\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8mi\u02d0ni\u0259/ (About this soundlisten);[16] Armenian: \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576, romanized: Hayastan, IPA: [h\u0251j\u0251s\u02c8t\u0251n]), officially the Republic of Armenia (Armenian: \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0540\u0561\u0576\u0580\u0561\u057a\u0565\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576, romanized: Hayastani Hanrapetut'yun, IPA: [h\u0251j\u0251st\u0251\u02c8ni h\u0251n\u027e\u0251p\u025btut\u02b0\u02c8jun]), is a landlocked country in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia,[17][18] on the Armenian Highlands, it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, the de facto independent Republic of Artsakh and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.[19]\nArmenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage. Urartu was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of Armenia. The Kingdom of Armenia reached its height under Tigranes the Great in the 1st century BC and became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD.[20][21][22] The official date of state adoption of Christianity is 301.[23] The ancient Armenian kingdom was split between the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires around the early 5th century. Under the Bagratuni dynasty, the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia was restored in the 9th century. Declining due to the wars against the Byzantines, the kingdom fell in 1045 and Armenia was soon after invaded by the Seljuk Turks. An Armenian principality and later a kingdom Cilician Armenia was located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea between the 11th and 14th centuries. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia came under the rule of the Ottoman and Iranian empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the Russian Empire, while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule. During World War I, Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, all non-Russian countries declared their independence after the Russian Empire ceased to exist, leading to the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, and in 1922 became a founding member of the Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into full Union republics. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Armenia recognises the Armenian Apostolic Church, the world's oldest national church, as the country's primary religious establishment.[24][5] The unique Armenian alphabet was invented by Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD. Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, the Council of Europe and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Armenia supports the de facto independent Artsakh, which was proclaimed in 1991. \n\n'''Australia''', officially the '''Commonwealth of Australia''', is a [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] country comprising the mainland of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]], the island of [[Tasmania]], and numerous [[List of islands of Australia|smaller islands]].

While [[German language|German]] is the country's [[official language]], many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]]. Austria initially emerged as a [[Margraviate of Austria|margraviate]] around 976 and developed into a [[Duchy of Austria|duchy]] and [[Archduchy of Austria|archduchy]]. In the 16th century, Austria started serving as the heart of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the junior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] \u2013 one of the most influential [[Royal house|royal dynasties]] in history. As an archduchy, it was a major component and administrative centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Early in the 19th century, Austria established [[Austrian Empire|its own empire]], which became a [[great power]] and the leading force of the [[German Confederation]] but pursued its own course independently of the other German states. Following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|compromise]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] was established. Austria was involved in [[World War I]] under Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] following the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne. After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy, the [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed with the intent of the union with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], which eventually failed because of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] and the state remained unrecognized. In 1919 the [[First Austrian Republic]] became the legal successor of [[Cisleithania|Austria]]. In 1938, the Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]], who became the [[German Chancellor|Chancellor]] of the [[German Reich]], achieved the annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] by the [[Anschluss]]. Following the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945 and an extended period of Allied occupation, Austria was re-established as a sovereign and self-governing democratic nation known as the Second Republic. Austria is a [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a directly elected Federal [[President of Austria|President]] as head of state and a [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] as head of the federal government.

The [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, [[Iran]] to the south and west, and has an 11 km (6.8 mi) long border with [[Turkey]] in the northwest. The [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became the first secular democratic Muslim-majority state. In 1920 the country was incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]] as the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991, shortly before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]] in the same year. In September 1991, the Armenian majority of the disputed [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region seceded to form the [[Republic of Artsakh]]. The region and [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|seven adjacent districts outside it]] became ''de facto'' independent with the end of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] in 1994. These regions are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh through negotiations facilitated by the [[OSCE]]. Azerbaijan is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]]. It is one of six independent [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries#Current%20independent%20states|Turkic states]] and an active member of the [[Turkic Council]] and the [[International Organization of Turkic Culture|T\u00dcRKSOY]] community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries and holds membership in 38 international organizations, including the [[United Nations]] (since 1992), the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and the [[NATO]] [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) program. It is one of the founding members of [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development|GUAM]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]]. Azerbaijan also holds observer status in the [[World Trade Organization]]. While more than 89% of the population is [[Shia Muslim]], the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]] does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are [[Secularism|secularist]]. Azerbaijan has a high level of human development according to the [[Human Development Index]]. It has a high rate of [[economic development]] and [[Literacy rate|literacy]], as well as a low rate of [[List of countries by unemployment rate|unemployment]]. However, the ruling party, the [[New Azerbaijan Party]], has been accused of authoritarianism and [[Human rights in Azerbaijan|human rights abuses]]. \n\n'''The Bahamas''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0259\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0m\u0259z/]] (listen)), known officially as the '''Commonwealth of The Bahamas''', is a country within the [[Lucayan Archipelago]] in the [[West Indies]]. It is a member of the [[Commonwealth Realms]] under the monarchy of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The [[archipelagic state]] consists of fewer than 700 [[Island|islands]], [[Cay|cays]], and [[Islet|islets]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and is located north of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] Island ([[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]), northwest of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], southeast of the [[United States|US]] state of [[Florida]], and east of the [[Florida Keys]]. The capital is [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on the island of [[New Providence]]. The [[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]] describes The Bahamas' territory as encompassing 470,000 km<sup>2</sup> (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space. The Bahamas were inhabited by the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], a branch of the [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Ta\u00edno people]], for many centuries. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] was the first European to see the islands, making his first landfall in the '[[New World]]' in 1492. Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]] shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on [[Hispaniola]], after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]]. The Bahamas became a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[crown colony]] in 1718, when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] to The Bahamas; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in The Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the [[Royal Navy]], while some [[Slavery in North America|North American slaves]] and [[Seminole|Seminoles]] escaped to The Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognise the freedom of slaves carried by the ships of other nations which reached The Bahamas. Today [[Afro-Bahamians]] make up 90% of the population of 332,634. The Bahamas gained governmental independence in 1973 led by Sir Lynden O. Pindling, with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of The Bahamas|its queen]]. In terms of [[gross domestic product]] per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the [[Americas]] (following the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), with an economy based on tourism and offshore finance. \n\n'''Bahrain''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0251\u02d0\u02c8re\u026an/]] (listen); [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646\u200e ''''al-Ba\u1e25rayn'''' <small>Arabic pronunciation:</small> [[Help:IPA/Arabic|[al ba\u0127rajn]]] (listen)), officially the '''Kingdom of Bahrain''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646\u200e ''Mamlakat al-Ba\u1e25rayn''), is a [[sovereign state]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The [[Island country|island nation]] comprises a small [[archipelago]] made up of 33 natural islands and an additional 51 [[Artificial island|artificial islands]], centered around [[Bahrain Island]] which makes up around 83 percent of the country's landmass. The country is situated between the Qatar peninsula and the north eastern coast of [[Saudi Arabia]], to which it is connected by the 25-kilometre (16 mi) [[King Fahd Causeway]]. According to the most recent 2010 census, Bahrain's population is over 1.2 million, of which around half are non-nationals. At 780 square kilometres (300 sq mi) in size, it is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|third-smallest nation]] in Asia after the [[Maldives]] and [[Singapore]]. The capital and largest city is [[Manama]]. Bahrain is the site of the ancient [[Dilmun civilization]]. It has been famed since antiquity for its [[pearl fisheries]], which were considered the best in the world into the 19th century. Bahrain was one of the earliest areas to convert to [[Islam]], in 628 AD. Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was ruled by the [[Portuguese Empire]] from 1521 until 1602, following the conquest by [[Shah]] [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] of the [[Safavid dynasty]] under the [[Persian Empire]]. In 1783, the [[Bani Utbah]] clan captured Bahrain from [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]] and it has since been ruled by the [[House of Khalifa|Al Khalifa royal family]], with [[Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Khalifa|Ahmed al Fateh]] as Bahrain's first [[Hakim (title)#In%20Arab%20countries|''hakim'']]. Formerly an [[emirate]], Bahrain was declared an Islamic [[constitutional monarchy]] in 2002. In the late 1800s, following successive treaties with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], Bahrain became a [[protectorate]] of the United Kingdom. In 1971, it [[Independence Day (Bahrain)|declared independence]]. In 2011, the country experienced [[Bahraini uprising of 2011|protests]] inspired by the regional [[Arab Spring]]. Bahrain's ruling al-Khalifa royal family has been accused and criticized for [[Human rights in Bahrain|human rights abuses]], including imprisonment, torture and execution of dissidents, political opposition figures and its majority [[Shia in Bahrain|Shia Muslim population]]. Bahrain developed the first post-oil economy in the [[Persian Gulf]], the result of decades of investing in the [[banking]] and [[tourism]] sectors; many of the world's largest financial institutions have a presence in the country's capital. It subsequently has a high [[Human Development Index]] and is recognised by the [[World Bank]] as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]]. Bahrain is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[Arab League]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]. \n\n'''Bangladesh''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02ccb\u00e6\u014bl\u0259\u02c8d\u025b\u0283/]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6, <small>pronounced</small> [[Help:IPA/Bengali|[\u02c8ba\u014bla\u02ccde\u0283]]] (listen); literally meaning ''The Country of Bengal''), officially called the '''People's Republic of Bangladesh''' (\u0997\u09a3\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u099c\u09be\u09a4\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09c0 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6 ''[[Romanisation of Bengali#Romanisation%20reference|G\u00f4noprojatontri Bangladesh]]''), is a country in [[South Asia]]. It is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|eighth-most populous country]] in the world, with a population exceeding 161 million people. In terms of land mass, Bangladesh ranks [[List of countries and dependencies by area|92nd]], spanning 147,570 square kilometres (56,980 sq mi), making it one of the most [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|densely-populated]] countries in the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with [[India]] to the west, north, and east, [[Myanmar]] to the southeast, and the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the south. It is narrowly separated from [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] by India's [[Siliguri Corridor]], and from [[China]] by the Indian state of [[Sikkim]], in the north, respectively. [[Dhaka]], the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political and cultural hub. [[Chittagong]], the [[Port of Chittagong|largest sea port]], is the second largest city. With numerous criss-crossing rivers and inland waterways, the dominant geographic feature of Bangladesh is the [[Ganges delta]], which empties into the [[Bay of Bengal]] with the combined waters of several [[River system|river systems]], including the [[Brahmaputra river]] and the [[Ganges river]]. [[List of mountains in Bangladesh|Highlands]], with evergreen forests, cover the northeastern and southeastern regions, while the country's [[biodiversity]] comprises a vast array of plants and wildlife, including the endangered [[Bengal tiger|Royal Bengal tiger]], which is the [[National symbols of Bangladesh|national animal]]. The seacoast features the world's longest natural sandy beach in [[Cox's Bazar]] as well as the [[Sundarbans]], which is the world's largest mangrove forest. Bangladesh forms the larger and eastern part of the [[Bengal]] region. According to the ancient sacred Indian texts, ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Vanga Kingdom]], one of the namesakes of the [[Bengal]] region, was a strong naval ally of the [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary Ayodhya]]. In the ancient and classical period of the [[Indian subcontinent]], the territory was home to many principalities, including the [[Pundravardhana|Pundra]], [[Gangaridai]], [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]], [[Samatata]] and [[Harikela]]. It was also a [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan province]] under the reign of [[Ashoka]]. The principalities were notable for their overseas trade, contacts with the Roman world, export of fine [[Muslin trade in Bengal|muslin]] and silk to the Middle East, and spreading of philosophy and art to Southeast Asia. The [[Pala Empire]], the [[Chandra dynasty]], and the [[Sena dynasty]] were the last pre-Islamic Bengali [[Middle kingdoms of India|middle kingdoms]]. [[Islam]] was introduced during the [[Pala Empire]], through trade with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], but following the early conquest of [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and preaching of [[Shah Jalal]] in East Bengal, the faith fully spread across the region. In 1576, the wealthy [[Bengal Sultanate]] was absorbed into the [[Mughal Empire]], but its rule was briefly interrupted by the [[Suri Empire]]. Following the death of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in the early 1700s, the [[Proto-industrialization|proto-industrialised]] [[Mughal Bengal]] became a semi-independent state under the [[Nawabs of Bengal]]. The region was later conquered by the [[British East India Company]] at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757. The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the separation of [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Bengal]] and [[Partition of India|India]] in August 1947, when the region became [[East Pakistan]] as a part of the newly formed [[Dominion of Pakistan|State of Pakistan]], demarcated by the ''Boundary of the Partition of India''. Later the rise of the [[Bengali nationalist]] and self-determination movement led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation War]] and eventually resulted in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign and independent nation in 1971. Speakers of the official [[Bengali language]], who form the [[Bengalis|Bengali]] ethnic group, make up 98% of the population. Bangladesh is created on the basis of language and ethnicity. Its large Muslim population makes Bangladesh the [[Islam by country|fourth-largest Muslim-majority country in the world]]. The constitution declares Bangladesh a [[Secular state|secular]], Muslim-majority country. A [[middle power]], Bangladesh is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[constitutional republic]] following the [[Westminster system]] of governance. The country is divided into [[Divisions of Bangladesh|eight administrative divisions]] and [[Districts of Bangladesh|sixty-four districts]]. Although the country continues to face the challenges of the [[Rohingya genocide|Rohingya refugee crisis]], [[Corruption in Bangladesh|corruption]] and the adverse effects of [[Climate change in Bangladesh|climate change]], it is one of the [[emerging and growth-leading economies]] of the world. Bangladesh is also one of the [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley#Next%20Eleven|Next Eleven]] countries, with one of the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest real GDP growth rates]] in the world. Its [[gross domestic product]] is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|39th]] largest in terms of market [[exchange rates]], and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|29th]] in [[purchasing power parity]]. Bangladesh's [[per capita income]] ranks [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|143th]] nominally and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|136th]] by [[purchasing power parity]]. In recent years Bangladesh has registered notable success in reducing [[child mortality]]; [[population control]]; combating natural disasters; women's empowerment; using [[microcredit]] to alleviate poverty; and boosting income through the [[Textile industry in Bangladesh|export of textiles]], garments, pharmaceuticals, manpower, agricultural produce, shrimps, jute, leather goods, seafood, tea, etc. Bangladesh is one of the few countries that achieved most of the 2015 [[Millennium Development Goals]] set by the [[United Nations|UN]] ahead of time. As a result of this and many other factors the [[World Bank]] upgraded the status of Bangladesh to a middle-income country. \n\n'''Barbados''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8be\u026ad\u0252s/]] (listen) or [[Help:IPA/English|/-do\u028as/]]) is an [[island country]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]] of the [[West Indies]], in the [[Caribbean]] region of [[North America]]. It is 34 kilometres (21 miles) in length and up to 23 km (14 mi) in width, covering an area of 432 km<sup>2</sup> (167 sq mi). It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and 100 km (62 mi) east of the [[Windward Islands]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]; therein, Barbados is east of the Windwards, part of the Lesser Antilles, roughly at [[13th parallel north|13\u00b0N]] of the [[equator]]. It is about 168 km (104 mi) east of both the countries of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and 180 km (110 mi) south-east of [[Martinique]] and 400 km (250 mi) north-east of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Barbados is outside the principal Atlantic [[hurricane belt]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Bridgetown, Barbados|Bridgetown]]. Inhabited by [[Island Caribs|Kalinago]] people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other [[Amerindian|Amerindians]], Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]]. It first appeared in a Spanish map in 1511. [[The Portuguese Empire]] claimed the island between 1532 and 1536, but later abandoned it in 1620; with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited, and to replenish their supply of freshwater. An English ship, the ''Olive Blossom'', arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625; its men took possession of it in the name of [[James VI and I|King James I]]. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and it became an [[English overseas possessions|English]] and later [[British colonisation of the Americas#British%20Caribbean%20colonies|British colony]]. As a wealthy sugar colony, it became an English centre of the [[African slave trade]] until that trade was outlawed in [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807]], with final emancipation of slaves in Barbados occurring over a period of years from [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|1833]]. On 30 November 1966, Barbados became an independent state and [[Commonwealth realm]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Barbados|its queen]]. It has a population of 287,010 people, predominantly of African descent. Despite being classified as an Atlantic island, Barbados is considered to be a part of the Caribbean, where it is ranked as a leading tourist destination. Of the tourists, 40% come from the UK, with the US and Canada making up the next large groups of visitors to the island.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\n'''Belarus''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u025bl\u0259\u02c8ru\u02d0s/]]; [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c, <small>IPA:</small> [[Help:IPA/Belarusian|[b\u02b2\u025bla\u02c8rus\u02b2]]]), officially the '''Republic of Belarus''' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: \u0420\u044d\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c, [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c), formerly known by its [[Russian language|Russian]] name '''Byelorussia''' or '''Belorussia''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Eastern Europe]] bordered by [[Russia]] to the northeast, [[Ukraine]] to the south, [[Poland]] to the west, and [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is [[Minsk]]. Over 40% of its 207,600 square kilometres (80,200 sq mi) is forested. Its major economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the [[Principality of Polotsk]] (11th to 14th centuries), the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. In the aftermath of the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], different states arose competing for legitimacy amidst the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], ultimately ending in the rise of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Byelorussian SSR) which became a founding [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]] in 1922. Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the [[Second Polish Republic]] were reintegrated into it after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], and were finalized after World War II. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the [[United Nations]], along with the Soviet Union and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The parliament of the republic proclaimed the [[sovereignty]] of Belarus on 27 July 1990, and during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Belarus declared independence on 25 August 1991. In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, forming the [[Union State]]. [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has served as the country's first president since 1994. Belarus has been labeled \"Europe's last dictatorship\" by some Western journalists, on account of Lukashenko's self-described [[authoritarian]] style of government. Lukashenko continued a number of Soviet-era policies, such as [[state ownership]] of large sections of the [[Economy of Belarus|economy]]. [[Elections in Belarus|Elections under Lukashenko's rule]] have been widely criticized as unfair; and according to many countries and organizations, political opposition has been violently suppressed. Belarus is also the last country in Europe using the [[Capital punishment in Belarus|death penalty]]. Belarus's [[Democracy Index]] rating is the lowest in Europe, the country is labelled as \"not free\" by [[Freedom House]], as \"repressed\" in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]], and is rated as by far the worst country for [[press freedom]] in Europe in the [[Press Freedom Index|2013\u201314 Press Freedom Index]] published by [[Reporters Without Borders]], which ranks Belarus 157th out of 180 nations. Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49 million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], with sizable minorities of [[Russians]], [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The second-most widespread religion, [[Catholic Church in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]], has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as [[Public holidays in Belarus|national holidays]]. Belarus is a member of the [[United Nations]] since its founding, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|CSTO]], [[Eurasian Economic Union|EEU]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the [[European Union]] but nevertheless maintains a [[Belarus\u2013European Union relations|bilateral relationship with the organisation]], and likewise participates in two EU projects: the [[Eastern Partnership]] and the [[Baku Initiative]].\n\n'''Belgium''', officially the '''Kingdom of Belgium''', is a country in [[Western Europe]]. It is bordered by the [[Netherlands]] to the north, [[Germany]] to the east, [[Luxembourg]] to the southeast, [[France]] to the southwest, and the [[North Sea]] to the northwest. It covers an area of 30,689 km<sup>2</sup> (11,849 sq mi) and has a population of more than 11.5 million, making it the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|22nd most densely populated]] country in the world and the [[Area and population of European countries|6th most densely populated]] country in Europe, with a density of 376 per square kilometre (970/sq mi). The capital and largest city is [[Brussels City|Brussels]]; other major cities are [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Charleroi]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Legally, Belgium is a [[sovereign state]] and a [[Federation|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]]. Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds. It is divided into three highly [[autonomous]] [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|regions]]: the [[Flemish Region]] in the north, [[Wallonia]] in the south, and the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]]. Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region, as well as the richest region in terms of [[GDP per capita]]. Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or ''[[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities]]'': the Dutch-speaking [[Flemish Community]], which constitutes about 60 percent of the population, and the [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking Community]], which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians. A small [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]], numbering around one percent, exists in the [[East Cantons]]. The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual (French and Dutch), although French is the dominant language. Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its [[History of Belgium|political history]] and [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|complex system of governance]], made up of [[List of governments in Belgium|six different governments]]. Historically, Belgium is part of an area known as the [[Low Countries]], a somewhat larger region than the current [[Benelux]] group of states that also included parts of northern France and western Germany. Its modern name is derived from the Latin word ''Belgium'', used in [[Julius Caesar]]'s \"[[Gallic War]]\", to describe the region in the period around 55 BCE. From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan center of commerce and culture. Between the 16th and early 19th centuries, Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, earning the moniker the \"Battlefield of Europe\", a reputation strengthened by both [[World war|world wars]]. The country emerged in 1830 following the [[Belgian Revolution]] when it seceded from the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. Belgium participated in the [[Industrial Revolution]] and, during the course of the 20th century, possessed [[Belgian overseas colonies|a number of colonies in Africa]]. The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fueled by [[Culture of Belgium|differences in language and culture]] and the [[North-South divide in Belgium|unequal economic development]] of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has led to several [[State reform in Belgium|far-reaching reforms]], resulting in a transition from a [[Unitary state|unitary]] to a [[Federalism|federal]] arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups have remained, if not increased; there is significant separatism particularly [[Flemish Movement|among the Flemish]]; controversial language laws exist such as the [[municipalities with language facilities]]; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|June 2010 federal election]], a world record. Unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders, which boomed after the war. Belgium is one of the six founding countries of the [[European Union]] and its capital, Brussels, hosts the official seats of the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]], and the [[European Council]], as well as one of two seats of the [[European Parliament]] (the other being [[Strasbourg]]). Belgium is also a founding member of the [[Eurozone]], [[NATO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], and [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union and the [[Schengen Area]]. Brussels hosts several of the EU's official seats as well as the headquarters of many major international organizations such as NATO. Belgium is a [[developed country]], with an advanced [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]]. It has very high standards of [[Standard of living|living]], [[quality of life]], [[Health care|healthcare]], [[education]], and is categorized as \"very high\" in the [[Human Development Index]].

Belize is bordered on the northwest by [[Mexico]], on the east by the [[Caribbean Sea]], and on the south and west by [[Guatemala]]. It has an area of 22,970 square kilometres (8,867 sq mi) and a population of 408,487 (2019). Its mainland is about 290 km (180 mi) long and 110 km (68 mi) wide. It has the lowest population and [[population density]] in Central America. The country's population growth rate of 1.87% per year (2018 estimate) is the second highest in the region and one of the [[List of countries by population growth rate|highest in the Western Hemisphere]]. The [[Mayan civilization|Maya Civilization]] spread into the area of Belize between 1500 B.C. and A.D. 300 and flourished until about 1200. European contact began in 1502 when [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed along the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. European exploration was begun by English settlers in 1638. This period was also marked by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] both laying claim to the land until Britain defeated the Spanish in the [[Battle of St. George's Caye]] (1798). It became a British colony in 1840, known as [[British Honduras]], and a [[Crown colony]] in 1862. Independence was achieved from the [[United Kingdom]] on 21 September 1981. Belize has a diverse society that is composed of many cultures and languages that reflect its rich history. [[English language|English]] is the official language of Belize, while [[Belizean Creole]] is the most widely spoken [[national language]], being the native language of over a third of the population. Over half the population is [[multilingual]], with Spanish being the second most common spoken language. It is known for its [[September Celebrations]], its extensive barrier reef [[Coral reef|coral reefs]] and [[Punta|punta music]]. Belize's abundance of terrestrial and marine species and its diversity of ecosystems give it a key place in the globally significant [[Mesoamerican Biological Corridor]]. It is considered a Central American and [[Caribbean]] nation with strong ties to both the American and Caribbean regions. It is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CELAC), and the [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA), the only country to hold full membership in all three regional organizations.

It is bordered by [[Togo]] to [[Benin\u2013Togo border|the west]], [[Nigeria]] to [[Benin\u2013Nigeria border|the east]], [[Burkina Faso]] to [[Benin-Burkina Faso border|the north-west]], and [[Niger]] to [[Benin\u2013Niger border|the north-east]]. The majority of its population lives on the small southern coastline of the [[Bight of Benin]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the northernmost tropical portion of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The capital of Benin is [[Porto-Novo]], but the [[seat of government]] is in [[Cotonou]], the country's largest city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometres (44,310 sq mi) and its population in 2018 was estimated to be approximately 11.49 million. Benin is a [[tropical]] nation, highly dependent on [[agriculture]], and is a large exporter of [[cotton]] and [[palm oil]]. Substantial employment and income arise from [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]]. The [[official language]] of Benin is [[French language|French]], with several indigenous languages such as [[Fon language|Fon]], [[Bariba language|Bariba]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Dendi language|Dendi]] also being commonly spoken. The largest religious group in Benin is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], followed closely by [[Islam]], [[Vodun]] (commonly referred to as Voodoo outside the country) and [[Protestants|Protestantism]]. Benin is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], the [[South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]], the [[Community of Sahel\u2013Saharan States]], the [[African Petroleum Producers Association]] and the [[Niger Basin Authority]]. Little is known of Benin's early history. From the 17th to the 19th century, the main political entities in the area were the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], along with the city-state of [[Porto-Novo]], and a large area with many different nations to the north. This region was referred to as the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of enslaved people who were shipped to the New World during the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. After enslavement was abolished, France took over the country and renamed it [[French Dahomey]]. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France. The [[sovereign state]] has had a tumultuous history since then, with many different democratic governments, military coups, and military governments. A [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]] called the [[People's Republic of Benin]] existed between 1975 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by the current [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] Republic of Benin. \n\n'''Bhutan''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/bu\u02d0\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0n/]] (listen); [[Dzongkha language|Dzongkha]]: \u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f61\u0f74\u0f63\u0f0b, <small>[[Romanization of Dzongkha|romanized]]:</small> ''[[Druk]] Yul'' [[Help:IPA|[\u0288uk\u031a\u02e9.y\u02d0\u02e9]]]), officially the '''Kingdom of Bhutan''' ([[Dzongkha language|Dzongkha]]: \u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f56\u0f0b, <small>[[Romanization of Dzongkha|romanized]]:</small> ''Druk Gyal Khap''), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[South Asia]]. Located in the [[Eastern Himalaya|Eastern Himalayas]], it is bordered by the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]] in the north, the [[Chumbi Valley]] of Tibet, China and the Indian states of Sikkim and [[West Bengal]] in the west, and the Indian states of [[Assam]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the south and east. Bhutan is geopolitically in [[South Asia]] and is the region's second-least-populous nation after the [[Maldives]]. [[Thimphu]] is its capital and largest city, while [[Phuntsholing]] is its financial center. Bhutan's independence has endured for centuries. It has never been colonized in [[History of Bhutan|its history]]. Situated on the ancient [[Silk Road]] between Tibet, the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]], the Bhutanese state developed a distinct [[Culture of Bhutan|national identity]] based on [[Buddhism]]. Headed by a spiritual leader known as the [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]], the territory comprised many [[Fief|fiefdoms]] and was governed as a Buddhist theocracy. Following a civil war in the 19th century, the [[House of Wangchuck]] reunited the country and established relations with the [[British Empire]]. After the end of the [[British Raj]], Bhutan fostered a strategic partnership with India during the rise of Chinese communism; it has a disputed border with China. In the early 1990s, the government deported much of the country's [[Nepali language|Nepali-speaking]] [[Lhotsampa]] minority, sparking a refugee crisis in nearby [[Nepal]]. In 2008, Bhutan transitioned from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]] and held the first election to the [[National Assembly (Bhutan)|National Assembly of Bhutan]]. The National Assembly is part of the bicameral parliament of the [[Bhutanese democracy]]. The country's landscape ranges from lush subtropical plains in the south to the sub-alpine Himalayan mountains in the north, where there are peaks higher than 7,000 metres (23,000 ft). [[Gangkhar Puensum]] is Bhutan's highest peak and may also be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The [[wildlife of Bhutan]] is notable for its diversity. In South Asia, Bhutan ranks first in [[Index of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]], [[Ease of doing business index|ease of doing business]], and [[Global Peace Index|peace]], and is the [[Corruption Perceptions Index|least corrupt country]] in the region as of 2016. It continues to be a [[Least Developed Countries|least developed country]], but expects to graduate from this status by 2023. Hydroelectricity accounts for most of its exports. [[Politics of Bhutan|The government]] is a parliamentary democracy; the head of state is the [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck|King of Bhutan]], known as the \"[[Druk Gyalpo|Dragon King]].\" Bhutan maintains diplomatic relations with 52 countries and the [[European Union]], but does not have formal ties with the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation|BIMSTEC]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. The [[Royal Bhutan Army]] maintains a close relationship with the [[Indian Armed Forces]].Bhutan is also notable for pioneering the concept of [[Gross National Happiness|gross national happiness]]. \n\n'''Bolivia''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0259\u02c8l\u026avi\u0259/]] (listen) <small>Spanish pronunciation:</small> [[Help:IPA/Spanish|[bo.\u02c8li.\u03b2ja]]]), officially the '''Plurinational State of Bolivia''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia'' <small>Spanish pronunciation:</small> [[Help:IPA/Spanish|[es\u02c8ta\u00f0o plu\u027einasjo\u02c8nal de \u03b2o\u02c8li\u03b2ja]]] (listen)), is a [[landlocked country]] located in western-central [[South America]]. The constitutional capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and executive capital is [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country. The [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With 1,098,581 km<sup>2</sup> (424,164 sq mi) of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]]. The country's population, estimated at 11 million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo|Mestizos]], [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous languages]] also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]]. Before Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]]. After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The%20Banzer%20regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[Left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001. Modern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]]. Bolivia remains the second poorest country in South America. It is a [[developing country]], with a medium ranking in the [[Human Development Index]] and a poverty level of 38.6%. Its main economic activities include [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fishing]], [[mining]], and [[manufacturing]] goods such as textiles, clothing, refined metals, and [[Oil refinery|refined petroleum]]. Bolivia is very [[Geology of Bolivia|rich in minerals]], including [[tin]], [[silver]], and [[lithium]]. \n\n'''Bosnia and Herzegovina''', abbreviated '''BiH''' or '''B&H''', sometimes called '''Bosnia\u2013Herzegovina''' and [[Pars pro toto#Geography|often known informally as]] '''Bosnia''', is a country in [[Southern Europe|South]] and [[Southeast Europe]], located within the [[Balkans]]. [[Sarajevo]] is the capital and largest city. Bosnia and Herzegovina is not entirely a [[landlocked country]] as it may appear on a map \u2013 to the south it has a narrow coast on the [[Adriatic Sea]], which is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) long and surrounds the town of [[Neum]]. It is bordered by [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, and [[Croatia]] to the north and southwest. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and in the northeast predominantly flatland. The inland, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, [[Herzegovina]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and mostly mountainous topography. Bosnia and Herzegovina was settled at least from [[Upper Palaeolithic]] and has preserved prehistoric art found in [[Badanj Cave|Badanj cave]]. The permanent human settlement traces back to the [[Neolithic]] age, inhabited by cultures such as [[Butmir culture|Butmir]], [[Kakanj culture|Kakanj]], and [[Vu\u010dedol culture|Vu\u010dedol]]. After arrival of the first [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] it was populated by several [[Illyria|Illyrian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich but complex history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878\u20131918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], it was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995 with the Dayton Agreement]]. [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has grown at double digit rates in recent years. Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural environment and [[Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cultural heritage]] inherited from six historical civilizations, its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine|cuisine]], [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina#Winter%20sports|winter sports]], its eclectic and unique [[Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina|music]], [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|architecture]], and its [[Sarajevo#Festivals|festivals]], some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe. The country is home to three main ethnic groups or, officially, [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]], as specified in the constitution. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest group of the three, with [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] second, and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] third. A native of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, is usually identified in English as a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]]. Minorities, defined [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|under the constitutional nomenclature \"Others\"]], include [[Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jews]], [[Romani people in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]], [[National minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Poles, Ukrainians, and Turks]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]], with a third unit, the [[Br\u010dko District]], governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of 10 [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina [[List of countries by Human Development Index#High%20human%20development|ranks highly in terms of human development]], and has an economy dominated by the industry and agriculture sectors, followed by the tourism and service sectors. The country has a social security and universal healthcare system, and primary- and secondary-level education is tuition-free. It is a member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[OSCE]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Partnership for Peace|PfP]], [[CEFTA]], and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] upon its establishment in July 2008. The country is an [[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|applicant for membership to the European Union]] and has been a candidate for [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] membership since April 2010, when it received a [[Membership Action Plan]].\n\n'''Botswana''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0252t\u02c8sw\u0251\u02d0n\u0259/]] (listen), <small>also</small> <small>[[British English|UK]]:</small> [[Help:IPA/English|/b\u028at-, b\u028a\u02c8t\u0283w-/]]), officially the '''Republic of Botswana''' ([[Setswana]]: ''Lefatshe la Botswana''), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Southern Africa]]. Formerly the British [[protectorate]] of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], Botswana adopted its name after becoming independent within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on 30 September 1966. Since then, it has been a [[representative republic]], with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic [[Elections in Botswana|elections]] and the lowest perceived corruption ranking in Africa since at least 1998. It is currently Africa's oldest continuous democracy. Botswana is topographically flat, with up to 70 percent of its territory being the [[Kalahari Desert]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. Its border with [[Zambia]] to the north near [[Kazungula, Zambia|Kazungula]] is poorly defined but is, at most, a few hundred metres long. A mid-sized country of just over 2.3 million people, Botswana is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most sparsely populated]] countries in the world. Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, [[Gaborone]]. Formerly one of the poorest countries in the world\u2014with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s\u2014Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the world's fastest-growing economies. The economy is dominated by [[Mining industry of Botswana|mining]], cattle, and [[Tourism in Botswana|tourism]]. Botswana boasts a GDP ([[purchasing power parity]]) per capita of about $18,825 per year as of 2015, which is one of the highest in Africa. Its high [[gross national income]] (by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa) gives the country a relatively high standard of living and the highest [[Human Development Index]] of continental [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Botswana is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Southern African Development Community]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and the [[United Nations]]. The country has been among the hardest hit by the [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. Despite the success in programmes to make treatments available to those infected, and to educate the populace in general about how to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, the number of people with AIDS rose from 290,000 in 2005 to 320,000 in 2013. As of 2014, Botswana has the [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|third-highest prevalence rate]] for HIV/AIDS, with roughly 20% of the population infected.\n\n'''Brazil''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Brasil''; Portuguese pronunciation: [[Help:IPA/Portuguese|[b\u027ea\u02c8ziw]]]), officially the '''Federative Republic of Brazil''' (Portuguese: ''Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil'', listen <small>([[wikipedia:Media help|help]]\u00b7[[:File:Pt-br-Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil.ogg|info]])</small>), is the largest country in both [[South America]] and [[Latin America]].

The federation is composed of the union of the 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]. It is the largest country to have [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as an [[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|official language]] and the only one in the [[Americas]]; it is also one of the most [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass [[Immigration to Brazil|immigration from around the world]]. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a [[Coastline of Brazil|coastline]] of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi). It borders all other countries in South America except [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]] and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its [[Amazon River basin]] includes a [[Amazon rainforest|vast tropical forest]], home to diverse [[Wildlife of Brazil|wildlife]], a variety of [[Environment of Brazil|ecological systems]], and extensive natural resources spanning numerous [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected habitats]]. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 [[megadiverse countries]], and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. Brazil was inhabited by [[Indigenous Brazilian|numerous tribal nations]] prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], who claimed the area for the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Brazil remained a [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony]] until 1808, when the capital of the empire was [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. [[Brazilian Independence|Independence]] was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the [[Empire of Brazil]], a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]]. The country [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|became a presidential republic]] in 1889 following a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. An authoritarian [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military junta]] came to power [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat|in 1964]] and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current [[Constitution of Brazil|constitution]], formulated in 1988, defines it as a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[federal republic]].

The [[Thalassocracy|maritime state]] was visited by Spain's [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan Expedition]] in 1521 and fought against Spain in the 1578 [[Castilian War]]. During the 19th century, the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The Sultanate ceded Sarawak ([[Kuching]]) to [[James Brooke]] and installed him as the [[White Rajahs|White Rajah]], and it ceded Sabah to the British [[North Borneo Chartered Company]]. In 1888, Brunei became a [[British protectorate]] and was assigned a [[Resident (title)|British resident]] as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during [[World War II]], in 1959 a new constitution was written. In 1962, a small [[Brunei revolt|armed rebellion]] against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British. Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. It has developed wealth from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields. Brunei has the second-highest [[Human Development Index]] among the [[Southeast Asian]] nations, after [[Singapore]], and is classified as a \"[[developed country]]\". According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at [[purchasing power parity]]. The IMF estimated in 2011 that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being [[Libya]]) with a public debt at 0% of the national GDP. ''[[Forbes]]'' also ranks Brunei as the fifth-richest nation out of 182, based on its petroleum and natural gas fields.\n\n'''Bulgaria''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u028cl\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u0259ri\u0259, b\u028al-/]] (listen); [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, <small>[[Romanization of Bulgarian|romanized]]:</small> ''Balgariya''), officially the '''Republic of Bulgaria''' (Bulgarian: \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, <small>romanized:</small> ''Republika Balgariya'', <small>IPA:</small> [[Help:IPA/Bulgarian|[r\u025b\u02c8publik\u0250 b\u0250\u026b\u02c8\u0261arij\u0250]]]), is a country in [[Southeastern Europe]]. It is bordered by [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[North Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. The capital and largest city is [[Sofia]]; other major cities are [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]]. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's [[List of European countries by area|sixteenth-largest country]]. One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the [[Neolithic]] [[Karanovo culture]], which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for [[Thracians]], [[Persians]], [[Celts]] and [[ancient Macedonians]]; stability came when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the region in AD 45. The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire]] lost some of these territories to an invading [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in AD 681, which dominated most of the [[Balkans]] and significantly influenced [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures by developing the [[Cyrillic script]]. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], which reached its apex under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218\u20131241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]] resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|one-party socialist state]] and part of the Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. The ruling [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] gave up its monopoly on power after the [[revolutions of 1989]] and allowed [[multi-party]] elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a [[democracy]] and a market-based economy. Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the [[sovereign state]] has been a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million resides mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the [[Provinces of Bulgaria|27 provinces]]. The population has declined since the late 1980s. Bulgaria is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[Council of Europe]]; it is a founding state of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the [[UN Security Council]] three times. Its [[market economy]] is part of the [[European Single Market]] and mostly relies on services, followed by industry\u2014especially machine building and mining\u2014and agriculture. Bulgaria is a [[developing country]] and ranks 52nd in the [[Human Development Index]], the lowest development rank in the European Union alongside [[Romania]]. [[Corruption in Bulgaria|Widespread corruption]] is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018.\n\n'''Burkina Faso''' (<small>[[British English|UK]]:</small> [[Help:IPA/English|/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02ccki\u02d0n\u0259 \u02c8f\u00e6so\u028a/]], <small>[[American English|US]]:</small> [[Help:IPA/English|/- \u02c8f\u0251\u02d0so\u028a/]] (listen); <small>French:</small> [[Help:IPA/French|[bu\u0281kina faso]]]), officially the '''Republic of Burkina Faso''' ([[Mossi language|Mossi]]: ''Repibilik b\u00e1\u00e1ga Burk\u0129na Faso''), is a [[landlocked country]] in West Africa. It covers an area of around 274,200 square kilometres (105,900 sq mi) and is surrounded by six countries: [[Mali]] to [[Burkina Faso\u2013Mali border|the north]]; [[Niger]] to [[Burkina Faso\u2013Niger border|the east]]; [[Benin]] to [[Benin-Burkina Faso border|the southeast]]; [[Togo]] to [[Burkina Faso\u2013Togo border|the southeast]]; [[Ghana]] to [[Burkina Faso\u2013Ghana border|the south]]; and [[Ivory Coast]] to [[Burkina Faso\u2013Ivory Coast border|the southwest]]. The July 2019 population estimate by the United Nations was 20,321,378. The country's official language of government and business is French. Roughly 50% of the population speaks the [[Mossi language]] natively. Formerly called the [[Republic of Upper Volta]] (1958\u20131984), the country was [[Geographical renaming|renamed]] \"Burkina Faso\" on 4 August 1984 by erstwhile President [[Thomas Sankara]]. Its citizens are known as ''Burkinab\u00e9'' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8ki\u02d0n\u0259be\u026a/]] [[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|''bur-KEE-n\u0259-bay'']]). Its capital is [[Ouagadougou]]. The [[Republic of Upper Volta]] was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]], and on 5 August 1960 it gained full independence, with [[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]] as [[List of heads of state of Burkina Faso|President]]. After protests by students and labour union members, Yam\u00e9ogo was deposed in the [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 coup d'\u00e9tat]], led by [[Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana]], who became President. His rule coincided with the [[Sahel drought]] and famine, and facing problems from the country's traditionally powerful trade unions he was deposed in the [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|1980 coup d'\u00e9tat]], led by [[Saye Zerbo]]. Encountering resistance from trade unions again, Zerbo's government was overthrown in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|1982 coup d'\u00e9tat]], led by [[Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo]]. The leader of the leftist faction of Ou\u00e9draogo's government, [[Thomas Sankara]], was made [[List of Prime Ministers of Burkina Faso|Prime Minister]] but was later imprisoned. Efforts to free him led to the popularly-supported 1983 coup d'\u00e9tat, in which he became President. Sankara renamed the country Burkina Faso and launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme which included a nationwide [[literacy]] campaign, [[land redistribution]] to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of [[female genital mutilation]], [[Forced marriage|forced marriages]] and [[polygamy]]. Sankara was overthrown and killed in the [[1987 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat|1987 coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]] \u2013 deteriorating relations with former coloniser France and its ally the Ivory Coast were the reason given for the coup. In 1987, Blaise Compaor\u00e9 became president and, after an alleged [[1989 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|1989 coup attempt]], was later elected in [[Burkinab\u00e9 presidential election, 1991|1991]] and [[Burkinab\u00e9 presidential election, 1998|1998]], elections which were boycotted by the opposition and received a considerably low turnout, as well as in [[Burkinab\u00e9 presidential election, 2005|2005]]. He remained head of state until he was ousted from power by the [[2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising|popular youth upheaval of 31 October 2014]], after which he was exiled to the Ivory Coast. [[Michel Kafando]] subsequently became the transitional president of the country. On 16 September 2015, [[2015 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the Kafando government was carried out by the [[Regiment of Presidential Security]], the former presidential guard of Compaor\u00e9. On 24 September 2015, after pressure from the [[African Union]], [[ECOWAS]] and the armed forces, the military junta agreed to step down, and Michel Kafando was reinstated as acting president. In the [[Burkinab\u00e9 general election, 2015|general election held on 29 November 2015]], [[Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9]] won in the first round with 53.5% of the vote and was sworn in as President on 29 December 2015.\n\n'''Burundi''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0259\u02c8r\u028andi/]] (listen), [[Help:IPA/English|/-\u02c8r\u028cn-/]]), officially the '''Republic of Burundi''' ([[Kirundi language|Kirundi]]: ''Republika y'Uburundi'', [[Help:IPA|[u.\u03b2u.\u027e\u01d4\u02d0.ndi]]]; French: ''R\u00e9publique du Burundi'', [[Help:IPA/French|[bu\u0281undi]]] or [[Help:IPA/French|[by\u0281yndi]]]), is a [[landlocked country]] in the [[Great Rift Valley]] where the [[African Great Lakes]] region and [[East Africa]] converge. It is bordered by [[Rwanda]] to the north, [[Tanzania]] to the east and southeast, and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the west; [[Lake Tanganyika]] lies along its southwestern border. The capital cities are Gitega and Bujumbura. The [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years. For more than 200 of those years, Burundi was an independent [[Kingdom of Burundi|kingdom]], until the beginning of the 20th century, when [[German Empire|Germany]] colonised the region. After the [[First World War]] and [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Germany's defeat]], it ceded the territory to [[Belgium]]. Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. Despite common misconceptions, Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation. Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a [[Kingdom of Burundi|monarchy]], but a series of assassinations, coups and a general climate of [[Congo Crisis|regional instability]] culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966. Bouts of [[ethnic cleansing]] and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the [[Burundian Genocide#1972|1970s]] and again in the [[Burundian Civil War|1990s]] left the [[Developing country|economy undeveloped]] and the population as one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|world's poorest]]. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died together when their aeroplane was shot down in April 1994. 2015 witnessed [[2015 Burundian unrest|large-scale political strife]] as President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] opted to run for a third term in office, a [[2015 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup attempt failed]] and the country's [[Burundian legislative election, 2015|parliamentary]] and [[Burundian presidential election, 2015|presidential]] elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community. The [[sovereign state]] of Burundi's political system is that of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic based upon a multi-party state. The President of Burundi is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. There are currently 21 [[List of political parties in Burundi|registered parties in Burundi]]. On 13 March 1992, Tutsi coup leader [[Pierre Buyoya]] established a constitution, which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition. Six years later, on 6 June 1998, the constitution was changed, broadening [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]]'s seats and making provisions for two vice-presidents. Because of the [[Arusha Accords (Burundi)|Arusha Accord]], Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000. In October 2016, Burundi informed the UN of its intention to withdraw from the [[International Criminal Court]]. Burundi remains primarily a rural society, with just 13.4% of the population living in urban areas in 2019. The population density of around 315 people per square kilometre (753 per sq mi) is the second highest in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Roughly 85% of the population are of [[Hutu]] ethnic origin, 15% are [[Tutsi]], and fewer than 1% are indigenous [[Twa]]. The [[Official language|official languages]] of Burundi are [[Kirundi language|Kirundi]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], Kirundi being recognised officially as the sole national language. One of the smallest countries in Africa, Burundi's land is used mostly for subsistence agricultural and grazing, which has led to [[deforestation]], [[soil erosion]] and [[habitat loss]]. As of 2005 the country was almost completely deforested, with less than 6% of its land covered by trees and over half of that being commmercial plantations. In addition to poverty, Burundians often have to deal with corruption, weak infrastructure, poor access to health and education services, and hunger. Burundi is densely populated and many young people emigrate in search of opportunities elsewhere. The [[World Happiness Report|World Happiness Report 2018]] ranked Burundi as the world's least happy nation with a rank of 156.\n\n'''C\u00f4te d'Ivoire''', officially the '''Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire''', is a country located on the south coast of [[West Africa]]. Ivory Coast's political capital is [[Yamoussoukro]] in the centre of the country, while its economic capital and largest city is the port city of [[Abidjan]]. It borders [[Guinea]] to [[Guinea\u2013Ivory Coast border|the northwest]], [[Liberia]] to [[Ivory Coast\u2013Liberia border|the west]], [[Mali]] to [[Ivory Coast\u2013Mali border|the northwest]], [[Burkina Faso]] to [[Burkina Faso\u2013Ivory Coast border|the northeast]], [[Ghana]] to [[Ghana\u2013Ivory Coast border|the east]], and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (Atlantic Ocean) to the south. The [[official language]] of the republic is [[French language|French]], with local indigenous languages also being widely used that include [[Baoul\u00e9 language|Baoul\u00e9]], [[Dioula language|Dioula]], [[Dan language|Dan]], [[Anyin language|Anyin]], and [[Senari languages|Cebaara Senufo]]. In total, there are around 78 different [[Languages of Ivory Coast|languages spoken in Ivory Coast]]. The country has large populations of [[Islam in Ivory Coast|Muslims]], [[Christianity in Ivory Coast|Christians]] (primarily [[Roman Catholicism in Ivory Coast|Roman Catholics]]) and [[Religion in Ivory Coast|various indigenous religions]]. Before its colonization by Europeans, Ivory Coast was home to several states, including [[Gyaaman]], the [[Kong Empire]] and [[Baoul\u00e9 people|Baoul\u00e9]]. The area became a [[protectorate]] of France in 1843 and was consolidated as a [[French colony]] in 1893 amid the European [[scramble for Africa]]. It achieved independence in 1960, led by [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny]], who ruled the country until 1993. Relatively stable by regional standards, Ivory Coast established close political and economic ties with its West African neighbors while at the same time maintaining close relations to [[Western Bloc|the West]], [[Fran\u00e7afrique|especially France]]. Ivory Coast experienced a [[1999 Ivorian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat in 1999]] and two religiously-grounded civil wars, first [[First Ivorian Civil War|between 2002 and 2007]] and again [[Second Ivorian Civil War|during 2010\u20132011]]. In 2000, the country adopted a new [[constitution]]. Ivory Coast is a republic with strong executive power vested in its [[President of Ivory Coast|president]]. Through the production of [[Coffee bean|coffee]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], the country was an economic powerhouse in West Africa during the 1960s and 1970s, though it went through an economic crisis in the 1980s, contributing to a period of political and social turmoil. It was not until around 2014 that the [[gross domestic product]] again reached the level of its peak in the 1970s. In the 21st century, the Ivorian economy has been largely market-based, and it still relies heavily on agriculture, with [[Smallholding|smallholder]] cash-crop production being predominant.\n\n'''Cape Verde''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02c8v\u025c\u02d0rd(i)/]] (listen)) or '''Cabo Verde''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02cck\u0251\u02d0bo\u028a \u02c8v\u025c\u02d0rde\u026a/]] (listen), [[Help:IPA/English|/\u02cck\u00e6b-/]]) ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Cabo Verde'', pronounced [[Help:IPA/Portuguese|[\u02c8kabu \u02c8ve\u027ed\u0268]]]), officially the '''Republic of Cabo Verde''', is an [[island country]] spanning an [[archipelago]] of 10 [[High island|volcanic islands]] in the central [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It forms part of the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]], along with the [[Azores]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. Located 570 kilometres (350 mi) west of the [[Cape Verde Peninsula]] off the coast of [[Northwest Africa]], the islands cover a combined area of 4,033 square kilometres (1,557 sq mi). The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century, when [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorers discovered and [[Colony|colonized]] the islands, establishing the first European settlement in the tropics. Ideally located for the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, attracting merchants, [[Privateer|privateers]], and [[Piracy|pirates]]. The end of [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slavery]] in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration. Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes. Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951, the islands continued to campaign for independence, which was achieved in 1975. Since the early 1990s, Cape Verde has been a stable [[representative democracy]], and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa. Lacking natural resources, its developing economy is mostly service-oriented, with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment. Its population of around 550,000 (as at mid 2019) is mostly of mixed [[Africa|African]], [[Moorish]], [[Arab]] and [[Europe|European]] heritage, and predominantly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule. A [[Cape Verdean diaspora|sizeable diaspora community]] exists across the world, slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands. Historically, the name \"Cape Verde\" has been used in English for the archipelago and, since independence in 1975, for the country. In 2013, the Cape Verdean government determined that the Portuguese designation ''Cabo Verde'' would henceforth be used for official purposes, such as at the [[United Nations]], even in English contexts. Cape Verde is a member of the [[African Union]].\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Confusing|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Rough translation|listed=yes|date=April 2020}}\nDr. Padumlal Punnalal Bakshi (27 May 1894 - 28 December 1971), also known as Masterji<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%80|title=\u092a\u0926\u0941\u092e\u0932\u093e\u0932 \u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u0916\u094d\u0936\u0940 - \u0935\u093f\u0915\u093f\u092a\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e|website=hi.m.wikipedia.org|language=hi|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>, was a [[Hindi]] essayist.
