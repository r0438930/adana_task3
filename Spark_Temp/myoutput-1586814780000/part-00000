This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\nTorres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842. At the time the area which had been built around the basilica of San Gavino joined the fishermen's community near the port to form the new ''Porto Torres''.\n\nOn 10th of May 1942 [[Benito Mussolini]] has visited the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fondoluce.archivioluce.com/LuceUnesco/avanzata/scheda/foto/IL3000006141/12/Mussolini-a-Porto-Torres.html?luoghi=Porto%20Torres|title=Mussolini a Porto Torres - Cinecitt\u00e0 Luce - Unesco|website=fondoluce.archivioluce.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Palm Sunday|18th of April 1943]] the city was bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ricerca.gelocal.it/lanuovasardegna/archivio/lanuovasardegna/2010/04/18/SP1PO_SP107.html|title=Il bombardamento di 67 anni fa - La Nuova Sardegna|website=Archivio - La Nuova Sardegna|language=it|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Main sights==\n=== Archaeological sites ===\n\n* ''[[Necropolis]] of Su Crucifissu Mannu''\n* ''[[Domus de Janas]] of Campu Perdu ([[Asinara]])''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Biunisi''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Monte Elva''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Margone''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Nieddu''\n* \"''Turris Libisonis''\" Archaeological park\n\n* ''[[Roman bridge]] of Rio Mannu''\n\n* ''Palace of the \"Re Barbaro\" and [[domus]] of [[Orpheus]]''\n\n* ''Baths of Maetzke''\n\n* ''Baths of Pallottino''\n\n* ''Domus dei Mosaici''\n* ''Tanca Borgona''\n* ''The [[Arcosolium]]''\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n==== Churches ====\n\n*The 11th-century  [[Basilica of San Gavino]], built using only hardstones like marble, porphyry and granite, is the largest [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in Sardinia.

The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\nTorres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842. At the time the area which had been built around the basilica of San Gavino joined the fishermen's community near the port to form the new ''Porto Torres''.\n\nOn 10th of May 1942 [[Benito Mussolini]] has visited the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fondoluce.archivioluce.com/LuceUnesco/avanzata/scheda/foto/IL3000006141/12/Mussolini-a-Porto-Torres.html?luoghi=Porto%20Torres|title=Mussolini a Porto Torres - Cinecitt\u00e0 Luce - Unesco|website=fondoluce.archivioluce.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Palm Sunday|18th of April 1943]] the city was bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ricerca.gelocal.it/lanuovasardegna/archivio/lanuovasardegna/2010/04/18/SP1PO_SP107.html|title=Il bombardamento di 67 anni fa - La Nuova Sardegna|website=Archivio - La Nuova Sardegna|language=it|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Main sights==\n=== Archaeological sites ===\n\n* ''[[Necropolis]] of Su Crucifissu Mannu''\n* ''[[Domus de Janas]] of Campu Perdu ([[Asinara]])''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Biunisi''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Monte Elva''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Margone''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Nieddu''\n* \"''Turris Libisonis''\" Archaeological park\n\n* ''[[Roman bridge]] of Rio Mannu''\n\n* ''Palace of the \"Re Barbaro\" and [[domus]] of [[Orpheus]]''\n\n* ''Baths of Maetzke''\n\n* ''Baths of Pallottino''\n\n* ''Domus dei Mosaici''\n* ''Tanca Borgona''\n* ''The [[Arcosolium]]''\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n==== Churches ====\n\n*The 11th-century  [[Basilica of San Gavino]], built using only hardstones like marble, porphyry and granite, is the largest [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in Sardinia.
