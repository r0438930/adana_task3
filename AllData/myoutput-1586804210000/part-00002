It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, and features a sidestep maneuver which is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3D.\"<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> The gameboy version of the of Battle Arena Toshiden despite sharing the same name as the console & PC counterparts is a different game. It is a 2D weapons based fighter & supports the Super Gameboy cartridge peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom to allow the game to be played on a TV with colour palettes & borders. \n\nThe game was announced as a PlayStation exclusive,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=December 1995|page=14}}</ref> with Sony initially promoting it as a \"[[Killer app|Saturn killer]]\" (against Sega's ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115002712/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |archive-date=2015-01-15 |url-status=live}}</ref> but it was ported to the Saturn with additional features less than a year later. Once fighting games like ''[[Tekken (arcade game)|Tekken]]'' started emerging, ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' declined in popularity, but still spawned a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by ''[[Soul Edge]]'' and other games of the genre.\n\n==Gameplay==\nEach character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.\n\nPlayers move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.\n\nAs with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.\n\n==Plot==\nA young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father.\n\nEiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the match is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.\n\n==Characters==\nInitially playable characters:\n*Eiji Shinjo - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho.\n*Kayin Amoh - A Scottish (later retconned as English) swordsman/bounty hunter who happens to be a friend and rival of Eiji. He seeks to avenge the death of his foster father, who was killed by the previous tournament's champion from last year.\n*Sofia - A whip-wielding blonde Russian woman who works as a private detective. She seeks to find and recover her long-lost memories.\n*Rungo Iron - A strong yet kind-hearted miner who seeks to rescue his wife Lila and his son Christopher from the Secret Society.\n*Fo Fai - An elderly Chinese magician who is secretly a cold-hearted serial killer. Fo Fai enters the tournament to satisfy his bloodlust.\n*Mondo - An emotionless Japanese ninja warrior who infiltrates the tournament under orders from a rival group of the Secret Society.\n*Duke B. Rambert - An arrogant French knight who seeks to find and defeat Eiji to avenge a past loss to him.\n*Ellis - A cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer of a traveling theater troupe who seeks to discover whether or not her long-lost missing father is still alive.\n\n[[Unlockable (gaming)|Unlockable]] characters:\n*Gaia - The sponsor of the tournament and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the game. His reasons for holding the tournament in the first place are shrouded in mystery. He is later revealed to be the father of Ellis.\n*Sho Shinjo - The secret final boss of the game, reached by clearing the game without continues. The champion from last year's previous tournament and Eiji's older brother, he is a merciless swordsman who holds nothing back from within the fights that he participates in. His soundtrack is a variation of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]]\n*Cupido ([[Sega Saturn]] version) - A mysterious woman who speaks with cryptic riddles and messages. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and not much is known about her. The \"true\" final boss in this version.\n*Uranus ([[Game Boy]] version)\n*[[Earthworm Jim (series)#Earthworm Jim|Earthworm Jim]] (PC version) - A guest character who happens to be the main protagonist from his self-named series. His attacks are identical to those of Rungo Iron.\n\n==Release==\nThe original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was ported by [[Nex Entertainment|Nextech]]/[[Sega]] to the Sega Saturn as '''''Toh Shin Den S''''' in Japan and as '''''Battle Arena Toshinden Remix''''' in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Wave: Toh Shin Den S |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1996|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Is War Hell for Sega?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=8|quote=''Toshinden'' is almost a year old and ...

It also supports resolutions up to 640x480. The PC port uses the Japanese PlayStation version's voices and music in all regions, unlike the original PlayStation version.\n\nThe game was also ported to the [[Game Boy]] by [[Takara]] in 1996, titled '''''Nettou Toshinden''''' in Japan. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the ''Battle Arena Toshinden 2'' version of Gaia (without his armor).\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 85% (PS)<ref name=\"GR\"/> <br> (2 reviews)\n| Dragon = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Dragon221\"/> (PS)\n| EGM = 32.5/40<ref name=\"EGM74\"/> (PS) <br> 21/40<ref name=\"EGM83\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Toshinden Remix|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=83|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1996|page=28}}</ref> (SS)\n| Fam = 30/40<ref name=\"famitsu333\"/> (PS) <br> 9/10<ref name=\"famitsu323\"/> (PS) <br> 10/10<ref name=\"famitsu336\"/> (PS)\n| GamePro = 18/20<ref name=\"gamepro69\"/> (PS) <br> 17/20<ref>''GamePro'', issue 74, September 1995, page 42</ref> (PS)\n| GI = 8.5/10<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19970811123729/http://www.gameinformer.com/sep95/tohshin.html</ref> (PS)\n| GMaster = 88%<ref>''GamesMaster'', episode 81 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108191815/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 |date=2016-01-08 }}), September 21, 1995</ref> (PS)\n| GSpot = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Leo |first=John |title=Battle Arena Toshinden Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 18, 2013 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130718032127/http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2013 }}</ref> (PC)\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> (PS)\n| rev1 = ''[[Electric Playground]]''\n| rev1Score = 10/10<ref name=\"GR\" /> (PS)\n| rev2 = ''Maximum''\n| rev2Score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max1\"/> (PS) <br>{{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Max6\"/> (SS)\n| NGen = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"NGen4\"/> (PS)<br>{{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen15\"/> (SS)\n| rev4 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev4Score = 80%<ref name=\"ssm\"/> (SS)\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = [[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Fighting Game of 1995]]<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1996\"/>\n}}\n''Battle Arena Toshinden'' sold more than 150,000 units in the United States, leading to its inclusion in the [[Greatest Hits (PlayStation)|Greatest Hits]] range.<ref>{{cite news|title=PlayStation Leads Videogame Industry with Aggressive New Price Structure; PlayStation Game Console to Retail for $149 and PlayStation Software to be Targeted at a MSRP of $49.99 or Less|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310162416/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 10, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2006|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=March 3, 1997}}</ref> ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' was also critically acclaimed when released.

They particularly praised the [[Texture mapping|texture-mapped]] polygon graphics, original fighters, myriad moves, unique style of play, and the sidestep move, commenting that \"The only problem with this slick defensive move is that from some viewing angles, the fighters obstruct the front of the screen, making it impossible to see where a move is coming from.\"<ref name=\"gamepro69\">{{cite magazine |title=Overseas ProSpects: Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=69 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1995|page=144}}</ref> Their review of the later U.S. release was also generally positive; they praised the graphics, stage design, playability, and dynamic camera, but criticized the game for being simplistic and easy, remarking that \"This game relies more on flash than fighting.\" They summarized the game as \"an enjoyable fight.\"<ref name=\"gamepro74\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Battle Arena Toshinden|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=74|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1995|pages=40\u201341}}</ref> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' also reviewed the game prior to the PlayStation's U.S. launch.

It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment, and features a sidestep maneuver which is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3D.\"<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/>\n\nThe game was announced as a PlayStation exclusive,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Toh Shin Den|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |date=December 1995|page=14}}</ref> with Sony initially promoting it as a \"[[Killer app|Saturn killer]]\" (against Sega's ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115002712/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/virtuafighter/virtuafighter.htm |archive-date=2015-01-15 |url-status=live}}</ref> but it was ported to the Saturn with additional features less than a year later. Once fighting games like ''[[Tekken (arcade game)|Tekken]]'' started emerging, ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' declined in popularity, but still spawned a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by ''[[Soul Edge]]'' and other games of the genre.\n\n==Gameplay==\nEach character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.\n\nPlayers move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.\n\nAs with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.\n\n==Plot==\nA young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father.\n\nEiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the match is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.\n\n==Characters==\nInitially playable characters:\n*Eiji Shinjo - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho.\n*Kayin Amoh - A Scottish (later retconned as English) swordsman/bounty hunter who happens to be a friend and rival of Eiji. He seeks to avenge the death of his foster father, who was killed by the previous tournament's champion from last year.\n*Sofia - A whip-wielding blonde Russian woman who works as a private detective. She seeks to find and recover her long-lost memories.\n*Rungo Iron - A strong yet kind-hearted miner who seeks to rescue his wife Lila and his son Christopher from the Secret Society.\n*Fo Fai - An elderly Chinese magician who is secretly a cold-hearted serial killer. Fo Fai enters the tournament to satisfy his bloodlust.\n*Mondo - An emotionless Japanese ninja warrior who infiltrates the tournament under orders from a rival group of the Secret Society.\n*Duke B. Rambert - An arrogant French knight who seeks to find and defeat Eiji to avenge a past loss to him.\n*Ellis - A cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer of a traveling theater troupe who seeks to discover whether or not her long-lost missing father is still alive.\n\n[[Unlockable (gaming)|Unlockable]] characters:\n*Gaia - The sponsor of the tournament and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] of the game. His reasons for holding the tournament in the first place are shrouded in mystery. He is later revealed to be the father of Ellis.\n*Sho Shinjo - The secret final boss of the game, reached by clearing the game without continues. The champion from last year's previous tournament and Eiji's older brother, he is a merciless swordsman who holds nothing back from within the fights that he participates in. His soundtrack is a variation of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]]\n*Cupido ([[Sega Saturn]] version) - A mysterious woman who speaks with cryptic riddles and messages. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and not much is known about her. The \"true\" final boss in this version.\n*Uranus ([[Game Boy]] version)\n*[[Earthworm Jim (series)#Earthworm Jim|Earthworm Jim]] (PC version) - A guest character who happens to be the main protagonist from his self-named series. His attacks are identical to those of Rungo Iron.\n\n==Release==\nThe original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was ported by [[Nex Entertainment|Nextech]]/[[Sega]] to the Sega Saturn as '''''Toh Shin Den S''''' in Japan and as '''''Battle Arena Toshinden Remix''''' in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Next Wave: Toh Shin Den S |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1996|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Is War Hell for Sega?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=8|quote=''Toshinden'' is almost a year old and ...

It also supports resolutions up to 640x480. The PC port uses the Japanese PlayStation version's voices and music in all regions, unlike the original PlayStation version.\n\nThe game was also ported to the [[Game Boy]] by [[Takara]] in 1996, titled '''''Nettou Toshinden''''' in Japan. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the ''Battle Arena Toshinden 2'' version of Gaia (without his armor).\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 85% (PS)<ref name=\"GR\"/> <br> (2 reviews)\n| Dragon = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Dragon221\"/> (PS)\n| EGM = 32.5/40<ref name=\"EGM74\"/> (PS) <br> 21/40<ref name=\"EGM83\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Toshinden Remix|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=83|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1996|page=28}}</ref> (SS)\n| Fam = 30/40<ref name=\"famitsu333\"/> (PS) <br> 9/10<ref name=\"famitsu323\"/> (PS) <br> 10/10<ref name=\"famitsu336\"/> (PS)\n| GamePro = 18/20<ref name=\"gamepro69\"/> (PS) <br> 17/20<ref>''GamePro'', issue 74, September 1995, page 42</ref> (PS)\n| GI = 8.5/10<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19970811123729/http://www.gameinformer.com/sep95/tohshin.html</ref> (PS)\n| GMaster = 88%<ref>''GamesMaster'', episode 81 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108191815/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ee-pyeZTjE&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 |date=2016-01-08 }}), September 21, 1995</ref> (PS)\n| GSpot = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Leo |first=John |title=Battle Arena Toshinden Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 18, 2013 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130718032127/http://uk.gamespot.com/battle-arena-toshinden/reviews/battle-arena-toshinden-review-2535126/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2013 }}</ref> (PC)\n| IGN = 7/10<ref name=\"ign_toshinden\"/> (PS)\n| rev1 = ''[[Electric Playground]]''\n| rev1Score = 10/10<ref name=\"GR\" /> (PS)\n| rev2 = ''Maximum''\n| rev2Score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max1\"/> (PS) <br>{{rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"Max6\"/> (SS)\n| NGen = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"NGen4\"/> (PS)<br>{{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen15\"/> (SS)\n| rev4 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev4Score = 80%<ref name=\"ssm\"/> (SS)\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = [[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Fighting Game of 1995]]<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1996\"/>\n}}\n''Battle Arena Toshinden'' sold more than 150,000 units in the United States, leading to its inclusion in the [[Greatest Hits (PlayStation)|Greatest Hits]] range.<ref>{{cite news|title=PlayStation Leads Videogame Industry with Aggressive New Price Structure; PlayStation Game Console to Retail for $149 and PlayStation Software to be Targeted at a MSRP of $49.99 or Less|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310162416/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_3/ai_19173261|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 10, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2006|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=March 3, 1997}}</ref> ''Battle Arena Toshinden'' was also critically acclaimed when released.
