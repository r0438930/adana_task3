Bands like [[Peter og Ulvene]], [[Sir Henry and his Butlers]], [[The Beefeaters]] and later on [[Steppeulvene]] (the Steppenwolves), [[Alrune Rod]] and [[Savage Rose]] were among the popular bands in Denmark throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.

Among the prominent soloists, often composing new songs, were [[Sebastian (Danish musician)|Sebastian]], Poul Dissing and [[Niels Hausgaard]]. The successful Lars Lilholt Band led by the violinist [[Lars Lilholt]] combines the folk music tradition with rock. A new and refreshing combination of techno music and medieval ballads has been provided by the group [[Sorten Muld]] since their first recording in 1996.<ref name=\"folk music\"/>\n\nThe formation of the [[Danish Folk Council]] to actively promote folk music both at home and abroad has helped raise the profile.<ref>[http://www.folkmusic.dk/view.php3?SectionID=635&ContentID=2512&ParentIDs=/ \"The Danish Folk Council\"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The first Danish music schools were formed in the 1930's with inspiration for Germany. From 1991 Musikloven - Law on Music - has had a [https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/r0710.aspx?id=158921#Kap2a chapter on music schools].  According to the law the purposes of the music schools are to develop and support the musical talents and knowledge and to enhance music in the local communities. The primary goal is to engage with children and youth (0-24 years), but activities for adults are also possible. The financing of the music schools are divided among state, municipality and students (or parents of students). \n\n==Music in everyday life==\nMusic is an important part of the lives of most Danes. One of the carefully observed traditions is to include music at celebrations at large, including family oriented ones such as wedding parties, birthdays and anniversaries. Indeed, it is not only common to engage one or more musicians for dancing but it is usual for the guests to write songs, normally to well-known traditional tunes, in honour of those to be celebrated.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Livsstil,_sport_og_fritid/Underholdning_og_spil/Forestillinger_og_forlystelser/Fest \"Fest\"], ''Den store Danske''. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 18 March 2010.</ref>\n\nThere is also a popular tradition of choir singing. There are hundreds of amateur choirs throughout Denmark, usually specialising in traditional Danish songs or folk music.<ref>[http://www.kor72.dk/dk/om_kor_72/ Lisbeth Gr\u00e5kj\u00e6r, \"Om Kor 72\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122055023/http://www.kor72.dk/dk/om_kor_72/ |date=22 January 2010 }} {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 19 March 2010.</ref> \n\nDenmark has two national anthems, which are widely performed. ''[[Der er et yndigt land]]'' (There is a Lovely Country) is sung loudly and enthusiastically at sporting events and is the most popular. Lyrics are by the Danish poet [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] and music by [[Hans Ernst Kr\u00f8yer]]. ''[[Kong Kristian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast]]'' (King Christian stood by tow'ring mast), is sung on official occasions when the royal family is represented. Lyrics are by [[Johannes Ewald]] while music was probably written by [[Ditlev Ludwig Rogert]] and can be heard in the final tableau of [[Elves' Hill|Elverh\u00f8j]].<ref name=\"netpub\"/><ref>[http://www.ambnewdelhi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/DanishNationalSymbols/TheDanishNationalAnthems/ \"The Danish National Anthems\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132835/http://www.ambnewdelhi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/DanishNationalSymbols/TheDanishNationalAnthems/ |date=19 July 2011 }}, Embassy of Denmark, New Delhi.
