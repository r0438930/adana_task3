It was established in [[Glasgow]], Scotland in 1849 as '''Arthur and Fraser'''. By 1891, it was known as '''Fraser & Sons'''. The company grew steadily during the early 20th century, and after the Second World War a large number of acquisitions transformed the company into a national chain.\n\nFrom 1936 onwards the company expanded substantially through acquisitions, including [[Scottish Drapery Corporation]] (1952), [[Binns (department store)|Binns]] (1953), [[Barkers of Kensington]] (1957), and [[Dickins & Jones]] and the [[Harrods]] group (1959). In 1948, the company was first listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Later acquisitions included [[Howells (department store)|Howells]] (1972) and [[Army & Navy Stores (United Kingdom)|Army & Navy Stores]] (1973).\n\nOwnership of the group passed to the [[Al Fayed]] family in 1985 (\u00a3615million), and in 1995 it was listed in the [[FTSE Group|FTSE Index]] as House of Fraser plc, with Harrods moved into the private ownership of the Al Fayeds. In the 1990s several stores were closed and fifteen stores transferred to a joint venture with [[British Land Company]], which then continued operating under their old name. The former Harrod group store [[D H Evans]] on Oxford Street, London was re-branded as House of Fraser in 2001 and became the chain's flagship store.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 2005, the group acquired [[Jenners]] (\u00a346m), and [[Beatties]] (\u00a369m). In 2006, group was acquired by a consortium of investors (Highland Group Holdings) including Icelandic based [[Landsbanki]] (35%). An online store was launched in 2007. In 2014 the group (as Highland Group Holdings Ltd) was sold to Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co. (Sanpower Group), a leading chain of Chinese department stores for approximately \u00a3480 million.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn May 2018, the group entered a [[company voluntary arrangement]], and in June the closure of 31 stores was announced. On 10 August 2018 [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]]'s [[Sports Direct]] chain agreed to buy the business (stores, stock, brand) for \u00a390 million after the chain went into administration earlier that day.\n\n==History==\n[[File:House of Fraser, Briggate, Leeds (27th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|House of Fraser on [[Briggate]] in [[Leeds, England]]]]\n[[File:Belfast (200), October 2009.JPG|thumb|right|House of Fraser in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]]]]\n\n===The early years===\nThe company was founded by [[Hugh Fraser (retailer)|Hugh Fraser]] and James Arthur in 1849 as a small drapery shop on the corner of [[Argyle Street, Glasgow|Argyle Street]] and [[Buchanan Street]] in Glasgow, Scotland trading as Arthur and Fraser.<ref name =history>{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_71300_en.pdf |title=House of Fraser archive project |format=PDF |accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nHugh Fraser had been apprenticed to Stewart & McDonald Ltd, a [[Glasgow]] [[draper]]y warehouse where he rose to the position of warehouse manager and from where he brought many of initial customers.<ref name=history/>\n\nJames Arthur also owned a retail drapery business in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], near Glasgow: he appointed a manager to oversee the Paisley business while he focused on his new business.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe company established a [[wholesale]] trade in adjoining premises in Argyle Street. In 1856 the wholesale business moved to a larger site in Miller Street, [[Glasgow]] and started to trade under the name Arthur & Co. The retail side of the business expanded into the vacant buildings left by the wholesale side.<ref name=history/>\n\nDuring the late 1850s and early 1860s the retail business was run by a professional manager \u2013 first Thomas Kirkpatrick and then Alexander McLaren.<ref name=history/> In 1865 the partnership between the partners was dissolved and Fraser assumed control of the retail business leaving Arthur with the wholesale business. In 1865 McLaren joined the retail business and the name was changed to Fraser & McLaren.<ref name=history/>\n\n===Fraser & Sons===\nWhen the first Hugh Fraser died in 1873, his three eldest sons, James, John and Hugh, acquired stakes in the business. James and John Fraser were initially directors in the business and employed Alexander McLaren and later John Towers to manage it for them. In 1891 Hugh also joined the partnership which by then was called Fraser & Sons.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn 1879, the current flagship store on Oxford Street in London was opened by Dan Harries Evans, a 23-year-old from Whitemill in Carmarthenshire, Wales who had previously been apprenticed to a [[draper]] in Forest Hamlet near [[Merthyr Tydfil]], Wales. He moved to London in 1878 to set up his own business in [[Westminster Bridge Road]]. The store traded under the [[D H Evans]] name until 2001.<ref name=history/>\n\nBy 1900, Hugh Fraser II was in charge: he incorporated the business as Fraser & Sons Ltd in 1909 and introduced the famous stag's head motif.<ref name=history/>\n\nAfter Hugh Fraser II died in 1927, his son [[Hugh Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of Allander|Hugh Fraser III]], an accountant, became Chairman of the business.<ref name=history/> He opened new departments, enlarged the tearoom, opened a restaurant and also began to look at possible acquisitions.<ref name=history/> In 1936 he purchased Arnott & Co Ltd and its neighbour Robert Simpson & Sons Ltd in nearby Argyle Street, merging the companies to help improve trade.<ref name=history/> In 1948 the Company, now named House of Fraser, was first listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref name=history/>\n\n===1950s to 1970s===\n[[File:Kendal Milne's Deansgate.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Art Deco]] [[Kendals]] building on [[Deansgate]], Manchester, England \u2013 a House of Fraser store since 1959]]\nIn 1951, the Company purchased McDonald's Ltd, and with it a branch in [[Harrogate]].

It was established in [[Glasgow]], Scotland in 1849 as '''Arthur and Fraser'''. By 1891, it was known as '''Fraser & Sons'''. The company grew steadily during the early 20th century, and after the Second World War a large number of acquisitions transformed the company into a national chain.\n\nFrom 1936 onwards the company expanded substantially through acquisitions, including [[Scottish Drapery Corporation]] (1952), [[Binns (department store)|Binns]] (1953), [[Barkers of Kensington]] (1957), and [[Dickins & Jones]] and the [[Harrods]] group (1959). In 1948, the company was first listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Later acquisitions included [[Howells (department store)|Howells]] (1972) and [[Army & Navy Stores (United Kingdom)|Army & Navy Stores]] (1973).\n\nOwnership of the group passed to the [[Al Fayed]] family in 1985 (\u00a3615million), and in 1995 it was listed in the [[FTSE Group|FTSE Index]] as House of Fraser plc, with Harrods moved into the private ownership of the Al Fayeds. In the 1990s several stores were closed and fifteen stores transferred to a joint venture with [[British Land Company]], which then continued operating under their old name. The former Harrod group store [[D H Evans]] on Oxford Street, London was re-branded as House of Fraser in 2001 and became the chain's flagship store.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 2005, the group acquired [[Jenners]] (\u00a346m), and [[Beatties]] (\u00a369m). In 2006, group was acquired by a consortium of investors (Highland Group Holdings) including Icelandic based [[Landsbanki]] (35%). An online store was launched in 2007. In 2014 the group (as Highland Group Holdings Ltd) was sold to Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co. (Sanpower Group), a leading chain of Chinese department stores for approximately \u00a3480 million.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn May 2018, the group entered a [[company voluntary arrangement]], and in June the closure of 31 stores was announced. On 10 August 2018 [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]]'s [[Sports Direct]] chain agreed to buy the business (stores, stock, brand) for \u00a390 million after the chain went into administration earlier that day.\n\n==History==\n[[File:House of Fraser, Briggate, Leeds (27th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|House of Fraser on [[Briggate]] in [[Leeds, England]]]]\n[[File:Belfast (200), October 2009.JPG|thumb|right|House of Fraser in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]]]]\n\n===The early years===\nThe company was founded by [[Hugh Fraser (retailer)|Hugh Fraser]] and James Arthur in 1849 as a small drapery shop on the corner of [[Argyle Street, Glasgow|Argyle Street]] and [[Buchanan Street]] in Glasgow, Scotland trading as Arthur and Fraser.<ref name =history>{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_71300_en.pdf |title=House of Fraser archive project |format=PDF |accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nHugh Fraser had been apprenticed to Stewart & McDonald Ltd, a [[Glasgow]] [[draper]]y warehouse where he rose to the position of warehouse manager and from where he brought many of initial customers.<ref name=history/>\n\nJames Arthur also owned a retail drapery business in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], near Glasgow: he appointed a manager to oversee the Paisley business while he focused on his new business.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe company established a [[wholesale]] trade in adjoining premises in Argyle Street. In 1856 the wholesale business moved to a larger site in Miller Street, [[Glasgow]] and started to trade under the name Arthur & Co. The retail side of the business expanded into the vacant buildings left by the wholesale side.<ref name=history/>\n\nDuring the late 1850s and early 1860s the retail business was run by a professional manager \u2013 first Thomas Kirkpatrick and then Alexander McLaren.<ref name=history/> In 1865 the partnership between the partners was dissolved and Fraser assumed control of the retail business leaving Arthur with the wholesale business. In 1865 McLaren joined the retail business and the name was changed to Fraser & McLaren.<ref name=history/>\n\n===Fraser & Sons===\nWhen the first Hugh Fraser died in 1873, his three eldest sons, James, John and Hugh, acquired stakes in the business. James and John Fraser were initially directors in the business and employed Alexander McLaren and later John Towers to manage it for them. In 1891 Hugh also joined the partnership which by then was called Fraser & Sons.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn 1879, the current flagship store on Oxford Street in London was opened by Dan Harries Evans, a 23-year-old from Whitemill in Carmarthenshire, Wales who had previously been apprenticed to a [[draper]] in Forest Hamlet near [[Merthyr Tydfil]], Wales. He moved to London in 1878 to set up his own business in [[Westminster Bridge Road]]. The store traded under the [[D H Evans]] name until 2001.<ref name=history/>\n\nBy 1900, Hugh Fraser II was in charge: he incorporated the business as Fraser & Sons Ltd in 1909 and introduced the famous stag's head motif.<ref name=history/>\n\nAfter Hugh Fraser II died in 1927, his son [[Hugh Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of Allander|Hugh Fraser III]], an accountant, became Chairman of the business.<ref name=history/> He opened new departments, enlarged the tearoom, opened a restaurant and also began to look at possible acquisitions.<ref name=history/> In 1936 he purchased Arnott & Co Ltd and its neighbour Robert Simpson & Sons Ltd in nearby Argyle Street, merging the companies to help improve trade.<ref name=history/> In 1948 the Company, now named House of Fraser, was first listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref name=history/>\n\n===1950s to 1970s===\n[[File:Kendal Milne's Deansgate.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Art Deco]] [[Kendals]] building on [[Deansgate]], Manchester, England \u2013 a House of Fraser store since 1959]]\nIn 1951, the Company purchased McDonald's Ltd, and with it a branch in [[Harrogate]].
