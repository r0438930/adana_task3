Steaua Ro\u0219ie was renamed in 1954 as ''Recolta Pecica'' and since 1965 was known as '''Progresul Pecica''' playing only at the level of the County or Districtual League (4th tier).\n\nProgresul was renamed again in 1987, this time as ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' and started to be financially supported by the Pecica Oil Scaffold. In 1992, former [[Liga III|Divizia C]] member ''Petrolul Arad/ Z\u0103d\u0103reni (est. 1983)'' merged with ''Aurul Negru Pecica (est. 1949)'' and formed a new entity, West Petrom Arad (Pecica). West Petrom was financially supported by [[Petrom]] and for 10 years (1994\u20132004) played in the third tier, but with oscillating results.\n\nIn 2001, ''Aurul Negru Pecica'' withdrew from the West Petrom Association, changed its name back to '''Progresul Pecica''' and enrolled a senior squad in the [[Liga IV|Divizia D]] \u2013 [[Liga IV Arad|Arad County]]. Progresul relegated in the [[Liga V|Honor Division]] after only one season, while West Petrom spent three more seasons in the third tier before it was dissolved.
