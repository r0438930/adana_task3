Segrave for the 1922 T.T. it achieved fastest lap both in practice and during the race but did not finish due to magneto problem.\n\nFitted with lights, self-starter and flywheel for road use by Sunbeam before it was sold in 1925. It remained largely unused until purchased by Sunbeam expert Anthony S.

It was subsequently used occasionally on the road before it was sold to the Rootes Motor Museum in 1956.\n\nIn the 1960s it passed to John T Panks (Rootes General Manager) and was restored in New York; a pair of Solexes replaced the original Claudel Hobson carburettors. In the USA it participated in various vintage speed events before it was repatriated by Panks to the U.K. where it took part in similar V.S.C.C. events.\n\nPurchased by Bentley enthusiast Guy Shoesmith in 1968 who commissioned Donald McKenzie to carry out bare chassis full mechanical restoration; new dashboard using the original instruments was made. Further V.S.C.C. events were undertaken before the car was housed in the Donington Collection. It was offered via a Phillips auction in 1988 and purchased for a private collection based in the UK.\n\n====History====\n*1921 May 30, Indianapolis 500, Ora Haiba Sunbeam no.16, 5:57:46, 83.86&nbsp;mph, 5th place, winning $3,000\n*1921 July 25, French Grand Prix de l\u2019A.C.F.

Segrave, in Brooklands for one season, tyres testing together with another illustrious Brooklands racing car \u2013 the 200 mile Alvis; the cars nicknamed \u2018Firefly I\u2019 and \u2018Firefly II\u2019 respectively.\n\nNew ownership in 1926 has given the aging racing car a second lease of life and launched it onto years of remarkable Brooklands racing success, described by William Boddy as \"the best run of success by any Brooklands\u2019 car in such a period\".<ref name=\"MS, Boddy, 537\" >{{harvnb|Boddy|4.9-litre Sunbeams| page=537 }}</ref> Racing success continued well into the 1930s when with a replacement engine it became known first as \u2018the Munday Special\u2019 and later in 1934 \u2018the Bainton Special\u2019. It was dismantled in the 1950s and later in 1988 resurrected as a 1922 Sunbeam T.T. no.1 and displayed at the Donnington Grand Prix Collection from where it passed to private collections.\n\n====History====\n; 1922\n*June IoM TT Sunbeam straight-eight three-litre\n*19 November Coppa Florio 268.5 miles (4laps) T.T. body 4.9Lt, race no. 5, 8:15:7 (32.5&nbsp;mph), H O D Segrave, 2nd\n\n; 1923\n*23 June Fanoe Island Denmark Speed Trials, 6-litre Class two-way (fs) mean speed 100&nbsp;mph, M.

Suresnes Works for the 1,500 Voiturettes class. These were in effect a smaller version of the Sunbeam 3-litre Grand Prix cars \u2013 their near identical engines built around one of the two blocks used by the G.P. cars with similar though shorter chassis. Painted blue and entered in the premium events for their class, these cars continued to dominate Voiturette racing for six years, winning every race<ref>The British Competition Car, Cyril Posthumus, 1959 p. 53 and A Souvenir of the Great Darrqcq Victory in the J.C.C. 200 Mile Race September 1924</ref> and earning the appellation \"The invincible Talbot-Darracq\".\n\nIn a sensational debut in the 1921 French Grand Prix des Voiturettes held at Le Mans, they finished first, second and third \u2013 the second time in Voiturettes racing history this has happened (the first occasion having been Sunbeam in the 1912 Coupe de l\u2019Auto).<ref name=\"LoS, 95\" >{{harvp|Lure of Speed|1928|page= 95 }}</ref> During 1921 and 1922 these ultra-reliable cars run in six races and won every one of them, regularly finishing 1-2-3.

Together with Talbot and Darracq they formed the S.T.D. Combine.<ref name=\"ME, 177\u2013180\" /> S.T.D. was to become a dominant player in Land Speed Records, Grand Prix and Voiturette racing both in Britain and abroad.<ref>The Encyclopedia of Motor Sport Edited by G N Georgano 1971 pp. 607\u2013608</ref> S.T.D. race cars using identical chassis and engines were to be designated variously as Sunbeam, [[Talbot]] or [[Darracq and Company London|Talbot Darracq]] in response to the different events or countries they took part in.<ref name=\"Borgeson, 91\" /> The highly evolved Experimental Departments in Wolverhampton and Suresnes cooperated on the meticulous development and construction of these fine wholly hand-crafted machines. These zero tolerance racing cars were milled, as it were, from solid billet.<ref>The Auto Car 1921 July 9 pp. 74\u201375</ref> Racing program was extensive; tailor-made alternative lightweight bodies, specific axle ratios and engines to suit each event were formed.<ref name=\"LoS, 75\u201379\" >{{harvp|Lure of Speed|1928|pages= 75\u201379 }}</ref> The driving force behind the S.T.D. and its racing program was the charismatic and ingenious Breton [[Louis Coatalen]]. Designer, engineer and racer Coatalen was inspired by the belief that \"Racing improves the breed\".<ref>{{harvp|Heal|1989| pages= 6, Foreword by Herve Coatalen }}</ref>\n \nWhilst catapulting S.T.D. to the highest echelons of the sport, with numerous successes still legendary today, the costly racing policy may have ultimately led to the demise of the once mighty S.T.D. Combine. Its subsequent merger with the [[Rootes Group]] was less than glorious. Conversely it may be that S.T.D.\u2019s loss of direction and withdrawal from racing in the late Vintage period was the real source of their demise.<ref name=\"Heal, 9\" >{{harvp|Heal|1989| page= 9 }}</ref>\n\nCoatalen famously held that ounces off the engine translate to pounds off the car; this simple design principal together with fastidious balancing, cooling and lubrication produced truly elegant engines.<ref>The Auto Car 1921 March 26 p. 563</ref> Coatalen's chassis behavior is near magical<ref name=\"ME, 51\u201352\" >{{harvp|Motoring Entente|1956| pages=51\u201352 }}</ref> and this together with sophisticated technical support and the greatest racing talents had led the company to a golden age of racing successes, the likes of which were not to be seen in Britain for many decades.\n\nDuring its pre 1930s heyday S.T.D. was consistently and fully committed to international racing at the highest level and was synonymous with British Racing.\n\n==Design==\n1920 November 3, S.T.D.

Modified by the Works for H.O.D. Segrave for the 1922 T.T. it achieved fastest lap both in practice and during the race but did not finish due to magneto problem.\n\nFitted with lights, self-starter and flywheel for road use by Sunbeam before it was sold in 1925. It remained largely unused until purchased by Sunbeam expert Anthony S. Heal who had Len Gibbs in 1946 comprehensively rebuild the car and paint it British Racing Green; non-original rigid pattern steering wheel fitted. It was subsequently used occasionally on the road before it was sold to the Rootes Motor Museum in 1956.\n\nIn the 1960s it passed to John T Panks (Rootes General Manager) and was restored in New York; a pair of Solexes replaced the original Claudel Hobson carburettors. In the USA it participated in various vintage speed events before it was repatriated by Panks to the U.K. where it took part in similar V.S.C.C. events.\n\nPurchased by Bentley enthusiast Guy Shoesmith in 1968 who commissioned Donald McKenzie to carry out bare chassis full mechanical restoration; new dashboard using the original instruments was made. Further V.S.C.C. events were undertaken before the car was housed in the Donington Collection. It was offered via a Phillips auction in 1988 and purchased for a private collection based in the UK.\n\n====History====\n*1921 May 30, Indianapolis 500, Ora Haiba Sunbeam no.16, 5:57:46, 83.86&nbsp;mph, 5th place, winning $3,000\n*1921 July 25, French Grand Prix de l\u2019A.C.F.

During his two-season ownership, Campbell used the car in a variety of speed events, achieving many Brooklands and Hill Climb firsts. \u2018Blue Bird\u2019 was then sold to Dunlop and driven by racing driver Paul Dutoit, erstwhile riding mechanic to H.O.D. Segrave, in Brooklands for one season, tyres testing together with another illustrious Brooklands racing car \u2013 the 200 mile Alvis; the cars nicknamed \u2018Firefly I\u2019 and \u2018Firefly II\u2019 respectively.\n\nNew ownership in 1926 has given the aging racing car a second lease of life and launched it onto years of remarkable Brooklands racing success, described by William Boddy as \"the best run of success by any Brooklands\u2019 car in such a period\".<ref name=\"MS, Boddy, 537\" >{{harvnb|Boddy|4.9-litre Sunbeams| page=537 }}</ref> Racing success continued well into the 1930s when with a replacement engine it became known first as \u2018the Munday Special\u2019 and later in 1934 \u2018the Bainton Special\u2019.
