The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]: substantially reducing the distance from [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] to [[Vladivostok]] and also linking the new port city of Dalny ([[Dalian]]) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur ([[L\u00fcshun]]). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown,\" growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars, {{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}}\n\nThe city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family wrote that in Harbin: \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}} Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play ''K zvezdam'' by [[Leonid Andreyev]] had its premiere there.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|pp=312-313}}  \u00a0\n\n[[File:Harbin 1940 st.nicolas.jpg|thumb|left|St. Nicolas Orthodox, a [[Russian Orthodox]] church in Harbin, circa 1940, demolished during the [[Cultural Revolution]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Harbin|Russian Orthodox]], [[Harbin Nangang Christian Church|Lutheran/German Protestant]], and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Harbin|Polish Catholic]] Christians.

The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]: substantially reducing the distance from [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] to [[Vladivostok]] and also linking the new port city of Dalny ([[Dalian]]) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur ([[L\u00fcshun]]). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown,\" growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars, {{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}}\n\nThe city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family wrote that in Harbin: \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}} Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play ''K zvezdam'' by [[Leonid Andreyev]] had its premiere there.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|pp=312-313}}  \u00a0\n\n[[File:Harbin 1940 st.nicolas.jpg|thumb|left|St. Nicolas Orthodox, a [[Russian Orthodox]] church in Harbin, circa 1940, demolished during the [[Cultural Revolution]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies.
