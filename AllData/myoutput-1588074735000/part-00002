Though typically thought of as an agriculturally focused organization as a result of its history, 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs. Clubs in today's 4-H world consist of a wide range of options each allowing for personal growth and career success. The 4-H [[motto]] is \"To make the best better\", while its [[slogan]] is \"Learn by doing\" (sometimes written as \"Learn to do by doing\").

The focal point of 4-H has been the idea of practical and hands-on learning, which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life. Early programs incorporated  both public and private resources. 4-H was founded with the purpose of instructing rural youth in improved farming and farm-homemaking practices. By the 1970s, it was broadening its goals to cover a full range of youth, including minorities,  and a wide range of life experiences.<ref>Rosenberg, 2015</ref>\n\nDuring this time researchers at experiment stations of the [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] and USDA saw that adults in the farming community did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults. So rural youth programs became a way to introduce new [[Timeline of agriculture and food technology|agriculture technology]] to the adults.\n\nClub work began wherever a public-spirited person did something to give rural children respect for themselves and their ways of life and it is very difficult to credit one sole individual.<ref>The Father of Wisconsin 4-H. The Ransom Asa Moore Story, Author: Gleason, Marjorie and William, Publication: 1989 Accurate Publishing & Printing Inc., pg. 9</ref> Instances of work with rural boys and girls can be found all throughout the 19th century. In the spring of 1882, [[Delaware College]] announced a statewide corn contest for boys, in which each boy was to plant a quarter of an acre, according to instructions sent out from the college, and cash prizes, certificates, and subscriptions to the ''American Agriculturalist'' were rewarded.<ref>The Father of Wisconsin 4-H.

Originally, these camps were for what was referred to as \"Corn Clubs\". Campers slept in corn fields, in tents, only to wake up and work almost the entirety of each day. Superintendent of schools G. C. Adams began a boys' corn club in [[Newton County, Georgia]], in 1904.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n4-H membership hit an all-time high in 1974 as a result of its popular educational program about nutrition, ''[[Mulligan Stew (TV series)|Mulligan Stew]]'', shown in schools and on television across the country.   Today, 4-H clubs and activities are no longer focused primarily on agricultural activities, instead emphasizing personal growth and preparation for lifelong learning.  Participation is greatest during the elementary school years, with enrollment in programs and activities peaking in the 4th grade.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn the southern United States,  in the mid-1960s 4-H began to broaden its programming to cover life experiences unrelated to agriculture.

Hall of [[Kansas]] in 1918. Some [[California]] 4-H clubs add either \"As a true 4-H member\" or \"As a loyal 4-H member\" at the beginning of the pledge. [[Minnesota]] and [[Maine]] 4-H clubs add \"for my family\" to the last line of the pledge. Originally, the pledge ended in \"and my country\".  In 1973, \"and my world\" was added.\n\nIt is a common practice to involve hand motions to accompany these spoken words.  While reciting the first line of the pledge, the speaker will point to their head with both of their hands. As the speaker recites the second line, they will place their right hand over their heart, much like during the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. For the third line, the speaker will present their hands, palm side up, before them. For the fourth line, the speaker will motion to their body down their sides. And for the final line, the speaker will usually place their right hand out for club, left hand for community, bring them together for country, and then bring their hands upwards in a circle for world.\n\n==Emblem==\n[[File:Oldham County, TX, 4-H emblem IMG 4911.JPG|thumb|4-H emblem in [[Oldham County, Texas|Oldham County]] in [[Vega, Texas|Vega]] west of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThe official 4-H emblem is a green [[four-leaf clover]] with a white ''H'' on each leaf standing for ''Head'', ''Heart'', ''Hands'', and ''Health''. The stem of the clover always points to the right.\n\nThe idea of using the four-leaf clover as an emblem for the 4-H program is credited to Oscar Herman Benson (1875\u20131951) of Wright County Iowa.

State 4-H Club Leader William H. \"Teepi\" Kendrick sought to develop youth to \"be yourself at your best\" and to \"make the best better\" through a fourfold personal development pattern involving the head, hands, heart, and, at that time, hustle.  It was with this philosophy, in collaboration with others, that the 4-H emblem was born. In an attempt to harbor further individual growth, Kendrick recognized excellence with pins bearing one, two, three, and four H's.  Recognition for outstanding participation was rewarded from 1917 to 1921 with trips to a Prize Winner's Course at [[West Virginia University]].  Members who demonstrated outstanding qualities at these courses were awarded five-pointed red pins with five H's, with this additional ''H'' to symbolize honor.  The recipients of these pins were referred to by Kendrick as \"All Stars\". It was following the pin consecration ceremony in 1919 that the official West Virginia 4-H All Stars organization was chartered, becoming the Alpha Chapter of the nationwide 4-H honorary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wv4hallstars.org/History.html |title=West Virginia 4-H All Star History |publisher=West Virginia 4-H All Star Website |accessdate=2010-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624014959/http://www.wv4hallstars.org/History.html |archive-date=2009-06-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMany states have All Star programs, although All Star programs vary from state to state.

The focal point of 4-H has been the idea of practical and hands-on learning, which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life. Early programs incorporated  both public and private resources. 4-H was founded with the purpose of instructing rural youth in improved farming and farm-homemaking practices. By the 1970s, it was broadening its goals to cover a full range of youth, including minorities,  and a wide range of life experiences.<ref>Rosenberg, 2015</ref>\n\nDuring this time researchers at experiment stations of the [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] and USDA saw that adults in the farming community did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults. So rural youth programs became a way to introduce new [[Timeline of agriculture and food technology|agriculture technology]] to the adults.\n\nClub work began wherever a public-spirited person did something to give rural children respect for themselves and their ways of life and it is very difficult to credit one sole individual.<ref>The Father of Wisconsin 4-H.

Hall of [[Kansas]] in 1918. Some [[California]] 4-H clubs add either \"As a true 4-H member\" or \"As a loyal 4-H member\" at the beginning of the pledge. [[Minnesota]] and [[Maine]] 4-H clubs add \"for my family\" to the last line of the pledge. Originally, the pledge ended in \"and my country\".  In 1973, \"and my world\" was added.\n\nIt is a common practice to involve hand motions to accompany these spoken words.  While reciting the first line of the pledge, the speaker will point to their head with both of their hands. As the speaker recites the second line, they will place their right hand over their heart, much like during the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. For the third line, the speaker will present their hands, palm side up, before them. For the fourth line, the speaker will motion to their body down their sides.

The stem of the clover always points to the right.\n\nThe idea of using the four-leaf clover as an emblem for the 4-H program is credited to Oscar Herman Benson (1875\u20131951) of Wright County Iowa. He awarded three-leaf and four-leaf clover pennants and pins for students' agricultural and domestic science exhibits at school fairs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://riley.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=8&tax_level=4&tax_subject=158&topic_id=1982&level3_id=6419&level4_id=10863&level5_id=0&placement_default=0&test# |title=Elsie Carper Collection on Extension Service, Home Economics, and 4-H |publisher=National Agricultural Library |accessdate=2010-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414034134/http://riley.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=8&tax_level=4&tax_subject=158&topic_id=1982&level3_id=6419&level4_id=10863&level5_id=0&placement_default=0&test |archive-date=2010-04-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe 4-H name and emblem have U.S. federal protection, under federal code 18 U.S.C. 707.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+466+0++|title=U.S. House of Representatives, 18 USC Sec. 707, 4-H club emblem fraudulently used|publisher=Office of the Law Revision Counsel|accessdate=2010-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303092055/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+466+0++|archive-date=2012-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> This federal protection makes it a mark unto and of itself with protection that supersedes the limited authorities of both a [[trademark]] and a [[copyright]].

Youth development research is undertaken in a variety of forms including program evaluation, applied research, and introduction of new programs.\n\n==Volunteers==\nVolunteering has deep roots in American society.  Over half of the American people will volunteer in some capacity during a year's time.  It is estimated that 44% of adults (over 83.9 million people) will volunteer within a year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}  This volunteerism is valued at over $239 billion per year.

They perform a variety of roles, functions and tasks to coordinate the 4-H program at the county level and come from all walks of life, bringing varied and rich experiences to the 4-H program.  With over 540,000 volunteers nationally, these leaders play an essential role in the delivery of 4-H programs and provide learning opportunities to promote positive youth development.  Every year, volunteer leaders work to carry out 4-H youth development programs, project groups, camps, conferences, animal shows and many more 4-H related activities and events.  4-H volunteer leaders help youth to achieve greater self-confidence and self-responsibility, learn new skills and build relationships with others that will last a lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Journal of Extension (JOE) |url=http://www.joe.org/joe/2011august/rb2.php |title=Relationships Between 4-H Volunteer Leader Competencies and Skills Youth Learn in 4-H Programs |publisher=The Journal of Extension |date= |accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\nVolunteers serve in many diverse roles. Some are project leaders who teach youth skills and knowledge in an area of interest. Others are unit or community club leaders who organize clubs meetings and other programs.

Results of retrospective pre/post-surveys indicate that children enrolled in the program showed life skill gain over time, and that gains on specific life skills differed as a function of age, gender, and ethnicity.\n\nThe life skills gained through 4-H Afterschool give children the tools they need for perceiving and responding to diverse life situations and achieving their personal goals.

Usually members are students who are 4-H alumni and want to continue a connection to 4-H, but any interested students are welcome. Clubs provide service and support to their local and state 4-H programs, such as serving as judges and conducting training workshops. They are also a service and social group for campus students. The very first collegiate 4-H club started in 1916 on the [[Oklahoma State University - Stillwater]] campus.\n\n===All Stars===\nFinding its roots in the early 4-H movement in [[West Virginia]], the 4-H All-Star program strives to recognize and challenge 4-H members and volunteers.  State 4-H Club Leader William H. \"Teepi\" Kendrick sought to develop youth to \"be yourself at your best\" and to \"make the best better\" through a fourfold personal development pattern involving the head, hands, heart, and, at that time, hustle.  It was with this philosophy, in collaboration with others, that the 4-H emblem was born. In an attempt to harbor further individual growth, Kendrick recognized excellence with pins bearing one, two, three, and four H's.  Recognition for outstanding participation was rewarded from 1917 to 1921 with trips to a Prize Winner's Course at [[West Virginia University]].  Members who demonstrated outstanding qualities at these courses were awarded five-pointed red pins with five H's, with this additional ''H'' to symbolize honor.  The recipients of these pins were referred to by Kendrick as \"All Stars\". It was following the pin consecration ceremony in 1919 that the official West Virginia 4-H All Stars organization was chartered, becoming the Alpha Chapter of the nationwide 4-H honorary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wv4hallstars.org/History.html |title=West Virginia 4-H All Star History |publisher=West Virginia 4-H All Star Website |accessdate=2010-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624014959/http://www.wv4hallstars.org/History.html |archive-date=2009-06-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMany states have All Star programs, although All Star programs vary from state to state.
