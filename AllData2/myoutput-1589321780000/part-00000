The painting was historically displayed above the Vilnius city gate; city gates of the time often contained religious artifacts intended to ward off attacks and bless passing travelers.\n\nThe painting is in the [[Northern Renaissance]] style and was completed most likely around 1630. The [[Madonna (art)|Virgin Mary]] is depicted without the infant Jesus. The artwork soon became known as miraculous and inspired a following. A dedicated chapel was built in 1671 by the [[Discalced Carmelites]]. At the same time, possibly borrowing from the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, the painting was covered in [[riza|expensive and elaborate silver and gold clothes]] leaving only the face and hands visible.\n\nThe legend tells that in 1702, when [[Battle of Vilnius (1702)|Vilnius was captured]] by the Swedish army during the [[Great Northern War]], ''Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn'' came to her people's rescue. At dawn, the heavy iron city gates fell, crushing and killing four Swedish soldiers. After this, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] Army successfully counter-attacked near the gate.\n\nIn the following centuries, the following grew stronger and ''Our Lady'' became an important part of religious life in Vilnius. The following inspired many copies in Lithuania, Poland, and diaspora communities worldwide. On 5 July 1927, the image was [[canonical coronation|canonically crowned]] as ''Mother of Mercy''. The chapel was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1993. It is a major site of pilgrimage in Vilnius and attracts many visitors, especially from Poland.<ref name=geo/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gate of Dawn Exterior, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|left|thumb|The Gate of Dawn in [[Vilnius]]; the painting can be seen through the glass window]]\n\nIt is believed that the painting was commissioned by the government of Vilnius.<ref name=obst/> It was customary to place paintings or sculptures of various saints in [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s of walls hoping that they would protect the building.<ref name=jurg/> The governor of Vilnius ordered two paintings, one depicting Christ the Saviour (''[[Salvator Mundi]]''), and the other the Virgin Mary.<ref name=obst/> Both of them decorated the [[Gate of Dawn]] of the [[Vilnius city wall]] \u2013 a defensive structure with no religious importance at the time. The painting of Christ decorated the exterior of the gate, while that of the Virgin was in the same place as it is now \u2013 a small niche, protected by shutters from rain and snow.<ref name=obst/> Narrow and steep stairs led to a small balcony where the faithful could light candles and pray.<ref name=jurg/> In 1650, [[Albert Wijuk Koja\u0142owicz]] published ''Miscellanea'', listing all miraculous paintings of Mary, but did not mention ''Our Lady of the Gate of the Dawn''.<ref name=obst/>\n\nIn the mid-17th century the [[Discalced Carmelites]] built the Church of Saint Teresa and their monastery near the Gate of Dawn.<ref name=jurg/> In 1655, the city was captured, looted, and depopulated during the [[Battle of Vilnius (1655)|Battle of Vilnius]] of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War]]. It was likely that the city government, short of funds, transferred maintenance of the gate and the paintings to the Carmelites.<ref name=jurg/> The painting of Christ was moved to the Carmelite monastery and later to [[Vilnius Cathedral]] (a fresco of Jesus was painted in its original niche in the 19th century; it was uncovered in 1976).<ref name=bern/> In 1671, the monks built a wooden chapel to Our Lady next to the gate tower; it was around the time that the painting was covered in expensive silver clothes. By then, the painting was already an object of public veneration and the chapel dedication ceremony was attended by many prominent figures of the time including Chancellor [[Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac]], Grand Hetman [[Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac]], and senators of the [[general sejm]].<ref name=conf/>\n\n[[File:Vilnia, Vostraja Brama, Kaplica. \u0412\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044f, \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430, \u041a\u0430\u043f\u043b\u0456\u0446\u0430 (V. Adam, 1847).jpg|thumb|Interior of the chapel of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn (1847)]]\nIn May 1715, the wooden chapel burnt down, but the painting was saved and placed in the Church of St Teresa. In 1720, the current brick chapel was dedicated in the presence of four bishops, a number of senators, and a large crowd of the faithful.<ref name=obst/> In 1761, the monk Hilarion published ''Relacja o cudownym Obrazie Naij\u015bwi\u0119tszej Marji Panny etc'', the primary source for the painting's early history and also the first collection of various miracles attributed to it. In 1773 [[Pope Clement XIV]] granted an [[indulgence]] to the faithful, designating the chapel as a place of public worship, and established a charitable society.<ref name=conf/> At the turn of the 19th century, [[Russian Empire|Tsarist authorities]] demolished the city wall and all the city's gates, except the Gate of Dawn and its chapel. In 1829, the chapel underwent restoration and acquired elements of late [[Neoclassicism]]. Since the entrance to the chapel was from inside the Carmelite monastery, women could not go inside. Because of this, one female devotee sponsored the construction of a two-storey gallery on the side of the street in 1830.<ref name=obst/>\n\nIn 1927, major restoration works were completed under bishop [[Romuald Ja\u0142brzykowski]]. With permission from [[Pope Pius XI]], the painting was solemnly crowned ''Mother of Mercy'' on 2 July 1927 by the [[Archbishop of Warsaw]] [[Alexander Kakowski|Alexander Cardinal Kakowski]]. The ceremony was attended by [[President of Poland|President]] [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]], First Marshal [[Jozef Pilsudski]], [[Primate of Poland]] [[August Hlond]], 28 other bishops, and other dignitaries.<ref name=conf/>\n\n==Painting==\n\n===Origin and inspiration===\nThe origin of the painting is not known. According to historian [[Teodor Narbutt]] (1784\u20131864),<ref name=jurg/> the painting was acquired by [[Algirdas]], [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] (c. 1296\u20131377), as a war trophy from [[Crimea]]. This note, based on dubious sources, along with dark colors of the painting that resembled [[Byzantine art|Byzantine icons]], inspired 19th-century Russian historians to claim that the painting was [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and not [[Roman Catholic]].<ref name=jurg/> This theory was popularized in various articles, brochures, studies and is sometimes quoted today.<ref name=tom/> Others claimed that the painting was commissioned by King of Poland [[Sigismund II Augustus]] and depicted his wife [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142]].<ref name=bern/>\n\nWith silver cloth covering the entire painting, except for the face and hands, it was very hard for art historians to determine in what period the painting was created.<ref name=jurg/> In 1927, the silver cover was removed for the first time in decades. The painting was analyzed and restored. Based on the new data gathered during the restoration, Mieczys\u0142aw Skrudlik came to a conclusion that the painting was completed around 1630\u201350 and linked it with another painting in the Corpus Christi Church in [[Krak\u00f3w]], created by artist Luke in 1624.<ref name=conf/> Mary Ka\u0142amajska Saeed in her 1990 thesis argued that ''Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn'' was a work of a local artist and was inspired by contemporary [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Mannerism|mannerist]] painter [[Marten de Vos]] through an engraving of [[Thomas de Leu]].<ref name=conf/><ref name=paint/> In 1993, on the occasion of pope's visit, the painting was restored and one of its planks was [[Dendrochronology|dated based on its tree-rings]]. The scientists concluded that the oak grew in 1434\u20131620.<ref name=surdo/>\n\n===Description===\n[[File:Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn Interior During Service, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|250px|Chapel of the Gate of Dawn]]\nThe original painting is {{convert|163|x|200|cm}} and was painted by an unknown artist on 8 [[oak]] planks {{convert|2|cm|adj=on}} thick. As usual for Northern Europe, a very thin layer of chalk priming was applied to the planks before painting in [[tempera]].<ref name=paint/> Later ''Our Lady'' was repainted in [[oil paint]]. Some restoration work was completed in the mid-19th century. Major restoration works were completed in 1927.\n\nThe painting depicts complex personality and devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning to her right, her eyes are half closed, her hands are crossed in devotion; this reminds that she is a virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people.<ref name=bern/> At the same time, her head is surrounded by an [[aureola]] with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the [[Queen of Heaven]].<ref name=bern/> The painting also reminds of ''[[Tota pulchra es]]'' (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.<ref name=icon/>\n\n===Casing===\n[[File:NMP Ostrobramska.JPG|thumb|left|288px|Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]]\nThe tradition to decorate paintings with clothes or revetment ([[riza]]) of precious metals may have been borrowed from Eastern Orthodoxy. The clothing of ''Our Lady'' is composed of three [[gilding|gilded]] silver parts, each completed by different artists at a different period. The head and shoulders were covered in 1670\u201390; the chest piece was adapted from a different painting in 1695\u20131700; the bottom of the painting was completed by the 1730s.<ref name=cloth/> The clothes are richly decorated in floral motifs: roses, tulips, [[narcissi]], [[carnation]]s,<ref name=venc/> and at least six other species.<ref name=cloth/>\n\nThe flowers were references to ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' (enclosed garden), and a symbol of Mary's virginity and purity.<ref name=cloth/> The [[circle of stars]] represents the [[immaculate conception]]. The head of ''Our Lady'' is adorned with two crowns. Two little angels lower the large [[Rococo]]-style crown with colored glass inlays upon the smaller [[Baroque]] crown.<ref name=cloth/> Some argued that the two crowns, resembling royal and ducal insignia, represented the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] respectively.<ref name=xxi/> In 1927, duplicate crowns were made of pure gold, donated by the people, and were blessed by [[Pope Pius XI]].<ref name=cloth/> On 2 July 1927 the [[Canonical Coronation]] took place and the painting received the title of ''Mother of Mercy''. The gold crowns were lost, possibly during World War II.<ref name=cloth/>\n\nSculptures of Mary's parents \u2013 [[St Joachim]] and [[St Anne]] \u2013 stand on both sides of the painting between the altar columns.<ref name=icon/>\n{{Clear}}<!-- don't remove technical -->\n\n==Veneration==\n\n===Miracles and votive offerings===\n[[File:Gateofdawn Vilnius fc03.jpg|thumb|Detail of votive offerings]]\nIn 1761, the monk Hilarion published a book enumerating 17 miracles attributed to the painting and the Virgin Mary. The first miracle he recorded occurred in 1671, the same year the first chapel was built. A two-year-old child fell from the second floor onto a stone pavement and was badly injured. The parents then prayed to ''Our Lady'' and the next day the child was healthy once again.<ref name=mira/> In 1702, Vilnius was captured by the Swedish Army during the [[Great Northern War]]. The Swedes, who were [[Protestants]], mocked the painting, forbade songs and prayers, and caroused around the Gate of Dawn. One soldier even shot at the painting (the bullet hole can still be seen on the right sleeve).<ref name=obst/> In the early morning of [[Great and Holy Saturday]], the heavy iron gates fell and crushed four Swedish soldiers \u2013 two died instantly and two later from their injuries.<ref name=obst/> The next day, [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], the Lithuanian Army [[Battle of Vilnius (1702)|successfully counter-attacked]] near the gate. The commander, grateful for the victory, bestowed a large silver [[votive offering]] upon the chapel.<ref name=jurg/> The painting is also credited with other miracles: subduing a city fire in 1706, punishing a Russian soldier for an attempt to steal her silver clothes in 1708,<ref name=mira/> and numerous [[faith healing|miraculous healings]]. Other stories of various miracles were kept by the Carmelite monks, but those books have not survived.<ref name=obst/>\n\nVotive offerings became a tradition. They are usually small silver objects (hearts, crucifixes, figures of praying people, images of cured eyes, legs, arms).<ref name=votum/> Several times (1799, 1808, 1810) some of these objects were taken down and melted into liturgical objects. In 1844 there was a total of 785 offerings.<ref name=votum/> Twelve years later, in 1856, the number had almost doubled to 1,438. From 1884 to 1927 a journal of new offerings was kept. During that time 2,539 new gifts were registered.<ref name=votum/> Currently, there are about 8,000 silver votive objects in the chapel.<ref name=venc/> The large [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] located right beneath ''Our Lady'' is also a votive offering. Its origins are unknown but it bears an inscription in Polish and a date of 1849.<ref name=cloth/> The crescent goes well with the silver cloth, adding additional parallels with the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], described in the [[Book of Revelation]] as ''a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars''.<ref name=luigi/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coleccionbbva.com/media/files/P02146_Detailed%20analysis.pdf |title=Anonymous, Cordoba (circle of Antonio del Castillo) |publisher=Colecci\u00f3n BBVA |accessdate=2014-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Divine Mercy===\nThe icon of ''Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn'' has become associated with the messages of [[Divine Mercy]]. Eight years after the icon was conferred the title of ''Mother of Mercy'', the first exposition of the [[Divine Mercy image]], painted by [[Eugene Kazimierowski]] under the direction of Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]], took place at the chapel on April 1935.<ref>''Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul'' \u00a789; https://liturgicalyear.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/divine-mercy-in-my-soul.pdf</ref> In her ''[[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul]]'', she writes of a mystical experience involving the icon in the Gate of Dawn chapel.  On 15 November 1935, Saint Faustina was at the Gate of Dawn chapel participating in the last day of the novena before the feast day of the icon, 16 November. She writes of seeing the icon taking on \"a living appearance\" and speaking to her, telling her \"accept all that God asked of me like a little child, without questioning; otherwise it would not be pleasing to God.\"<ref>''Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul'' \u00a7529; https://liturgicalyear.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/divine-mercy-in-my-soul.pdf</ref>\n\n===Shrines in other locations===\n[[File:Katedra V WBAK.jpg|thumb|Chapel devoted to ''Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn'' in the [[St. Mary's Church, Gdansk|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Gda\u0144sk]]]]\n[[File:Lietuvi\u0173 Koply\u010dia.jpg|thumb|Lithuanian Chapel ({{lang-it|Cappella Lituana}}) in the [[St. Peter's Basilica]]]]\nToday this holy image is venerated by [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faithful of many countries whose origins lie in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], including [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and their [[diaspora]]s worldwide. In Lithuania itself there are 15 churches as well as Lithuanian parishes in [[Montreal]] and [[Buenos Aires]] devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Gate of Dawn.

The painting was historically displayed above the Vilnius city gate; city gates of the time often contained religious artifacts intended to ward off attacks and bless passing travelers.\n\nThe painting is in the [[Northern Renaissance]] style and was completed most likely around 1630. The [[Madonna (art)|Virgin Mary]] is depicted without the infant Jesus. The artwork soon became known as miraculous and inspired a following. A dedicated chapel was built in 1671 by the [[Discalced Carmelites]]. At the same time, possibly borrowing from the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, the painting was covered in [[riza|expensive and elaborate silver and gold clothes]] leaving only the face and hands visible.\n\nThe legend tells that in 1702, when [[Battle of Vilnius (1702)|Vilnius was captured]] by the Swedish army during the [[Great Northern War]], ''Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn'' came to her people's rescue. At dawn, the heavy iron city gates fell, crushing and killing four Swedish soldiers. After this, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] Army successfully counter-attacked near the gate.\n\nIn the following centuries, the following grew stronger and ''Our Lady'' became an important part of religious life in Vilnius. The following inspired many copies in Lithuania, Poland, and diaspora communities worldwide. On 5 July 1927, the image was [[canonical coronation|canonically crowned]] as ''Mother of Mercy''. The chapel was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1993. It is a major site of pilgrimage in Vilnius and attracts many visitors, especially from Poland.<ref name=geo/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gate of Dawn Exterior, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|left|thumb|The Gate of Dawn in [[Vilnius]]; the painting can be seen through the glass window]]\n\nIt is believed that the painting was commissioned by the government of Vilnius.<ref name=obst/> It was customary to place paintings or sculptures of various saints in [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s of walls hoping that they would protect the building.<ref name=jurg/> The governor of Vilnius ordered two paintings, one depicting Christ the Saviour (''[[Salvator Mundi]]''), and the other the Virgin Mary.<ref name=obst/> Both of them decorated the [[Gate of Dawn]] of the [[Vilnius city wall]] \u2013 a defensive structure with no religious importance at the time. The painting of Christ decorated the exterior of the gate, while that of the Virgin was in the same place as it is now \u2013 a small niche, protected by shutters from rain and snow.<ref name=obst/> Narrow and steep stairs led to a small balcony where the faithful could light candles and pray.<ref name=jurg/> In 1650, [[Albert Wijuk Koja\u0142owicz]] published ''Miscellanea'', listing all miraculous paintings of Mary, but did not mention ''Our Lady of the Gate of the Dawn''.<ref name=obst/>\n\nIn the mid-17th century the [[Discalced Carmelites]] built the Church of Saint Teresa and their monastery near the Gate of Dawn.<ref name=jurg/> In 1655, the city was captured, looted, and depopulated during the [[Battle of Vilnius (1655)|Battle of Vilnius]] of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War]]. It was likely that the city government, short of funds, transferred maintenance of the gate and the paintings to the Carmelites.<ref name=jurg/> The painting of Christ was moved to the Carmelite monastery and later to [[Vilnius Cathedral]] (a fresco of Jesus was painted in its original niche in the 19th century; it was uncovered in 1976).<ref name=bern/> In 1671, the monks built a wooden chapel to Our Lady next to the gate tower; it was around the time that the painting was covered in expensive silver clothes. By then, the painting was already an object of public veneration and the chapel dedication ceremony was attended by many prominent figures of the time including Chancellor [[Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac]], Grand Hetman [[Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac]], and senators of the [[general sejm]].<ref name=conf/>\n\n[[File:Vilnia, Vostraja Brama, Kaplica. \u0412\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044f, \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430, \u041a\u0430\u043f\u043b\u0456\u0446\u0430 (V. Adam, 1847).jpg|thumb|Interior of the chapel of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn (1847)]]\nIn May 1715, the wooden chapel burnt down, but the painting was saved and placed in the Church of St Teresa. In 1720, the current brick chapel was dedicated in the presence of four bishops, a number of senators, and a large crowd of the faithful.<ref name=obst/> In 1761, the monk Hilarion published ''Relacja o cudownym Obrazie Naij\u015bwi\u0119tszej Marji Panny etc'', the primary source for the painting's early history and also the first collection of various miracles attributed to it. In 1773 [[Pope Clement XIV]] granted an [[indulgence]] to the faithful, designating the chapel as a place of public worship, and established a charitable society.<ref name=conf/> At the turn of the 19th century, [[Russian Empire|Tsarist authorities]] demolished the city wall and all the city's gates, except the Gate of Dawn and its chapel. In 1829, the chapel underwent restoration and acquired elements of late [[Neoclassicism]]. Since the entrance to the chapel was from inside the Carmelite monastery, women could not go inside. Because of this, one female devotee sponsored the construction of a two-storey gallery on the side of the street in 1830.<ref name=obst/>\n\nIn 1927, major restoration works were completed under bishop [[Romuald Ja\u0142brzykowski]]. With permission from [[Pope Pius XI]], the painting was solemnly crowned ''Mother of Mercy'' on 2 July 1927 by the [[Archbishop of Warsaw]] [[Alexander Kakowski|Alexander Cardinal Kakowski]]. The ceremony was attended by [[President of Poland|President]] [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]], First Marshal [[Jozef Pilsudski]], [[Primate of Poland]] [[August Hlond]], 28 other bishops, and other dignitaries.<ref name=conf/>\n\n==Painting==\n\n===Origin and inspiration===\nThe origin of the painting is not known. According to historian [[Teodor Narbutt]] (1784\u20131864),<ref name=jurg/> the painting was acquired by [[Algirdas]], [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] (c. 1296\u20131377), as a war trophy from [[Crimea]]. This note, based on dubious sources, along with dark colors of the painting that resembled [[Byzantine art|Byzantine icons]], inspired 19th-century Russian historians to claim that the painting was [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and not [[Roman Catholic]].<ref name=jurg/> This theory was popularized in various articles, brochures, studies and is sometimes quoted today.<ref name=tom/> Others claimed that the painting was commissioned by King of Poland [[Sigismund II Augustus]] and depicted his wife [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142]].<ref name=bern/>\n\nWith silver cloth covering the entire painting, except for the face and hands, it was very hard for art historians to determine in what period the painting was created.<ref name=jurg/> In 1927, the silver cover was removed for the first time in decades. The painting was analyzed and restored. Based on the new data gathered during the restoration, Mieczys\u0142aw Skrudlik came to a conclusion that the painting was completed around 1630\u201350 and linked it with another painting in the Corpus Christi Church in [[Krak\u00f3w]], created by artist Luke in 1624.<ref name=conf/> Mary Ka\u0142amajska Saeed in her 1990 thesis argued that ''Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn'' was a work of a local artist and was inspired by contemporary [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Mannerism|mannerist]] painter [[Marten de Vos]] through an engraving of [[Thomas de Leu]].<ref name=conf/><ref name=paint/> In 1993, on the occasion of pope's visit, the painting was restored and one of its planks was [[Dendrochronology|dated based on its tree-rings]]. The scientists concluded that the oak grew in 1434\u20131620.<ref name=surdo/>\n\n===Description===\n[[File:Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn Interior During Service, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|250px|Chapel of the Gate of Dawn]]\nThe original painting is {{convert|163|x|200|cm}} and was painted by an unknown artist on 8 [[oak]] planks {{convert|2|cm|adj=on}} thick. As usual for Northern Europe, a very thin layer of chalk priming was applied to the planks before painting in [[tempera]].<ref name=paint/> Later ''Our Lady'' was repainted in [[oil paint]]. Some restoration work was completed in the mid-19th century. Major restoration works were completed in 1927.\n\nThe painting depicts complex personality and devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning to her right, her eyes are half closed, her hands are crossed in devotion; this reminds that she is a virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people.<ref name=bern/> At the same time, her head is surrounded by an [[aureola]] with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the [[Queen of Heaven]].<ref name=bern/> The painting also reminds of ''[[Tota pulchra es]]'' (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.<ref name=icon/>\n\n===Casing===\n[[File:NMP Ostrobramska.JPG|thumb|left|288px|Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]]\nThe tradition to decorate paintings with clothes or revetment ([[riza]]) of precious metals may have been borrowed from Eastern Orthodoxy. The clothing of ''Our Lady'' is composed of three [[gilding|gilded]] silver parts, each completed by different artists at a different period. The head and shoulders were covered in 1670\u201390; the chest piece was adapted from a different painting in 1695\u20131700; the bottom of the painting was completed by the 1730s.<ref name=cloth/> The clothes are richly decorated in floral motifs: roses, tulips, [[narcissi]], [[carnation]]s,<ref name=venc/> and at least six other species.<ref name=cloth/>\n\nThe flowers were references to ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' (enclosed garden), and a symbol of Mary's virginity and purity.<ref name=cloth/> The [[circle of stars]] represents the [[immaculate conception]]. The head of ''Our Lady'' is adorned with two crowns. Two little angels lower the large [[Rococo]]-style crown with colored glass inlays upon the smaller [[Baroque]] crown.<ref name=cloth/> Some argued that the two crowns, resembling royal and ducal insignia, represented the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] respectively.<ref name=xxi/> In 1927, duplicate crowns were made of pure gold, donated by the people, and were blessed by [[Pope Pius XI]].<ref name=cloth/> On July 2, 1927, the [[Canonical Coronation]] took place and painting received the title of ''Mother of Mercy''. The gold crowns were lost, possibly during World War II.<ref name=cloth/>\n\nSculptures of Mary's parents \u2013 [[St Joachim]] and [[St Anne]] \u2013 stand on both sides of the painting between the altar columns.<ref name=icon/>\n{{Clear}}<!-- don't remove technical -->\n\n==Veneration==\n\n===Miracles and votive offerings===\n[[File:Gateofdawn Vilnius fc03.jpg|thumb|Detail of votive offerings]]\nIn 1761, the monk Hilarion published a book enumerating 17 miracles attributed to the painting and the Virgin Mary. The first miracle he recorded occurred in 1671, the same year the first chapel was built. A two-year-old child fell from the second floor onto a stone pavement and was badly injured. The parents then prayed to ''Our Lady'' and the next day the child was healthy once again.<ref name=mira/> In 1702, Vilnius was captured by the Swedish Army during the [[Great Northern War]]. The Swedes, who were [[Protestants]], mocked the painting, forbade songs and prayers, and caroused around the Gate of Dawn. One soldier even shot at the painting (the bullet hole can still be seen on the right sleeve).<ref name=obst/> In the early morning of [[Great and Holy Saturday]], the heavy iron gates fell and crushed four Swedish soldiers \u2013 two died instantly and two later from their injuries.<ref name=obst/> The next day, [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], the Lithuanian Army [[Battle of Vilnius (1702)|successfully counter-attacked]] near the gate. The commander, grateful for the victory, bestowed a large silver [[votive offering]] upon the chapel.<ref name=jurg/> The painting is also credited with other miracles: subduing a city fire in 1706, punishing a Russian soldier for an attempt to steal her silver clothes in 1708,<ref name=mira/> and numerous [[faith healing|miraculous healings]]. Other stories of various miracles were kept by the Carmelite monks, but those books have not survived.<ref name=obst/>\n\nVotive offerings became a tradition. They are usually small silver objects (hearts, crucifixes, figures of praying people, images of cured eyes, legs, arms).<ref name=votum/> Several times (1799, 1808, 1810) some of these objects were taken down and melted into liturgical objects. In 1844 there was a total of 785 offerings.<ref name=votum/> Twelve years later, in 1856, the number had almost doubled to 1,438. From 1884 to 1927 a journal of new offerings was kept. During that time 2,539 new gifts were registered.<ref name=votum/> Currently, there are about 8,000 silver votive objects in the chapel.<ref name=venc/> The large [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] located right beneath ''Our Lady'' is also a votive offering. Its origins are unknown but it bears an inscription in Polish and a date of 1849.<ref name=cloth/> The crescent goes well with the silver cloth, adding additional parallels with the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], described in the [[Book of Revelation]] as ''a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars''.<ref name=luigi/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coleccionbbva.com/media/files/P02146_Detailed%20analysis.pdf |title=Anonymous, Cordoba (circle of Antonio del Castillo) |publisher=Colecci\u00f3n BBVA |accessdate=2014-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Divine Mercy===\nThe icon of ''Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn'' has become associated with the messages of [[Divine Mercy]]. Eight years after the icon was conferred the title of ''Mother of Mercy'', the first exposition of the [[Divine Mercy image]], painted by [[Eugene Kazimierowski]] under the direction of Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]], took place at the chapel on April 1935.<ref>''Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul'' \u00a789; https://liturgicalyear.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/divine-mercy-in-my-soul.pdf</ref> In her ''[[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul]]'', she writes of a mystical experience involving the icon in the Gate of Dawn chapel.  On 15 November 1935, Saint Faustina was at the Gate of Dawn chapel participating in the last day of the novena before the feast day of the icon, 16 November. She writes of seeing the icon taking on \"a living appearance\" and speaking to her, telling her \"accept all that God asked of me like a little child, without questioning; otherwise it would not be pleasing to God.\"<ref>''Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul'' \u00a7529; https://liturgicalyear.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/divine-mercy-in-my-soul.pdf</ref>\n\n===Shrines in other locations===\n[[File:Katedra V WBAK.jpg|thumb|Chapel devoted to ''Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn'' in the [[St. Mary's Church, Gdansk|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Gda\u0144sk]]]]\n[[File:Lietuvi\u0173 Koply\u010dia.jpg|thumb|Lithuanian Chapel ({{lang-it|Cappella Lituana}}) in the [[St. Peter's Basilica]]]]\nToday this holy image is venerated by [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faithful of many countries whose origins lie in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], including [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and their [[diaspora]]s worldwide.
