He painted marine landscapes in a free manner and is regarded as a forerunner of [[Impressionism]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Johan_Barthold_Jongkind_-_Overschie_bij_maneschijn.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Overschie in the Moonlight'', 1871, [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]\n\n[[File:Johan Barthold Jongkind The Seine and Notre-Dame in Paris.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''The Seine and Notre-Dame in Paris'', 1864, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nJongkind was born in the town of [[Lattrop]] in the [[Overijssel]] province of the [[Netherlands]] near the border with [[Germany]]. Trained at the art academy in [[The Hague]] under [[Andreas Schelfhout]], in 1846 he moved to [[Montparnasse]] in [[Paris, France]] where he studied under [[Eug\u00e8ne Isabey]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois-\u00c9douard Picot]]. Two years later, the [[Paris Salon]] accepted his work for its exhibition, and he received acclaim from critic [[Charles Baudelaire]] and later on from [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. He was to experience little success, however, and he suffered bouts of [[Clinical depression|depression]] complicated by [[alcoholism]].<ref name=\"Oxford\" />\n\nJongkind returned to live in [[Rotterdam]] in 1855, and remained there until 1860.<ref name=\"Oxford\">Oxford Art Online: \"Johan Barthold Jongkind\"</ref> Back in Paris, in 1861 he rented a studio on the rue de Chevreuse in [[Montparnasse]] where some of his paintings began to show glimpses of the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] style to come. In 1862 he met in [[Normandy]], in the famous ''[[ferme Saint-Sim\u00e9on]]'' in [[Honfleur]], with some of his artist friends, such as [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], and the young [[Claude Monet]], to all of whom Jongkind served as a mentor.  Monet later referred to him as \"...a quiet man with such a talent that is beyond words\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} and credited the \"definitive education\" of his own eye to Jongkind.<ref name=\"Boorsch&Marciari246\">Boorsch & Marciari, p. 246.</ref> In 1863 Jongkind exhibited at the first [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]]. He was invited to participate in the first exhibition of the Impressionist group in 1874, but he declined.<ref>University of California et al. 1974, p. 31.</ref>\n\nIn 1878, Jongkind and his companion Jos\u00e9phine Fesser moved to live in the small town of [[La C\u00f4te-Saint-Andr\u00e9]] near [[Grenoble]] in the [[Is\u00e8re]] [[d\u00e9partement]] in the southeast of France. He died in 1891 in [[Saint-\u00c9gr\u00e8ve]], in the same d\u00e9partement. He is buried in the cemetery of La C\u00f4te-Saint-Andr\u00e9. A street is named after him in the neighborhood of streets named after 19th- and 20th-century Dutch painters in [[Overtoomse Veld]]-Noord, Amsterdam.\n\n==Commemoration==\nOn 2 June 2019, a statue of Jongkind made by Dutch sculptor [[Rob Houdijk]] was revealed in the Duifpolder between [[Maassluis]] and [[Vlaardingen]] alongside the Vlaardingertrekvaart canal, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of his birth. <ref>[https://www.wos.nl/jongkind-zweeft-in-duifpolder/nieuws/item?1133507 ''Jongkind zweeft in Duifpolder'']</ref> <ref>[https://www.vlaardingen24.nl/nl/nieuws/uit-cultuur/johan-barthold-jongkind-schittert-in-de-polder/25414 ''Johan Barthold Jongkind schittert in de polder'' ]</ref>At this spot, Jongkind must have made preparatory sketches of the ''Rechthuis van Zouteveen'' for one of his later etching \u2018Les deux barques \u00e0 voile\u2019 from 1862. <ref>[http://tweegezichten.middendelfland.net/17rechthuis.htm ''Twee gezichten van Nr. 17: Het rechthuis van Zouteveen'']</ref>\n\n==Subject and style==\nJongkind's most frequent subject was the marine landscape, which he painted both in the Netherlands and in France. Many of his works depict the [[Seine]], particularly the area near [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]]. He painted watercolors out-of-doors, and used them as sketches for oil paintings made in his studio.<ref name=\"Boorsch&Marciari246\" /> His paintings are characterized by vigorous brushwork and strong contrasts. Like the 17th-century Dutch landscape painters of the [[Dutch Golden Age|1.
