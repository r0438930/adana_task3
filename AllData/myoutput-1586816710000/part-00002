Lucas wrote and directed ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), based on his earlier student short ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), inspired by his youth in the early 1960s [[Modesto, California]], and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful and received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\nLucas's next film, the [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film at the time]], winning six Academy Awards and sparking [[Cultural impact of Star Wars|a cultural phenomenon]]. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983). With director [[Steven Spielberg]], he created, produced and co-wrote the ''Indiana Jones'' films ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|The Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]'' (1989) and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the [[Star Wars Trilogy|''Star Wars'' Trilogy]] as part of a [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#1997 Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|special edition]] featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011.

He began penning more to the story, indicating that the series would be a tragic one, examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change the prequels status relative to the originals; at first, they were supposed to be a \"filling-in\" of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a \"Saga\".{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 299\u2013300|ref=kaminski}} In 1994, Lucas began work on the screenplay of the first prequel, tentatively titled ''Episode I: The Beginning''.\n\nIn 1997, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ''Star Wars,'' Lucas returned to the original trilogy and made numerous modifications using newly available digital technology, releasing them in theaters as the ''Star Wars Special Edition''. For DVD releases in 2004 and Blu-ray releases in 2011, the trilogy received further revisions to make them congruent with the prequel trilogy.

Lucas wrote and directed ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), based on his earlier student short ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), inspired by his youth in the early 1960s [[Modesto, California]], and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful and received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\nLucas's next film, the [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film at the time]], winning six Academy Awards and sparking [[Cultural impact of Star Wars|a cultural phenomenon]]. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983). With director [[Steven Spielberg]], he created, produced and co-wrote the ''Indiana Jones'' films ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|The Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]'' (1989) and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the [[Star Wars Trilogy|''Star Wars'' Trilogy]] as part of a [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#1997 Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|special edition]] featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]] comprising ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005).

He began penning more to the story, indicating that the series would be a tragic one, examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change the prequels status relative to the originals; at first, they were supposed to be a \"filling-in\" of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a \"Saga\".{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 299\u2013300|ref=kaminski}} In 1994, Lucas began work on the screenplay of the first prequel, tentatively titled ''Episode I: The Beginning''.\n\nIn 1997, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ''Star Wars,'' Lucas returned to the original trilogy and made numerous modifications using newly available digital technology, releasing them in theaters as the ''Star Wars Special Edition''. For DVD releases in 2004 and Blu-ray releases in 2011, the trilogy received further revisions to make them congruent with the prequel trilogy. Besides the additions to the ''Star Wars'' franchise, Lucas released a ''Director's Cut'' of ''THX 1138'' in 2004, with the film re-cut and containing a number of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] revisions.\n\nThe first ''Star Wars'' prequel was finished and released in 1999 as ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', which would be the first film Lucas had directed in over two decades.
