In Arabic, the term ''tajw\u012bd'' is derived from the [[triliteral]] root ''{{transl|ar|ALA|j-w-d}}'', meaning enhancement or to make something excellent. Technically, it means giving every letter its right in reciting the Qur'an.\n\n==History==\nThe history of tajwid is tied to the history of [[qira'at]], as each reciter had their own set of tajwid rules, with much overlap between them.\n\n[[Abu Ubaid al-Qasim bin Salam]] (774 - 838 CE) was the first to develop a recorded science for [[tajwid]], giving the rules of tajwid names and putting it into writing in his book called ''al-Qiraat.'' He wrote about 25 reciters, including the 7 mutawatir reciters.<ref name=\"ajaja\">{{cite web |last1=Ajaja |first1=Abdurrazzak |title=\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a : The readings |url=https://scientificsentence.net/newArabic/tajweed/index.php?key=yes&Integer=the_10_readings}}</ref> He made the reality, transmitted through reciters of every generation, a science with defined rules, terms, and enunciation.<ref name=\"shadee\">{{cite book |last1=el-Masry |first1=Shadee |title=The Science of Tajwid |publisher=Safina Society |page=8 |url=https://myarkview.org/courses/322185/lectures/5481431 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |ref=shadee}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What is Tajweed? |url=https://www.onlinequranteachers.com/what-is-tajweed/ |website=Online Quran Teachers |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Abu Bakr Ibn Muj\u0101hid]] (859 - 936 CE) wrote a book called ''Kitab al-Sab\u2019 fil-qir\u0101\u2019\u0101t'' \"The Seven of the [[Qira'at|Recitations]].\" He is the first to limit the number of [[Qira'at|reciters]] to the seven known.\n\nImam [[Al-Shatibi]] (1320 - 1388 CE) wrote a poem outlining the two most famous ways passed down from each of seven strong imams, known as ''ash-Shatibiyyah.'' In it, he documented the rules of recitation of Naafi\u2019, Ibn Katheer, Abu \u2018Amr, Ibn \u2018Aamir, \u2018Aasim, al-Kisaa\u2019i, and Hamzah.

There is a difference of opinion on the ruling for individuals. Dr. Shadee el-Masry states that it is an individual obligation (''[[fard|far\u1e0d al-'ayn]]'') on every Muslim to recite the opening chapter of the Qur'an (''al-fatiha'') with correct tajw\u012bd, though they do not need to know the terms and definitions of the rules themselves.<ref name=\"masry\">{{cite book |last1=el-Masry |first1=Shadee |title=The Science of Tajwid |publisher=Safina Society |page=7 |url=https://www.safinasociety.org/product-page/the-science-of-tawhid-book |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref> Sheikh [[Zakariyya al-Ansari]] stated that it is sinful to recite in a way that changes the meaning or changes the grammar.

Some of the characteristics have opposites, while some are individual. An example of a characteristic would be the [[fricative consonant]] sound called ''\u1e63af\u012br'', which is an attribute of air escaping from a tube.\n\n===Thickness and thinness===\n{{see also|Emphatic consonants|Pharyngealization}}\nThe [[emphatic consonant]]s {{lang|ar|{{large|[[\u1e2b\u0101\u02be|\u062e]] [[\u1e63\u0101d|\u0635]] [[\u1e0d\u0101d|\u0636]] [[\u1e6d\u0101\u02be|\u0637]] [[\u1e93\u0101\u02be|\u0638]] [[\u0121ayn|\u063a]] [[q\u0101f|\u0642]]}}}}, known as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mufakhkham}}'' letters, are pronounced with a \"heavy accent\" (''{{transl|ar|ALA|tafkh\u012bm}}'').

It is heavy if the first preceding voweled letter is accompanied by a ''fat\u1e25ah'' or ''\u1e0dammah''.
