Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he did not survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the 1957 movie ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)]]'', the plot follows a murder lawsuit in which an experienced star lawyer successfully contends an acquittal by exposing the incriminating statements made by the accused's wife as false. In the twist it is revealed that the wife deceived the jury and the main character actually committed the murder.

An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode \"[[Time Enough at Last]]\" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.\n\n===''Deus ex machina''===\n''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning \"god from the machine.\" It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.<ref name=\"Shipley1964\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}</ref> In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the \"deus ex machina\" ('\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2\u2014''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. The term is now used pejoratively for any improbable or unexpected contrivance by which an author resolves the complications of the plot in a play or novel, and which has not been convincingly prepared for in the preceding action; the discovery of a lost will was a favorite resort of Victorian novelists.<ref>{{ citation | last1 = Baldick | first1 = Chris | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms | location = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-860883-7 }}</ref>\n\n===Red herring===\nA [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.<ref name=\"Asong2012\">{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}</ref> This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named \"Bishop Aringarosa\" draw attention away from the true master villain (\"Aringarosa\" literally translates as \"pink herring\"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel ''[[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]]'' (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].\n\n=== False protagonist ===\nA [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins. Another instance is ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'''s Marion Crane (portrayed by [[Janet Leigh]]), who is brutally murdered early in the film. A contemporary example is the character of Charlie in ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'', who is killed before the end of the first hour.\n\n===Non-linear narrative===\nA [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.<ref name=\"Steiff2011\">{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}</ref> This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. ''[[The Aeneid]]'', another [[epic poem]], uses a similar approach; it begins with the main protagonist, [[Aeneas]], telling stories about the end of the [[Trojan War]] and the first half of his journey to [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.<ref>Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc.

A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.\n\n===''Deus ex machina''===\n''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning \"god from the machine.\" It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.<ref name=\"Shipley1964\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}</ref> In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the \"deus ex machina\" ('\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2\u2014''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. The term is now used pejoratively for any improbable or unexpected contrivance by which an author resolves the complications of the plot in a play or novel, and which has not been convincingly prepared for in the preceding action; the discovery of a lost will was a favorite resort of Victorian novelists.<ref>{{ citation | last1 = Baldick | first1 = Chris | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms | location = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-860883-7 }}</ref>\n\n===Red herring===\nA [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.<ref name=\"Asong2012\">{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}</ref> This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named \"Bishop Aringarosa\" draw attention away from the true master villain (\"Aringarosa\" literally translates as \"pink herring\"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel ''[[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]]'' (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].\n\n=== False protagonist ===\nA [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins. Another instance is ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'''s Marion Crane (portrayed by [[Janet Leigh]]), who is brutally murdered early in the film. A contemporary example is the character of Charlie in ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'', who is killed before the end of the first hour.\n\n===Non-linear narrative===\nA [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.<ref name=\"Steiff2011\">{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}</ref> This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. ''[[The Aeneid]]'', another [[epic poem]], uses a similar approach; it begins with the main protagonist, [[Aeneas]], telling stories about the end of the [[Trojan War]] and the first half of his journey to [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.<ref>Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc.

Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irr\u00e9versible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' and the [[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Climax (narrative)]]\n* [[MacGuffin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Narrative modes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Plot Twist}}\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Plot (narrative)|Twist]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Anita5192", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAnagnorisis:Removed superfluous underscores.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_twist"}
