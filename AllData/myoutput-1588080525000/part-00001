Aherne's first TV appearances were as Mrs Merton in a semi-regular spot on the [[Granada TV]] discussion show ''Upfront'' in 1990. She had already recorded a pilot for Leeds-based [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire TV]] of ''Mrs Murton's Nightcap'',<ref>\"[http://theafterword.co.uk/mrs-murtons-nightcap/ Mrs Murton\u2019s Nightcap]\". theafterword.co.uk. 17/09/2016.

The series ran in various formats from 1994 to 1997, winning a [[BAFTA]] for Best Chat Show in 1997.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> The success of the show was partly attributed to the \"round vowel sounds of the North West accent\" which \"naturally sound safe and unthreatening\" and which allowed the character \"to ask the most outrageous, below-the-belt questions of her guest stars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northwest/series7/comedy_accents.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out \u2013 North West comedy|publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=17 January 2005 |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Mrs Merton character was given a sitcom, ''[[Mrs Merton and Malcolm]]'', which depicted her home life with her \"mummy's boy\" son (played by co-writer [[Craig Cash]]). This aspect of Malcolm's character was exaggerated to the point that many complained the series ridiculed those with learning difficulties.<ref name=\"Learning Difficulties Criticism\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27392549 | title=Obituary: Caroline Aherne | publisher=BBC | date=2 July 2016 | accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref> ''Mrs Merton and Malcolm'' lasted one series, and was released on DVD in 2008.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1997 she appeared in and wrote for the BBC comedy series ''[[The Fast Show]]''. One of her most notable characters was the \"Chanel 9 Neus\" meteorologist Poula Fisch, who invariably reported a temperature for all locations of 45&nbsp;\u00b0C (113&nbsp;\u00b0F) while exclaiming \"Scorchio!\" with apparent surprise. Other notable characters included the endlessly chattering [[Northern England|northern]] Ren\u00e9e, wife of submissive husband Roy and supermarket Checkout Girl who, by way of conversation, would comment nosily and judgementally on each item a customer had bought.\n\n===''The Royle Family''===\nHer most popular creation is the situation comedy ''[[The Royle Family]]'', which she co-created and wrote with Cash, and directed in its third series. The programme ran for three series from 1998 to 2000. Aherne starred alongside [[Ricky Tomlinson]] and [[Sue Johnston]], as their daughter Denise Royle. The show was a commercial and critical success, and ran for three series with a total of twenty episodes as well as five one-offs made for showing at Christmas. After a 2000 spoof documentary with Cash entitled ''Back Passage to India'', Aherne said ''The Royle Family'' would end in December 2000 after a [[Christmas special]], and that she would not appear on television again, although she would continue to write. Aherne received [[British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy|BAFTAs for Best Sitcom]] in 2000 and 2007,<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> and she won the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Performance|BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance]] in 2000.

She wrote ''[[Dossa and Joe]]'' which was  screened on [[BBC Two]] in 2002. Although critics applauded it, the show did not attract viewers and did not return for a second series. Returning to Britain, she began work on another sitcom with Cash but pulled out, after which Cash wrote ''[[Early Doors]]'' with [[Phil Mealey]].\n\nAfter ''Dossa and Joe'', Aherne avoided media attention. When ''The Fast Show'' was featured on the [[BBC One]] show ''[[Comedy Connections]]'', Aherne was the only cast member not interviewed. In April 2006, the BBC said Aherne and Cash were developing a script for a one-off special of ''The Royle Family''. ''The Royle Family: The Queen of Sheba'' was broadcast on 29 October 2006, to an audience of 7.8 million. Aherne subsequently made few TV appearances. On 14 October 2008 she was in the BBC comedy drama written by Cash and Phil Mealey'', [[Sunshine (UK TV series)|Sunshine]]'' as a barmaid. She appeared in ''The Royle Family, The New Sofa'' on Christmas Day 2008. In 2009, she appeared in a Royle Family special for [[Comic Relief]] as well as another Christmas Day special of ''The Royle Family'' entitled ''The Golden Eggcup''. She co-wrote the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] comedy-drama ''[[The Fattest Man in Britain]]'', which was broadcast in December 2009.\n\nIn November 2010, Aherne appeared in the special ''The Royle Family: Behind the Sofa'' shown on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], featuring clips of ''The Royle Family'' and interviews with Aherne, Cash and the cast, which was followed by another Christmas Day special, ''Joe's Cracker''. She narrated a BBC1 documentary series ''[[Pound Shop Wars]]'' broadcast in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nts9x |title=BBC One \u2013 Pound Shop Wars |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> She also appeared in ''The Fast Show'' internet specials, sponsored by the lager brand [[Foster's Group|Fosters]], which reunited most of the original principal cast; only [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] was unable to participate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fosters.co.uk/tagged/The_Fast_Show |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105230039/http://fosters.co.uk/tagged/The_Fast_Show |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 November 2011 |title=Foster's \u2013 The Fast Show |publisher=Fosters.co.uk |accessdate=22 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAherne wrote the 2013 one-off sitcom ''[[The Security Men]]'' along with [[Jeff Pope]] for ITV. The episode starred [[Paddy McGuinness]], [[Brendan O'Carroll]], [[Dean Andrews]], [[Bobby Ball]] and [[Peter Wight (actor)|Peter Wight]].\n\nAherne's final role was as narrator of the [[Channel 4]] comedy reality series ''[[Gogglebox]]'', reflecting her character in ''The Royle Family'', who would frequently be watching TV and commenting on it. Cash filled in when she was unavailable and took over the role permanently in April 2016.\n\nAherne's final on screen appearance came in the Sky 1 show [[After Hours (UK TV series)|''After Hours'']], where she was reunited with her old writing partner [[Craig Cash]] who produced and directed the show. She played the role of Sheila.\n\n==Personal life==\nAherne was married to [[Peter Hook]] of the bands [[Joy Division]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]] from 1994 until 1997. During their marriage he appeared in her TV series ''The Mrs Merton Show'' as leader of Hooky & the Boys, the show's house band.<ref name=\"screenonline.org.uk\"/> After Aherne's death Hook described how she had been physically abusive towards him during their marriage.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/03/peter-hook-caroline-aherne-physically-abusive-during-marriage</ref>\n\n===Health issues===\nHer private life was well publicised, especially her depressions and struggles with alcohol and drugs during the 1990s. Before ''[[The Royle Family]]'' began, she suffered from depression and after her former boyfriend, BBC technician Matt Bowers, succumbed to [[stomach cancer]], she attempted suicide.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The day after she checked into the [[Priory Hospital]] and was diagnosed as a [[binge drinking|binge alcoholic]].

1963 \u2013 2 July 2016) was an English comedian and writer and actress, best known for performing as the acerbic chat show host ''[[The Mrs Merton Show|Mrs Merton]]'', in various roles in ''[[The Fast Show]]'', and as Denise in ''[[The Royle Family]]'', a series which she co-wrote. She won [[BAFTA]] awards for her work on ''The Mrs Merton Show'' and ''The Royle Family''.\n\nAherne narrated the [[Channel 4]] reality television series ''[[Gogglebox]]'' from its inception in 2013 until 8 April 2016. She died of cancer at age 52.\n\n==Early life==\nAherne was born in [[Ealing]], [[London]], to the family of an Irish railway worker,<ref name=\"manchester2002-uk1\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/broadcasters1.html |title=Manchester Television Broadcasters and Film Actors including Caroline Aherne... |publisher=Manchester2002-uk.com |date= |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and from the age of two was brought up in [[Wythenshawe]], [[Manchester]].<ref name=\"screenonline\">Rinaldi, Graham. \"[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/458572/index.html Aherne, Caroline (1963\u2013)]\". screenonline.org.uk.

Aherne's first TV appearances were as Mrs Merton in a semi-regular spot on the [[Granada TV]] discussion show ''Upfront'' in 1990. She had already recorded a pilot for Leeds-based [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire TV]] of ''Mrs Murton's Nightcap'',<ref>\"[http://theafterword.co.uk/mrs-murtons-nightcap/ Mrs Murton\u2019s Nightcap]\". theafterword.co.uk. 17/09/2016.

She made brief appearances in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]'' in 1993 and alongside [[Steve Coogan]] and [[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] in a Granada TV pilot entitled ''The Dead Good Show''s.\n\nShe rose to prominence in 1994 as her created character Mrs Merton on the mock chat show ''[[The Mrs Merton Show]]'' under her married name of Caroline Hook.<ref>Kelner, Martin; [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-warm-and-gentle-kicking-1572047.html \"A warm and gentle kicking\"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 8 February 1995.

Manning clashed with Wilson and Aherne as she asked him about his racist attitudes at one point saying, \u201cWho do you vote for now [[Hitler]]\u2019s dead?\u201d, although he acknowledged that ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]'' was funny. The series ran in various formats from 1994 to 1997, winning a [[BAFTA]] for Best Chat Show in 1997.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> The success of the show was partly attributed to the \"round vowel sounds of the North West accent\" which \"naturally sound safe and unthreatening\" and which allowed the character \"to ask the most outrageous, below-the-belt questions of her guest stars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northwest/series7/comedy_accents.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out \u2013 North West comedy|publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=17 January 2005 |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Mrs Merton character was given a sitcom, ''[[Mrs Merton and Malcolm]]'', which depicted her home life with her \"mummy's boy\" son (played by co-writer [[Craig Cash]]). This aspect of Malcolm's character was exaggerated to the point that many complained the series ridiculed those with learning difficulties.<ref name=\"Learning Difficulties Criticism\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27392549 | title=Obituary: Caroline Aherne | publisher=BBC | date=2 July 2016 | accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref> ''Mrs Merton and Malcolm'' lasted one series, and was released on DVD in 2008.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1997 she appeared in and wrote for the BBC comedy series ''[[The Fast Show]]''. One of her most notable characters was the \"Chanel 9 Neus\" meteorologist Poula Fisch, who invariably reported a temperature for all locations of 45&nbsp;\u00b0C (113&nbsp;\u00b0F) while exclaiming \"Scorchio!\" with apparent surprise. Other notable characters included the endlessly chattering [[Northern England|northern]] Ren\u00e9e, wife of submissive husband Roy and supermarket Checkout Girl who, by way of conversation, would comment nosily and judgementally on each item a customer had bought.\n\n===''The Royle Family''===\nHer most popular creation is the situation comedy ''[[The Royle Family]]'', which she co-created and wrote with Cash, and directed in its third series. The programme ran for three series from 1998 to 2000. Aherne starred alongside [[Ricky Tomlinson]] and [[Sue Johnston]], as their daughter Denise Royle. The show was a commercial and critical success, and ran for three series with a total of twenty episodes as well as five one-offs made for showing at Christmas. After a 2000 spoof documentary with Cash entitled ''Back Passage to India'', Aherne said ''The Royle Family'' would end in December 2000 after a [[Christmas special]], and that she would not appear on television again, although she would continue to write. Aherne received [[British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy|BAFTAs for Best Sitcom]] in 2000 and 2007,<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> and she won the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Performance|BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance]] in 2000.

She wrote ''[[Dossa and Joe]]'' which was  screened on [[BBC Two]] in 2002. Although critics applauded it, the show did not attract viewers and did not return for a second series. Returning to Britain, she began work on another sitcom with Cash but pulled out, after which Cash wrote ''[[Early Doors]]'' with [[Phil Mealey]].\n\nAfter ''Dossa and Joe'', Aherne avoided media attention. When ''The Fast Show'' was featured on the [[BBC One]] show ''[[Comedy Connections]]'', Aherne was the only cast member not interviewed. In April 2006, the BBC said Aherne and Cash were developing a script for a one-off special of ''The Royle Family''. ''The Royle Family: The Queen of Sheba'' was broadcast on 29 October 2006, to an audience of 7.8 million. Aherne subsequently made few TV appearances. On 14 October 2008 she was in the BBC comedy drama written by Cash and Phil Mealey'', [[Sunshine (UK TV series)|Sunshine]]'' as a barmaid. She appeared in ''The Royle Family, The New Sofa'' on Christmas Day 2008. In 2009, she appeared in a Royle Family special for [[Comic Relief]] as well as another Christmas Day special of ''The Royle Family'' entitled ''The Golden Eggcup''. She co-wrote the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] comedy-drama ''[[The Fattest Man in Britain]]'', which was broadcast in December 2009.\n\nIn November 2010, Aherne appeared in the special ''The Royle Family: Behind the Sofa'' shown on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], featuring clips of ''The Royle Family'' and interviews with Aherne, Cash and the cast, which was followed by another Christmas Day special, ''Joe's Cracker''. She narrated a BBC1 documentary series ''[[Pound Shop Wars]]'' broadcast in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nts9x |title=BBC One \u2013 Pound Shop Wars |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> She also appeared in ''The Fast Show'' internet specials, sponsored by the lager brand [[Foster's Group|Fosters]], which reunited most of the original principal cast; only [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] was unable to participate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fosters.co.uk/tagged/The_Fast_Show |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105230039/http://fosters.co.uk/tagged/The_Fast_Show |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 November 2011 |title=Foster's \u2013 The Fast Show |publisher=Fosters.co.uk |accessdate=22 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAherne wrote the 2013 one-off sitcom ''[[The Security Men]]'' along with [[Jeff Pope]] for ITV. The episode starred [[Paddy McGuinness]], [[Brendan O'Carroll]], [[Dean Andrews]], [[Bobby Ball]] and [[Peter Wight (actor)|Peter Wight]].\n\nAherne's final role was as narrator of the [[Channel 4]] comedy reality series ''[[Gogglebox]]'', reflecting her character in ''The Royle Family'', who would frequently be watching TV and commenting on it. Cash filled in when she was unavailable and took over the role permanently in April 2016.\n\nAherne's final on screen appearance came in the Sky 1 show [[After Hours (UK TV series)|''After Hours'']], where she was reunited with her old writing partner [[Craig Cash]] who produced and directed the show. She played the role of Sheila.\n\n==Personal life==\nAherne was married to [[Peter Hook]] of the bands [[Joy Division]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]] from 1994 until 1997. During their marriage he appeared in her TV series ''The Mrs Merton Show'' as leader of Hooky & the Boys, the show's house band.<ref name=\"screenonline.org.uk\"/> After Aherne's death Hook described how she had been physically abusive towards him during their marriage.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/03/peter-hook-caroline-aherne-physically-abusive-during-marriage</ref>\n\n===Health issues===\nHer private life was well publicised, especially her depressions and struggles with alcohol and drugs during the 1990s. Before ''[[The Royle Family]]'' began, she suffered from depression and after her former boyfriend, BBC technician Matt Bowers, succumbed to [[stomach cancer]], she attempted suicide.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The day after she checked into the [[Priory Hospital]] and was diagnosed as a [[binge drinking|binge alcoholic]].
