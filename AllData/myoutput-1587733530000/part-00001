Conversely, the online edition commences numbered pagination ''at'' chapter one. A comparison of the 1983 edition and the viewable online text shows no discernible deletions of text. Certainly chapter one appears word-for-word, as does chapter 11 (''Disastrous Motherhood''). In the latter case, the 1983 pagination encompasses four pages, whereas the online book encompasses three. However, the text is the same. The 1983 edition has each sequential chapter commencing on the same page as the preceding chapter ends, which causes a greater page range for some chapters.

He sprung across the blood-stained boards upon his swooning, sweating, strapped-down patient like a duelist, calling, 'Time me gentlemen, time me!' to students craning with pocket watches from the iron-railinged galleries. Everyone swore that the first flash of his knife was followed so swiftly by the rasp of saw on bone that sight and sound seemed simultaneous. To free both hands, he would clasp the bloody knife between his teeth.<ref name=\"RichardGordonp1\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nGordon's prose is more than just caricature. He describes how the link between surgical hygiene and iatrogenic infection was poorly understood at that time. At an address by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Dr Oliver Wendell Holmes]] to the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]] on 13 February 1843, his suggestions for hygiene improvement to reduce obstetric infections and mortality from [[Puerperal fever#Prevention via hygienic measures|puerperal fever]] \"outraged obstetricians, particularly in Philadelphia\".<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood\">{{Cite book |title=Great Medical Disasters |last=Gordon |first=Richard |publisher=House of Stratus |year=2001 |location=London |pages=34\u201336 |chapter=Disastrous Motherhood: Tales from the Vienna Wards}} (p.&nbsp;43 of pp.&nbsp;43\u201346 in 1983 edition)</ref>{{efn|name=pagination}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holmes, O.W. |year=1842\u20131843 |title=On the contagiousness of puerperal fever |journal=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine. |volume=i |pages=503\u201330}} in Gordon, R. (1983), p.147.</ref> In those days, \"surgeons operated in blood-stiffened frock coats \u2013 the stiffer the coat, the prouder the busy surgeon\", \"pus was as inseparable from surgery as blood\", and \"Cleanliness was next to prudishness\". He quotes [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Treves]] on that era: \"There was no object in being clean...Indeed, cleanliness was out of place. It was considered to be finicking and affected. An executioner might as well manicure his nails before chopping off a head\".<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood3544\">Gordon, Richard (2001) p.35; (1983) p.44</ref> Indeed, the connection between surgical hygiene, infection, and maternal mortality rates at [[Vienna General Hospital]] was only made in 1847 by Vienna physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Dr Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]] from Hungary, after a close colleague of his died. He instituted the hygiene practices exhorted by Holmes, and the mortality rate fell.<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood34-36&43-45\">Gordon, Richard (2001) pp.34\u201336; (1983) pp.43\u201345</ref>\n\nSuch was the era in which Liston lived. Gordon states that Liston was \"an abrupt, abrasive, argumentative man, unfailingly charitable to the poor and tender to the sick (who) was vilely unpopular to his fellow surgeons at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He relished operating successfully in the reeking tenements of the [[Grassmarket]] and [[Lawnmarket]] on patients they had discharged as hopelessly incurable. They conspired to bar him from the wards, banished him south, where he became professor of surgery at University College Hospital and made a fortune\".<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\">Gordon, Richard (2001), p.2</ref>\n\nIn writings on Liston, he is portrayed as a man of strong character and ethics, which was the source of some of his confrontational style. In one case, he confronted a medical colleague ([[Robert Knox|Dr Robert Knox]]) over the treatment of a young woman (Mary Paterson) who it later transpired was murdered (see [[Burke and Hare murders]]), with Knox thought complicit in the murder. She was in Knox's dissecting rooms within four hours of her death, and kept in whisky for three months before dissection, during which time she was essentially on voyeuristic display.<ref name=\"Richardson1987\">{{Citation |last=Richardson, Ruth |title=Death, Dissection and the Destitute |pages=131\u2013158 |year=1987 |chapter=Trading Assassins |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4cOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22death+dissection%22&hl=en&ei=ZclATPmMM47-vQOr4oz4DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |place=London |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7102-0919-1 |access-date=16 July 2010}}</ref> Liston's response is documented in a letter from him<blockquote>According to Liston, he saw Mary Paterson's body in Knox's rooms and immediately suspected foul play.

Gordon describes Liston's four most famous cases in his book, as quoted verbatim below.\n\n;Fourth most famous case:\n{{quote|Removal in 4 minutes of a 45-pound scrotal tumour, whose owner had to carry it round in a wheelbarrow.|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Third most famous case:\n{{quote|\nArgument with his house-surgeon. Was the red, pulsating tumour in a small boy's neck a straightforward abscess of the skin, or a dangerous aneurism of the carotid artery? 'Pooh!' Liston exclaimed impatiently. 'Whoever heard of an aneurism in one so young?' Flashing a knife from his waistcoat pocket, he lanced it. Houseman's note \u2013 'Out leaped arterial blood, and the boy fell.' The patient died but the artery lives, in University College Hospital pathology museum, specimen No. 1256.\n|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Second most famous case:\n{{quote|Amputated the leg in 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes, but in his enthusiasm the patient's testicles as well.|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Liston's most famous case:\n{{quote|\nAmputated the leg in under 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes (the patient died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene; they usually did in those [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister#Antiseptics|pre-Listerian]] days). He amputated in addition the fingers of his young assistant (who died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene). He also slashed through the coat tails of a distinguished surgical spectator, who was so terrified that the knife had pierced his vitals he dropped dead from fright.\n\nThat was the only operation in history with a 300 percent mortality.\n|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordon15\">Gordon, Richard (2001), p.3;(1983), p.15</ref><!--Note: This is a verbatim quote.

He sprung across the blood-stained boards upon his swooning, sweating, strapped-down patient like a duelist, calling, 'Time me gentlemen, time me!' to students craning with pocket watches from the iron-railinged galleries. Everyone swore that the first flash of his knife was followed so swiftly by the rasp of saw on bone that sight and sound seemed simultaneous. To free both hands, he would clasp the bloody knife between his teeth.<ref name=\"RichardGordonp1\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nGordon's prose is more than just caricature. He describes how the link between surgical hygiene and iatrogenic infection was poorly understood at that time. At an address by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Dr Oliver Wendell Holmes]] to the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]] on 13 February 1843, his suggestions for hygiene improvement to reduce obstetric infections and mortality from [[Puerperal fever#Prevention via hygienic measures|puerperal fever]] \"outraged obstetricians, particularly in Philadelphia\".<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood\">{{Cite book |title=Great Medical Disasters |last=Gordon |first=Richard |publisher=House of Stratus |year=2001 |editor-last=\u2026 |location=London |pages=34\u201336 |chapter=Disastrous Motherhood: Tales from the Vienna Wards}} (p.&nbsp;43 of pp.&nbsp;43\u201346 in 1983 edition)</ref>{{efn|name=pagination}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holmes, O.W. |year=1842\u20131843 |title=On the contagiousness of puerperal fever |journal=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine. |volume=i |pages=503\u201330}} in Gordon, R. (1983), p.147.</ref> In those days, \"surgeons operated in blood-stiffened frock coats \u2013 the stiffer the coat, the prouder the busy surgeon\", \"pus was as inseparable from surgery as blood\", and \"Cleanliness was next to prudishness\". He quotes [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Treves]] on that era: \"There was no object in being clean...Indeed, cleanliness was out of place. It was considered to be finicking and affected. An executioner might as well manicure his nails before chopping off a head\".<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood3544\">Gordon, Richard (2001) p.35; (1983) p.44</ref> Indeed, the connection between surgical hygiene, infection, and maternal mortality rates at [[Vienna General Hospital]] was only made in 1847 by Vienna physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Dr Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]] from Hungary, after a close colleague of his died. He instituted the hygiene practices exhorted by Holmes, and the mortality rate fell.<ref name=\"GordononMotherhood34-36&43-45\">Gordon, Richard (2001) pp.34\u201336; (1983) pp.43\u201345</ref>\n\nSuch was the era in which Liston lived. Gordon states that Liston was \"an abrupt, abrasive, argumentative man, unfailingly charitable to the poor and tender to the sick (who) was vilely unpopular to his fellow surgeons at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He relished operating successfully in the reeking tenements of the [[Grassmarket]] and [[Lawnmarket]] on patients they had discharged as hopelessly incurable. They conspired to bar him from the wards, banished him south, where he became professor of surgery at University College Hospital and made a fortune\".<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\">Gordon, Richard (2001), p.2</ref>\n\nIn writings on Liston, he is portrayed as a man of strong character and ethics, which was the source of some of his confrontational style. In one case, he confronted a medical colleague ([[Robert Knox|Dr Robert Knox]]) over the treatment of a young woman (Mary Paterson) who it later transpired was murdered (see [[Burke and Hare murders]]), with Knox thought complicit in the murder. She was in Knox's dissecting rooms within four hours of her death, and kept in whisky for three months before dissection, during which time she was essentially on voyeuristic display.<ref name=\"Richardson1987\">{{Citation |last=Richardson, Ruth |title=Death, Dissection and the Destitute |pages=131\u2013158 |year=1987 |chapter=Trading Assassins |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4cOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22death+dissection%22&hl=en&ei=ZclATPmMM47-vQOr4oz4DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |place=London |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7102-0919-1 |access-date=16 July 2010}}</ref> Liston's response is documented in a letter from him<blockquote>According to Liston, he saw Mary Paterson's body in Knox's rooms and immediately suspected foul play.

Gordon describes Liston's four most famous cases in his book, as quoted verbatim below.\n\n;Fourth most famous case:\n{{quote|Removal in 4 minutes of a 45-pound scrotal tumour, whose owner had to carry it round in a wheelbarrow.|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Third most famous case:\n{{quote|\nArgument with his house-surgeon. Was the red, pulsating tumour in a small boy's neck a straightforward abscess of the skin, or a dangerous aneurism of the carotid artery? 'Pooh!' Liston exclaimed impatiently. 'Whoever heard of an aneurism in one so young?' Flashing a knife from his waistcoat pocket, he lanced it. Houseman's note \u2013 'Out leaped arterial blood, and the boy fell.' The patient died but the artery lives, in University College Hospital pathology museum, specimen No. 1256.\n|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Second most famous case:\n{{quote|Amputated the leg in 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes, but in his enthusiasm the patient's testicles as well.|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordonp2\" />}}\n\n;Liston's most famous case:\n{{quote|\nAmputated the leg in under 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes (the patient died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene; they usually did in those [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister#Antiseptics|pre-Listerian]] days). He amputated in addition the fingers of his young assistant (who died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene). He also slashed through the coat tails of a distinguished surgical spectator, who was so terrified that the knife had pierced his vitals he dropped dead from fright.\n\nThat was the only operation in history with a 300 percent mortality.\n|Richard Gordon<ref name=\"RichardGordon15\">Gordon, Richard (2001), p.3;(1983), p.15</ref><!--Note: This is a verbatim quote.
