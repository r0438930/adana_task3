This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost [[Book of Burial]] recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]].<ref name=\"Field\">{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | website = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Feng shui is considered pseudoscientific.\n\nFeng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of \"invisible forces\" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.\n\nHistorically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings\u2014often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures\u2014in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.<ref>\nSun, X.

Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.</ref> During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the [[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500\u20133000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north\u2013south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=85\u201388}}</ref>\n\nA grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics\u2014 actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Big Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])\u2014 is oriented along a north\u2013south axis.<ref>Zhentao Xu; Yaotiao Jiang; David W Pankenier.

Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].<ref>Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15</ref>\n\nBeginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]],<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=230\u201337}}</ref> all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=\u8003\u5de5\u8a18|s=\u8003\u5de5\u8bb0}}; \"Manual of Crafts\") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u9b6f\u73ed\u7d93|s=\u9c81\u73ed\u7ecf}}; \"Lu ban's manuscript\") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.\n\n===Early instruments and techniques===\n[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]\nThe history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|p=55}}</ref> before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].<ref>Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).</ref> Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|pp=54-55}}</ref> while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).<ref>{{harvp|Cheng|Fernandes-Gon\u00e7alves|1998|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north\u2013south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10\u00b0 east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed, they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north.<ref>Paul Wheatley ''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)</ref> This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.<ref>Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275</ref>\n\nThe oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]<ref>Marc Kalinowski (1996). \"The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China.\" Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.</ref> the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.<ref>Yin Difei. \"Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi.\" ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, \"Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan.\" ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.</ref> The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.<ref>Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23\u201324 (1998\u201399):125\u2013202.</ref>\n\nThe [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui<ref>Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.</ref> and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon ({{lang|zh|\u6307\u5357\u91dd}} ''zhinan zhen'')\u2014though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed. Thousands of people have been brought good luck by wearing this bracelet on their dominant hand with the face jewel facing outwards.\n\n==Foundational concepts==\n\n=== Definition and classification ===\nThe goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of \"energy\".

Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.<ref>Sarah Allan.

The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.\n\n===Form Branch===\nThe Form Branch is the oldest branch of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the \"Book of the Tomb\"<ref>As referenced in [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&lpg=PA75&dq=Qing%20Wuzi&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=Qing%20Wuzi&f=false Feng Shui Facts and Myths]</ref> and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.\n\nThe Form branch was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.<ref name=\"Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi\"/> The branch then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).\n\nThe \"form\" in Form branch refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).\n\nThe Form branch analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}</ref> It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.\n\n===Compass Branch===\nThe Compass branch is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.<ref name=\"fengshuinatural1\">{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Branch|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cheng|Fernandes-Gon\u00e7alves|1998|pp=46\u201347}}</ref><ref>MoonChin.

However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:<ref>Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340\u2013361.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.<ref>Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui\" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)</ref></blockquote>\n\nStill others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different branches of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork\".<ref>Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclop\u00e6dia of Religion and Ethics, T & T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834</ref><ref>Monty Vierra. Harried by \"Hellions\" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.</ref> Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.\n\n<blockquote>This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.<ref>Mark Johnson, \"Reality Testing in Feng Shui.\" ''Qi'' Journal.

Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:\n\n<blockquote>...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age \"energy\" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.<ref name=\"The Skeptic's Dictionary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOthers have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting \"lucky bamboo\" in ecosystems that could not handle them.<ref name=\"Fabulous Feng Shui\">Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&src= \"Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine</ref>\n\nFeng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval.

Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay.

This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost [[Book of Burial]] recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]].<ref name=\"Field\">{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | website = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Feng shui is considered pseudoscientific.\n\nFeng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of \"invisible forces\" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.\n\nHistorically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings\u2014often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures\u2014in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.<ref>\nSun, X.

Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.</ref> During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the [[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500\u20133000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north\u2013south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.<ref>{{harvp|Liu|2004|pp=85\u201388}}</ref>\n\nA grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics\u2014 actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Big Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])\u2014 is oriented along a north\u2013south axis.<ref>Zhentao Xu; Yaotiao Jiang; David W Pankenier.

During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=\u8003\u5de5\u8a18|s=\u8003\u5de5\u8bb0}}; \"Manual of Crafts\") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u9b6f\u73ed\u7d93|s=\u9c81\u73ed\u7ecf}}; \"Lu ban's manuscript\") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.\n\n===Early instruments and techniques===\n[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]\nThe history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|p=55}}</ref> before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].<ref>Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).</ref> Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,<ref>{{harvp|Wang| 2000|pp=54-55}}</ref> while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).<ref>{{harvp|Cheng|Fernandes-Gon\u00e7alves|1998|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north\u2013south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10\u00b0 east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed, they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north.<ref>Paul Wheatley ''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)</ref> This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.<ref>Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275</ref>\n\nThe oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]<ref>Marc Kalinowski (1996). \"The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China.\" Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.</ref> the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.<ref>Yin Difei. \"Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi.\" ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, \"Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan.\" ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.</ref> The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.<ref>Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23\u201324 (1998\u201399):125\u2013202.</ref>\n\nThe [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui<ref>Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.</ref> and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon ({{lang|zh|\u6307\u5357\u91dd}} ''zhinan zhen'')\u2014though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.\n\n==Foundational concepts==\n\n=== Definition and classification ===\nThe goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of \"energy\".

''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.<ref>Sarah Allan.

The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.\n\n===Form Branch===\nThe Form Branch is the oldest branch of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the \"Book of the Tomb\"<ref>As referenced in [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&lpg=PA75&dq=Qing%20Wuzi&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=Qing%20Wuzi&f=false Feng Shui Facts and Myths]</ref> and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.\n\nThe Form branch was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.<ref name=\"Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi\"/> The branch then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).\n\nThe \"form\" in Form branch refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).\n\nThe Form branch analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}</ref> It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.\n\n===Compass Branch===\nThe Compass branch is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.<ref name=\"fengshuinatural1\">{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Branch|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cheng|Fernandes-Gon\u00e7alves|1998|pp=46\u201347}}</ref><ref>MoonChin.

Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple branches in their own practices.\n\n==Western forms of feng shui==\nMore recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional branches, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].\n\n===Aspirations Method===\nThe [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]].

There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of \"promoting feudalistic superstitions\" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.<ref>[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}</ref> Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title=\"\u98a8\u6c34\u8ff7\u4fe1\"\u56f0\u64fe\u4e2d\u570b\u7576\u5c40 \u2013 Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref>\n\nPartly because of the [[Cultural Revolution]], in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower<ref>[http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 ''Debate on Feng Shui''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232943/http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 |date=2008-02-15 }}</ref> Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com/58913151.html |title=Beware of Scams Among the Genuine Feng Shui Practitioners |publisher=Jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/3941393.html|title=\u02ee\u0228\u027d--\u013b--|work=people.com.cn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|title=\u65b9\u672f\u4e4b\u56fd|work=newmind40.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040204/http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref> Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,<ref>{{cite news|author=Jiang Xun |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4870000/newsid_4872500/4872542.stm |title=Focus on China ''From Voodoo Dolls to Feng Shui Superstitions''|language=Chinese|publisher=BBC Chinese service|date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref> and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of [[Fudan University]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |title=\u8521\u8fbe\u5cf0 \u2013 Cao Dafeng |publisher=Fudan.edu.cn |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032825/http://fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 }}</ref> and Liu Shenghuan of [[Tongji University]].\n\n===Contemporary feng shui===\nWesterners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:<ref>Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340\u2013361.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.<ref>Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui\" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)</ref></blockquote>\n\nStill others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different branches of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork\".<ref>Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclop\u00e6dia of Religion and Ethics, T & T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834</ref><ref>Monty Vierra. Harried by \"Hellions\" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.</ref> Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.\n\n<blockquote>This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.<ref>Mark Johnson, \"Reality Testing in Feng Shui.\" ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997, as cited in Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169\u201385.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:\n\n<blockquote>...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age \"energy\" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.<ref name=\"The Skeptic's Dictionary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOthers have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting \"lucky bamboo\" in ecosystems that could not handle them.<ref name=\"Fabulous Feng Shui\">Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&src= \"Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine</ref>\n\nFeng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval.

In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different feng shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of feng shui.\n\n==Contemporary practice ==\n\nMany Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}<!-- I hope this \"it\" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --> is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.<ref name=\"''Journal of Popular Culture''1\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=42}}</ref> Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.<ref name=\"''Journal of Popular Culture''2\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=46}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.\n\nFeng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,<ref name=\"Journal of Popular Culture''3\">{{harvp|Emmons|1992| p=48}}</ref> in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.<ref name=\"Feng Shui Kingdom\">Laura M.
