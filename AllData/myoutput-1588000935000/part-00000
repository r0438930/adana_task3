These are called \"Phases\", and correspond with the physical/emotional/intellectual readiness for the lessons of each phase.  The suggested corresponding ages are a general guide, with exceptions that vary widely.  DeMille cites such developmental psychologists as [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lev Vygotsky]] and [[Erik Erikson]] in support of their paradigm of \"Phases\".<ref>DeMille, Oliver and Rachel, ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', 2008; Chapter One: \"Two Views of Childhood\"; {{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}.</ref>\n\n===Foundational Phases===\nThe \"Foundational Phases\" of TJEd are as follows:<ref>DeMille, Oliver and Rachel, ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', 2008; Chapter 3-6; {{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}.</ref>\n*Core (birth to 8+ years of age): right and wrong, good and bad, true and false, relationships, family values, family routines and responsibilities, learning accountability, and the value and love of work.\n*Love of Learning (about 8 to 12 years of age): encourages family reading of classic literature, project learning, clubs and \"Momschools\" are among the elements that help inspire the youngster to love learning and to approach a variety of subjects with interest and growing levels of competence and diligence. The lessons of \"Love of Learning\" Phase: What's out there to learn? You're responsible for personal decisions. Personal accountability. Learning your gifts, interests, life's goals, mission. And the importance of home and family.\n\n===Educational Phases===\nThe \"Educational Phases\" are as follows:<ref>DeMille, Oliver and Rachel, ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', 2008; Chapter 7-8; {{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}.</ref>\n*Scholar (approximately 12 to 18 years of age): adolescent students study long hours and work with a mentor to refine their academic skills\u2014the emphasis placed on cultural literacy and a personalized approach to studies.\n*Depth (approximately 18 to 24 years of age): students submit to a mentor-guided program, whether privately or in a formal college setting or a \"mission\".

The Five Pillars of Statesmanship are: Classics, Mentors, Simulations, Field Experience and God. Certification endorses an individual\u2019s knowledge and ability in the Classics/Mentors approach to teaching leaders by incorporating all Five Pillars into an overall system of education. The 5 Pillar Certification program is divided into three levels to facilitate progress. \n\nLevel I is an introduction to the Five Pillars and the Classics/Mentors model of education includes attending a seminar, submitting a form to a facilitator, and reading and discussing the following books: ''[[The Chosen (Potok novel)|The Chosen]]'', ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', ''[[Lonesome Gods]]'', ''[[Little Britches (book)|Little Britches]]'', ''[[Laddie (novel)|Laddie]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and ''A Thomas Jefferson Education''.\n\nLevel II is a comprehensive study of additional classics. It also requires seminar attendance and a reading and one-page summary for 12 of the following books: ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', \"What is Seen and What is Not Seen\" from ''[[Essays on Political Economy]]'', ''[[The One Minute Teacher]]'', ''[[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]]'', ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', ''[[Great Expectations]]'', ''[[Alas, Babylon]]'', ''[[Multiple Intelligences]]'', \"The 7 Lesson School Teacher\" from ''[[Dumbing Us Down]]'', ''[[Market-Based Education]]'', ''[[How Children Learn]]'', ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', ''[[Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers]]'', ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', ''[[Understanding the Times]]'', ''[[Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin]]'', ''[[The Fourth Turning]]'', ''[[Walden]]'', and ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]''.\n\nLevel III is considered a practical application of the Five Pillars in an educational setting. One must administrate or teach in a public, private or home school or class and apply the 5 Pillar system for a minimum of six months; keep a journal of the entire project and write a project summary when the project is complete; pass an oral board covering the content of the three levels, as well as the practicum; and attend a seminar.\n\n==Related works==\n* ''A Thomas Jefferson Education: Teaching a Generation of Leaders for the Twenty-first Century''<ref>{{ISBN|978-0-9671246-1-2}}</ref> (1st edition, softbound, 2000; 2nd edition hardback 2006; 2nd edition softbound 2009; by Oliver DeMille; published by TJEdOnline)\n* ''A Thomas Jefferson Education Home Companion''<ref>{{ISBN|978-0-9671246-3-6}}</ref> (2006, Oliver DeMille, Rachel DeMille and Diann Jeppson; published by George Wythe University Press)\n* ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning''<ref>{{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}</ref> (2010, Oliver and Rachel DeMille; published by TJEdOnline)\n* ''Thomas Jefferson Education for Teens''<ref>{{ISBN|978-1-61539-994-9}}</ref> (2009, with Shanon Brooks; published by TJEdOnline)\n* ''The Student Whisperer'' <ref>{{ISBN|978-0-9830996-1-1}}</ref> (2011, with Tiffany Earl; published by TJEdOnline)\n* ''A Call to Reinvent Liberal Arts Education\" [https://www.ted.com/talks/liz_coleman_s_call_to_reinvent_liberal_arts_education?language=en Ted.com] (2009 February, Liz Coleman, president of Bennington College)\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Element-Finding-Passion-Changes-Everything/dp/0143116738/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1461335146&sr=1-1&keywords=the+element+ken+robinson The Element] (2009, Ken Robinson, Penguin Books)\n'''* Additional Reading''' \n* Liberal Arts Education wikipedia page for history of, usage of in history and usage of around the world\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2ap6fd_sXY The Education of Jim Rohn]\n* \"[https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity Do Schools Kill Creativity]\" Ted Talk by Ken Robinson 2006\n* \"[https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms Changing Education Paradigms]\" Ted Talk by Ken Robinson 2010\n* See Adler, Reforming American Education\n* Bacon, Novum Organum\n* Barton, What Happened in Education?\n* Barzun, Teacher in America\n* Bloom, A., The Closing of the American Mind\n* Bloom, H., The Wester Cannon\n* Bloomenfeld, How to Tutor\n* Bloomenfeld, The Illiterates\n* Bunding, An Education for Our Time\n* Colfax, Home Schooling for Excellence\n* Covey, First Things First\n* Dewey, The School and Society\n* Emerson, The American Scholar\n* Gardner, Multiple Intelligences\n* Gardner, The Unschooled Mind\n* Gatto, Dumbing Us Down\n* Gatto, The Exhausted School\n* Glasser, The Quality School\n* Harward, A Market Approach to Education\n* Hirsch, Cultural Literacy\n* Hirsch, et al., The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy\n* Holt, How Children Fail\n* Holt, How Children Learn\n* Hutchins, The Higher Learning in America\n* Kirk, Redeeming the Times\n* Lewis, The Abolition of Man\n* Mason, The Original Home School Series (6 vol.)\n* Montessori, all writings\n* Nash, The Closing of the American Heart\n* Noebel, Understanding the Times\n* Ortegta y Gasset, Mission of the University\n* Perelman, School's Out\n* Pudewa, all writings\n* Smith, Killing the Spirit\n* Strauss and Howe, The Fourth Turning\n* Swanson, The Education of James Madison\n* Taylor, The Healing Power of Stories\n* Toffler, Futureshock\n* Van Doren, Liberal Education\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://tjed.org Thomas Jefferson Education]\n* [http://tjedforteens.com Thomas Jefferson Education for Teens]\n* [http://oliverdemille.com Oliver DeMille]\n\n{{TJEd}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thomas Jefferson Education}}\n[[Category:Alternative education]]\n[[Category:Homeschooling]]\n", "text_old": "'''''Thomas Jefferson Education''''', also known as \"TJEd\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/i_video/main500251.shtml?id=3917028n |title=Three Ways to Home School |aboom boom pow.pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> or \"Leadership Education\" is a philosophy and methodology of education which is popular among some alternative educators, including private schools, charter schools and homeschoolers.
