Van der Walt and Michael Schmidt criticise the \"standard\" works on the overall history and theory of anarchism and syndicalism for focusing on the North Atlantic region, and for insisting upon an indefensible \"Spanish exceptionalism,\" the notion that in Spain alone were anarchism and syndicalism mass movements.\n\nA global view shows that Spain was by no means unique. According to Lucien van der Walt, \"once you look globally, you find mass movements of comparable, sometimes even greater, influence in countries ranging from Argentina, to China, to Cuba, to Mexico, to Peru, to the Ukraine and so on. What gets a bit lost in studies that focus on Western Europe is that most of anarchist and syndicalist history took place elsewhere. In other words, you can\u2019t understand anarchism unless you understand that much of its history was in the east and the south, not only in the north and the west.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ |title=\"Fanning the Flames\" interview with Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt |access-date=2012-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828002207/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ |archive-date=2017-08-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTherefore, besides movements like the Spanish [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], the book examines movements like the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina]], the [[Uruguayan Anarchist Federation]], the Shinmin autonomous region founded by Korean anarchists, and the Ukrainian [[Free Territory]] of [[Makhnovism]]. Attention is also paid to figures and movements partially influenced by anarchism, like [[Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino]], and the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union]], in southern Africa.\n\n''Black Flame'' also examines anarchist and syndicalist ideas and debates globally: for example, the account of anarchist debates on whether the [[Soviet Union]] was \"[[state capitalist]]\" includes the views of Asian anarchists, while sections on anarchism, syndicalism and race include coverage of Chinese, Mexican, Peruvian, and South African materials and movements.\n\n== ''Black Flame'' and a global anarchist/ syndicalist canon ==\n\n''Black Flame'' argues that [[East Europeans]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]] are the two most important anarchist thinkers.

Regarding the so-called \u201c[[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical]], individualist, [[Anarchism and religion|spiritual]] and \u2018[[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestyle]]\u2019 traditions,\u201d the authors say \u201cwe do not regard these currents as part of the broad anarchist tradition.\u201d<ref name=\"review\">[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Deric_Shannon__A_Flame_to_Extenguish_Capital__Review_of_Black_Flame.html A Flame to Extenguish Capital: Review of Black Flame by Deric Shannon]</ref>\n\n''Black Flame'' insists that while anarchism owes an immense debt to the earlier current of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] and to [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], it cannot be reduced to, or conflated with, Mutualism. For example, its stresses class struggle and social revolution, unlike Mutualism, which envisaged gradual change through building cooperatives.\n\nThe book argues that there are no rational or historical grounds for including currents like Stirnerism and Mutualism in the anarchist tradition.\n\nSome studies do this, by defining anarchism as basically an anti-statist movement (this sort of approach can be found, for example, on Wikipedia at [[Anarchist schools of thought]]). However, the authors argue, if this was true, then [[Marxism-Leninism]] and [[economic liberalism]] must also be considered \"anarchist,\" as one aims at the \"withering away of the state\" and the other, at a massive reduction in state control. These currents cannot be logically excluded from anarchism, if anarchism is defined as anti-statism, but it would also be nonsensical to include them within anarchism.\n\nRather, anarchism (including syndicalism) emerged as a movement in the [[International Workingmen's Association]], or \"First International,\" founded in 1864: the new anarchist current emerged simultaneously in Europe and Latin America. After the International split in 1872, the anarchist majority   (sometimes known as the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]]) attracted affiliates in central Asia and North Africa. This is ignored by flawed twentieth century scholarship, which reduced anarchism to anti-statism, so conflating the movement with earlier (as well as parallel) libertarian currents. Thus, anarchism is regarded here as a distinct, continuous and novel ideological and political tradition, not a gallery of superficially similar moments and thinkers.\n\nAnarchism was, that is, born as a radical, anti-capitalist current in the radical working class and peasant milieu. Since this milieu was the product of modern capitalist and the modern state in the 1800s, the first anarchist formations emerged in the 1860s and 1870s in areas by then being reshaped by these forces: parts of East as well as West Europe, North Africa as well as North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. As capitalist modernity expanded into southern Africa from the 1880s and east Asia from the 1890s, anarchism spread into those regions as well.\n\nFurther, since syndicalism is a variant of anarchism, argues ''Black Flame'', syndicalists who rejected the anarchist label, like [[James Connolly]] and [[Bill Haywood]] are nonetheless still part of the anarchist tradition.\n\nIt is not, ''Black Flame'' stresses, self-identity (such as calling oneself an 'anarchist') that makes one an \"anarchist\": the term \"anarchist,\" after all, has been used by the radical right, by free market neo-liberals, and by rock stars. It is the ideological content that matters, and this content goes back to the Bakuninist wing of the  \"First International.\" Thus, figures like the syndicalist [[Bill Haywood]], who often used the term \"anarchism\" in a negative way, form part of the larger anarchist tradition - while figures with no real connection to that tradition, like Stirner, do not.\n\n== Mass anarchism (including syndicalism) versus insurrectionist anarchism ==\n\nVan der Walt and Schmidt argue, instead, that the main divide in the anarchist movement has been between two main ''strategic'' approaches,  \"mass and [[insurrectionist anarchism]].\" The book is closer to the mass anarchist perspective, although it provides considerable coverage of insurrectionism.<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\nFor the authors, mass anarchism \"stresses that only mass movements can create revolutionary change in society,\" and \"that such movements are typically built through struggles around immediate issues and reforms.\u201d<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\nA key example of \"mass anarchism\" is [[syndicalism]], which is a variant of anarchism, and a key \"mass anarchist\" approach. However, it argues, not all mass anarchists are syndicalists, nor are all anarchists, mass anarchists.\n\nThey go on that \u201c[t]he insurrectionist approach, in contrast, claims that reforms are illusory, that movements like unions are willing or unwitting bulwarks of the existing order, and that formal organisations are authoritarian.\" Consequently, insurrectionist anarchism typically emphasises violent action \u2013 \u2018propaganda by the deed\u2019 \u2013 as the \"most important means of evoking a spontaneous revolutionary upsurge\u201d by the popular classes<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\n== Sequel: ''Global Fire'' ==\n\n''Black Flame'' is the first of two volumes in the authors' ''Counter Power'' series.

These currents cannot be logically excluded from anarchism, if anarchism is defined as anti-statism, but it would also be nonsensical to include them within anarchism.\n\nRather, anarchism (including syndicalism) emerged as a movement in the [[International Workingmen's Association]], or \"First International,\" founded in 1864: the new anarchist current emerged simultaneously in Europe and Latin America. After the International split in 1872, the anarchist majority   (sometimes known as the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]]) attracted affiliates in central Asia and North Africa. This is ignored by flawed twentieth century scholarship, which reduced anarchism to anti-statism, so conflating the movement with earlier (as well as parallel) libertarian currents. Thus, anarchism is regarded here as a distinct, continuous and novel ideological and political tradition, not a gallery of superficially similar moments and thinkers.\n\nAnarchism was, that is, born as a radical, anti-capitalist current in the radical working class and peasant milieu. Since this milieu was the product of modern capitalist and the modern state in the 1800s, the first anarchist formations emerged in the 1860s and 1870s in areas by then being reshaped by these forces: parts of East as well as West Europe, North Africa as well as North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. As capitalist modernity expanded into southern Africa from the 1880s and east Asia from the 1890s, anarchism spread into those regions as well.\n\nFurther, since syndicalism is a variant of anarchism, argues ''Black Flame'', syndicalists who rejected the anarchist label, like [[James Connolly]] and [[Bill Haywood]] are nonetheless still part of the anarchist tradition.\n\nIt is not, ''Black Flame'' stresses, self-identity (such as calling oneself an 'anarchist') that makes one an \"anarchist\": the term \"anarchist,\" after all, has been used by the radical right, by free market neo-liberals, and by rock stars. It is the ideological content that matters, and this content goes back to the Bakuninist wing of the  \"First International.\" Thus, figures like the syndicalist [[Bill Haywood]], who often used the term \"anarchism\" in a negative way, form part of the larger anarchist tradition - while figures with no real connection to that tradition, like Stirner, do not.\n\n== Mass anarchism (including syndicalism) versus insurrectionist anarchism ==\n\nVan der Walt and Schmidt argue, instead, that the main divide in the anarchist movement has been between two main ''strategic'' approaches,  \"mass and [[insurrectionist anarchism]].\" The book is closer to the mass anarchist perspective, although it provides considerable coverage of insurrectionism.<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\nFor the authors, mass anarchism \"stresses that only mass movements can create revolutionary change in society,\" and \"that such movements are typically built through struggles around immediate issues and reforms.\u201d<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\nA key example of \"mass anarchism\" is [[syndicalism]], which is a variant of anarchism, and a key \"mass anarchist\" approach. However, it argues, not all mass anarchists are syndicalists, nor are all anarchists, mass anarchists.\n\nThey go on that \u201c[t]he insurrectionist approach, in contrast, claims that reforms are illusory, that movements like unions are willing or unwitting bulwarks of the existing order, and that formal organisations are authoritarian.\" Consequently, insurrectionist anarchism typically emphasises violent action \u2013 \u2018propaganda by the deed\u2019 \u2013 as the \"most important means of evoking a spontaneous revolutionary upsurge\u201d by the popular classes<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\n== Sequel: ''Global Fire'' ==\n\n''Black Flame'' is the first of two volumes in the authors' ''Counter Power'' series. ''Black Flame'' is a thematic work, on the history and theory of global anarchism and syndicalism. The forthcoming sequel, ''Global Fire'', will provide a global narrative history of the movement.\n\n== The authors ==\n\nThe authors are South Africans.\n\nMichael Schmidt, a senior journalist with an activist background, is now a journalism trainer.\n\n[[Lucien van der Walt]], an industrial sociologist who works on labour and left movements and capitalist restructuring, also has an activist background.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20171119063336/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/black-flame-the-revolutionary-class-politics-of-anarchism-and-syndicalism-%E2%80%94-book-excerpt/ An excerpt from the book, plus the contents pages]\n*[http://black-flame-anarchism.blogspot.com/A blog on ''Black Flame'', including many reviews, news on launches, short articles and debates]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170828002207/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ \"Fanning the Flames\": Interview with the authors, Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt]\n*[http://lucienvanderwalt.wordpress.com/ Various writings by co-author Lucien van der Walt]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100917060243/http://ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html Exchange on ''Black Flame'' with ''[[Anarchist Studies]]'' between Spencer Sunshine and Lucien van der Walt]\n*[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/c2frv6 Review of the book by 'M.
