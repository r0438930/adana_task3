The railway bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]] as the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and built during 1882 by J. S. Bennett, with iron work by J. & C. Brettell, Worcester, England. The bridge is also known as the '''Tamworth rail bridge over Peel River''' and the '''Tamworth Lattice Railway Bridge'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1058>{{cite NSW SHR|5012237|Tamworth rail bridge over Peel River|hr=01058|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is located {{convert|454.125|km}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 20-year period 1873-1893 there was a massive programme of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. It was a boom period that ended with a severe economic depression.<ref name=nswshr-1058/>\n\nDespite the boom conditions, the respective Chief Engineers, for Roads (William C. Bennett) and for Railways ([[John Whitton]]) were constrained to economise by using as much local material as possible, consequently an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridgeworks, mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1058/>\n\nHowever, there were many major rivers to be crossed, requiring long span bridges, for which no form of timber bridge was suitable. These large bridges had to be metal and supplied from England, a very expensive import cost to the successive colonial governments.<ref name=nswshr-1058/>\n\nBoth Chief Engineers were British so they chose the widely used wrought iron lattice truss bridge in the half-through form. Twelve of these were built for the railways and 24 for roads. These two sets of iron lattice bridges are the most significant group of bridges of the colonial period. A high percentage are extant and still in use, eleven on railways and eighteen on roads.<ref name=nswshr-1058/>\n\nThe current railway lattice bridges are:<ref name=nswshr-1058/>\n*1876{{spaced endash}}[[Macquarie River railway bridge, Bathurst|Macquarie River railway bridge]] at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] \n*1881{{spaced endash}}[[Murrumbidgee River railway bridge, Wagga Wagga|Murrumbidgee River railway bridge]] at [[Wagga Wagga]]\n*1881{{spaced endash}}Macquarie River at [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]] \n*1882{{spaced endash}}[[Peel River (New South Wales)|Peel River]] at Tamworth\n*1882{{spaced endash}}[[Macdonald River railway bridge, Woolbrook|Macdonald River railway bridge]] at [[Woolbrook, New South Wales|Woolbrook]] \n*1884{{spaced endash}}[[Murray River railway bridge, Albury-Wodonga|Murray River railway bridge]] at [[Albury]]-[[Wodonga]]\n*1884{{spaced endash}}[[Macquarie River railway bridge, Dubbo|Macquarie River railway bridge]] at [[Dubbo]] \n*1885{{spaced endash}}Murrumbidgee River at [[Narrandera]]\n*1887{{spaced endash}}[[Lachlan River railway bridge, Cowra|Lachlan River railway bridge]] at [[Cowra]]\n\nTwo former railway lattice bridges (1885 [[Como railway bridge|Georges River railway bridge]] at [[Como, New South Wales|Como]] and 1886 [[Parramatta River railway bridge, Meadowbank|Parramatta River railway bridge]] at [[Meadowbank, New South Wales|Meadowbank]]) were converted for use by pedestrian/cycle ways.<ref name=nswshr-1058/>\n\nThe 1871 lattice railway bridge over the [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]] at [[Aberdeen, New South Wales|Aberdeen]] was replaced by steel girders and demolished.<ref name=nswshr-1058/>\n\n== Description ==\nA single-[[Span (architecture)|span]] iron [[Latticework|lattice]] bridge.
