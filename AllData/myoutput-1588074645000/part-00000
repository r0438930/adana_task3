His mother died on 16 January 1536, when Palestrina was aged 10. Documents suggest that he first visited Rome in 1537, when he is listed as a lolthe [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] basilica, Cathedral of the Diocese of Rome. He studied with [[Robin Mallapert]] and [[Firmin Lebel]]. He spent most of his career in the city.\n\nPalestrina came of age as a musician under the influence of the northern European style of [[polyphony]], which owed its dominance in Italy primarily to two influential [[Netherlandish]] composers, [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Josquin des Prez]], who had spent significant portions of their careers there. Italy itself had yet to produce anyone of comparable fame or skill in polyphony.<ref name=Roche/>\n\nFrom 1544 to 1551, Palestrina was the organist of the [[Palestrina Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Agapito]], the principal church of his native city. In 1551 [[Pope Julius III]] (previously the [[Bishop of Palestrina]]) appointed Palestrina ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' or musical director of the [[Cappella Giulia]],<ref>Lino Bianchi, ''Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina''</ref> (Julian Chapel, in the sense of choir), the choir of the chapter of canons at [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Palestrina dedicated to Julius III his first published compositions (1554), a book of [[Mass (music)|Masses]]. It was the first book of Masses by a native composer, since in the Italian states of Palestrina's day, most composers of sacred music were from the [[Low Countries]], France, or Spain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In fact the book was modeled on one by [[Crist\u00f3bal de Morales]]: the woodcut in the front is almost an exact copy of the one from the book by the Spanish composer.\n\n[[File:Facade San Giovanni in Laterano 2006-09-07.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|St John Lateran]], Rome, where Palestrina was musical director]]\nDuring the next decade, Palestrina held positions similar to his Julian Chapel appointment at other chapels and churches in Rome, notably [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|St. John Lateran]] (1555\u20131560, a post previously held by [[Lassus]]), and Santa Maria Maggiore (1561\u20131566). In 1571 he returned to the Julian Chapel and remained at St Peter's for the rest of his life. The decade of the 1570s was difficult for him personally: he lost his brother, two of his sons, and his wife in three separate outbreaks of the plague (1572, 1575, and 1580, respectively). He seems to have considered becoming a priest at this time, but instead he remarried, this time to a wealthy widow. This finally gave him financial independence (he was not well paid as choirmaster) and he was able to compose prolifically until his death.\n\nHe died in Rome of [[pleurisy]] on 2 February 1594. It is said that Palestrina died only one day before his 69th birthday. As was usual, Palestrina was buried on the same day he died, in a plain coffin with a lead plate on which was inscribed ''[[Libera me]] Domine''. A five-part psalm for three choirs was sung at the funeral.<ref name=Pyne>Zoe Kendrick Pyne, ''Giovanni Pierluigi di Palestrina: His Life and Times'' (London: Bodley Head, 1922).</ref> Palestrina's funeral was held at St. Peter's, and he was buried beneath the floor of the basilica.

In addition, there are at least 72 [[hymn]]s, 35 [[magnificat]]s, 11 [[litany|litanies]], and four or five sets of [[Lamentations (music)|lamentations]].<ref name=Roche/> The ''Gloria'' melody from Palestrina's ''Magnificat Tertii Toni'' (1591) is widely used today in the resurrection hymn tune, ''Victory'' (The Strife Is O'er).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PsH/391 |title=The Psalter Hymnal Handbook |editor-first1=Emily |editor-last1=Brink |editor-first2=Bert |editor-last2=Polman |date=1998 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis attitude toward madrigals was somewhat enigmatic: whereas in the preface to his collection of ''Canticum canticorum'' (Song of Songs) motets (1584) he renounced the setting of profane texts, only two years later he was back in print with Book II of his secular madrigals (some of these being among the finest compositions in the medium).<ref name=Roche/> He published just two collections of madrigals with profane texts, one in 1555 and another in 1586.<ref name=Roche/> The other two collections were spiritual madrigals, a genre beloved by the proponents of the Counter-Reformation.<ref name=Roche/>\n\nPalestrina's masses show how his compositional style developed over time.<ref name=Roche/> His ''Missa sine nomine'' seems to have been particularly attractive to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who studied and performed it while writing the [[Mass in B minor]].<ref name=Wolff>Christoph Wolff, ''Der Stile Antico in der Musik Johann Sebastian Bachs: Studien zu Bachs Sp\u00e4twerk'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1968), pp. 224\u2013225.</ref> Most of Palestrina's masses appeared in thirteen volumes printed between 1554 and 1601, the last seven published after his death.<ref name=Roche/><ref name=Garrat>James Garrat, ''Palestrina and the German Romantic Imagination'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002).</ref>\n[[File:Palestrina missa papae macelli kyrie.PNG|thumb|522x522px|Pope Marcellus Mass - Kyrie]]\nOne of his most important works, the ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'' ([http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/d/d9/IMSLP334033-SIBLEY1802.25717.71e8-39087015868518score.pdf Pope Marcellus Mass]), has been historically associated with erroneous information involving the Council of Trent.  According to this tale (which forms the basis of [[Hans Pfitzner]]'s opera [[Palestrina (opera)|''Palestrina'']]), it was composed in order to persuade the [[Council of Trent]] that a draconian ban on the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] treatment of text in sacred music (as opposed, that is, to a more directly intelligible homophonic treatment) was unnecessary.<ref name=\"Bokina\">John Bokina, ''Opera and Politics'' (New York: Yale University Press, 1997), pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> However, more recent scholarship shows that this mass was in fact composed before the cardinals convened to discuss the ban (possibly as much as 10 years before).<ref name=\"Bokina\" /> Historical data indicates that the Council of Trent, as an official body, never actually banned any church music and failed to make any ruling or official statement on the subject. These stories originated from the unofficial points-of-view of some Council attendees who discussed their ideas with those not privy to the Council's deliberations. Those opinions and rumors have, over centuries, been transmuted into fictional accounts, put into print, and often incorrectly taught as historical fact. While Palestrina's compositional motivations are not known, he may have been quite conscious of the need for intelligible text; however, this was not to conform with any doctrine of the [[Counter-Reformation]],<ref name=\"Bokina\" /> because no such doctrine exists.  His characteristic style remained consistent from the 1560s until the end of his life.  Roche's hypothesis that Palestrina's seemingly dispassionate approach to expressive or emotive texts could have resulted from his having to produce many to order, or from a deliberate decision that any intensity of expression was unbecoming in church music,<ref name=\"Roche\" /> reflects modern expectations about expressive freedom and underestimates the extent to which the mood of Palestrina's settings is adapted to the liturgical occasions for which the texts were set, rather than the line-by-line meaning of the text, and depends on the distinctive characters of the church [[Gregorian mode|modes]] and variations in vocal grouping for expressive effect. Performing editions and recordings of Palestrina have tended to favour his works in the more familiar modes and standard (SATB) voicings, under-representing the expressive variety of his settings.\n\nThere are two comprehensive editions of Palestrina's works: a 33-volume edition published by Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel, in [[Leipzig]] Germany between 1862 and 1894 edited by [[Franz Xaver Haberl]], and a 34-volume edition published in the mid twentieth century, by Fratelli Scalera, in Rome, Italy edited by [[w:it:Raffaele Casimiri|R. Casimiri]] and others.\n\n==The 'Palestrina Style'==\nOne of the hallmarks of Palestrina's music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the [[Off-beat (music)|\"weak\" beats]] in a measure.<ref name=Jeppesen>Knud Jeppesen, ''Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century'', trans. Glen Haydon (with a new foreword by Alfred Mann; New York: Prentice-Hall, 1939, repr. New York: Dover, 1992).</ref> This produced a smoother and more consonant type of [[polyphony]] which is now considered to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina's position as Europe's leading composer (along with [[Orlande de Lassus]]) in the wake of [[Josquin des Prez]] (d. 1521).\n\nThe \"Palestrina style\" taught in college courses covering Renaissance [[counterpoint]] is often based on the codification by the 18th-century composer and theorist [[Johann Joseph Fux]], published as ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' (Steps to Parnassus, 1725). Citing Palestrina as his model, Fux divided counterpoint into five ''species'' (hence the term \"[[species counterpoint]]\"), designed as exercises for the student, which deployed progressively more elaborate rhythmic combinations of voices while adhering to strict harmonic and melodic requirements. The method was widely adopted and was the main basis of contrapuntal training in the 19th century, but Fux had introduced a number of simplifications to the Palestrina style, notably the obligatory use of a ''[[cantus firmus]]'' in [[semibreves]], which were corrected by later authors such as [[Knud Jeppesen]] and [[R. O. Morris]]. Palestrina's music conforms in many ways to Fux's rules, particularly in the fifth species but does not fit his pedagogical format.\n\nThe main insight, that the \"pure\" style of polyphony achieved by Palestrina followed an invariable set of stylistic and combinational requirements, was justified. Fux's manual was endorsed by his contemporary [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], who himself arranged two of Palestrina's masses for performance.\n\nAccording to Fux, Palestrina had established and followed these basic guidelines:\n\n* The flow of music is dynamic, not rigid or static.\n* Melody should contain few leaps between notes. (Jeppesen: \"The line is the starting point of Palestrina's style\".)<ref name=Jeppesen/>\n* If a leap occurs, it must be small and immediately countered by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.\n* Dissonances are to be confined to suspensions, passing notes and weak beats. If one falls on a strong beat (in a suspension) it must be immediately resolved.\n\nNot mentioned by Fux, was the manner in which the musical phrasing of Palestrina followed the [[syntax]] of the sentences he was setting to music,\nsomething not always observed by earlier composers. Also to be noticed in Palestrina is a great deal of [[tone painting]]. Elementary examples of this are descending musical motion with Latin words like ''descendit'' (descends) or of a static musical or cadential moment with the words ''de coelis'' (from heaven).<ref>{{cite book|last=Georgiades|first=Thrasybulos|year=1974|title=Music and Language The Rise of Western Music as Exemplified in Settings of the Mass|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Giovanni_Palestrina_and_Pope_Julius_III.jpg|thumb|Palestrina, presenting his masses to Pope [[Julius III]], 1554]]\nPalestrina was extremely famous in his day, and if anything, his reputation and influence increased after his death.

Palestrina dedicated to Julius III his first published compositions (1554), a book of [[Mass (music)|Masses]]. It was the first book of Masses by a native composer, since in the Italian states of Palestrina's day, most composers of sacred music were from the [[Low Countries]], France, or Spain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In fact the book was modeled on one by [[Crist\u00f3bal de Morales]]: the woodcut in the front is almost an exact copy of the one from the book by the Spanish composer.\n\n[[File:Facade San Giovanni in Laterano 2006-09-07.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|St John Lateran]], Rome, where Palestrina was musical director]]\nDuring the next decade, Palestrina held positions similar to his Julian Chapel appointment at other chapels and churches in Rome, notably [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|St. John Lateran]] (1555\u20131560, a post previously held by [[Lassus]]), and Santa Maria Maggiore (1561\u20131566). In 1571 he returned to the Julian Chapel and remained at St Peter's for the rest of his life. The decade of the 1570s was difficult for him personally: he lost his brother, two of his sons, and his wife in three separate outbreaks of the plague (1572, 1575, and 1580, respectively). He seems to have considered becoming a priest at this time, but instead he remarried, this time to a wealthy widow. This finally gave him financial independence (he was not well paid as choirmaster) and he was able to compose prolifically until his death.\n\nHe died in Rome of [[pleurisy]] on 2 February 1594. It is said that Palestrina died only one day before his 69th birthday. As was usual, Palestrina was buried on the same day he died, in a plain coffin with a lead plate on which was inscribed ''[[Libera me]] Domine''. A five-part psalm for three choirs was sung at the funeral.<ref name=Pyne>Zoe Kendrick Pyne, ''Giovanni Pierluigi di Palestrina: His Life and Times'' (London: Bodley Head, 1922).</ref> Palestrina's funeral was held at St. Peter's, and he was buried beneath the floor of the basilica. His tomb was later covered by new construction and attempts to locate the site have been unsuccessful.\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Counterpoint}}\n{{Listen|header=Agnus Dei from Missa in Festis Apostolorum\n| image       = \n| filename    = Palestrina Agnus Dei from Missa in Festis Apostolorum.ogg\n| alt         = \n| title       = Instrumental midi version\n| description = |Audio|help=no}}\n{{Listen|header=Madrigal Vestiva i colli - Prima parte\n| image       = \n| filename    = Palestrina - Vestiva i colli - Prima parte.ogg\n| alt         = \n| title       = Instrumental midi version\n| description = |Audio|help=no}}\nPalestrina left hundreds of compositions, including 105 [[mass (music)|masses]], 68 [[offertory|offertories]], at least 140 [[madrigal]]s and more than 300 [[motet]]s. In addition, there are at least 72 [[hymn]]s, 35 [[magnificat]]s, 11 [[litany|litanies]], and four or five sets of [[Lamentations (music)|lamentations]].<ref name=Roche/> The ''Gloria'' melody from Palestrina's ''Magnificat Tertii Toni'' (1591) is widely used today in the resurrection hymn tune, ''Victory'' (The Strife Is O'er).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PsH/391 |title=The Psalter Hymnal Handbook |editor-first1=Emily |editor-last1=Brink |editor-first2=Bert |editor-last2=Polman |date=1998 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis attitude toward madrigals was somewhat enigmatic: whereas in the preface to his collection of ''Canticum canticorum'' (Song of Songs) motets (1584) he renounced the setting of profane texts, only two years later he was back in print with Book II of his secular madrigals (some of these being among the finest compositions in the medium).<ref name=Roche/> He published just two collections of madrigals with profane texts, one in 1555 and another in 1586.<ref name=Roche/> The other two collections were spiritual madrigals, a genre beloved by the proponents of the Counter-Reformation.<ref name=Roche/>\n\nPalestrina's masses show how his compositional style developed over time.<ref name=Roche/> His ''Missa sine nomine'' seems to have been particularly attractive to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who studied and performed it while writing the [[Mass in B minor]].<ref name=Wolff>Christoph Wolff, ''Der Stile Antico in der Musik Johann Sebastian Bachs: Studien zu Bachs Sp\u00e4twerk'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1968), pp. 224\u2013225.</ref> Most of Palestrina's masses appeared in thirteen volumes printed between 1554 and 1601, the last seven published after his death.<ref name=Roche/><ref name=Garrat>James Garrat, ''Palestrina and the German Romantic Imagination'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002).</ref>\n[[File:Palestrina missa papae macelli kyrie.PNG|thumb|522x522px|Pope Marcellus Mass - Kyrie]]\nOne of his most important works, the ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'' ([http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/d/d9/IMSLP334033-SIBLEY1802.25717.71e8-39087015868518score.pdf Pope Marcellus Mass]), has been historically associated with erroneous information involving the Council of Trent.  According to this tale (which forms the basis of [[Hans Pfitzner]]'s opera [[Palestrina (opera)|''Palestrina'']]), it was composed in order to persuade the [[Council of Trent]] that a draconian ban on the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] treatment of text in sacred music (as opposed, that is, to a more directly intelligible homophonic treatment) was unnecessary.<ref name=\"Bokina\">John Bokina, ''Opera and Politics'' (New York: Yale University Press, 1997), pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> However, more recent scholarship shows that this mass was in fact composed before the cardinals convened to discuss the ban (possibly as much as 10 years before).<ref name=\"Bokina\" /> Historical data indicates that the Council of Trent, as an official body, never actually banned any church music and failed to make any ruling or official statement on the subject. These stories originated from the unofficial points-of-view of some Council attendees who discussed their ideas with those not privy to the Council's deliberations. Those opinions and rumors have, over centuries, been transmuted into fictional accounts, put into print, and often incorrectly taught as historical fact. While Palestrina's compositional motivations are not known, he may have been quite conscious of the need for intelligible text; however, this was not to conform with any doctrine of the [[Counter-Reformation]],<ref name=\"Bokina\" /> because no such doctrine exists.  His characteristic style remained consistent from the 1560s until the end of his life.  Roche's hypothesis that Palestrina's seemingly dispassionate approach to expressive or emotive texts could have resulted from his having to produce many to order, or from a deliberate decision that any intensity of expression was unbecoming in church music,<ref name=\"Roche\" /> reflects modern expectations about expressive freedom and underestimates the extent to which the mood of Palestrina's settings is adapted to the liturgical occasions for which the texts were set, rather than the line-by-line meaning of the text, and depends on the distinctive characters of the church [[Gregorian mode|modes]] and variations in vocal grouping for expressive effect. Performing editions and recordings of Palestrina have tended to favour his works in the more familiar modes and standard (SATB) voicings, under-representing the expressive variety of his settings.\n\nThere are two comprehensive editions of Palestrina's works: a 33-volume edition published by Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel, in [[Leipzig]] Germany between 1862 and 1894 edited by [[Franz Xaver Haberl]], and a 34-volume edition published in the mid twentieth century, by Fratelli Scalera, in Rome, Italy edited by [[w:it:Raffaele Casimiri|R. Casimiri]] and others.\n\n==The 'Palestrina Style'==\nOne of the hallmarks of Palestrina's music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the [[Off-beat (music)|\"weak\" beats]] in a measure.<ref name=Jeppesen>Knud Jeppesen, ''Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century'', trans. Glen Haydon (with a new foreword by Alfred Mann; New York: Prentice-Hall, 1939, repr. New York: Dover, 1992).</ref> This produced a smoother and more consonant type of [[polyphony]] which is now considered to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina's position as Europe's leading composer (along with [[Orlande de Lassus]]) in the wake of [[Josquin des Prez]] (d. 1521).\n\nThe \"Palestrina style\" taught in college courses covering Renaissance [[counterpoint]] is often based on the codification by the 18th-century composer and theorist [[Johann Joseph Fux]], published as ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' (Steps to Parnassus, 1725). Citing Palestrina as his model, Fux divided counterpoint into five ''species'' (hence the term \"[[species counterpoint]]\"), designed as exercises for the student, which deployed progressively more elaborate rhythmic combinations of voices while adhering to strict harmonic and melodic requirements. The method was widely adopted and was the main basis of contrapuntal training in the 19th century, but Fux had introduced a number of simplifications to the Palestrina style, notably the obligatory use of a ''[[cantus firmus]]'' in [[semibreves]], which were corrected by later authors such as [[Knud Jeppesen]] and [[R. O. Morris]]. Palestrina's music conforms in many ways to Fux's rules, particularly in the fifth species but does not fit his pedagogical format.\n\nThe main insight, that the \"pure\" style of polyphony achieved by Palestrina followed an invariable set of stylistic and combinational requirements, was justified. Fux's manual was endorsed by his contemporary [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], who himself arranged two of Palestrina's masses for performance.\n\nAccording to Fux, Palestrina had established and followed these basic guidelines:\n\n* The flow of music is dynamic, not rigid or static.\n* Melody should contain few leaps between notes. (Jeppesen: \"The line is the starting point of Palestrina's style\".)<ref name=Jeppesen/>\n* If a leap occurs, it must be small and immediately countered by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.\n* Dissonances are to be confined to suspensions, passing notes and weak beats. If one falls on a strong beat (in a suspension) it must be immediately resolved.\n\nNot mentioned by Fux, was the manner in which the musical phrasing of Palestrina followed the [[syntax]] of the sentences he was setting to music,\nsomething not always observed by earlier composers. Also to be noticed in Palestrina is a great deal of [[tone painting]]. Elementary examples of this are descending musical motion with Latin words like ''descendit'' (descends) or of a static musical or cadential moment with the words ''de coelis'' (from heaven).<ref>{{cite book|last=Georgiades|first=Thrasybulos|year=1974|title=Music and Language The Rise of Western Music as Exemplified in Settings of the Mass|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Giovanni_Palestrina_and_Pope_Julius_III.jpg|thumb|Palestrina, presenting his masses to Pope [[Julius III]], 1554]]\nPalestrina was extremely famous in his day, and if anything, his reputation and influence increased after his death.
