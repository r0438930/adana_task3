While agreeing that the country faced a financial crisis, organisations including some [[trade unions in the United Kingdom|UK trade unions]], argued that the [[Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition government]] was pushing deep spending cuts rapidly and without proper consultations or consideration for the impact on the public. They believed that most of the government cuts were designed to target the working class, while big businesses and financial businesses, in particular businesses with connections to British MPs, were going unpunished whilst avoiding paying any tax, despite their perception that the latter was the main reason for the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis]] and the subsequent [[Late-2000s recession|recession]].<ref name=\"Gulfnews\">{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/opinion/london-faces-a-summer-of-strike-chaos-over-austerity-1.829578|title=London faces a summer of strike chaos over austerity|work=Gulf News|first=Ayman|last=Mustafa|date=29 June 2011|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nEarlier demonstrations led to a major event, the [[March for the Alternative]], on 26 March 2011 coordinated by the [[Trades Union Congress]] with a crowd of 500,000 people taking to [[London|London's]] streets.<ref name=\"Time 110326 Anti-cuts\">[http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/26/anti-cuts-march-for-the-alternative-draws-500000-protestors-in-london/ Anti-cuts March for the Alternative draws 500,000 protestors in London].

The Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] became prime minister, whilst Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] became deputy prime minister.\n\nThe government planned to put into action sharp spending cuts, stating that they were necessary to address the [[United Kingdom]]'s record peacetime [[Government budget deficit|deficit]], with the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]], saying that Britain risks suffering a debt crisis like those seen in [[Greece]], [[Ireland]] and [[Portugal]] if it fails to reduce the budget deficit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/UPDATE-1-Osborne-Euro-zone-targetukfocus-1207082316.html?x=0 |title=UPDATE 1-Osborne: Euro zone crisis shows debt dangers for UK |publisher=Yahoo!

The planned spending cuts included most government departments, which involved around 300,000 public service job cuts and the pay of other civil servants being frozen.\n\nOrganisers said the government's plans to eliminate the deficit in four years, and to focus on cutting spending rather than raising tax, did not have national support. They say they want to give a voice to all the people affected by the cuts, and to demonstrate to Westminster that the public rejects the argument that there is no alternative. They and many protesters argue that the cuts will threaten the country's economic recovery.<ref name=\"Time 110326 Anti-cuts\" /><ref name=\"AP London\"/><ref name=abc/> They suggest that since the government recently spent billions bailing out indebted banks,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Banking crisis timeline | date=30 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=487951&in_page_id=2 |title=Bank of England: Bailout bill over \u00a31 trillion |publisher=This is Money |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> the government should create new taxes for banks and close loopholes that allow some companies to pay less tax.
