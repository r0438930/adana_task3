Like many other children, the kids in this documentary travel without an accompanying adult and their mode of transportation is \"El Tren de la Muerte.\" These stories focus on the emotional impact of the journey as well as the physical danger. The documentary also shows what happens to children when they fail to arrive at their destination and are forced to go back to their countries of origin.
