In Solo ([[Surakarta]]), Kleen worked with [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]] to write an anthropological study on the ritual court dances of Solo. Both also participated in the dance lessons.[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers] Kleen felt that dancing not only involved making the right movements on the sound of music, but that it also involved the transition into an altered state of mind to become in harmony not only with oneself, but with the Universe.\n\nUnfortunately, this project ended in July 1920 in turmoil due to clashing personalities, and van Helsdingen-Schoevers died 17 August 1920 of an unknown disease.<ref>Vivian van de Loo, \"Leven tussen Kunst en Krant, [[Beata van Helsdingen-Schoevers]],[[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beata_van_Helsdingen-Schoevers]] journaliste en declamatrice in Indi\u00eb.

In July 1925 there appeared a new edition with 30 pages of text. The coloured plates were reproductions made by the Topographic Service of Kleen's drawings. For everyone involved, but especially Kleen, the result was very disappointing, because she wanted to participate in this project in order to result in a standard reference work that could be presented worldwide.\n\nWhen she arrived in Bali in 1920, she started a new project on the mudras, or ritual hand poses, of the Balinese Hindu priests with the assistance of the Rajah of [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]], Gusti Bagus Djilantik, whom she had met in Solo the year before, and of [[Piet de Kat Angelino]]. This was a turning point in her career because de Kat Angelino was able to explain to her the mudras and also encouraged the priests to cooperate. He was district-officer (controleur) of Gianjar and [[Klungklung]] for over a decade and had been collecting material on Balinese priests for years in his home in Gianjar. At his home, she could draw priests and their mudras. Their work together is presented in the book ''Mudras'', with text and illustrations by Kleen, who acknowledged that much of the technical information about the poses and ceremonies came from de Kat Angelino and later on from R.Ng. Poerbatjaraka. Kleen spent the whole of 1921 in Java, working on the material collected in Bali the year before. She exhibited her pictures of the priests at the Art Society in Batavia. Collaboration with de Kat Angelino continued and she met him in Amsterdam on her way home. With his help an exhibition was arranged at the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam. The exhibition was favorably reviewed by de Kat Angelino in the magazine [[Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw |''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw'']].\nWhat was the reaction  at that time in the Netherlands on her work in Bali?\n[[Anne Hallema]], a Dutch journalist and art-criticus  wrote a critical and extensive article on the Mudra's which appeared Elseviers Ge\u00efllustreerd Maandschrift, Jaargang 34, 1924 pp.145-147. He disqualified her work as an artist but praiserd her for her scientific contribution. \nHe ends his article with stating that we have to be grateful that this stranger from the land of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f toke the initiativ to study the mudra's of the Balinese priests in performing his Hindu\u00efstic rituals. Specially the Indologists and Ori\u00ebtalists should be happy with the appearance of this publication.\n\nAnother crucial exhibition was ''Tv\u00e5 vittberesta damer'' (Two Travelling Ladies) at [[Liljevalchs konsthall|Liljevalch's]] Public Art Gallery in Stockholm 1922, where she showed art and artifacts from [[Java]] and [[Bali]] together with Swedish photographer and author [[Ida Trotzig]] contributing works from [[Japan]]. This exhibition was the starting point for the \"Bali-fever\" in Sweden. Kleen's depictions of mudras were shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1923.\n\nBesides ''Mudras'', Kleen published two other books about Bali: ''Ni-Si-Pleng, a story about black children written for white children'' (1924), and, seven years later, ''Tempeldanser och musikinstrument pa Bali'', printed in 300 numbered copies, translated in 1936 as ''The Temple Dances in Bali''.<ref>Elisabeth Lind: the pencil in the service of ethnographical research.p 91-133 in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered by Niclas Franz\u00e9n and others, Sweden 2018</ref>\n\nKleen's study on the mudras, the exhibition in Amsterdam at the Colonial Institute and the publication of her books made her internationally known. For her scientific ethnographic work on Bali, Kleen was awarded the Johan August Wahlberg silver medal in April 1938, given to individuals who have \"promoted anthropological and geographical science through outstanding efforts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssag.se/om/stadgar-och-bestammelser/johan-august-wahlbergs-medaljfond/|title=SSAG {{!}} Svenska S\u00e4llskapet f\u00f6r Antropologi och Geografi {{!}} Johan August Wahlbergs medaljfond|website=ssag.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Spies]] was the central figure in the circle of artists residing on the island in Ubud, Klungklung and Karangasem. He was considered to be the greatest expert on Balinese dance and drama. Together with the British dance critic [[Beryl de Zoete]], he wrote the standard 1938 work ''Dance and Drama in Bali''. Spies was jealous of the international success of Kleen{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and wrote a very critical nine-page review of the ''Temple Dances in Bali'' in the journal ''Djawa'' (1939). He complained, \"the text and the depictions are filled with so many mistakes, errors and incorrect statements that one must shake one's head.\" Spies claims that as an ethnographic document the book has no value.<ref>Elisabeth Lind, The pencil in the service of ethnographical research, etc. p. 131-132,</ref> As a result, there were nearly no references to the work of Kleen in any ethnographic periodicals or publications after this critical review. It is only in 1962 that [[C. Hooykaas]] in his article \"Saiva-Siddhanta in Java and Bali\"<ref>Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 118 (1962) no 3(Leiden 309-327</ref> supported the importance of the study on mudras by de Kat Angelino and Kleen.\n\nKleen contributed work to various European magazines, including ''Sluyters' Monthly'', ''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb Oud en Nieuw'', ''Ord och Bild'' and ''Inter-Ocean'', between 1920 and 1925<ref>Haks & Maris, Lexicon of foreign artists who visualized Indonesia. (1600-1950),Singapore 1995</ref> and influenced in this way the perception and expectations of foreign visitors to Bali. Furthermore, she influenced with her colourful, vivid and dynamic art-deco drawing style the development of painting by local artists in Bali, not in a one-way influence but more a kind of mutual influence.<ref>Bruce Granquist. Inventing art: The paintings of Batuan Bali. Satumata Press, 2012</ref> Mostly these local paintings were made for the touristic market and depicted daily life instead of exclusively being concerned with gods, demons and the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics. In this way, she took part in the marketing of \"the last paradise\". This also meant that she became associated with this type of magazine drawing instead of her more important  ethnographic publications.\n\n===Egypt===\nIn 1926, Kleen visited Egypt to study the meanings of the different hand and foot movements depicted in the art, which resulted in her last publication in 1946 of the book ''Solens Son'' about pharaoh [[Akhenaten|Echnaton]].\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Tyra-Kleen.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in the 1940s]]\nKleen left her collections to the Swedish House of Nobility on the condition that the archive would not be opened until 50 years after her death.[https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling] In 2001, the paintings, lithographs, drawings, diaries and sketches were brought out and the private part of her collection was brought home to Valinge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling/|title=Tyra Kleens samling : Riddarhuset|website=www.riddarhuset.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Kleen is represented with art at, for instance, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=24094&viewType=detailView|title=G\u00f6teborgs konstmuseum {{!}} Orientalisk parfym|website=emp-web-34.zetcom.ch|language=sv|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> and [[Nationalmuseum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=artist&objectId=15325&viewType=detailView|title=Nationalmuseum - Tyra Kleen|website=emp-web-84.zetcom.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> in Stockholm.

For everyone involved, but especially Kleen, the result was very disappointing, because she wanted to participate in this project in order to result in a standard reference work that could be presented worldwide.\n\nWhen she arrived in Bali in 1920, she started a new project on the mudras, or ritual hand poses, of the Balinese Hindu priests with the assistance of the Rajah of [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]], Gusti Bagus Djilantik, whom she had met in Solo the year before, and of [[Piet de Kat Angelino]]. This was a turning point in her career because de Kat Angelino was able to explain to her the mudras and also encouraged the priests to cooperate. He was district-officer (controleur) of Gianjar and [[Klungklung]] for over a decade and had been collecting material on Balinese priests for years in his home in Gianjar. At his home, she could draw priests and their mudras. Their work together is presented in the book ''Mudras'', with text and illustrations by Kleen, who acknowledged that much of the technical information about the poses and ceremonies came from de Kat Angelino and later on from R.Ng. Poerbatjaraka. Kleen spent the whole of 1921 in Java, working on the material collected in Bali the year before. She exhibited her pictures of the priests at the Art Society in Batavia. Collaboration with de Kat Angelino continued and she met him in Amsterdam on her way home. With his help an exhibition was arranged at the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam. The exhibition was favorably reviewed by de Kat Angelino in the magazine [[Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw |''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb, Oud en Nieuw'']].\nWhat was the reaction  at that time in the Netherlands on her work in Bali?\n[[Anne Hallema]], a Dutch journalist and art-criticus  wrote a critical and extensive article on the Mudra's which appeared Elseviers Ge\u00efllustreerd Maandschrift, Jaargang 34, 1924 pp.145-147. He disqualified her work as an artist but praiserd her for her scientific contribution. \nHe ends his article with stating that we have to be grateful that this stranger from the land of Selma Lagerl\u00f6f toke the initiativ to study the mudra's of the Balinese priests in performing his Hindu\u00efstic rituals. Specially the Indologists and Ori\u00ebtalists should be happy with the appearance of this publication.\n\nAnother crucial exhibition was ''Tv\u00e5 vittberesta damer'' (Two Travelling Ladies) at [[Liljevalchs konsthall|Liljevalch's]] Public Art Gallery in Stockholm 1922, where she showed art and artifacts from [[Java]] and [[Bali]] together with Swedish photographer and author [[Ida Trotzig]] contributing works from [[Japan]]. This exhibition was the starting point for the \"Bali-fever\" in Sweden. Kleen's depictions of mudras were shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1923.\n\nBesides ''Mudras'', Kleen published two other books about Bali: ''Ni-Si-Pleng, a story about black children written for white children'' (1924), and, seven years later, ''Tempeldanser och musikinstrument pa Bali'', printed in 300 numbered copies, translated in 1936 as ''The Temple Dances in Bali''.<ref>Elisabeth Lind: the pencil in the service of ethnographical research.p 91-133 in Tyra Kleen, her life and work rediscovered by Niclas Franz\u00e9n and others, Sweden 2018</ref>\n\nKleen's study on the mudras, the exhibition in Amsterdam at the Colonial Institute and the publication of her books made her internationally known. For her scientific ethnographic work on Bali, Kleen was awarded the Johan August Wahlberg silver medal in April 1938, given to individuals who have \"promoted anthropological and geographical science through outstanding efforts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssag.se/om/stadgar-och-bestammelser/johan-august-wahlbergs-medaljfond/|title=SSAG {{!}} Svenska S\u00e4llskapet f\u00f6r Antropologi och Geografi {{!}} Johan August Wahlbergs medaljfond|website=ssag.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Spies]] was the central figure in the circle of artists residing on the island in Ubud, Klungklung and Karangasem. He was considered to be the greatest expert on Balinese dance and drama. Together with the British dance critic [[Beryl de Zoete]], he wrote the standard 1938 work ''Dance and Drama in Bali''. Spies was jealous of the international success of Kleen{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and wrote a very critical nine-page review of the ''Temple Dances in Bali'' in the journal ''Djawa'' (1939). He complained, \"the text and the depictions are filled with so many mistakes, errors and incorrect statements that one must shake one's head.\" Spies claims that as an ethnographic document the book has no value.<ref>Elisabeth Lind, The pencil in the service of ethnographical research, etc. p. 131-132,</ref> As a result, there were nearly no references to the work of Kleen in any ethnographic periodicals or publications after this critical review. It is only in 1962 that [[C. Hooykaas]] in his article \"Saiva-Siddhanta in Java and Bali\"<ref>Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 118 (1962) no 3(Leiden 309-327</ref> supported the importance of the study on mudras by de Kat Angelino and Kleen.\n\nKleen contributed work to various European magazines, including ''Sluyters' Monthly'', ''Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb Oud en Nieuw'', ''Ord och Bild'' and ''Inter-Ocean'', between 1920 and 1925<ref>Haks & Maris, Lexicon of foreign artists who visualized Indonesia. (1600-1950),Singapore 1995</ref> and influenced in this way the perception and expectations of foreign visitors to Bali. Furthermore, she influenced with her colourful, vivid and dynamic art-deco drawing style the development of painting by local artists in Bali, not in a one-way influence but more a kind of mutual influence.<ref>Bruce Granquist. Inventing art: The paintings of Batuan Bali. Satumata Press, 2012</ref> Mostly these local paintings were made for the touristic market and depicted daily life instead of exclusively being concerned with gods, demons and the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics. In this way, she took part in the marketing of \"the last paradise\". This also meant that she became associated with this type of magazine drawing instead of her more important  ethnographic publications.\n\n===Egypt===\nIn 1926, Kleen visited Egypt to study the meanings of the different hand and foot movements depicted in the art, which resulted in her last publication in 1946 of the book ''Solens Son'' about pharaoh [[Akhenaten|Echnaton]].\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Tyra-Kleen.jpg|thumb|Tyra Kleen in the 1940s]]\nKleen left her collections to the Swedish House of Nobility on the condition that the archive would not be opened until 50 years after her death.[https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling] In 2001, the paintings, lithographs, drawings, diaries and sketches were brought out and the private part of her collection was brought home to Valinge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/tyra-kleens-samling/|title=Tyra Kleens samling : Riddarhuset|website=www.riddarhuset.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Kleen is represented with art at, for instance, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-34.zetcom.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=24094&viewType=detailView|title=G\u00f6teborgs konstmuseum {{!}} Orientalisk parfym|website=emp-web-34.zetcom.ch|language=sv|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> and [[Nationalmuseum]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emp-web-84.zetcom.ch/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=artist&objectId=15325&viewType=detailView|title=Nationalmuseum - Tyra Kleen|website=emp-web-84.zetcom.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> in Stockholm.

She loved her freedom and hated to be dominated by men or women. She was very ambitious and particular in traveling and doing business. She was very productive and could work for hours, days and weeks to get results. On the one hand she could be charming and kind, but she could switch quickly from friendship to hostility.
