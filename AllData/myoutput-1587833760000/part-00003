The group, which grew out of the harsh economic deprivations of [[working class]] Britain, was composed largely of young men of lower to middle-classes. They derived social power from robbery, violence, racketeering, illegal bookmaking and the control of gambling. Members of this gang wore a signature outfit that included tailored jackets, lapel [[overcoat]]s, button [[waistcoats]], silk [[scarves]], [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom trousers]], leather boots, and [[Flat cap|peaked flat caps]]. The gang was highly organised with its own systems of hierarchy.\n\nThe Blinders\u2019 dominance came about from beating rivals, such as the \"Sloggers\", whom they fought for territory in Birmingham and its surrounding districts. They held control for nearly 20 years until 1910, when a larger gang, the [[Birmingham Boys]] led by Billy Kimber, overtook them. However, even though they had disappeared by the 1920s, the name of the \"Peaky Blinders\" became synonymous slang for any street gang in Birmingham. \n\nIn 2013, the name was reused for a BBC television series entitled ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]''. The series, which stars [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Paul Anderson (actor)|Paul Anderson]], and [[Joe Cole (actor)|Joe Cole]], is a crime story about a fictional crime family operating in Birmingham just after World War I.\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe name  is said to be derived from the gang members' practice of stitching disposable [[razor blade]]s into the peaks of their [[flat cap]]s which could then be used as weapons.

Almost all members wore a peaked flat cap and an overcoat. Their sporting of the flat cap lends itself to debate regarding the naming of the gang. The Peaky Blinders wore tailored suits usually with [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom trousers]] and button jackets.<ref name=\"Halls\"/> The weather conditions of the slums prompted members to incorporate leather steel-toed boots into their outfits. Wealthier members wore silk scarves and [[Detachable collar|starched collars]] with metal tie buttons. Their distinctive dress was easily recognisable by city inhabitants, police, and rival gang members. The wives, girlfriends, and mistresses of the gang members were known for wearing lavish clothing. Pearls, silks, and colourful scarves were commonplace.<ref name=\"Halls\"/><ref name=\"Peak\" />\n\n===Decline===\nAfter nearly a decade of political control, their growing influence brought on the attention of a larger gang, the [[Birmingham Boys]]. The Peaky Blinders' expansion into racecourses led to violent backlash from the Birmingham Boys gang. Peaky Blinder families physically distanced themselves from Birmingham's centre into the countryside. With the Blinders' withdrawal from the criminal underworld, the [[Sabini gang]] moved in on the Birmingham Boys gang and solidified political control over Central England in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gangland.net/ukgangland.htm|title=UK Chaps|accessdate=2018-01-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012214335/http://gangland.net/ukgangland.htm|archivedate=12 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbarlay.com/journo1.html#az1|title=The Times - London A-Z Series No.1 (A Sample....) \"G for Gangland London\"|author=Barley, Nick|authorlink=|date=|year=2001|work=|publisher=[[The Times]]|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230213420/http://www.nickbarlay.com/journo1.html|archivedate=December 30, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=2006-12-06|quote=|coauthors=|month=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://innovatecentre.co.uk/solon/journal/issue%201.1/ShoreCandMIssue1%20.doc|title=Undiscovered Country\u2019: Towards A History Of The Criminal \u2018Underworld\u2019|author=Shore, Heather|authorlink=|date=|year=2001|work=|publisher=School of Cultural Studies:  Leeds Metropolitan University|pages=|language=|format=[[.doc]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130433/http://innovatecentre.co.uk/solon/journal/issue%201.1/ShoreCandMIssue1%20.doc|archivedate=September 29, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=2006-12-06|quote=|coauthors=|month=}}</ref>\n\nOther elements such as education, discipline and harsher policing and sentencing also contributed to the decrease of the blinder's influence, and by the 1920s they have officially disappeared.<ref>Chinn, p. 108, 116, 194</ref> As the specific gang known as the Peaky Blinders diminished, their namesake was used as generic term to describe violent street youth.<ref name=\"Halls\"/> The gangs' activities lasted from the 1890s until the 1930s.<ref name=\"The Week UK\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe [[BBC]] [[television drama series]] ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'', starring [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Sam Neill]], and [[Helen McCrory]], premiered in September 2013.

Shortly afterwards several men known as the \"Peaky Blinders\" gang, whom Eastwood knew by sight from their living in the same neighborhood as himself, came in.</poem>}}\n\nAfter some gangsters attacked a man in 1890, they sent a letter to various national newspapers declaring themselves as members of this specific group.<ref name=\":5\"/> Their first activities primarily revolved around occupying favourable land, notably the communities of [[Small Heath]] and Cheapside, Birmingham.<ref name=\"Halls\"/> Their expansion was noted by their first gang rival, the \"Cheapside Sloggers\", who battled against them in an effort to control land.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/real-peaky-blinders-pictures-unearthed-5903767|title=Meet the real Peaky Blinders...|last=McCarthy|first=Nick|date=2013-09-11|work=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref> The Sloggers originated in the 1870s and were known for street fights in the [[Bordesley, West Midlands|Bordesley]] and [[Small Heath, Birmingham|Small Heath]] areas \u2013 extremely poor slums of Birmingham.\n\nThe Peaky Blinders, after they established controlled territory, in the late 19th century began expanding their criminal enterprise. Their activities included [[protection racket]]s, [[fraud]], [[land grab]]s, [[smuggling]], [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]], [[robbery]], and illegal [[bookmaking]].<ref name=\"Halls\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-24047750|title=Birmingham's real Peaky Blinders|last=Bradley|first=Michael|date=2013-09-12|work=BBC News|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> Historian Heather Shor of the [[University of Leeds]] claims that the Blinders were more focused on street fighting, robbery, and [[Protection racket|racketeering]], as opposed to more [[organised crime]].<ref name=\"The Week UK\"/>\n\nHowever, the group was known for its violence not only on innocent civilians but also on rival gangs and constables. Gang wars between rival gangs frequently erupted in Birmingham which led to brawls and shootouts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chinn|first=Carl|title=Peaky Blinders: The Real Story|publisher=John Blake Publication|year=2019|page=192|ISBN=978-1789461725}}</ref> The Peaky Blinders also deliberately attacked police officers, which became known as \"constable baiting\".<ref name=\"ILuv\"/> In 1897, Constable George Snipe and Charles Philip Gunter were both killed in 1901 by the gang.<ref>Chinn, p.164, p.185</ref> Hundreds more were injured and some left the force because of the violence.<ref name=\"ILuv\"/>\n\nSoon, the term \"Peaky Blinder\" became a generic term for young street criminals in Birmingham.<ref name=\"Halls\"/><ref>Chinn, p. 99</ref> In 1899, an Irish [[Constable|police chief]] named Charles Haughton Rafter was contracted to enforce local law in Birmingham. However, police corruption and [[bribery]] diminished the effectiveness of his enforcement for a time.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\n===Notorious members===\nContrary to popular belief, most Peaky Blinders were from the middle class and had jobs.<ref>Chinn, p. 20</ref> The most powerful member of the Peaky Blinders was a man known as Kevin Mooney. His real name was Thomas Gilbert, but he routinely changed his last name. He initiated many of the [[Land grabbing|land grabs]] undertaken by the gang.\n\nOther prominent members of the gang were David Taylor, Earnest Haynes, Harry Fowles, and Stephen McNickle.<ref name=\"Peak\">{{cite news|author=Larner, Tony|title=When Peaky Blinders Ruled Streets with Fear|work=Sunday Mercury|date= 1 August 2010|page= 14}}</ref><ref name=\":2\"/> Harry Fowler, known as \"Baby-faced Harry\", was arrested at age 19 for stealing a bike in October 1904.<ref name=\":2\"/> McNickle and Haynes were also arrested at the same time, for stealing a bicycle and [[home invasion]], respectively.

Henry Lightfoot, the first person to be named as a Peaky Blinder, had joined the British Army three times in his life and participated in the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916.<ref>Chinn,  p. 155-159</ref> One of the youngest members, Henry Fowler, was buried alive in the trenches and couldn't speak or see for some time following the war.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/tv/news/a18796/11-things-you-didnt-know-about-peaky-blinders/|title=11 Things You Didn't Know About Peaky Blinders|magazine=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=30 November 2017|author=Laurs Raphael}}</ref>\n\nThe notorious gangster [[Billy Kimber (gangster)|Billy Kimber]] was also a former Peaky Blinder.<ref name=\"ILuv\">{{cite web|url=https://ilovemanchester.com/real-peaky-blinders-truth-behind-legend-manchester-funzing-talk/|title=Real Peaky Blinder: Truth Behind the Legend|website=I Love Manchester|author=Louise Rhind Tutt}} September 7, 2019</ref>\n\n===Weapons and fashion===\nThe Peaky Blinders used an assortment of melee weapons from belt buckles, metal-tipped boots, [[fire irons]], canes and knives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/80768/12-eye-opening-facts-about-peaky-blinders|title=12 Eye Opening Facts About the Peaky Blinder|website=Mental Floss|author=Cormier, Roger}} May 30, 2016</ref> In the case of George Eastwood, he was beaten by belt buckles.

Almost all members wore a peaked flat cap and an overcoat. Their sporting of the flat cap lends itself to debate regarding the naming of the gang. The Peaky Blinders wore tailored suits usually with [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom trousers]] and button jackets.<ref name=\"Halls\"/> The weather conditions of the slums prompted members to incorporate leather steel-toed boots into their outfits. Wealthier members wore silk scarves and [[Detachable collar|starched collars]] with metal tie buttons. Their distinctive dress was easily recognisable by city inhabitants, police, and rival gang members. The wives, girlfriends, and mistresses of the gang members were known for wearing lavish clothing. Pearls, silks, and colourful scarves were commonplace.<ref name=\"Halls\"/><ref name=\"Peak\" />\n\n===Decline===\nAfter nearly a decade of political control, their growing influence brought on the attention of a larger gang, the [[Birmingham Boys]]. The Peaky Blinders' expansion into racecourses led to violent backlash from the Birmingham Boys gang. Peaky Blinder families physically distanced themselves from Birmingham's centre into the countryside. With the Blinders' withdrawal from the criminal underworld, the [[Sabini gang]] moved in on the Birmingham Boys gang and solidified political control over Central England in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gangland.net/ukgangland.htm|title=UK Chaps|accessdate=2018-01-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012214335/http://gangland.net/ukgangland.htm|archivedate=12 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbarlay.com/journo1.html#az1|title=The Times - London A-Z Series No.1 (A Sample....) \"G for Gangland London\"|author=Barley, Nick|authorlink=|date=|year=2001|work=|publisher=[[The Times]]|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230213420/http://www.nickbarlay.com/journo1.html|archivedate=December 30, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=2006-12-06|quote=|coauthors=|month=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://innovatecentre.co.uk/solon/journal/issue%201.1/ShoreCandMIssue1%20.doc|title=Undiscovered Country\u2019: Towards A History Of The Criminal \u2018Underworld\u2019|author=Shore, Heather|authorlink=|date=|year=2001|work=|publisher=School of Cultural Studies:  Leeds Metropolitan University|pages=|language=|format=[[.doc]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130433/http://innovatecentre.co.uk/solon/journal/issue%201.1/ShoreCandMIssue1%20.doc|archivedate=September 29, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=2006-12-06|quote=|coauthors=|month=}}</ref>\n\nOther elements such as education, discipline and harsher policing and sentencing also contributed to the decrease of the blinder's influence, and by the 1920s they have officially disappeared.<ref>Chinn, p. 108, 116, 194</ref> As the specific gang known as the Peaky Blinders diminished, their namesake was used as generic term to describe violent street youth.<ref name=\"Halls\"/> The gangs' activities lasted from the 1890s until the 1930s.<ref name=\"The Week UK\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe [[BBC]] [[television drama series]] ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'', starring [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Sam Neill]], and [[Helen McCrory]], premiered in September 2013.
