The '''8.8&nbsp;cm Flak 16''' was a German 8.8&nbsp;cm anti-aircraft gun from World War I,  forerunner of the 8,8 cm [[Anti-aircraft warfare|FlaK]]/[[PaK]] [[Flak 88|Flak 18/36/37]] of World War II. Its contemporary name was the '''8,8&nbsp;cm K.Zugflak L/45'''.

Early anti-aircraft artillery guns of World War I were primarily adaptations of existing medium-[[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] weapons, mounted to enable fire at higher angles.

'''''Leptospermum gregarium''''' is a species of shrub that is [[Endemism|endemic]] to eastern Australia. Its young stems are hairy the leaves are egg-shaped to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, the flowers are white and arranged singly or in pairs on short side branches and the fruit remain on the plant at maturity. It usually grows in dense stands in swamps or along rocky creeks in high altitude place in northern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland.

==Description==
''Leptospermum gregarium'' is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about {{cvt|2|m}}. Older stems have bark that is shed in strips or small flakes and younger stems are covered with fine hairs. The leaves are broadly egg-shaped to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, mostly {{cvt|5-10|mm}} long and {{cvt|2.5-4|mm}} wide but sometimes longer. The flowers are white and are borne singly or in pairs on short side branches, and are less than {{cvt|10|mm}} in diameter. The [[Hypanthium|floral cup]] is hairy, about {{cvt|3|mm}} long on very short [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. The [[sepal]]s are triangular to more or less round, {{cvt|1.5-2|mm}} long, the [[petal]]s about {{cvt|3-4|mm}} long and the stamens {{cvt|1.5-2|mm}} long. Flowering mainly occurs from November to December and the fruit is a [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] mostly {{cvt|5-6|mm}} in diameter and remain on the plant at maturity.<ref name=\"Telopea\">{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Joy |title=A revision of the genus ''Leptospermum'' (Myrtaceae) |journal=Telopea |date=1989 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=411–412}}</ref><ref name=\"RBGS\">{{cite web |title=''Leptospermum gregarium'' |url=http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&lvl=sp&name=Leptospermum~gregarium |publisher=Royal Botanic Garden Sydney |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>
