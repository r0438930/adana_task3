It's a struggle by an indigenous people against colonial power.\" \n* \"The logic of 'antisemitism' deployed by Zionists, if applied in principle, would make pretty much everybody not a sociopath 'antisemitic'. \n* \"If it's 'antisemitic' to deplore colonisation, land theft, and child murder, then what choice does any person of conscience have?\" \n* \"Zionists: transforming anti-semitism from something horrible into something honorable since 1948.\"\n* \"I repeat: if you're defending Israel right now, then 'hopelessly brainwashed' is your best prognosis.\"\n* \"At this point, if Netanyahu appeared on TV with a necklace made from the teeth of Palestinian children, would anybody be surprised?\"\n* \"#Israel's bombardment of #Gaza provides a necessary impetus to reflect on the genocides that accompanied the formation of the United States.\" \n* \"I refuse to conceptualise Israel / Palestine as Jewish-Arab acrimony.
