After the establishment of the [[American Athletic Conference]] in 2013, the series was renewed from the days of [[Conference USA]]. Most notably, in the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 season]] the two teams would face off twice in consecutive weeks, with both games being hosted by Memphis. The second game would be the [[2019 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game]] in which the Tigers would beat the Bearcats for the second straight week.\n\n===Miami===\n{{Main|Victory Bell (Cincinnati\u2013Miami)}}\n\nThe [[Victory Bell (Miami-Cincinnati)|Victory Bell]] is the trophy awarded to the winner of the American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played by the Cincinnati and [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]]. The Victory Bell is the oldest current non-conference college football rivalry in the United States (though the teams were [[Mid-American Conference|conference rivals]] for a few years in the late 1940s and early 1950s).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/oldest-rivalry-games-college-football/|title=Longest-running rivalries in college football|date=23 March 2016|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312061840/https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/oldest-rivalry-games-college-football/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Bearcats and RedHawks (formerly the Redskins) square off each fall for the famed Victory Bell. The first game in the series, played on December 8, 1888 in [[Oxford, Ohio]], was the first college football game played in the state of Ohio. The original bell hung in Miami's [[Harrison Hall (Miami University)|Harrison Hall]] (Old Main) near the site of the first game and was used to ring in Miami victories.  The traveling trophy tradition began in the 1890s when some Cincinnati fans \"borrowed\" the bell. The bell went to the winner of the annual game for the next forty years until it mysteriously disappeared in the 1930s. The original bell reappeared in 1946 and is on display in the lobby of Miami's Murstein Alumni Center. The current trophy is a replica of the original bell and is kept in the possession of the winning team each year. One side of the bell is painted black with white numbers showing Cincinnati's victories, while the other side is white with red numbers showing Miami's victories.  Ties are indicated on the top of the red yoke in white numbers.\n\nThe Miami\u2013Cincinnati series ranks fifth on the list of most-played rivalries in college football and is the oldest Division I rivalry west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnativseveryone.com/uc-football-victory-bell-rivalry-is-at-its-end/|title=UC Football: Victory Bell Rivalry Is At Its End - Cincinnati vs. Everyone|date=20 September 2016|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060049/http://www.cincinnativseveryone.com/uc-football-victory-bell-rivalry-is-at-its-end/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref> After the [[2010\u201312 NCAA conference realignment]] led to the end of several historic rivalries, it is now the most-played currently active rivalry involving schools from the same state, and also holds the same distinction among inter-conference rivalries. Of the more than thirty college football rivalries that include at least 89 games, none is older than Miami vs. Cincinnati.\n\n===Louisville===\n{{Main|The Keg of Nails}}\nThe [[Keg of Nails]] is the name of the rivalry between Cincinnati and [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]]. The rivalry has stretched over the span of four conferences from the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], to the Metro Conference to [[Conference USA]], and more recently in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]], which in 2013 was renamed to the [[American Athletic Conference]]. It is believed to be the oldest rivalry for the Louisville football team and the second oldest for Cincinnati, only behind [[Victory Bell (Miami\u2013Cincinnati)|the annual game]] with the [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami RedHawks]].\n\nThe trophy is a replica of a keg used to ship nails. The exchange is believed to have been initiated by fraternity chapters on the UC and U of L campuses, signifying that the winning players in the game were \"tough as nails.\"\n\nThe present keg is actually a replacement for the original award, which was misplaced by Louisville, lost during some construction of office facilities. It is adorned with the logos of both schools and the scores of the series games.\n\nThe rivalry went on hiatus following the 2013 season, as Louisville moved to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] on July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|title=ACC votes to add Louisville in 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312052203/http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pittsburgh===\n{{Main|River City Rivalry}}\nThe [[River City Rivalry]] is the name of the rivalry between Cincinnati and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]. The rivalry itself was relatively brief, played annually from 2005, during which season the rivalry trophy was introduced. Before the rivalry was titled, the two teams played each other in 1921, 1922, 1979, and 1981. The rivalry went on hiatus, like many others throughout the country, in the aftermath of the [[2010\u201313 NCAA conference realignment]], which left the programs in separate leagues.  However, the two teams are scheduled to meet in a home-and-home series for the 2023 and 2024 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghsportingnews.com/pitt-schedules-home-and-home-with-cincinnati-other-notes/23498|title=Pitt schedules home and home with Cincinnati; other notes - Pittsburgh Sporting News|date=18 June 2015|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312204203/http://www.pittsburghsportingnews.com/pitt-schedules-home-and-home-with-cincinnati-other-notes/23498/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Paddlewheel Trophy is the rivalry trophy that was created in 2005 when the [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Bearcats]] joined the Big East Conference to which the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]] already belonged. The trophy is designed and named in honor the historic link between the cities from the days in the 19th and early-20th centuries when [[Paddle wheel]]-powered [[Paddle steamer|boats]] traveled between the two cities along the [[Ohio River]]. \n\nThe 2009 match-up between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh was described by one national columnist as the most \"fascinating game I've ever seen.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/12619740/cincy-exits-on-high-pitt-crushed-after-fascinating-game | first=Gregg | last=Doyel | title=Cincy exits on high, Pitt crushed after fascinating game | date=2009-12-05 | publisher=CBSSports.com | accessdate=2009-12-07 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603133151/http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/12619740/cincy-exits-on-high-pitt-crushed-after-fascinating-game | archivedate=2012-06-03 }}</ref> The game functioned as a Big East championship game, with Cincinnati entering first in the conference, and Pittsburgh at second. Additionally, the Bearcats entered the game undefeated and trying to earn a spot in the [[BCS National Championship Game]], while the 9\u20132 Panthers were trying to secure their first [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS bowl]] since the [[2005 Fiesta Bowl|2004]] season. The Panthers had an early 31\u201310 lead, however, the ensuing kickoff was returned for a touchdown by [[Mardy Gilyard]] to make it a 31\u201317 game at halftime. Cincinnati completed the comeback, tying the game at 38 late in the 4th quarter. Pittsburgh running back [[Dion Lewis]] scored a touchdown with 1:36 left in the game, but a mishandled snap by Andrew Janocko prevented the Panthers from converting the extra point. The Bearcats then drove down the field and scored on a 29-yard touchdown pass from [[Tony Pike]] to [[Armon Binns]] with 33 seconds left. Bearcats kicker Jake Rodgers converted the extra point attempt, and Cincinnati held on to win 45\u201344. Following the game, Cincinnati rose to a #3 ranking in the final BCS standing while Pitt dropped to #17. The game has been described as \"one of the most crushing losses in the history of Pitt football.\"<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/college/s_656492.html | title=Pitt's toughest loss in decades | first=Joe | last=Starkey | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2009-12-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209023332/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/college/s_656492.html | archivedate=2009-12-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Xavier===\n{{Main|Cincinnati\u2013Xavier rivalry#Football}}\nCincinnati and [[Xavier Musketeers football|Xavier]] would first play in 1918, but the series would not become an annual event until 1946.

The series, and Xavier's football program, would come to a close after the 1973 series.

After the establishment of the [[American Athletic Conference]] in 2013, the series was renewed from the days of [[Conference USA]]. Most notably, in the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 season]] the two teams would face off twice in consecutive weeks, with both games being hosted by Memphis. The second game would be the [[2019 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game]] in which the Tigers would beat the Bearcats for the second straight week.\n\n===Miami===\n{{Main|Victory Bell (Cincinnati\u2013Miami)}}\n\nThe [[Victory Bell (Miami-Cincinnati)|Victory Bell]] is the trophy awarded to the winner of the American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played by the Cincinnati and [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]]. The Victory Bell is the oldest current non-conference college football rivalry in the United States (though the teams were [[Mid-American Conference|conference rivals]] for a few years in the late 1940s and early 1950s).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/oldest-rivalry-games-college-football/|title=Longest-running rivalries in college football|date=23 March 2016|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312061840/https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/oldest-rivalry-games-college-football/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Bearcats and RedHawks (formerly the Redskins) square off each fall for the famed Victory Bell. The first game in the series, played on December 8, 1888 in [[Oxford, Ohio]], was the first college football game played in the state of Ohio. The original bell hung in Miami's [[Harrison Hall (Miami University)|Harrison Hall]] (Old Main) near the site of the first game and was used to ring in Miami victories.  The traveling trophy tradition began in the 1890s when some Cincinnati fans \"borrowed\" the bell. The bell went to the winner of the annual game for the next forty years until it mysteriously disappeared in the 1930s. The original bell reappeared in 1946 and is on display in the lobby of Miami's Murstein Alumni Center. The current trophy is a replica of the original bell and is kept in the possession of the winning team each year. One side of the bell is painted black with white numbers showing Cincinnati's victories, while the other side is white with red numbers showing Miami's victories.  Ties are indicated on the top of the red yoke in white numbers.\n\nThe Miami\u2013Cincinnati series ranks fifth on the list of most-played rivalries in college football and is the oldest Division I rivalry west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnativseveryone.com/uc-football-victory-bell-rivalry-is-at-its-end/|title=UC Football: Victory Bell Rivalry Is At Its End - Cincinnati vs. Everyone|date=20 September 2016|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060049/http://www.cincinnativseveryone.com/uc-football-victory-bell-rivalry-is-at-its-end/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref> After the [[2010\u201312 NCAA conference realignment]] led to the end of several historic rivalries, it is now the most-played currently active rivalry involving schools from the same state, and also holds the same distinction among inter-conference rivalries.

The rivalry has stretched over the span of four conferences from the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], to the Metro Conference to [[Conference USA]], and more recently in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]], which in 2013 was renamed to the [[American Athletic Conference]]. It is believed to be the oldest rivalry for the Louisville football team and the second oldest for Cincinnati, only behind [[Victory Bell (Miami\u2013Cincinnati)|the annual game]] with the [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami RedHawks]].\n\nThe trophy is a replica of a keg used to ship nails. The exchange is believed to have been initiated by fraternity chapters on the UC and U of L campuses, signifying that the winning players in the game were \"tough as nails.\"\n\nThe present keg is actually a replacement for the original award, which was misplaced by Louisville, lost during some construction of office facilities. It is adorned with the logos of both schools and the scores of the series games.\n\nThe rivalry went on hiatus following the 2013 season, as Louisville moved to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] on July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|title=ACC votes to add Louisville in 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312052203/http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pittsburgh===\n{{Main|River City Rivalry}}\nThe [[River City Rivalry]] is the name of the rivalry between Cincinnati and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]. The rivalry itself was relatively brief, played annually from 2005, during which season the rivalry trophy was introduced. Before the rivalry was titled, the two teams played each other in 1921, 1922, 1979, and 1981. The rivalry went on hiatus, like many others throughout the country, in the aftermath of the [[2010\u201313 NCAA conference realignment]], which left the programs in separate leagues.  However, the two teams are scheduled to meet in a home-and-home series for the 2023 and 2024 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghsportingnews.com/pitt-schedules-home-and-home-with-cincinnati-other-notes/23498|title=Pitt schedules home and home with Cincinnati; other notes - Pittsburgh Sporting News|date=18 June 2015|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312204203/http://www.pittsburghsportingnews.com/pitt-schedules-home-and-home-with-cincinnati-other-notes/23498/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Paddlewheel Trophy is the rivalry trophy that was created in 2005 when the [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Bearcats]] joined the Big East Conference to which the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]] already belonged.

Additionally, the Bearcats entered the game undefeated and trying to earn a spot in the [[BCS National Championship Game]], while the 9\u20132 Panthers were trying to secure their first [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS bowl]] since the [[2005 Fiesta Bowl|2004]] season. The Panthers had an early 31\u201310 lead, however, the ensuing kickoff was returned for a touchdown by [[Mardy Gilyard]] to make it a 31\u201317 game at halftime. Cincinnati completed the comeback, tying the game at 38 late in the 4th quarter. Pittsburgh running back [[Dion Lewis]] scored a touchdown with 1:36 left in the game, but a mishandled snap by Andrew Janocko prevented the Panthers from converting the extra point. The Bearcats then drove down the field and scored on a 29-yard touchdown pass from [[Tony Pike]] to [[Armon Binns]] with 33 seconds left. Bearcats kicker Jake Rodgers converted the extra point attempt, and Cincinnati held on to win 45\u201344. Following the game, Cincinnati rose to a #3 ranking in the final BCS standing while Pitt dropped to #17. The game has been described as \"one of the most crushing losses in the history of Pitt football.\"<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/college/s_656492.html | title=Pitt's toughest loss in decades | first=Joe | last=Starkey | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2009-12-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209023332/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/college/s_656492.html | archivedate=2009-12-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Xavier===\n{{Main|Cincinnati\u2013Xavier rivalry#Football}}\nCincinnati and [[Xavier Musketeers football|Xavier]] would first play in 1918, but the series would not become an annual event until 1946.
