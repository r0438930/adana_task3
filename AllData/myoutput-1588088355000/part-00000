[[Filipino people|Filipinos]] most commonly blend the older Spanish system and Anglo-American conventions, where there is a distinction between the \"Christian name\" and the \"surname\". The construct of having several middle names is common to all systems, but to have multiple \"first\" names and only one middle and last name is a result of the blending of American and Spanish naming customs. The [[Tagalog language]] is one of the few national languages in Asia to practically use the Western name order while formally using the eastern name order. Thus, the Philippine naming custom is coincidentally identical to the [[Spanish name|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese name]] customs and, to an extent, [[Chinese name|Chinese]] naming customs.\n\nFor the most part today, Filipinos abide by the Spanish system of using both paternal and maternal surnames, the latter constituting the \"middle name\". An example would be ''Jose Cuyegkeng y Mangahas'' becoming ''Jose Mangahas Cuyegkeng'', where the [[Spanish naming customs#The particle \"y\" (and)|particle ''y'']] is used only for legal purposes and is otherwise dropped. The middle name in its natural sense would have been the second name if the person had one, but is never counted as an individual's given name.\n\n==Historical Context and Examples==\nIn ancient times, the Tagalogs had a naming system that changed via family dynamics. A Tagalog man (esp. a chief) would lose his name and take his firstborn's name. He became known as \"son's/daughter's father\", rather than the opposite ie give his offspring his surname, as the modern naming convention is today. If he was baptized into Christianity, he would take a Spanish \"Christian name\" but retained his native name as surname. Eg Calao's (trans. \"hornbill\") father, became Don Luis Amanicalao (Lord Luis, a chief of Tondo, Calao's Father). This was also applied to mothers (eg Inanicalao) etc. One also gained numerous 'poetic' titles (ie \"pamagat\" lit. 'to have something to go before', today literally translatde as \"title\", from where the prenom \"Gat\" is derived) from his renown/actions (eg valiance in battle) or other naming means (like a naming feast for those without offspring).<ref name=\"Blair and Robertson Vol 40\" /> \n\nHistorical examples: Manila/Tagalog chiefs listed in the Tondo Conspiracy (1587-88) ''Phelipe Amarlangagui/Amarlangagui'' ('Felipe, Ama ni Langawi'), ''Luis Amanicalao'' (Luis, Ama ni Calao) (note: his son ''Calao'' was also a named conspirator), and ''Omaghicon/Amaghikon'' (Ama ni Hikon).<ref name=\"Blair and Robertson Vol 7\">{{cite book |title= The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 Vol. 7|last=Blair|first=Emma |year=1906 |publisher=Arthur H.

Tomas Land Titles (1613-1625). In Document B (1625) (copy originally trans. by Villamor, 1922), Line 12, a certain ''Amadaga'' was named. The contract said that the owner of the land adjacent to the one sold in the contract was ''Maria Gada'' who had acquired it from ''Amadaga''. Although no other context was given in the document, it is quiet possible that ''Maria Gada'' is the daughter of (misspelled) \"Ama ni Gada\" and inherited the land from him as legacy.<ref name=\"Morrow\">{{cite web |url= http://www.paulmorrow.ca/doc_b2.pdf |title= Document B |last=Morrow |first=Paul |date=4 March 2018 |website=Sari-sari Etc |access-date=27 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Historical Accounts==\n\"Ch XIII. 97. The method of giving names was the following. As soon as a child was born, it was the mother\u2019s business to name it. Generally the occasion or motive of the name was taken from some one of the circumstances which occurred at the time. For example, Maliuag, which means \u201cdifficult,\u201d because of the difficulty of the birth; Malacas, which signifies \u201cstrong,\u201d for it is thought that the infant will be strong. This is like the custom of the Hebrews, as appears from Holy Writ. At other times the name was given without any hidden meaning, from the first thing that struck the fancy, as Daan, which signifies \u201croad,\u201d and Damo, signifying \u201cgrass.\u201d They were called by those names, without the use of any surname, until they were married. Then the first son or daughter gave the surname to the parents, as Amani Maliuag, Ynani Malacas, \u201cthe father of Maliuag,\u201d \u201cthe mother of Malacas.\u201d The names of women are differentiated from those of men by adding the syllable \u201cin,\u201d as Ilog, \u201criver;\u201d Si Ilog, the name of a male; Si Iloguin, the name of a female. They used very tender diminutives for the children, in our manner. Among themselves they had certain domestic and delicate appellations of various sorts for the different degrees of relationship\u2014as that of a child for his father and mother, and vice versa. In the same way [they have appellations] for their ancestors, descendants, and collaterals. This shows the abundance, elegance, and courtesy of this language. It is a general thing in all these nations not to have special family names which are perpetuated to their successors, but each individual has the simple name that is given him at birth. At present this name serves as surname, and the peculiar name is the Christian name of Juan or Pedro which is imposed at baptism. However, there are now mothers so Christian and civilized that they will not assign any secular name to their children until the Christian name has been given in baptism, and then the surname is added, although it has already been chosen after consultation with the parents and relatives. In place of our \u201cDon\u201d (which indeed has been assigned to them with as much abuse as among ourselves), in some districts they formerly placed before their names, Lacan or Gat: as the Moluccans use Cachil, the Africans Muley, the Turks Sultan, etc. The \u201cDon\u201d of the women is not Lacan or Gat, but Dayang, Dayang Mati, Dayang Sanguy, i.e., \u201cDo\u00f1a Mati,\u201d \u201cDo\u00f1a Sanguy.\u201d\n\n\"There is general distaste among our Tag\u00e1logs to mention one another among themselves by their own names alone, without adding something which smells of courtesy. When they are asked by the Spaniards \u201cWho is So-and-so?\u201d and they cannot avoid naming him by his own name, they do it with a certain shamefacedness and embarrassment. Inasmuch as the method of naming one is \u201cthe father of So-and-so,\u201d as soon as he has children, for him who had no children (among persons of influence) his relatives and acquaintances assembled at a banquet, and gave him a new name there, which they designated as Pamagat. That was usually a name of excellence by some circumlocution or metaphor, based on their own old name. Thus if one was called by his own name, Bacal, which signifies \u201ciron,\u201d the new name given him would be Dimatanassan, signifying \u201cnot to spoil with time.\u201d If it were Bayani, which signifies \u201cvaliant\u201d and \u201cspirited,\u201d he was called Dimalapitan \u201che to whom no one is bold.\u201d It is also the custom among these nations to call one another among themselves, by way of friendship, by certain correlative names based on some special circumstance. Thus if one had given a branch of sweet basil to another, the two among themselves called each other Casolasi, the name of the thing given; or Caytlog, he who ate of an egg with another. This is in the manner of the names of fellow-students or chums as used by us. These are all arguments in favor of the civilization of these Indians.\" \n\n'''Fr. Francisco Colin, Labor Evangelica, (1663)'''<ref name=\"Blair and Robertson Vol 40\">{{cite book |title= The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 Vol. 40|last=Blair|first=Emma |year=1906 |publisher=Arthur H.

The natives of these islands employ innumerable other elegancies and courtesies, now in actions, now in words, now in names and titles, which they apply to themselves; these are various according to the difference of the provinces, and are too numerous to mention, for they are ceremonial, and they value their ceremonies highly. No one will pass in front of another, without asking permission, and in order to pass, he doubles the whole body with the most profound bow, at the same time lifting one foot in the air, and doubling the knee and lifting both hands to the face. If one has to talk to any person of higher rank, he shows all reverence and squats down [pone en cuclillas], with raised face, and waits thus, until he is asked his reason for coming; for to speak without being questioned would be a point of bad breeding. They employ many courteous acts and expressions in saluting one another when they meet; but these do not seem to me to be so many as in Nueva Espa\u00f1a, where people do not cease to use them until they lose sight of one another in the street. The Filipinos do this here with greater dignity and respect. When they write, they heighten their style with so many rhetorical phrases, metaphors, and pictures, that many who think themselves poets would be glad to do as much; and yet this is only in prose. For, when it comes to poesy, he who would understand it must be very learned in their language, even among his own compatriots.\"\n\n423. \"The names which they impose now are usually high-sounding. I know a Pius V, and a Philipe V; and, following this custom, they take as surnames the most honorable names of Espa\u00f1a. This is since they have known Castilians. But, even before, they could rival in this the kings of Espa\u00f1a; for just as the latter have been called \u201cthe Wise,\u201d \u201cthe Prudent,\u201d \u201cthe Chaste,\u201d etc., for the special virtues which have made them worthy of this glory, so here in the Philipinas, they called one \u201cthe Strong,\u201d another \u201cthe Splendid,\u201d and another \u201cthe Terrible,\u201d according to his deeds, or to those of his ancestors, or in accordance with various incidents that happened at birth. Now they are introducing the custom of taking the paternal name added to the baptismal name. However, when the first-born child comes to any one, the latter\u2019s Christian name is forgotten; for that instant they call the father by the name of his first-born for the rest of his life. If the name of the first-born is Rosa, the father is called Ama ni Rosa, or Pan-Rosa, which means \u201cthe father of Rosa.\u201d One must not then ask for such a man in any village by his Christian name (which is the one entered on the parish register), for there are many so named, so that he would not be known by that name. An author is not wanting to call this an instance of courtesy; but many times it serves as a dishonor, if they know him and call him, for example, \u201cfather of Judas.\u201d They employ many other names and endearing expressions in naming their children, relatives, and families, although I believe that the affection that they feel for one another has very little reality.\"\n\n424. \"The \u201cDon\u201d of the Castilians is being rapidly introduced among the Indian chiefs, both men and women, of these islands. In olden times they did not lack a term proper to their own language by which they expressed it, as Lacan or Gat for the men, and Dayang for the women.\" \n\n'''Fr. Francisco de San Antonio, Cronicas, (1738-44)'''<ref name=\"Blair and Robertson Vol 40b\">{{cite book |title= The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 Vol. 40|last=Blair|first=Emma |year=1906 |publisher=Arthur H. Clark Company|isbn= |page=161-162|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30253/30253-h/30253-h.htm|accessdate=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Given names==\nFilipinos may have one or more official given names (as registered in their birth certificates and baptismal certificates) and various types of temporary or permanent nicknames. Filipinos have a penchant for giving themselves or each other various sorts of nicknames and monikers. Some nicknames are carried for life while others are used only with certain groups so a person can have multiple nicknames at different ages or among different groups of people.\n\n===Abbreviations, combinations, and elisions===\nLong given names can be shortened in various ways. ''Emmanuel'' can become ''Eman'', ''Manuel'', ''Manolo'', ''Manny'', or ''Manoy''. ''Consolaci\u00f3n'' has been converted to ''Connie'', ''Cons'', ''Sol'', or ''Chona''.\n\nFilipino women with two given names such as ''Mar\u00eda Cristina'' or ''Mar\u00eda Victoria'' may choose to abbreviate the very common ''Mar\u00eda'' (in honour of the [[Virgin Mary]]) as ''Ma''. (with a [[full stop]]), thus rendering these given names as ''Ma. Cristina'' or ''Ma. Victoria''. Filipino males with two given names such as ''Jos\u00e9 Mariano'' or ''Jos\u00e9 Gerardo'' could follow the same practice of abbreviating ''Jos\u00e9'' as ''Jo.'', though this is not as consistent. Some Muslims would follow conventions found in neighbouring [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], and [[Indonesia]], abbreviating \"''Muhammad''\" (and its variants, ''[[viz.]]'' \"''Mohammed''\", etc.) as \"''Muhd.''\" or \"''Mohd.''\", or the title of \"''[[Hajji]]''\" (male) or \"''Hajjah''\" (female), meaning someone who has been on the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], to \"''Hj.''\" or \"''Hjh.''\"\n\nAnother common practice rarely seen in other cultures (but common with [[Spanish name#Mar\u00eda and Jos\u00e9|Spanish conventions]]) is to [[elision|elide]] or combine multiple given names into one nickname. The aforementioned ''Mar\u00eda Cristina'' and ''Mar\u00eda Victoria'' may thus acquire the nicknames ''Maricris'' and ''Marivic''. Thus the Filipino names ''Maricel'', ''Maritoni'', ''Marijo'', ''Maritess'', and ''Maricon'' come from  ''Maria Celia (or Celeste)'', ''Marie Antoinette'', ''Mar\u00eda Josefa'' (or ''Josefina)'', ''Mar\u00eda Teresa'', and ''Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n'' (or ''Consolaci\u00f3n)''. The popular male nicknames ''Joma'', ''Jomar'', and ''Jomari'' are derived from [[concatenation|concatenating]] ''Jos\u00e9 Mariano''. ''Jestoni'' was derived from ''Jes\u00fas Antonio''. These types of nicknames have become so common that they have also been registered as a child's official given name by the parents (e.g., ''Maricris Llamador Gunigundo'' or ''Maricris Ll. Gunigundo''). The child ''Sidperl'' got his name when his parents combined their given names ''Isidro'' and ''Perlita''.\n\nSometimes, this practice results in a completely new, unprecedented given name. Former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] [[Jejomar Binay]]'s given name is a combination of ''[[Holy Family|Jesus-Joseph-Mary]]''. Former Senator [[Heherson Alvarez]]'s name is derived from ''He-Her-Son'' (from \"He, Her [Virgin Mary]'s Son\", referring to [[Jesus Christ]]). The unique, patriotic female names ''[[Luzviminda]]'' and its variants ''Minvilu'' and ''Vizminda'' come from concatenating the names of the country's three main island groups: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]].\n\nA related custom is that parents combine their given names to create a name for their child. For example:\n*Maria + Carlos = Malolos\n*Elvin + Liza = Elliza\n*Marino + Erlinda = Marinerl \n\nSome first names like ''Lodegrano'' or ''Lorimer'' may have been invented on the spot by the parents or derived from some partially remembered foreign term. Other coined first names have unusual spellings or [[spelling pronunciation|spellings which are pronounced differently]].\n\n===Honorifics and titles===\nHonorifics and titles are sometimes used in place of a person's actual name. Thus, titles for family elders are often used by the younger persons and then adopted by the wider community: ''Apo'' (grandson/granddaughter). ''Lolo'' (grandfather) and ''Lola'' (grandmother) are used for senior elders; ''Tatay/Itay/Ama'' (father) or ''Tito/Tiyo/Tsong'' (uncle) and ''Nanay/Inay/Ina'' (mother) or ''Tita/Tiya/Tsang'' (aunt) for middle-aged elders; ''Manong'' or ''Kuya'' (elder brother) and ''Manang'' or ''Ate'' (elder sister) for anyone slightly older than the person speaking.\n\nPeople in the community are often addressed by their military or police rank, professional titles or job descriptions, either with or without their names. ''Architect'', ''Attorney'', ''Engineer'', ''Teacher'', ''Dok/Doctor'', ''Direk/Director'', ''Manager'', ''Bisor'' (supervisor), ''Boss'', ''Tsip/Chief'', are used in the same way as ''Mister'', ''Miss'', ''Ms''., or ''Mrs''. especially when the addressee's name is not yet known by the speaker. This is often done as a sign of respect and to avoid giving offence. Even foreigners who work in the Philippines or are naturalized Filipino citizens, including foreign spouses of Filipinos, who hold some of these titles and descriptions are addressed in the same way as their Filipino counterparts, although it may sound awkward or unnatural to some of them or language purists who argue that the basic titles that precede surnames and either ''Sir'' or ''Ma'am/Madam'' are to be employed for simplicity. Also, ''Sir'' and ''Madam/Ma'am'' are not to be used preceding a nickname.\n\n===Numerals and birth order patterns===\nPeople with the same name as their father are registered as ''Junior'' (abbreviated to ''Jr''.) or numbered with Roman numerals (III, IV, V, etc.); their father adds ''Senior'' (''Sr''.) after his surname or suffix. Inevitably, the younger person tends to be nicknamed ''Junior'' or ''Jun'' permanently. This can also be applied to numerals, i.e. the nickname being ''Third'' or ''Fourth''. Because of this, a family will necessarily bestow a variety of unofficial nicknames to distinguish the various people with nearly identical official given names.\n\nMany nicknames are bestowed by parents or other elders on children while they are still toddlers. Examples are the numerous ''Boy'', ''Toto/Totoy'' (young boy), ''Girlie'', ''Nene'' (young girl), ''Baby'' and similar types of pet names given to people who received them as kids and carried them into adult life and seniority. They've carried the nickname all their lives and see no incongruity in being called ''Boy'' or ''Baby'' even when in their sixth decade. Some are diminutives of the actual name, such as ''Pepito'' for ''Pepe'', ''Juanito'' for ''Juan'' (or the English form ''Johnny'' for ''John''), and ''Nenita'' for ''Nena''. Thus, a person used to being called ''Joselito'' (''Little Joseph'') as a child may retain the nickname as an adult even if he could already be called ''Jos\u00e9'' or ''Joseph''.\n\nThe names of children in some families may follow a certain pattern, such as beginning with a certain letter of the alphabet, e.g. ''Diego Arnel'', ''Diamond Amelia'', ''Danford Arman'', ''Dolores Allison'', such that all their initials will be the same, i.e., ''DAZL'' if the middle name is ''Zulueta'' and the surname is ''Lim''. An example of this is that former Senator [[Joker Arroyo]] (legal name) has a brother named Jack.<ref name=McGeown/> Siblings can also be named after certain themes, such as countries, car trademarks, and popular brand names - for instance, World Champion boxer and incumbent Senator [[Manny Pacquiao]] named his two daughters ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Princess''<ref name=McGeown/>.\n\n===Reversals, indigenised names and Anglicisation===\nThe Filipino given name ''Dranreb'' was invented by reversing the spelling of the English name ''Bernard'', while someone calling himself ''Nosrac'' bears the legal name ''Carson''. [[Joseph Estrada|Joseph Ej\u00e9rcito Estrada]], [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|Thirteenth]] [[President of the Philippines]], began as a movie actor and received his nickname ''Erap'' as an adult; it comes from ''Pare'' spelled backwards (from Spanish ''compadre'', ''fellow godparent'') but now means ''mate'' or ''buddy'' in Filipino.<ref name=McGeown/>\n\nAn old custom is to replace or insert Filipino phonemes into a Spanish or English name: ''Mariano'' becomes ''Nano'', ''Edwin'' becomes ''Aweng'', ''Eduardo'' becomes ''Dwarding'', ''Roberto'' becomes ''Berting'', ''Ponciano'' becomes either ''Popoy'', ''Onse'', or ''Syano''. Sometimes there is a tendency to convert a grand-sounding given name into something very ordinary, such as when ''John Paul'' becomes ''JayPee'', ''Peter John'' becomes ''Peejong'', ''Anthony'' becomes ''Tonyo'', ''Ronald'' becomes ''Onad'', ''Mar\u00eda Elena'' becomes ''Ineng'' or ''Inyang'', or ''Ambrosia'' becomes ''Brosya''.\n\nComplementary to this is the practise of Anglicising (with the implication of \"modernising\") a Spanish given name. Thus ''Jos\u00e9 Roberto'' becomes ''Joseph Robert'' (further shortened to ''Joebert''). ''Eduardo'' becomes ''Edward'' and then ''Eddie'' or ''Eddieboy'' (sometimes further shortened to ''Daboy''). ''Consolaci\u00f3n'' becomes ''Connie''; ''Coraz\u00f3n'' becomes ''Cora'' or ''Cory''; ''Juan'' becomes ''John'' or ''Johnny''; ''Teresita'' or ''Teresa'' becomes ''Ter\u00ea'', ''Tessa'', or ''Tessie''; and ''Gracia'' becomes ''Grace''.\n\n===Monikers and progressional names===\nThe variety of Filipino names, some of them with negative connotations in Anglicised form, often take foreigners by surprise.<ref name=McGeown>{{cite web |author=Kate McGeown |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9435751.stm |title=Playful Filipino Names Hard to Get Used To |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=27 March 2011 |access-date=1 January 2014}}</ref>  Most Filipinos don't notice any negative English connotations, however, unless somebody points it out.<ref name=McGeown/>\n\nMany Filipino celebrities and high-status personalities, such as actors and politicians, don't mind having such types of nicknames;<ref name=McGeown/> in fact, their nicknames are often more well-known than their actual given names. Film and television celebrity [[German Moreno]] didn't mind using the nickname ''Kuya Germs'' (''kuya'' = elder brother). National Artist of the Philippines for Fashion Design, Jos\u00e9 ''Pitoy'' Moreno, would never be recognized anywhere under his official given name, but so far, he is the only prominent ''Pitoy'' in the world.\n\n== Middle names ==\n{{Main|Filipino middle names}}\n\n==Surnames==\n===Indigenous languages===\nThough most Filipinos adopted Malaysian/Indonesian, Chinese and European (especially Spanish and English) surnames, some chose surnames that derive from words in autochthonous languages, like Tagalog, Visayan (Cebuano and Hiligaynon), Ilocano, Kapampangan and Pangasinan. Many indigenous surnames derive from words displaying qualities of people, especially those related to strength (e.g. Tagalog ''Macaraeg'' and ''Panganiban''), defiance (e.g. Tagalog ''Dimayuga'') or settlement (e.g. Cebuano/Hiligaynon ''Magbanua'').\n\nMost indigenous surnames are spelled closely following the [[Spanish orthography|Spanish-derived]] orthographic conventions of the time. Many of these words are spelled differently today in the various Philippine languages (following spelling reforms since the late 19th century).<ref name=PilipinoExpress />\n\n\n\n===Cordilleran===\nUnlike their lowlander counterparts, [[Igorot people|Igorots]] living in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] in northern [[Luzon]] were not conquered by the Spaniards, thereby preserving their naming customs from foreign influence. Each group had their own naming customs, but generally, like [[Indonesian names]], there is only one given name and no surname to speak of. The given name's meaning is usually connected to natural phenomena or objects, such as ''danum'' for water. It was only the Igorots who have had interacted with Spaniards and lowlanders for trade who were given a name that follows the binomial \"first name\"-\"surname\" system, such as Mateo Cari\u00f1o and Mateo Carantes.\n\nIt was only at the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American occupation of the Philippines]] that the naming customs of the Igorots slowly conformed with the national legal naming system used to today, aided by the evangelization efforts of American Protestant missionaries. Most older people, however, still keep the singular given name given to them by their parents while also using the so-called \"Christian names\" to conform to Philippine law. The singular given names of some individuals living in the early 20th century have since been adopted as a surname by their descendants.\n\n===Spanish===\n{{see also|Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos}}\nAlmost all Filipinos had [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish]] or Spanish-sounding surnames imposed on them for taxation purposes, but a number of them have indigenous Filipino surnames. On 21 November 1849, Governor General Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa issued a decree stating that Filipinos should adopt Spanish surnames to make census counting easier. Some Filipinos retained their native pre-colonial names, especially those who were exempted from the Claver\u00eda decree such as the descendants of rulers of the ''Maharlika'' or noble class. These surnames of the native nobility include Lacandola, [[Macapagal]], Macabulos, and Tupas whom each descended from different [[Datu]]s. They were allowed to keep the name to claim tax exemptions.\n\nThe Spanish surname category provides the [[List of common Filipino surnames|most common surnames]] in the Philippines.<ref name=\"geocities.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/heartland/ranch/9121/surnames.html|title=List of some surnames in the Philippines|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/heartland/ranch/9121/surnames.html&date=2009-10-25+02:24:29|archivedate=2009-10-25}}</ref> At the course of time, some Spanish surnames were altered (with some eventually diverged/displaced their original spelling), as resulted from illiteracy among the poor and farming class bearing such surnames, creating confusion in the civil registry and a sense of detachment from their better-off relatives. Except for the \"\u00f1\", Filipino surnames from Spanish are written without accents owing from the use of typewriters in civil registry imported from US that lacks special characters.\n\n===Chinese===\n{{See also|List of common Chinese surnames}}\nMany modern-day [[Chinese Filipino]]s, may have common Chinese surnames. Early Chinese Filipino families took on the complete name of their [[patriarch]], and sometimes added \"-co\" at the end from \u54e5(\"ko\"), which means brother, such as Cojuangco, Gotamco, Yuchengco, etc. Some Chinese names were hispanicized then appended -son or -zon from \u5b6b (\"sun\"), which means grandchild, as in Quezon, Singson, Japson, etc. There are also those that used this style but instead of a family name, they used Hokkien transcriptions of birth order numbers{{claridy|date=April 2020}} appended with -son or -zon or even -co, like Tuazon, Tiongson, Sioson, etc.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Antonio S.|year=1986|title=The Chinese Mestizos and the Formation of the Filipino Nationality|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/arch_0044-8613_1986_num_32_1_2316|journal=Archipel|volume=32|pages=145|doi=10.3406/arch.1986.2316|via=}}</ref> These became unique [[Surnames by country#The Philippines|Filipino surnames]].

Some names, including F\u00e1tima, Omar, and Soraya, bear direct influence from Arab sources and Spanish ones, given the latter's period [[Al-Andalus|under Moorish rule]]. Filipino Muslims also bear and maintain a unique blend of indigenous Moro and Arabic surnames, some are registered with Spanish renderings. Among Maranao families, some Maranao surnames are often used as a given name to their children. Others may or might have borne surnames from their mothers, manifesting scant matrilineal practice.\n\n===Other surnames of foreign origins===\nFilipinos who hold middle or family names from other non-English-speaking nations also follow the conventions mentioned in this article, despite the proper naming customs that are followed in those nations.

[[Filipino people|Filipinos]] most commonly blend the older Spanish system and Anglo-American conventions, where there is a distinction between the \"Christian name\" and the \"surname\". The construct of having several middle names is common to all systems, but to have multiple \"first\" names and only one middle and last name is a result of the blending of American and Spanish naming customs. The [[Tagalog language]] is one of the few national languages in Asia to practically use the Western name order while formally using the eastern name order. Thus, the Philippine naming custom is coincidentally identical to the [[Spanish name|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese name]] customs and, to an extent, [[Chinese name|Chinese]] naming customs.\n\nFor the most part today, Filipinos abide by the Spanish system of using both paternal and maternal surnames, the latter constituting the \"middle name\". An example would be ''Jose Cuyegkeng y Mangahas'' becoming ''Jose Mangahas Cuyegkeng'', where the [[Spanish naming customs#The particle \"y\" (and)|particle ''y'']] is used only for legal purposes and is otherwise dropped. The middle name in its natural sense would have been the second name if the person had one, but is never counted as an individual's given name.\n\n==Historical Context and Examples==\nIn ancient times, the Tagalogs had a naming system that changed via family dynamics. A Tagalog man (esp. a chief) would lose his name and take his firstborn's name. He became known as \"son's/daughter's father\", rather than the opposite ie give his offspring his surname, as the modern naming convention is today. If he was baptized into Christianity, he would take a Spanish \"Christian name\" but retained his native name as surname. Eg Calao's (trans. \"hornbill\") father, became Don Luis Amanicalao (Lord Luis, a chief of Tondo, Calao's Father). This was also applied to mothers (eg Inanicalao) etc. One also gained numerous 'poetic' titles (ie \"pamagat\" lit. 'to have something to go before', today literally translatde as \"title\", from where the prenom \"Gat\" is derived) from his renown/actions (eg valiance in battle) or other naming means (like a naming feast for those without offspring).<ref name=\"Blair and Robertson Vol 40\" /> \n\nHistorical examples: Manila/Tagalog chiefs listed in the Tondo Conspiracy (1587-88) ''Phelipe Amarlangagui/Amarlangagui'' ('Felipe, Ama ni Langawi'), ''Luis Amanicalao'' (Luis, Ama ni Calao) (note: his son ''Calao'' was also a named conspirator), and ''Omaghicon/Amaghikon'' (Ama ni Hikon).<ref name=\"Blair and Robertson Vol 7\">{{cite book |title= The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 Vol. 7|last=Blair|first=Emma |year=1906 |publisher=Arthur H.

Tomas Land Titles (1613-1625). In Document B (1625) (copy originally trans. by Villamor, 1922), Line 12, a certain ''Amadaga'' was named. The contract said that the owner of the land adjacent to the one sold in the contract was ''Maria Gada'' who had acquired it from ''Amadaga''. Although no other context was given in the document, it is quiet possible that ''Maria Gada'' is the daughter of (misspelled) \"Ama ni Gada\" and inherited the land from him as legacy.<ref name=\"Morrow\">{{cite web |url= http://www.paulmorrow.ca/doc_b2.pdf |title= Document B |last=Morrow |first=Paul |date=4 March 2018 |website=Sari-sari Etc |access-date=27 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Historical Accounts==\n\"Ch XIII. 97. The method of giving names was the following. As soon as a child was born, it was the mother\u2019s business to name it. Generally the occasion or motive of the name was taken from some one of the circumstances which occurred at the time. For example, Maliuag, which means \u201cdifficult,\u201d because of the difficulty of the birth; Malacas, which signifies \u201cstrong,\u201d for it is thought that the infant will be strong. This is like the custom of the Hebrews, as appears from Holy Writ. At other times the name was given without any hidden meaning, from the first thing that struck the fancy, as Daan, which signifies \u201croad,\u201d and Damo, signifying \u201cgrass.\u201d They were called by those names, without the use of any surname, until they were married. Then the first son or daughter gave the surname to the parents, as Amani Maliuag, Ynani Malacas, \u201cthe father of Maliuag,\u201d \u201cthe mother of Malacas.\u201d The names of women are differentiated from those of men by adding the syllable \u201cin,\u201d as Ilog, \u201criver;\u201d Si Ilog, the name of a male; Si Iloguin, the name of a female. They used very tender diminutives for the children, in our manner. Among themselves they had certain domestic and delicate appellations of various sorts for the different degrees of relationship\u2014as that of a child for his father and mother, and vice versa. In the same way [they have appellations] for their ancestors, descendants, and collaterals. This shows the abundance, elegance, and courtesy of this language. It is a general thing in all these nations not to have special family names which are perpetuated to their successors, but each individual has the simple name that is given him at birth. At present this name serves as surname, and the peculiar name is the Christian name of Juan or Pedro which is imposed at baptism. However, there are now mothers so Christian and civilized that they will not assign any secular name to their children until the Christian name has been given in baptism, and then the surname is added, although it has already been chosen after consultation with the parents and relatives. In place of our \u201cDon\u201d (which indeed has been assigned to them with as much abuse as among ourselves), in some districts they formerly placed before their names, Lacan or Gat: as the Moluccans use Cachil, the Africans Muley, the Turks Sultan, etc. The \u201cDon\u201d of the women is not Lacan or Gat, but Dayang, Dayang Mati, Dayang Sanguy, i.e., \u201cDo\u00f1a Mati,\u201d \u201cDo\u00f1a Sanguy.\u201d\n\n\"There is general distaste among our Tag\u00e1logs to mention one another among themselves by their own names alone, without adding something which smells of courtesy. When they are asked by the Spaniards \u201cWho is So-and-so?\u201d and they cannot avoid naming him by his own name, they do it with a certain shamefacedness and embarrassment. Inasmuch as the method of naming one is \u201cthe father of So-and-so,\u201d as soon as he has children, for him who had no children (among persons of influence) his relatives and acquaintances assembled at a banquet, and gave him a new name there, which they designated as Pamagat. That was usually a name of excellence by some circumlocution or metaphor, based on their own old name. Thus if one was called by his own name, Bacal, which signifies \u201ciron,\u201d the new name given him would be Dimatanassan, signifying \u201cnot to spoil with time.\u201d If it were Bayani, which signifies \u201cvaliant\u201d and \u201cspirited,\u201d he was called Dimalapitan \u201che to whom no one is bold.\u201d It is also the custom among these nations to call one another among themselves, by way of friendship, by certain correlative names based on some special circumstance. Thus if one had given a branch of sweet basil to another, the two among themselves called each other Casolasi, the name of the thing given; or Caytlog, he who ate of an egg with another. This is in the manner of the names of fellow-students or chums as used by us. These are all arguments in favor of the civilization of these Indians.\" \n\n'''Fr. Francisco Colin, Labor Evangelica, (1663)'''<ref name=\"Blair and Robertson Vol 40\">{{cite book |title= The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 Vol. 40|last=Blair|first=Emma |year=1906 |publisher=Arthur H.

The natives of these islands employ innumerable other elegancies and courtesies, now in actions, now in words, now in names and titles, which they apply to themselves; these are various according to the difference of the provinces, and are too numerous to mention, for they are ceremonial, and they value their ceremonies highly. No one will pass in front of another, without asking permission, and in order to pass, he doubles the whole body with the most profound bow, at the same time lifting one foot in the air, and doubling the knee and lifting both hands to the face. If one has to talk to any person of higher rank, he shows all reverence and squats down [pone en cuclillas], with raised face, and waits thus, until he is asked his reason for coming; for to speak without being questioned would be a point of bad breeding. They employ many courteous acts and expressions in saluting one another when they meet; but these do not seem to me to be so many as in Nueva Espa\u00f1a, where people do not cease to use them until they lose sight of one another in the street. The Filipinos do this here with greater dignity and respect. When they write, they heighten their style with so many rhetorical phrases, metaphors, and pictures, that many who think themselves poets would be glad to do as much; and yet this is only in prose. For, when it comes to poesy, he who would understand it must be very learned in their language, even among his own compatriots.\"\n\n423. \"The names which they impose now are usually high-sounding. I know a Pius V, and a Philipe V; and, following this custom, they take as surnames the most honorable names of Espa\u00f1a. This is since they have known Castilians. But, even before, they could rival in this the kings of Espa\u00f1a; for just as the latter have been called \u201cthe Wise,\u201d \u201cthe Prudent,\u201d \u201cthe Chaste,\u201d etc., for the special virtues which have made them worthy of this glory, so here in the Philipinas, they called one \u201cthe Strong,\u201d another \u201cthe Splendid,\u201d and another \u201cthe Terrible,\u201d according to his deeds, or to those of his ancestors, or in accordance with various incidents that happened at birth. Now they are introducing the custom of taking the paternal name added to the baptismal name. However, when the first-born child comes to any one, the latter\u2019s Christian name is forgotten; for that instant they call the father by the name of his first-born for the rest of his life. If the name of the first-born is Rosa, the father is called Ama ni Rosa, or Pan-Rosa, which means \u201cthe father of Rosa.\u201d One must not then ask for such a man in any village by his Christian name (which is the one entered on the parish register), for there are many so named, so that he would not be known by that name. An author is not wanting to call this an instance of courtesy; but many times it serves as a dishonor, if they know him and call him, for example, \u201cfather of Judas.\u201d They employ many other names and endearing expressions in naming their children, relatives, and families, although I believe that the affection that they feel for one another has very little reality.\"\n\n424. \"The \u201cDon\u201d of the Castilians is being rapidly introduced among the Indian chiefs, both men and women, of these islands. In olden times they did not lack a term proper to their own language by which they expressed it, as Lacan or Gat for the men, and Dayang for the women.\" \n\n'''Fr. Francisco de San Antonio, Cronicas, (1738-44)'''<ref name=\"Blair and Robertson Vol 40b\">{{cite book |title= The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 Vol. 40|last=Blair|first=Emma |year=1906 |publisher=Arthur H. Clark Company|isbn= |page=161-162|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30253/30253-h/30253-h.htm|accessdate=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Given names==\nFilipinos may have one or more official given names (as registered in their birth certificates and baptismal certificates) and various types of temporary or permanent nicknames. Filipinos have a penchant for giving themselves or each other various sorts of nicknames and monikers. Some nicknames are carried for life while others are used only with certain groups so a person can have multiple nicknames at different ages or among different groups of people.\n\n===Abbreviations, combinations, and elisions===\nLong given names can be shortened in various ways. ''Emmanuel'' can become ''Eman'', ''Manuel'', ''Manolo'', ''Manny'', or ''Manoy''. ''Consolaci\u00f3n'' has been converted to ''Connie'', ''Cons'', ''Sol'', or ''Chona''.\n\nFilipino women with two given names such as ''Mar\u00eda Cristina'' or ''Mar\u00eda Victoria'' may choose to abbreviate the very common ''Mar\u00eda'' (in honour of the [[Virgin Mary]]) as ''Ma''. (with a [[full stop]]), thus rendering these given names as ''Ma. Cristina'' or ''Ma. Victoria''. Filipino males with two given names such as ''Jos\u00e9 Mariano'' or ''Jos\u00e9 Gerardo'' could follow the same practice of abbreviating ''Jos\u00e9'' as ''Jo.'', though this is not as consistent. Some Muslims would follow conventions found in neighbouring [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], and [[Indonesia]], abbreviating \"''Muhammad''\" (and its variants, ''[[viz.]]'' \"''Mohammed''\", etc.) as \"''Muhd.''\" or \"''Mohd.''\", or the title of \"''[[Hajji]]''\" (male) or \"''Hajjah''\" (female), meaning someone who has been on the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], to \"''Hj.''\" or \"''Hjh.''\"\n\nAnother common practice rarely seen in other cultures (but common with [[Spanish name#Mar\u00eda and Jos\u00e9|Spanish conventions]]) is to [[elision|elide]] or combine multiple given names into one nickname. The aforementioned ''Mar\u00eda Cristina'' and ''Mar\u00eda Victoria'' may thus acquire the nicknames ''Maricris'' and ''Marivic''. Thus the Filipino names ''Maricel'', ''Maritoni'', ''Marijo'', ''Maritess'', and ''Maricon'' come from  ''Maria Celia (or Celeste)'', ''Marie Antoinette'', ''Mar\u00eda Josefa'' (or ''Josefina)'', ''Mar\u00eda Teresa'', and ''Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n'' (or ''Consolaci\u00f3n)''. The popular male nicknames ''Joma'', ''Jomar'', and ''Jomari'' are derived from [[concatenation|concatenating]] ''Jos\u00e9 Mariano''. ''Jestoni'' was derived from ''Jes\u00fas Antonio''. These types of nicknames have become so common that they have also been registered as a child's official given name by the parents (e.g., ''Maricris Llamador Gunigundo'' or ''Maricris Ll. Gunigundo''). The child ''Sidperl'' got his name when his parents combined their given names ''Isidro'' and ''Perlita''.\n\nSometimes, this practice results in a completely new, unprecedented given name. Former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] [[Jejomar Binay]]'s given name is a combination of ''[[Holy Family|Jesus-Joseph-Mary]]''. Former Senator [[Heherson Alvarez]]'s name is derived from ''He-Her-Son'' (from \"He, Her [Virgin Mary]'s Son\", referring to [[Jesus Christ]]). The unique, patriotic female names ''[[Luzviminda]]'' and its variants ''Minvilu'' and ''Vizminda'' come from concatenating the names of the country's three main island groups: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]].\n\nA related custom is that parents combine their given names to create a name for their child. For example:\n*Maria + Carlos = Malolos\n*Elvin + Liza = Elliza\n*Marino + Erlinda = Marinerl \n\nSome first names like ''Lodegrano'' or ''Lorimer'' may have been invented on the spot by the parents or derived from some partially remembered foreign term. Other coined first names have unusual spellings or [[spelling pronunciation|spellings which are pronounced differently]].\n\n===Honorifics and titles===\nHonorifics and titles are sometimes used in place of a person's actual name. Thus, titles for family elders are often used by the younger persons and then adopted by the wider community: ''Apo'' (grandson/granddaughter). ''Lolo'' (grandfather) and ''Lola'' (grandmother) are used for senior elders; ''Tatay/Itay/Ama'' (father) or ''Tito/Tiyo/Tsong'' (uncle) and ''Nanay/Inay/Ina'' (mother) or ''Tita/Tiya/Tsang'' (aunt) for middle-aged elders; ''Manong'' or ''Kuya'' (elder brother) and ''Manang'' or ''Ate'' (elder sister) for anyone slightly older than the person speaking.\n\nPeople in the community are often addressed by their military or police rank, professional titles or job descriptions, either with or without their names. ''Architect'', ''Attorney'', ''Engineer'', ''Teacher'', ''Dok/Doctor'', ''Direk/Director'', ''Manager'', ''Bisor'' (supervisor), ''Boss'', ''Tsip/Chief'', are used in the same way as ''Mister'', ''Miss'', ''Ms''., or ''Mrs''. especially when the addressee's name is not yet known by the speaker. This is often done as a sign of respect and to avoid giving offence. Even foreigners who work in the Philippines or are naturalized Filipino citizens, including foreign spouses of Filipinos, who hold some of these titles and descriptions are addressed in the same way as their Filipino counterparts, although it may sound awkward or unnatural to some of them or language purists who argue that the basic titles that precede surnames and either ''Sir'' or ''Ma'am/Madam'' are to be employed for simplicity. Also, ''Sir'' and ''Madam/Ma'am'' are not to be used preceding a nickname.\n\n===Numerals and birth order patterns===\nPeople with the same name as their father are registered as ''Junior'' (abbreviated to ''Jr''.) or numbered with Roman numerals (III, IV, V, etc.); their father adds ''Senior'' (''Sr''.) after his surname or suffix. Inevitably, the younger person tends to be nicknamed ''Junior'' or ''Jun'' permanently. This can also be applied to numerals, i.e. the nickname being ''Third'' or ''Fourth''. Because of this, a family will necessarily bestow a variety of unofficial nicknames to distinguish the various people with nearly identical official given names.\n\nMany nicknames are bestowed by parents or other elders on children while they are still toddlers. Examples are the numerous ''Boy'', ''Toto/Totoy'' (young boy), ''Girlie'', ''Nene'' (young girl), ''Baby'' and similar types of pet names given to people who received them as kids and carried them into adult life and seniority. They've carried the nickname all their lives and see no incongruity in being called ''Boy'' or ''Baby'' even when in their sixth decade. Some are diminutives of the actual name, such as ''Pepito'' for ''Pepe'', ''Juanito'' for ''Juan'' (or the English form ''Johnny'' for ''John''), and ''Nenita'' for ''Nena''. Thus, a person used to being called ''Joselito'' (''Little Joseph'') as a child may retain the nickname as an adult even if he could already be called ''Jos\u00e9'' or ''Joseph''.\n\nThe names of children in some families may follow a certain pattern, such as beginning with a certain letter of the alphabet, e.g. ''Diego Arnel'', ''Diamond Amelia'', ''Danford Arman'', ''Dolores Allison'', such that all their initials will be the same, i.e., ''DAZL'' if the middle name is ''Zulueta'' and the surname is ''Lim''. An example of this is that former Senator [[Joker Arroyo]] (legal name) has a brother named Jack.<ref name=McGeown/> Siblings can also be named after certain themes, such as countries, car trademarks, and popular brand names - for instance, World Champion boxer and incumbent Senator [[Manny Pacquiao]] named his two daughters ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Princess''<ref name=McGeown/>.\n\n===Reversals, indigenised names and Anglicisation===\nThe Filipino given name ''Dranreb'' was invented by reversing the spelling of the English name ''Bernard'', while someone calling himself ''Nosrac'' bears the legal name ''Carson''. [[Joseph Estrada|Joseph Ej\u00e9rcito Estrada]], [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|Thirteenth]] [[President of the Philippines]], began as a movie actor and received his nickname ''Erap'' as an adult; it comes from ''Pare'' spelled backwards (from Spanish ''compadre'', ''fellow godparent'') but now means ''mate'' or ''buddy'' in Filipino.<ref name=McGeown/>\n\nAn old custom is to replace or insert Filipino phonemes into a Spanish or English name: ''Mariano'' becomes ''Nano'', ''Edwin'' becomes ''Aweng'', ''Eduardo'' becomes ''Dwarding'', ''Roberto'' becomes ''Berting'', ''Ponciano'' becomes either ''Popoy'', ''Onse'', or ''Syano''. Sometimes there is a tendency to convert a grand-sounding given name into something very ordinary, such as when ''John Paul'' becomes ''JayPee'', ''Peter John'' becomes ''Peejong'', ''Anthony'' becomes ''Tonyo'', ''Ronald'' becomes ''Onad'', ''Mar\u00eda Elena'' becomes ''Ineng'' or ''Inyang'', or ''Ambrosia'' becomes ''Brosya''.\n\nComplementary to this is the practise of Anglicising (with the implication of \"modernising\") a Spanish given name. Thus ''Jos\u00e9 Roberto'' becomes ''Joseph Robert'' (further shortened to ''Joebert''). ''Eduardo'' becomes ''Edward'' and then ''Eddie'' or ''Eddieboy'' (sometimes further shortened to ''Daboy'').

National Artist of the Philippines for Fashion Design, Jos\u00e9 ''Pitoy'' Moreno, would never be recognized anywhere under his official given name, but so far, he is the only prominent ''Pitoy'' in the world.\n\n== Middle names ==\n{{Main|Filipino middle names}}\n\n==Surnames==\n===Indigenous languages===\nThough most Filipinos adopted Malaysian/Indonesian, Chinese and European (especially Spanish and English) surnames, some chose surnames that derive from words in autochthonous languages, like Tagalog, Visayan (Cebuano and Hiligaynon), Ilocano, Kapampangan and Pangasinan. Many indigenous surnames derive from words displaying qualities of people, especially those related to strength (e.g. Tagalog ''Macaraeg'' and ''Panganiban''), defiance (e.g. Tagalog ''Dimayuga'') or settlement (e.g. Cebuano/Hiligaynon ''Magbanua'').\n\nMost indigenous surnames are spelled closely following the [[Spanish orthography|Spanish-derived]] orthographic conventions of the time. Many of these words are spelled differently today in the various Philippine languages (following spelling reforms since the late 19th century).<ref name=PilipinoExpress />\n\n\n\n===Cordilleran===\nUnlike their lowlander counterparts, [[Igorot people|Igorots]] living in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] in northern [[Luzon]] were not conquered by the Spaniards, thereby preserving their naming customs from foreign influence. Each group had their own naming customs, but generally, like [[Indonesian names]], there is only one given name and no surname to speak of. The given name's meaning is usually connected to natural phenomena or objects, such as ''danum'' for water. It was only the Igorots who have had interacted with Spaniards and lowlanders for trade who were given a name that follows the binomial \"first name\"-\"surname\" system, such as Mateo Cari\u00f1o and Mateo Carantes.\n\nIt was only at the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American occupation of the Philippines]] that the naming customs of the Igorots slowly conformed with the national legal naming system used to today, aided by the evangelization efforts of American Protestant missionaries. Most older people, however, still keep the singular given name given to them by their parents while also using the so-called \"Christian names\" to conform to Philippine law. The singular given names of some individuals living in the early 20th century have since been adopted as a surname by their descendants.\n\n===Spanish===\n{{see also|Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos}}\nAlmost all Filipinos had [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish]] or Spanish-sounding surnames imposed on them for taxation purposes, but a number of them have indigenous Filipino surnames. On 21 November 1849, Governor General Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa issued a decree stating that Filipinos should adopt Spanish surnames to make census counting easier. Some Filipinos retained their native pre-colonial names, especially those who were exempted from the Claver\u00eda decree such as the descendants of rulers of the ''Maharlika'' or noble class. These surnames of the native nobility include Lacandola, [[Macapagal]], Macabulos, and Tupas whom each descended from different [[Datu]]s. They were allowed to keep the name to claim tax exemptions.\n\nThe Spanish surname category provides the [[List of common Filipino surnames|most common surnames]] in the Philippines.<ref name=\"geocities.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/heartland/ranch/9121/surnames.html|title=List of some surnames in the Philippines|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/heartland/ranch/9121/surnames.html&date=2009-10-25+02:24:29|archivedate=2009-10-25}}</ref> At the course of time, some Spanish surnames were altered (with some eventually diverged/displaced their original spelling), as resulted from illiteracy among the poor and farming class bearing such surnames, creating confusion in the civil registry and a sense of detachment from their better-off relatives. Except for the \"\u00f1\", Filipino surnames from Spanish are written without accents owing from the use of typewriters in civil registry imported from US that lacks special characters.\n\n===Chinese===\n{{See also|List of common Chinese surnames}}\nMany modern-day [[Chinese Filipino]]s, may have common Chinese surnames. Early Chinese Filipino families took on the complete name of their [[patriarch]], and sometimes added \"-co\" at the end from \u54e5(\"ko\"), which means brother, such as Cojuangco, Gotamco, Yuchengco, etc. Some Chinese names were hispanicized then appended -son or -zon from \u5b6b (\"sun\"), which means grandchild, as in Quezon, Singson, Japson, etc. There are also those that used this style but instead of a family name, they used Hokkien transcriptions of birth order numbers{{claridy|date=April 2020}} appended with -son or -zon or even -co, like Tuazon, Tiongson, Sioson, etc.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Antonio S.|year=1986|title=The Chinese Mestizos and the Formation of the Filipino Nationality|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/arch_0044-8613_1986_num_32_1_2316|journal=Archipel|volume=32|pages=145|doi=10.3406/arch.1986.2316|via=}}</ref> These became unique [[Surnames by country#The Philippines|Filipino surnames]].

They most likely indicate Japanese ancestry either from the many Japanese who settled during pre-colonial Philippines when it was separated among different nations (kingdoms, rajahnates, sultanates, tribes, etc.), colonial times, or more recently from World War II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seapots.com/home/index.php/production-centers-pottery-groups/philippines |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019011022/http://www.seapots.com/home/index.php/production-centers-pottery-groups/philippines |archivedate=October 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiapacificuniverse.com/pkm/tech.htm|title=Philippines History, Culture, Civilization and Technology, Filipino|website=asiapacificuniverse.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archivedate=July 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=litYzL0GYSkC&pg=PA21&dq=Japanese+diaspora+Philippines#v=onepage|title=Japanese Diasporas: Unsung Pasts, Conflicting Presents and Uncertain Futures|first=Nobuko|last=Adachi|date=26 October 2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780203968840|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6mfCzrbOn80C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=Japanese+immigrants+to+Davao#v=onepage|title=The Japanese in Colonial Southeast Asia|first1=Saya|last1=Shiraishi|first2=Takashi|last2=Shiraishi|date=27 August 1993|publisher=SEAP Publications|isbn=9780877274025|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nMore recent economic developments{{clarify|date=April 2020}} in both Japan and the Philippines have enabled exchanges of both peoples for various economic reasons, whether for employment, higher career opportunities, business expansions, or philanthropic ventures, thus a few Japanese expatriates making such ventures settled in the country today, marrying local Filipino women and raising a generation of Filipino-Japanese children taking their education in the Philippines and living in a mix of Filipino and Japanese cultural lifestyles.\n\n===Anglo-American English===\nThese are the surnames of Filipinos of British and/or American heritage, as these surnames are by British people and Americans.\n\n===German surnames===\nA number of Filipino-[[Germans]], Filipino-[[Austrians]], Filipino-[[Swiss people|Swiss]] and Filipino descendants of [[German Americans]] bear German surnames. Some have German surnames because of the immigration of the Jewish communities from Europe during the Commonwealth era in the Philippines.\n\n===Moro===\nThe use of [[Arabic name]]s is prominent among the [[Islam in the Philippines|Filipino Muslims]]. The country has Islamic influence from what are now Arabs, Persians, Malays, Indonesians, and Indians, who have traded with ancestors of Filipinos, and introduced [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]] to the southern parts of the archipelago beginning in the 13th century. Some names, including F\u00e1tima, Omar, and Soraya, bear direct influence from Arab sources and Spanish ones, given the latter's period [[Al-Andalus|under Moorish rule]]. Filipino Muslims also bear and maintain a unique blend of indigenous Moro and Arabic surnames, some are registered with Spanish renderings. Among Maranao families, some Maranao surnames are often used as a given name to their children. Others may or might have borne surnames from their mothers, manifesting scant matrilineal practice.\n\n===Other surnames of foreign origins===\nFilipinos who hold middle or family names from other non-English-speaking nations also follow the conventions mentioned in this article, despite the proper naming customs that are followed in those nations. Such surnames indicate their foreign heritage, primarily due to the influx of migrants and workers from Europe and East Asia, South Asia, and more recently from Middle East.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Philippine kinship]]\n*[[Double-barrelled_name#Filipino_naming_tradition|Filipino naming tradition]]\n*[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]], book of surnames distributed by decree to Filipinos\n*{{section link|Surnames by country|The Philippines}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.babynames.ch/Info/Language/laTagalog Philippine Given Names] A list of typically Philippine given names and hit-parades of the most popular names\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100305142404/http://www.bibingka.com/names/ Catalog of Filipino Names by Hector Santos] Filipino names still used even after the Claver\u00eda edict\n* [http://www.philippinebabynames.com/a-babynames.html Popular names given to Filipino babies] Traditional names given by parents today\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9435751.stm Playful Filipino names hard to get used to], Kate McGeown, BBC News, 27 March 2011.\n\n{{Personal names by culture}}\n{{India-related topics in Philippines}}\n\n[[Category:Names by culture]]\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Hinduism in the Philippines]]\n", "name_user": "Mikeblas", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix broken reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_name"}
