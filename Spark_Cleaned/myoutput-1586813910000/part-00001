'''''Love Stories''''') is a [[List of Bollywood films of 2000|2000]] [[India|Indian]] [[Hindi]]-language [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic drama]] film directed by [[Aditya Chopra]], marking his second directorial venture after ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' (1995). It stars [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] in leading roles. The film also features [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Uday Chopra]], [[Jugal Hansraj]], [[Kim Sharma]], [[Shamita Shetty]], [[Preeti Jhangiani]], [[Anupam Kher]] and [[Archana Puran Singh]] in other pivotal roles. Its soundtrack is composed by [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]] and lyrics are penned by [[Anand Bakshi]]. \n\n''Mohabbatein'' marked the first collaboration between Khan and Bachchan. Shooting took place in India and the United Kingdom from September 1999 to June 2000. The film was released worldwide on 27 October 2000, clashing with ''[[Mission Kashmir]]''. After ''Mohabbatein'', Khan and Rai appeared in ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002). Before ''Mohabbatein'', they also worked together in ''[[Josh (2000 film)|Josh]]'' (2000).\n\nProduced on a budget of {{INRConvert|19|c}}, ''Mohabbatein'' was billed as one of the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Hindi films]] to that point. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, story, music, and performances. With a worldwide gross of {{INRConvert|90|c}}, the film became a major critical and commercial success. It was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year worldwide as well as abroad, and the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year in India. The film changed Amitabh Bachchan's career prospects and earned him critical acclaim as well as several awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Shah Rukh Khan's work in ''Mohabbatein'' is still regarded as one of his finest performances; he won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and also received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] nomination. Aishwarya Rai was also noted for her work, earning her a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Aditya Chopra was nominated for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nNarayan Shankar ([[Animesh Pandey]]) has been the strict Headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. He believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honor, tradition and discipline, with no room for fun and games. He is particularly intolerant of romance, decreeing that any student who is caught having a romantic affair will immediately be expelled.\n\nDespite this draconian rule, three Gurukul students \u2014 Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]), and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) \u2014 all fall in love. Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), a carefree and sweet young girl who is his childhood friend but who already has a steady boyfriend named Deepak (Raman Lamba). Vicky is attracted to Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a sporty and feisty young student at the neighboring all-girls college who rebuffs his attempts to woo her. Karan falls for Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), an elegant young widow whose military pilot husband has been shot down and whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.\n\nMeanwhile, Narayan hires Raj Aryan Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) as Gurukul's new music teacher. Friendly and a firm believer in the power of love, Raj Aryan makes it his mission to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to not give up and stay loyal to their loves. He tells them that he has a special love himself, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), saying that although she is dead, he imagines her to be by his side every day.\n\nOne day, as part of his plan to spread love throughout the school, Raj Aryan throws a party and invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan walks in on the party, shuts it down, and furiously threatens to fire Raj Aryan. At this point, Raj Aryan reveals that he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, who happened to be Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj Aryan from the school without even seeing his face, and a distraught Megha, unable to live without Raj Aryan, committed suicide. Raj Aryan declares that he has come back to Gurukul to honor Megha's memory by reversing the school's zero-tolerance policy on romance, and promises that before he leaves he will fill the school with so much love that even Narayan will be unable to stop it. A shocked Narayan takes this as a challenge and allows Raj Aryan to remain for a while longer.\n\nSameer, Vicky, and Karan are all able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj Aryan, continues to defy the rules, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels Sameer, Vicky, and Karan. Raj Aryan speaks up on their behalf, stating that they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. He also says that he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj Aryan (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him as well.\n\nRaj Aryan's harsh words sting Narayan, and he tearfully realizes his strict no-romance policy has been misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body and resigns as headmaster of Gurukul, nominating Raj Aryan as his successor, who accepts and reconciles with Narayan.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Mr. Narayan Shankar\n*[[Shahrukh Khan]] as Raj Aryan Malhotra\n*[[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Megha Shankar\n*[[Jimmy Sheirgill]] as Karan Chaudhry\n*[[Jugal Hansraj]] as Sameer Sharma\n*[[Uday Chopra]] as Vikram Kapoor/Vikram Oberoi\n*[[Kim Sharma]] as Sanjana\u2013 Sameer's love interest\n*[[Preeti Jhangiani]] as Kiran Khanna\u2013 Karan's love interest\n*[[Shamita Shetty]] as Ishika Dhanrajgir\u2013 Vicky's love interest\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as Major General Ajitesh Khanna\u2013 Kiran's father-in-law\n*[[Shefali Shah]] as Nandini Khanna\u2013 Kiran's sister-in-law\n*[[Parzan Dastur]] as Ayush Khanna- Nandini\u2019s son, Kiran\u2019s nephew\n*[[Saurabh Shukla]] as Sanjana's father\n*[[Anupam Kher]] as Kaake\n*[[Archana Puran Singh]] as Preeto\n*[[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as Miss Monica Khanna\n*[[Sindhu Tolani]] as Abhilasha Verma\u2013 Ishika's friend\n\n==Production==\nBefore the production of the film, Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career with little success, and was also in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, not only hurting his image but leaving him almost penniless. It was at this time that Bachchan contacted his friend, director/producer [[Yash Chopra]], who told him of an upcoming production that he could be in.<ref name=trib>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Lead Article |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=4 March 2001 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref> With ''Mohabbatein'', Bachchan was finally able to shed his \"hero\" image and to play older, more mature roles.<ref name=trib/> This was also the first film in which Bachchan and Khan appeared together.

'''''Love Stories''''') is a [[List of Bollywood films of 2000|2000]] [[India|Indian]] [[Hindi]]-language [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic drama]] film directed by [[Aditya Chopra]], marking his second directorial venture after ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' (1995). It stars [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] in leading roles. The film also features [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Uday Chopra]], [[Jugal Hansraj]], [[Kim Sharma]], [[Shamita Shetty]], [[Preeti Jhangiani]], [[Anupam Kher]] and [[Archana Puran Singh]] in other pivotal roles. Its soundtrack is composed by [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]] and lyrics are penned by [[Anand Bakshi]]. \n\n''Mohabbatein'' marked the first collaboration between Khan and Bachchan. Shooting took place in India and the United Kingdom from September 1999 to June 2000. The film was released worldwide on 27 October 2000, clashing with ''[[Mission Kashmir]]''. After ''Mohabbatein'', Khan and Rai appeared in ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002). Before ''Mohabbatein'', they also worked together in ''[[Josh (2000 film)|Josh]]'' (2000).\n\nProduced on a budget of {{INRConvert|19|c}}, ''Mohabbatein'' was billed as one of the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Hindi films]] to that point. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, story, music, and performances. With a worldwide gross of {{INRConvert|90|c}}, the film became a major critical and commercial success. It was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year worldwide as well as abroad, and the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year in India. The film changed Amitabh Bachchan's career prospects and earned him critical acclaim as well as several awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Shah Rukh Khan's work in ''Mohabbatein'' is still regarded as one of his finest performances; he won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and also received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] nomination. Aishwarya Rai was also noted for her work, earning her a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Aditya Chopra was nominated for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nNarayan Shankar ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) has been the strict Headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. He believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honor, tradition and discipline, with no room for fun and games. He is particularly intolerant of romance, decreeing that any student who is caught having a romantic affair will immediately be expelled.\n\nDespite this draconian rule, three Gurukul students \u2014 Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]), and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) \u2014 all fall in love. Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), a carefree and sweet young girl who is his childhood friend but who already has a steady boyfriend named Deepak (Raman Lamba). Vicky is attracted to Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a sporty and feisty young student at the neighboring all-girls college who rebuffs his attempts to woo her. Karan falls for Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), an elegant young widow whose military pilot husband has been shot down and whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.\n\nMeanwhile, Narayan hires Raj Aryan Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) as Gurukul's new music teacher. Friendly and a firm believer in the power of love, Raj Aryan makes it his mission to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to not give up and stay loyal to their loves. He tells them that he has a special love himself, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), saying that although she is dead, he imagines her to be by his side every day.\n\nOne day, as part of his plan to spread love throughout the school, Raj Aryan throws a party and invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan walks in on the party, shuts it down, and furiously threatens to fire Raj Aryan. At this point, Raj Aryan reveals that he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, who happened to be Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj Aryan from the school without even seeing his face, and a distraught Megha, unable to live without Raj Aryan, committed suicide. Raj Aryan declares that he has come back to Gurukul to honor Megha's memory by reversing the school's zero-tolerance policy on romance, and promises that before he leaves he will fill the school with so much love that even Narayan will be unable to stop it. A shocked Narayan takes this as a challenge and allows Raj Aryan to remain for a while longer.\n\nSameer, Vicky, and Karan are all able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj Aryan, continues to defy the rules, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels Sameer, Vicky, and Karan. Raj Aryan speaks up on their behalf, stating that they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. He also says that he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj Aryan (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him as well.\n\nRaj Aryan's harsh words sting Narayan, and he tearfully realizes his strict no-romance policy has been misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body and resigns as headmaster of Gurukul, nominating Raj Aryan as his successor, who accepts and reconciles with Narayan.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Mr. Narayan Shankar\n*[[Shahrukh Khan]] as Raj Aryan Malhotra\n*[[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Megha Shankar\n*[[Jimmy Sheirgill]] as Karan Chaudhry\n*[[Jugal Hansraj]] as Sameer Sharma\n*[[Uday Chopra]] as Vikram Kapoor/Vikram Oberoi\n*[[Kim Sharma]] as Sanjana\u2013 Sameer's love interest\n*[[Preeti Jhangiani]] as Kiran Khanna\u2013 Karan's love interest\n*[[Shamita Shetty]] as Ishika Dhanrajgir\u2013 Vicky's love interest\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as Major General Ajitesh Khanna\u2013 Kiran's father-in-law\n*[[Shefali Shah]] as Nandini Khanna\u2013 Kiran's sister-in-law\n*[[Parzan Dastur]] as Ayush Khanna- Nandini\u2019s son, Kiran\u2019s nephew\n*[[Saurabh Shukla]] as Sanjana's father\n*[[Anupam Kher]] as Kaake\n*[[Archana Puran Singh]] as Preeto\n*[[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as Miss Monica Khanna\n*[[Sindhu Tolani]] as Abhilasha Verma\u2013 Ishika's friend\n\n==Production==\nBefore the production of the film, Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career with little success, and was also in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, not only hurting his image but leaving him almost penniless. It was at this time that Bachchan contacted his friend, director/producer [[Yash Chopra]], who told him of an upcoming production that he could be in.<ref name=trib>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Lead Article |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=4 March 2001 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref> With ''Mohabbatein'', Bachchan was finally able to shed his \"hero\" image and to play older, more mature roles.<ref name=trib/> This was also the first film in which Bachchan and Khan appeared together.
