The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>\n\nThe boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>\n\n==Career==\nLike the rest of her class, ''G3''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]].\n\nIn December 1921 ''G3'', out of commission, was being towed north to be broken up for scrap when she broke her tether and came ashore at Scalby Mills, north of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. The submarine later broke free from the shore and drifted back out to sea. She then drifted south, finally running aground under Buckton cliffs in Filey Bay, bow first. A local man, John Webster bought the salvage rights to the vessel and the wreck was scrapped. Lumps of the hulk were lifted up the sheer cliffs using ropes and pulleys, the salvers using rope ladders for access.
