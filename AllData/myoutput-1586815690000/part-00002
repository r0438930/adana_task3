Edmond Leary and [[MC Shan]] produced the entire album, apart from one track which was produced by John Ficarrotta. The album was produced shortly before Snow was imprisoned for a year on an [[assault]] charge. Upon his release from [[prison]], his first single \"[[Informer (song)|Informer]]\" became a chart topping hit. It later went on to become one of the largest-selling reggae records of all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter M.C. Shan discovered Snow through a Canadian DJ Prince Marvin, he began recording songs with Snow in New York in the Basement of his house at 169-05 Union Turnpike Queens NYC with his first Wife at the time Terri Moltke, currently Terri Tucker shopped his tape and live with Snow to several record labels offering a live demonstration of the tape to include Select Records and other Labels. The times were tough for the Moltke's as MC Shan did not receive marketing support from Warner Bros Cold Chillin' Records for his new album \"Play It Again Shan\". During the pregnancy of their second child, Terri Moltke-Tucker took Snow on the train all over Mahattan, N.Y.C. in the winter months of 1992 after, Michael Grier, Edmond Leary (AKIM), MC Shan, Terri Moltke all banged out what they thought was their best work ever. Terri Moltke stood in a coin laundry mat across from a Dunkin Donuts and next to a Seven 7 Eleven 11 store waiting for call backs from labels. Finally the pay phone wars with laundry patrons grew old day after day and Terri asked David Eng the Owner of Bayside Studios stating she could she use his reception service at the studio for call backs from labels for their Artist \"Snow\" whom she labeled as the next big ICON. David asked Terri if he could hear the Artist since he and Steve Salem his business partner just started a Record Label \"Mo Jam Records\" and she arranged a meeting with managers David Kenneth Eng and EZ Steve Salem (Same day signed a Management Deal) in their basement, and who also signed Snow to \"Mo Jam Records\". While awaiting trial for assault with a crowbar fight outside of a Canadian Pub and murder charges eight (8) Months later Snow was acquitted, Shan and Snow began mixing the completed album down at the Bayside Studios. The inspiration for the song [[Informer (song)|Informer]] stemmed from a late night incident across the street from Snow's Allenbury home. Thus, the song described how a detective incorrectly accused Snow of \"stabbing someone down the lane.\" The song also chronicled Snow's incarceration at [[Toronto East Detention Centre]] and prison life.<ref name=\"See 1993\">See: 12 Inches of Snow, VHS (New York: A-Vision, 1993)</ref>\n\nShan described the album as not \"raw, straight-up\" reggae but more of a hybrid album fusing pop, jazz, reggae, and hip hop resulting in \"mass appeal.\" Indeed, the songs \"Informer,\" \"Runway,\" \"Champion Sound,\" and \"Lonely Monday Morning,\" were [[dancehall]] tracks performed in [[Jamaican Patois]]. Shan recorded \"Drunken Styles,\" another song performed entirely in patois, after Snow and the recording crew celebrated at a nearby tavern in Bayside Queens after a studio session whereas a tipsy Snow performed the entire track free style.<ref name=\"See 1993\"/>\n\nOther songs, such as \"Lady With the Red Dress,\" \"Girl I've Been Hurt,\" \"Uhh in You,\" and \"Hey, Pretty Love,\" mixed love ballads and dance tracks with patois. \"Ease Up,\" \"Creative Child,\" and \"50 Ways (To Flip a Style),\" were hip-hop inspired songs.<ref name=\"See 1993\"/>\n\n===Legal dispute===\nWhile touring as Snow's DJ in December 1994, Marvin Prince abruptly left the tour after discovering Snow \"was receiving more money from management than he was.\" While listed as only the co-writer of the song \"Runway\" on the 12&nbsp;inches of Snow album, Prince claimed to have co-written five songs and co-produced the album with Shan, Eng, and Salem. Furthermore, Prince alleged that Eng and Salem provided \"a draft of a multi-album production and recording agreement\" for both Snow and himself. Unable to understand the contract, Prince allegedly \"sent a copy to his mother to get legal advice from her friend\" and \"never saw the agreement again.\" Moreover, Prince claimed to have entered an \"oral agreement\" with Snow implying that the two would share profits from the album \"fifty-fifty.\" The first agreement, Prince alleged, occurred \"in 1990, when the two men began working together on songs in\" Prince's \"basement\" and he \"allegedly suggested to\" Snow, \"if something comes out of this, let's be partners.\" The second oral agreement, according to Prince, took place in August 1991 while Snow \"auditioned for Shan.\" While Snow frequently referred to Prince as his partner in promotional videos, he claimed to have used the term \"only in the slang sense.\" Prince, moreover, \"admitted that these discussions were not concrete; the parties never organized a formal business plan, nor was plaintiff in New York to advance defendant's career.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13886394386652351580&q=Prince+v.+O%27BRIEN,+256+AD2d+208&hl=en&as_sdt=100000000000002&as_vis=1 |title=Prince v.
