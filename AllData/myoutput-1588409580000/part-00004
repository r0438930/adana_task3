It has a population of 1,147,000<ref name=\"GSO09\"/> and spans an area of 5,197&nbsp;km\u00b2. Its capital is [[Nha Trang]]. Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a is the site of [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]]'s summer home, the [[Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang]], the Institute of Oceanography, the Institute of Vaccines and Biological Substances, and was headquarters of the US Army's [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] (\"the Green Berets\") during the [[Vietnam War]] in the late 1950s and 1960s. [[Cam Ranh Bay]] port is on land closest to a deep sea drop in Vietnam - the best site for [[submarine]] bases in Vietnam. An ancient temple of [[Champa]] is on the north side of Nha Trang.\n\n==History==\nThe site of what is now Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a had been within the territory of the [[Champa]] Kingdom before it was annexed to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's (Vietnam's) territory. In 1653, one of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]], [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac T\u1ea7n]], sent his troops to occupy [[Phan Rang]]. The Champa king [[B\u00e0 T\u1ea5m]] surrendered to Nguy\u1ec5n's troops and ceded an area from the east of the [[Phan Rang River]] to [[Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean]] to the Nguy\u1ec5n lord. The Nguy\u1ec5n lord accepted the ceded territory and set up the Th\u00e1i Khang garrison and divided it into two districts: Th\u00e1i Khang and Di\u00ean Ninh.\n\nIn 1832, under the rule of emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]], this area was renamed Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a and was divided into two districts, Ph\u1ee7 Di\u00ean Kh\u00e1nh and Ph\u1ee7 Ninh H\u00f2a, which between them had a total of four counties: Ph\u01b0\u1edbc \u0110i\u1ec1n and V\u0129nh X\u01b0\u01a1ng counties; and Qu\u1ea3ng Ph\u01b0\u1edbc and T\u00e2n \u0110\u1ecbnh counties, respectively.\n\nUnder [[French Indochina]], the provincial capital was located in Di\u00ean Kh\u00e1nh Citadel, but it was relocated to Nha Trang in 1945.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a was a hub of military activity for the [[Republic of Vietnam]] army ([[ARVN]]), the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]], the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]], and for the U.S. [[Pacific Air Forces]] (USAF), particularly in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] and at the [[Nha Trang Air Base]]. The II Corp. headquarters was located in Nha Trang and populated by general and field officers, intelligence groups and ARVN liaisons.\n\nAfter the communists' victory and the [[Fall of Saigon]] on April 30, 1975, the communist regime merged two provinces, [[Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean]] and Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a, into Ph\u00fa Kh\u00e1nh Province on 29 October 1975. In 1977, Nha Trang was upgraded to city status. In 1982, the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]] decided to incorporate the [[Spratly Islands]] into Ph\u00fa Kh\u00e1nh Province. On June 30, 1989, the National Assembly reversed its previous decision and split Ph\u00fa Kh\u00e1nh Province into two provinces as they were before.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Su\u1ed1i_Ba_H\u1ed3_25.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ba H\u1ed3 stream in Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a province]]\nKh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province has an area of 5,197&nbsp;km\u00b2. Its geographical coordinates are 108\u00b040\u201933\" to 109\u00b027\u201955\" E and 11\u00b042\u201950\" to 12\u00b052\u201915\" N.\n\nThe provincial coastline spreads from \u0110\u1ea1i L\u00e3nh Commune to the end of [[Cam Ranh Bay]] with 385&nbsp;km of coastline featuring numerous creek mouths, lagoons, river mouths, and hundreds of islands and islets. The province also administers large territorial waters. The [[Spratly Islands]] are part of the province's Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Sa District. The coastline is indented by several bays, most notably the four bays of [[V\u00e2n Phong Bay]], [[Nha Phu Bay]], [[Nha Trang Bay]] (C\u00f9 Hu\u00e2n) and [[Cam Ranh Bay]], of which Cam Ranh Bay with an area of around 200&nbsp;km\u00b2, encompassed by a mountain range, is regarded as one of the three best natural seaports in the world. Cam Ranh Bay is strategically important and has been used as a naval base by several major powers throughout history.\n\n[[H\u00f2n \u0110\u00f4i Cliff]] (M\u0169i H\u00f2n \u0110\u00f4i) on the [[H\u00f2n G\u1ed1m Peninsula]] in [[V\u1ea1n Ninh District]] is the easternmost tip of Vietnam's mainland.\n\nThe province is mostly mountainous.

There are two distinct seasons: the rainy season lasts from April to December, with the other months being the dry season, except in [[Nha Trang]] where the rainy season lasts for just two months. The average relative humidity is 80.5%. The climate on the summit of H\u00f2n B\u00e0 Mountain (located 30&nbsp;km from Nha Trang) features a climate like that of [[\u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t]] and [[Sa Pa (town)|Sa Pa]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2007}}, the province had a population of 1.147 million,<ref name=\"GSO09\"/> of which the majority are ''Kinh'' or [[Vietnamese people]], the dominant ethnic group in Vietnam. [[Minority group]]s dwelling in the province are the [[Cham people|Cham]], [[Raglai people]], the \"Overseas [[Chinese people|Chinese]]\" [[Hoa people]], and the Austroasiatic-speaking [[Koho people]].\n\nKh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a had an urban population of 466,500 people or 40.7% of the total in 2007, making it the most urbanized province of the [[South Central Coast]]. The average population growth per year between 2000 and 2007 was 1.26%, close to the average of the region.

The province is endowed with beautiful natural landscapes and beaches, which (together with its Cham heritage) attracts a large number of tourists. Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a has had a significant trade surplus in recent years, with exports in 2007 of US$503.3 million and imports of US$222.5 million.<ref name=GSO09/>\n\n===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===\nGiven its lack of flat land, Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a has a relatively small agricultural sector. Rice harvests are among the lowest in the [[Nam Trung B\u1ed9|South Central Coast]] with 188,500t in 2007. However, its output of sugar cane (738,200t in 2007, 4.25% of the national figure) and cashew nuts (5,238t, 1.74%) are more significant.<ref name=GSO09calc/>\n\nKh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a is one of the few provinces with a higher [[gross output]] in fishing than in agriculture.<ref name=GSO09/> This is mostly due to the large number of aquaculture farms in the province, which make up around two thirds of the fishing output.\n\n===Industry===\n[[Nha Trang]] is the [[South Central Coast]]'s second largest industrial center<ref name=Atlat/> and the province in general accounts for more than one fifth of the region's industrial GDP.<ref name=GSO09calc/> Food processing industries are large, especially those processing local fishing products and food for shrimp farms. Other industrial sectors produce beverages, fabric, textiles, paper, and construction materials.<ref name=GSO09/>\n\nIndustrial production is not only in and around Nha Trang. The province has also benefited significantly from investment related to the former Russian naval base at [[Cam Ranh]], to which around 30 factories were attached.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Nga x\u00e2y l\u1ea1i qu\u00e2n c\u1ea3ng Cam Ranh?| newspaper = BBC Vietnamese| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2010/10/101007_russia_camranh.shtml| date= 2010-10-07| accessdate = 2011-07-08}}</ref> A major new industrial center is being developed in the north of the province around [[V\u00e2n Phong Port]] ([[V\u00e2n Phong Economic Zone]]).\n\n==Infrastructure==\nKh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a is located along Vietnam's main north-south transport corridors.

Nha Trang Port (a tourist and cargo port) and D\u1ed1c L\u1ebft Port (a shipbuilding and logistics port) are now in use. [[V\u00e2n Phong Port]], a [[megaproject]] intended to be developed in [[V\u00e2n Phong Bay]] by a consortium of Japanese corporations (with [[Sumitomo]] as the leading investor) with an estimated investment of US$15 billion, is in progress. On completion, this deep sea port will be capable of handling ships up to 100,000 tonnes and 100 million tonnes of loaded/unloaded cargo per annum.\n\n[[Cam Ranh International Airport]] is located in the south of the province and is one of Vietnam's busiest airports.\n\n==Education==\nKh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a is one of the most important educational centers in Vietnam. It is home to [[Nha Trang University]] (formerly Nha Trang Fishery University), a [[multidisciplinary]] university; the Naval Academy; the Air Force Officer Academy; a Normal College; a Kindergarten Teacher's Training College; and an Arts and Tourism College.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Khanh Hoa}}\n*[http://www.khanhhoa.gov.vn Official website of the provincial government]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province\n|North     = [[Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean Province]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = ''[[South China Sea|East Sea]]''\n|Southeast = ''[[South China Sea|East Sea]]''\n|South     = [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn Province]]\n|Southwest = [[L\u00e2m \u0110\u1ed3ng Province]]\n|West      = \n|Northwest = [[\u0110\u1eafk L\u1eafk Province]]\n}}\n\n{{Subdivisions of Vietnam}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khanh Hoa Province}}\n[[Category:Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2011}}\n{{short description|Province of Vietnam}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province\n| official_name                   = \n| native_name                     = T\u1ec9nh Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a\n| native_name_lang                = vi<!-- ISO 639-2 code: vi for Vietnamese -->\n| type                            = [[Provinces of Vietnam|Province]]\n| nickname                        = [[Agarwood]] Land\n| image_skyline                   = Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a.png\n| image_caption                   = Clockwise, from left to right: [[Raglai people|Raglai House]], [[Di\u00ean Kh\u00e1nh District|Di\u00ean Kh\u00e1nh Citadel]], [[Po Nagar|Po Nagar Tower]], [[Amboyna Cay]], [[Nha Trang|Nha Trang Coastline]]\n| image_seal                      = Emblem of Khanhhoa Province.png\n| image_map                       = Khanh Hoa in Vietnam.svg\n| map_caption                     = Location of Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a within Vietnam\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|12|15|N|109|12|E|region:VN_type:adm1st|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|Vietnam}}\n| subdivision_type1               = [[Regions of Vietnam|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1               = [[South Central Coast]]\n| seat_type                       = Capital\n| seat                            = [[Nha Trang]]\n| leader_party                    = \n| leader_title                    = [[Provinces of Vietnam#People's Council|People's Committee]] Chair\n| leader_name                     = L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Vinh\n| leader_title1                   = [[Provinces of Vietnam#People's Committee|People's Council]] Chair\n| leader_name1                    = L\u00ea Thanh Quang\n| area_total_km2                  = 5217.6\n| elevation_footnotes             = \n| elevation_m                     = \n| population_footnotes            = \n| population_total                = 1,336,143\n| population_as_of                = 2019\n| population_density_km2          = auto\n| demographics_type1              = Demographics\n| demographics1_title1            = [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|Ethnicities]]\n| demographics1_info1             = [[Vietnamese people|Kinh]], [[Raglai people|Raglai]], [[Hoa people|Hoa]], [[Koho people|Koho]]\n| timezone1                       = ICT\n| utc_offset1                     = +7\n| area_code_type                  = Calling code\n| area_code                       = 258\n| iso_code                        = [[ISO 3166-2:VN|VN-34]]\n| website                         = {{URL|http://www.khanhhoa.gov.vn/}}\n}}\n\n'''Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a''' ({{audio|Khanh Hoa.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] of [[Vietnam]] located in the [[South Central Coast]].

The Champa king [[B\u00e0 T\u1ea5m]] surrendered to Nguyen's troops and ceded an area from the east of the [[Phan Rang River]] to [[Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean]] to the Nguy\u1ec5n lord. The Nguy\u1ec5n lord accepted the ceded territory and set up the Th\u00e1i Khang garrison and divided it into two districts: Th\u00e1i Khang and Di\u00ean Ninh.\n\nIn 1832, under the rule of emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]], this area was renamed Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a and was divided into two districts which included four counties: Ph\u1ee7 Di\u00ean Kh\u00e1nh inclusive of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc \u0110i\u1ec1n and V\u0129nh X\u01b0\u01a1ng county; Ph\u1ee7 Ninh H\u00f2a inclusive of Qu\u1ea3ng Ph\u01b0\u1edbc and T\u00e2n \u0110\u1ecbnh county.\n\nUnder [[French Indochina]], the provincial capital was located in Di\u00ean Kh\u00e1nh Citadel, but it was relocated in Nha Trang Town in 1945.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a was a hub of military activity for the [[Republic of Vietnam]] army ([[ARVN]]), the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]], the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]], and for the U.S. [[Pacific Air Forces]] (USAF), particularly in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] and at the [[Nha Trang Air Base]]. The II Corp. headquarters was located in Nha trang and populated by general and field officers, intelligence groups and ARVN liaisons.\n\nAfter the communists' victory and the [[Fall of Saigon]] on April 30, 1975, the communist regime merged two provinces, [[Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean]] and Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a, into Ph\u00fa Kh\u00e1nh Province on 29 October 1975. In 1977, Nha Trang Town was upgraded to city status. In 1982, the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]] decided to incorporate the [[Spratly Islands]] into Ph\u00fa Kh\u00e1nh Province. On June 30, 1989, the National Assembly reversed its previous decision and split Ph\u00fa Kh\u00e1nh Province into two provinces as they were before.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Su\u1ed1i_Ba_H\u1ed3_25.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ba H\u1ed3 stream in Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a province]]\nKh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province has an area of 5,197&nbsp;km\u00b2. Its geographical coordinates are 108\u00b040\u201933\" to 109\u00b027\u201955\" E and 11\u00b042\u201950\" to 12\u00b052\u201915\" N.\n\nThe provincial coastline spreads from \u0110\u1ea1i L\u00e3nh Commune to the end of [[Cam Ranh Bay]] with a total length of coastline of 385&nbsp;km featuring numerous creek mouths, lagoons, river mouths, and hundreds of islands and islets. The province also administers large territorial waters. The [[Spratly Islands]] are part of the province's Truong Sa County. The coastline is indented by several bays, most notably the four bays [[V\u00e2n Phong Bay]], [[Nha Phu Bay]], [[Nha Trang Bay]] (C\u00f9 Hu\u00e2n) and [[Cam Ranh Bay]], of which Cam Ranh Bay with its area of around 200&nbsp;km\u00b2, encompassed by a mountain range, is regarded as one of three best natural seaports in the world. Cam Ranh Bay is strategically important and has been used as a naval base by several major powers throughout history.\n\n[[H\u00f2n \u0110\u00f4i Cliff]] (M\u0169i H\u00f2n \u0110\u00f4i) on the [[H\u00f2n G\u1ed1m Peninsula]], [[V\u1ea1n Ninh District]] is the easternmost tip of Vietnam's mainland.\n\nThe province is mostly mountainous.

[[V\u00e2n Phong Port]], a [[megaproject]] intended to be developed in [[V\u00e2n Phong Bay]] by a consortium of Japanese corporations (with [[Sumitomo]] as the leading investor) with an estimated investment of US$15 billion (15*10^9) is in progress. On completion, this deep sea port will be capable of handling ships up to 100,000 tonnes and of 100 million tonnes of loaded/unloaded cargo per annum.\n\n[[Cam Ranh International Airport]] is located in the south of the province and is one of Vietnam's busiest airports.\n\n==Education==\nKh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a is one of the most important educational centers in Vietnam.
