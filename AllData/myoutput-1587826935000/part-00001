It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.{{sfn|Junor|p=72|2005}}</blockquote>\n\nCharles's girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of [[John Russell (diplomat)|Sir John Russell]], who was [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Spain|British ambassador to Spain]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=192|2007}} Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the [[8th Duke of Wellington]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=193|2007}} Davina Sheffield;{{sfn|Brandreth|p=194|2007}} [[Lady Sarah Spencer]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=195|2007}} and [[Camilla Shand]],{{sfn|Brandreth|p=178|2007}} who later became his second wife and Duchess of Cornwall.{{sfn|Brandreth|pp=15\u201317|2007}}\n\nEarly in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to [[Amanda Knatchbull]], who was Mountbatten's granddaughter.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=204\u2013206|1994}}{{sfn|Brandreth|p=200|2007}} Charles wrote to Amanda's mother\u2014[[Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Lady Brabourne]], who was also his [[Godparent|godmother]]\u2014expressing interest in her daughter, to which she replied approvingly, though she suggested that a [[courtship]] with the not yet 17-year-old girl was premature.{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=263|1994}} Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 tour of India. Both fathers, however, objected; Philip feared that Charles would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British [[Viceroy]] and first [[Governor-General of India]]), while [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]] warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263\u2013265|1994}} However, in August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was killed by the IRA. When Charles returned, he proposed to Amanda,<!--Brandreth p 202 says Charles proposed two weeks before the assassination and that Amanda turned him down then, before Mountbatten's death--> but in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother [[Nicholas Knatchbull|Nicholas]] in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263\u2013265|1994}} In June 1980, Charles officially turned down [[Chevening]] House, placed at his disposal since 1974, as his future residence. Chevening, a [[stately home]] in Kent, was bequeathed, along with an [[financial endowment|endowment]], to the Crown by the last [[James Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope|Earl Stanhope]], Amanda's childless great-uncle, in the hope that Charles would eventually occupy it.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=299\u2013300|1994}} In 1977, a newspaper report mistakenly announced his engagement to [[Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg]].{{sfn|Brandreth|p=196|2007}}\n\n===Marriages===\n====Marriage to Lady Diana Spencer====\n{{Main|Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer}}\n[[File:Charles and Di.

He was the companion of her elder sister, [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale|Sarah]], and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten. Soon, according to Charles's chosen biographer, [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], \"without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride\", and she accompanied Charles on visits to [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]].{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=279|1994}}\n\nCharles's cousin [[Norton Knatchbull, 8th Baron Brabourne|Norton Knatchbull]] and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=280\u2013282|1994}} Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and [[paparazzi]]. When Prince Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=281\u2013283|1994}}\n\nPrince Charles proposed to Diana in February 1981; she accepted and they married in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 29 July of that year.

It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.{{sfn|Junor|p=72|2005}}</blockquote>\n\nCharles's girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of [[John Russell (diplomat)|Sir John Russell]], who was [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Spain|British ambassador to Spain]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=192|2007}} Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the [[8th Duke of Wellington]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=193|2007}} Davina Sheffield;{{sfn|Brandreth|p=194|2007}} [[Lady Sarah Spencer]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=195|2007}} and [[Camilla Shand]],{{sfn|Brandreth|p=178|2007}} who later became his second wife and Duchess of Cornwall.{{sfn|Brandreth|pp=15\u201317|2007}}\n\nEarly in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to [[Amanda Knatchbull]], who was Mountbatten's granddaughter.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=204\u2013206|1994}}{{sfn|Brandreth|p=200|2007}} Charles wrote to Amanda's mother\u2014[[Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Lady Brabourne]], who was also his [[Godparent|godmother]]\u2014expressing interest in her daughter, to which she replied approvingly, though she suggested that a [[courtship]] with the not yet 17-year-old girl was premature.{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=263|1994}} Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 tour of India. Both fathers, however, objected; Philip feared that Charles would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British [[Viceroy]] and first [[Governor-General of India]]), while [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]] warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263\u2013265|1994}} However, in August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was killed by the IRA. When Charles returned, he proposed to Amanda,<!--Brandreth p 202 says Charles proposed two weeks before the assassination and that Amanda turned him down then, before Mountbatten's death--> but in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother [[Nicholas Knatchbull|Nicholas]] in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263\u2013265|1994}} In June 1980, Charles officially turned down [[Chevening]] House, placed at his disposal since 1974, as his future residence. Chevening, a [[stately home]] in Kent, was bequeathed, along with an [[financial endowment|endowment]], to the Crown by the last [[James Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope|Earl Stanhope]], Amanda's childless great-uncle, in the hope that Charles would eventually occupy it.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=299\u2013300|1994}} In 1977, a newspaper report mistakenly announced his engagement to [[Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg]].{{sfn|Brandreth|p=196|2007}}\n\n===Marriages===\n====Marriage to Lady Diana Spencer====\n{{Main|Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer}}\n[[File:Charles and Di.

He was the companion of her elder sister, [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale|Sarah]], and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten. Soon, according to Charles's chosen biographer, [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], \"without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride\", and she accompanied Charles on visits to [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]].{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=279|1994}}\n\nCharles's cousin [[Norton Knatchbull, 8th Baron Brabourne|Norton Knatchbull]] and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=280\u2013282|1994}} Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and [[paparazzi]]. When Prince Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=281\u2013283|1994}}\n\nPrince Charles proposed to Diana in February 1981; she accepted and they married in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 29 July of that year.
