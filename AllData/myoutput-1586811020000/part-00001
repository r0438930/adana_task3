[[Camborne]] and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]].\n\n[[File:Celtic wooden cross - Redruth - New Cut Car Park.jpg|thumb|right|Celtic wooden cross in New Cut Car Park]]\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe name Redruth derives from its older Cornish name, ''Rhyd-ruth''.  It means Red Ford (literally fordred). The first syllable 'red' means ford. The second 'ruth' means red.\n\n''Rhyd'' is the older form of 'Res', which is a Cornish equivalent to a ford (across a river), a common Celtic word; Old Cornish ''rid''; Welsh ''rhyd'' (Old Welsh ''rit''); Old Breton ''rit'' or ''ret'', Gaulish ''ritu-'', all from Indo-European ''*prtus'' derived word in ''-tu'' from the root *per \" to cross, to go through \"; Proto-Germanic ''*furd\u00faz'' (English ford, German ''Furt''); Latin ''portus'', all related to the Celtic word.<ref>[[Xavier Delamarre]], ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', \u00e9ditions errance 2003, p. 258.</ref> \n\nIt is the ''-ruth'' (and not the ''Red-'' part of the name) which means the colour red.<ref>Redruth & its people \u2013 Michael Tangye \u2013 {{ISBN|0-9501872-1-6}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Native Copper from Huelvor near Redruth, Cornwall.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Native Copper]] mineral specimen from Huelvor near Redruth. Hand-colored copper-plate engraving by [[James Sowerby]], 1807.]]\n[[File:St Uny's Church - geograph.org.uk - 352440.jpg|thumb|St Uny's Church]]\nTraditionally in the [[Penwith (hundred)|Penwith Hundred]], the town has developed away from the original settlement, which was near where the present Churchtown (around [[St. Euny]]'s Church) district of Redruth stands today. This location is a steeply wooded valley, with [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] on one side and the now-called [[Bullers Hill]] on the other. The presence of shallow [[lode]]s of [[tin]] and [[copper]] lying east to west made it an advantageous site for extracting metals, including, tin, [[lead]] and copper. The first settlers stayed by a crossing in the river and started extracting metal ores, and this process turned the colour of the river red.\n\nHistorically, Redruth was a small [[market town]] overshadowed by its neighbours until a boom in the demand for copper [[ore]] during the 18th century. Copper ore had mostly been discarded by the Cornish [[tin]]-mining industry but was now needed to make [[brass]], an essential metal in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Surrounded by copper ore deposits, Redruth quickly became one of the largest and richest mining areas in Britain and the town's population grew markedly, although most miners' families remained poor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn the 1880s and 1890s the town end of Clinton Road gained a number of institutions, notably a [[School of Metalliferous Mining|School of Mines and Art School]] in 1882\u201383, St. Andrew's Church (replacing the chapel in Chapel Street) in 1883 and, opposite, the Free Library, built in 1895. The [[Mining Exchange]] was built in 1880 as a place for the trading of mineral stock. By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria Park had been laid out to commemorate the [[Golden Jubilee]] and this part of town had taken on its present appearance \u2013 a far cry from the jumble of mining activity that had taken place there in the early 19th century. Redruth was making its transition from a market town dominated by mines and industry to a residential centre.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the Cornish mining industry was in decline and Britain was importing most of its copper ore. To find employment, many miners [[Emigration|emigrated]] to the newer mining industries in the Americas, Pachuca, Mexico, [[Australasia]] and South Africa. Cornwall's last fully operational mine, [[South Crofty]] at [[Pool, Cornwall|Pool]] between Redruth and [[Camborne]], closed in March 1998.\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\nThe [[Camborne and Redruth (UK Parliament constituency)|Camborne and Redruth]] [[county constituency|constituency]] was created for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], following a review of parliamentary representation in [[Cornwall]] by the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission for England]], which increased the number of seats in the county from five to six.<ref name=\"BCECornwall\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Cornwall_the_Isles_of_Scilly.doc |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091102212641/http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Cornwall_the_Isles_of_Scilly.doc |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 November 2009 |title=Final recommendations for Parliamentary constituencies in the county of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly |publisher=[[Boundary Commission for England]] |date=9 January 2005 |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}</ref>\nIt is primarily a successor to the former [[Falmouth and Camborne (UK Parliament constituency)|Falmouth and Camborne]] seat.\n\nIn the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]] the results were:\n\n{{Election box begin |title=[[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]]: Camborne and Redruth <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000616 |title=Camborne & Redruth parliamentary constituency |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n  |candidate   = [[George Eustice]]\n  |party       = Conservative Party (UK)\n  |votes       = 26,674\n  |percentage  = 53.1\n  |change      = +5.7\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n |party       = Labour Party (UK)\n |candidate   = Paul Farmer\n |votes       = 18,064\n |percentage  = 35.9\n |change      = -8.3\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n |party       = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n |candidate   = Florence MacDonald\n |votes       = 3,504\n |percentage  = 7.0\n |change      = +0.8\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n  |party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n  |candidate  = Karen La Borde\n  |votes      = 1,359\n  |percentage = 2.7\n  |change     = +0.5\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n  |party      = Liberal Party (UK, 1989)\n  |candidate  = Paul Holmes\n  |votes      = 676\n  |percentage = 1.3\n  |change     = +1.3\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n |votes      = 8,610\n |percentage = 17.2\n |change     = +13.9\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n |winner = Conservative Party (UK)\n |swing = +7.0\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n===Local government===\nRedruth until the late 1800s comprised the Redruth Urban District and [[Redruth Rural District]].

[[William Murdoch]] lived in it from 1782 to 1798. During this time, he worked on local tin and copper mines, erecting engines on behalf of [[Boulton and Watt]].\nHe fitted the house out with [[gas lighting]] from [[coal gas]] \u2013 this was the first house in the world with this type of lighting.\n\nIn the 19th century, the house was used as a tea room, run by a Mrs Knuckey. In 1931 Mr A. Pearce Jenkin, a leading citizen of Redruth purchased the house and gave it as a gift to the [[Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]).<ref>Janet Thomson; ''The Scot Who Lit The World, The Story of William Murdoch Inventor of Gas Lighting''; 2003; {{ISBN|0-9530013-2-6}}</ref>\n\nMurdoch House has since been fully restored and is now regularly used by the Redruth [[Old Cornwall Society]], as well as the Cornish-American Connection and the Redruth Story Group.

Players such as [[Phil Vickery (rugby player)|Phil Vickery]] and [[Rob Thirlby]] have both passed through its ranks though the club's most famous \"son\" must be [[Richard Sharp]] OBE. A resident of Clinton Road with his mother and brother Nigel, he represented Redruth, Cornwall, and England, leading his country to the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations]] title in [[1963 Five Nations Championship|1963]]. Redruth [[association football|soccer club]] has not enjoyed as much success but still thrives in its regular fixtures. On the high street there is a [[Tang Soo Do]] (Korean Karate) and [[Kickboxing]] Academy named ISK Martial Arts. [[Duchy Hockey Club]] are based at Pool Academy on the outskirts of Redruth and compete in the West of England regional leagues.\n\n'''''Performing arts''''' Actress [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], electronic musician [[Luke Vibert]], [[baritone]] [[Benjamin Luxon]], opera singer [[Alan Opie]], record producer and broadcaster Tris Penna, and the co founder of and drummer with [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], were all born here. The writer and comedian [[Rory McGrath]] was born here and educated at the town's secondary school, Cornish artist [[Jonathan Polkest]] studied art at The Redruth School of Art in Clinton Road, The musician [[Aphex Twin]] (and friend of Vibert) grew up near Redruth. Luke Vibert has released an album called ''Chicago, Detroit, Redruth'' and has also recorded under the alias ''Kerrier District''; a reference to name of the district in which Redruth is located. [[Hedluv + Passman]] both grew up in Redruth, and wrote the song \"'druth\" in tribute to the town. The traditional Cornish dance and music group, [[Hevva]] is based in Redruth.\n\n'''''Scholars and philanthropists''''' The historians [[Kenneth Hamilton Jenkin]] and [[Charles Thomas (historian)|Charles Thomas]] were also born in Redruth, and the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] philanthropist [[John Passmore Edwards]] was born in the neighbouring village of Blackwater.\n\n'''''Town centre shopping''''' Key shops and other outlets within the [[town centre]] include a multi-screen [[Cinema (place)|cinema]], a covered [[market (place)|market]] way, the [[Cornish Studies Centre]], an old butter market, various [[antique shop]]s, a second hand [[book shop]] and two supermarkets, plus Greens Newsagents, The Emporium (formerly John Oliver's) which still carries on the tradition of selling music and books (mainly of local historical interest) and antiques, as well as providing other products (gifts, stationery, greeting cards, etc.) and the local cash and carry Jims. Off the main street ([[Fore Street]]), there are two separate specialist shopping areas, Bond Street (to the south of the [[Redruth railway station|railway station]]) and Green Lane to the north.\n\nThe new '''''street landscaping''''' includes wooden seating, with granite furniture, new [[signpost]]s, [[street lights]] and [[litter bin]]s, and two sets of [[bronze]] 'dogs', which were cast from the boots of former tin miners by sculptor David Kemp. The town has a burgundy colour theme, which is in the new [[Public Realm]] regeneration work to highlight the town's name. A project to light various [[public buildings]] around the town with [[LED]] coloured lights has already commenced. Some of the buildings opposite the railway station and the St. Rumon's Gardens have now (April 2008) been completed.\n\n'''''Environment awards''''' On 7 November 2007, Redruth jointly won (with [[Luton]]) the annual UK town centre environment awards, which are run by the BCSC (a retail property consortium).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsc.org.uk/news_art.asp?news_id=319 |publisher=BCSC |title= Environment award details}}</ref> The judges praised the cast bronze 'dogs'<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7083063.stm |publisher=BBC Cornwall |title= Redruth Town Prize | date=7 November 2007 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> and also liked the large amount of work that had been done to the town in terms of landscaping the central area (mainly Fore St & the opeways).\n\n'''''Heartlands visitor park''''' Just outside the town is a European funded visitor attraction, themed on the Robinson Shaft Mine, it offers parking, an adventure play ground for older children and a pleasant restaurant.

The [[Redruth railway station|railway station]] is a [[railhead]] for both [[Helston]] and the [[Lizard, Cornwall|Lizard]], and there are frequent buses connecting the three places. The railway station is served by trains from [[Paddington]], as well as the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the [[Northern England|North]]. Redruth is next to the main [[A30 road]] and thus has access to the main route out of the county as well as routes to the [[Penwith|far West]], [[North Cornwall]], [[South East Cornwall]] and [[Plymouth]]. Another road, the A393, bisects the town in a north-south direction, and links the A30 with the port of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. A third road, the A3047, links Redruth with [[Camborne]], some four miles ({{convert|4|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) to the west.\n\nThe Barncoose by-pass connects between the Redruth Community Hospital and the Barncoose [[Industrial Estate]]. It is intended to reduce [[Heavy Goods Vehicle|HGV]] traffic using the main Camborne road and provide a direct access to the Industrial Estate.

It means Red Ford (literally fordred). The first syllable 'red' means ford. The second 'ruth' means red.\n\n''Rhyd'' is the older form of 'Res', which is a Cornish equivalent to a ford (across a river), a common Celtic word; Old Cornish ''rid''; Welsh ''rhyd'' (Old Welsh ''rit''); Old Breton ''rit'' or ''ret'', Gaulish ''ritu-'', all from Indo-European ''*prtus'' derived word in ''-tu'' from the root *per \" to cross, to go through \"; Proto-Germanic ''*furd\u00faz'' (English ford, German ''Furt''); Latin ''portus'', all related to the Celtic word.<ref>[[Xavier Delamarre]], ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', \u00e9ditions errance 2003, p. 258.</ref> \n\nIt is the ''-ruth'' (and not the ''Red-'' part of the name) which means the colour red.<ref>Redruth & its people \u2013 Michael Tangye \u2013 {{ISBN|0-9501872-1-6}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Native Copper from Huelvor near Redruth, Cornwall.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Native Copper]] mineral specimen from Huelvor near Redruth. Hand-colored copper-plate engraving by [[James Sowerby]], 1807.]]\n[[File:St Uny's Church - geograph.org.uk - 352440.jpg|thumb|St Uny's Church]]\nTraditionally in the [[Penwith (hundred)|Penwith Hundred]], the town has developed away from the original settlement, which was near where the present Churchtown (around [[St. Euny]]'s Church) district of Redruth stands today. This location is a steeply wooded valley, with [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] on one side and the now-called [[Bullers Hill]] on the other. The presence of shallow [[lode]]s of [[tin]] and [[copper]] lying east to west made it an advantageous site for extracting metals, including, tin, [[lead]] and copper. The first settlers stayed by a crossing in the river and started extracting metal ores, and this process turned the colour of the river red.\n\nHistorically, Redruth was a small [[market town]] overshadowed by its neighbours until a boom in the demand for copper [[ore]] during the 18th century. Copper ore had mostly been discarded by the Cornish [[tin]]-mining industry but was now needed to make [[brass]], an essential metal in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Surrounded by copper ore deposits, Redruth quickly became one of the largest and richest mining areas in Britain and the town's population grew markedly, although most miners' families remained poor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn the 1880s and 1890s the town end of Clinton Road gained a number of institutions, notably a [[School of Metalliferous Mining|School of Mines and Art School]] in 1882\u201383, St. Andrew's Church (replacing the chapel in Chapel Street) in 1883 and, opposite, the Free Library, built in 1895. The [[Mining Exchange]] was built in 1880 as a place for the trading of mineral stock. By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria Park had been laid out to commemorate the [[Golden Jubilee]] and this part of town had taken on its present appearance \u2013 a far cry from the jumble of mining activity that had taken place there in the early 19th century. Redruth was making its transition from a market town dominated by mines and industry to a residential centre.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the Cornish mining industry was in decline and Britain was importing most of its copper ore. To find employment, many miners [[Emigration|emigrated]] to the newer mining industries in the Americas, Pachuca, Mexico, [[Australasia]] and South Africa. Cornwall's last fully operational mine, [[South Crofty]] at [[Pool, Cornwall|Pool]] between Redruth and [[Camborne]], closed in March 1998.\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\nThe [[Camborne and Redruth (UK Parliament constituency)|Camborne and Redruth]] [[county constituency|constituency]] was created for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], following a review of parliamentary representation in [[Cornwall]] by the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission for England]], which increased the number of seats in the county from five to six.<ref name=\"BCECornwall\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Cornwall_the_Isles_of_Scilly.doc |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091102212641/http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Cornwall_the_Isles_of_Scilly.doc |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 November 2009 |title=Final recommendations for Parliamentary constituencies in the county of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly |publisher=[[Boundary Commission for England]] |date=9 January 2005 |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}</ref>\nIt is primarily a successor to the former [[Falmouth and Camborne (UK Parliament constituency)|Falmouth and Camborne]] seat.\n\nIn the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]] the results were:\n\n{{Election box begin |title=[[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]]: Camborne and Redruth <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000616 |title=Camborne & Redruth parliamentary constituency |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n  |candidate   = [[George Eustice]]\n  |party       = Conservative Party (UK)\n  |votes       = 26,674\n  |percentage  = 53.1\n  |change      = +5.7\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n |party       = Labour Party (UK)\n |candidate   = Paul Farmer\n |votes       = 18,064\n |percentage  = 35.9\n |change      = -8.3\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n |party       = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n |candidate   = Florence MacDonald\n |votes       = 3,504\n |percentage  = 7.0\n |change      = +0.8\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n  |party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n  |candidate  = Karen La Borde\n  |votes      = 1,359\n  |percentage = 2.7\n  |change     = +0.5\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n  |party      = Liberal Party (UK, 1989)\n  |candidate  = Paul Holmes\n  |votes      = 676\n  |percentage = 1.3\n  |change     = +1.3\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n |votes      = 8,610\n |percentage = 17.2\n |change     = +13.9\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n |winner = Conservative Party (UK)\n |swing = +7.0\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n===Local government===\nRedruth until the late 1800s comprised the Redruth Urban District and [[Redruth Rural District]].

In 1931 Mr A.

Off the main street ([[Fore Street]]), there are two separate specialist shopping areas, Bond Street (to the south of the [[Redruth railway station|railway station]]) and Green Lane to the north.\n\nThe new '''''street landscaping''''' includes wooden seating, with granite furniture, new [[signpost]]s, [[street lights]] and [[litter bin]]s, and two sets of [[bronze]] 'dogs', which were cast from the boots of former tin miners by sculptor David Kemp. The town has a burgundy colour theme, which is in the new [[Public Realm]] regeneration work to highlight the town's name. A project to light various [[public buildings]] around the town with [[LED]] coloured lights has already commenced. Some of the buildings opposite the railway station and the St. Rumon's Gardens have now (April 2008) been completed.\n\n'''''Environment awards''''' On 7 November 2007, Redruth jointly won (with [[Luton]]) the annual UK town centre environment awards, which are run by the BCSC (a retail property consortium).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsc.org.uk/news_art.asp?news_id=319 |publisher=BCSC |title= Environment award details}}</ref> The judges praised the cast bronze 'dogs'<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7083063.stm |publisher=BBC Cornwall |title= Redruth Town Prize | date=7 November 2007 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> and also liked the large amount of work that had been done to the town in terms of landscaping the central area (mainly Fore St & the opeways).\n\n'''''Heartlands visitor park''''' Just outside the town is a European funded visitor attraction, themed on the Robinson Shaft Mine, it offers parking, an adventure play ground for older children and a pleasant restaurant. At times the last working [[Cornish engine|Cornish pumping engine]] can be seen working.<ref>[https://plus.google.com/109520294795188720633/about?hl=en&gl=de Google review]</ref> The museum is an Anchor point on the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erih.net/nc/anchor-points/detail.html?user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bpointer%5D=0&user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bmode%5D=1&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BshowUid%5D=18485&user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bregionalroute%5D=0&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BanchorOnly%5D=1&user_erihobjects_pi2%5BmembersOnly%5D=0|title=ERIH Entry: Heartlands|year=2014|ref=harv|publisher=European Route of Industrial Heritage|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''''Miscellany''''' It is home to Cornwall's first ILR Radio Station, [[Pirate FM]]. On 20 June 2008, the town held its first regular [[Farmers' Market]] in Market Place: the Market will now be held every Friday throughout the year.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Redruth - Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Redruth railway station]]\nRedruth is an important transport hub. The [[Redruth railway station|railway station]] is a [[railhead]] for both [[Helston]] and the [[Lizard, Cornwall|Lizard]], and there are frequent buses connecting the three places. The railway station is served by trains from [[Paddington]], as well as the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the [[Northern England|North]]. Redruth is next to the main [[A30 road]] and thus has access to the main route out of the county as well as routes to the [[Penwith|far West]], [[North Cornwall]], [[South East Cornwall]] and [[Plymouth]]. Another road, the A393, bisects the town in a north-south direction, and links the A30 with the port of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. A third road, the A3047, links Redruth with [[Camborne]], some four miles ({{convert|4|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) to the west.\n\nThe Barncoose by-pass connects between the Redruth Community Hospital and the Barncoose [[Industrial Estate]]. It is intended to reduce [[Heavy Goods Vehicle|HGV]] traffic using the main Camborne road and provide a direct access to the Industrial Estate. It did, however, provoke some controversy, as some residents in Barncoose lost their parking spaces to make way for the new road.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6523417.stm BBC News \u2013 Residents anger]</ref> It was extended further towards Camborne in 2016.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Peter Bayley (scholar of French literature)|Peter Bayley]] (1944\u20132018), scholar of French literature, born and educated in Redruth.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Peter Bayley (1944\u20132018) |journal=French Studies |date=October 2018 |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=649\u2013651 |doi=10.1093/fs/kny221 }}</ref>\n* [[Mick Fleetwood]] (born 1947), drummer and co-founder of the band [[Fleetwood Mac]]<ref name=obit>'Susan Fleetwood; Obituary,' ''[[The Times]]'' (2 October 1995), p. 23</ref>\n* [[Stephen Frost]] (born 1955), actor, writer and comedian{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* [[John Gray (Wisconsin)|John Gray]] (1817\u2013), member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]]<ref>{{cite book |title=The Legislative Manual of the State of Wisconsin |edition=17th |location=Madison, Wis. |year=1878 |page=472 |url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=goto&id=WI.WIBlueBk1878&page=472&isize=L }}</ref>\n* [[Harold Hayman]] (1894\u20131966), Labour MP<ref>\"HAYMAN, Frank Harold (b.
