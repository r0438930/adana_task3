His project, called the ''West Side Improvement'', was twice as expensive as the [[Hoover Dam]] and created the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]], as well as a [[Freedom Tunnel|railroad tunnel]] through the park.

The two stations have never been connected, even after the PRR and New York Central merged as [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] in 1968 and after Amtrak took over intercity rail service in 1971.\n\n[[File:Spuyten Duyvil joint.jpg|thumb|North end of the Empire Connection, joining Metro-North's [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]]]\n\nWhen the [[West Side Yard]] for the [[Long Island Rail Road]] was built on the west side of Manhattan in 1986, a tunnel was built under it connecting Penn Station to the West Side Line just west of [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Eleventh Avenue]], near the [[Javits Center]]. The project severed the southernmost part of the West Side Line, the High Line viaduct, from the rest of the West Side Line.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Air Above Rail Yards Still Free |first=Mary |last=Voboril |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |location=New York |date=March 26, 2005}}</ref> When additional funding later became available, one track along the northern part of the West Side Line was rebuilt for passenger service and named the Empire Connection.

North of 41st Street, the single track expands into two tracks and electrification on the line ends. A [[wye (railroad)|wye]] was constructed next to Track 2 (the westernmost track) to allow diesels to turn around. South of 49th Street, there is a crossover from Track 1 (the easternmost track) to Track 2, and another siding splits off Track 2 at 49th Street.

Besides being more convenient for passengers, many of whom had balked at taking the train to New York City due to the difficulty of transferring between stations, this saved Amtrak the expense of operating two stations in New York City.
