He is the author of some fifty plays, among them ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' (1965), the production of which was instrumental in the abolition of [[Theatre censorship|theatre censorship in the UK]]. Bond is broadly considered one among the major living [[dramatist]]s but he has always been and remains highly controversial because of the violence shown in his plays, the radicalism of his statements about modern theatre and society, and his theories on drama.\n\n==Early life==\nEdward Bond was born on 18 July 1934 into a lower-working-class family in [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], North London. As a child during World War II he was evacuated to the countryside but was present during the [[The Blitz|bombings on London]] in 1940 and 1944. This early exposure to the violence and terror of war probably shaped themes in his work, while his experience of the evacuation gave him an awareness of social alienation which would characterise his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Drama and the Dialectic of Violence\", interview with A.

He later explained that this performance was the first time he had been presented with traumatic experiences comparable to his own in a way he could apprehend and give meaning to.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAt fifteen, he left school with only a very basic education, something from which he derived a deep sense of social exclusion<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> that contributed significantly to his political orientation.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.15</ref> Bond then educated himself, driven by an impressive eagerness for knowledge.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', Londres, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 1979, p.12</ref> After various jobs in factories and offices, he did his national service in the British Army occupation forces in [[History of Vienna#Allied occupation|Vienna]] between 1953 and 1955. During his time in the army he discovered the naked violence hidden behind normal social behaviour, and decided to start writing.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', London, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 1979, p.12</ref>\n\nBack in London, he educated himself in theatre while working, saw everything he could on stage and exercised his skill by writing drama sketches.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', Londres, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 1979, p.13</ref> He was especially impressed by the performances of the [[Berliner Ensemble]] in the summer of 1956. In June 1958, after submitting two plays to the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (''The Fiery Tree'' and ''Klaxon in Atreus' Place'', which Bond keeps unpublished) he was invited to join its newly formed writers' group.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', London, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 1979, p.14</ref><ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.14-22</ref>\n\n==Mid-1960s to mid-1970s: first plays and association with the Royal Court==\n\nAfter three years studying with writers his age but already well-known (like [[John Arden]], [[Arnold Wesker]], and [[Ann Jellicoe]]), Bond had his first real play, ''The Pope's Wedding'', staged as a Sunday night \"performance without d\u00e9cor\" at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in 1962.<ref>[[Malcolm Hay]] & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, [[Eyre Methuen]], Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.23</ref> This is a falsely naturalistic drama (the title refers to \"an impossible ceremony\")<ref>Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.23</ref> set in contemporary [[Essex]] which shows, through a set of tragic circumstances, the death of rural society brought about by modern post-war urban living standards.\n\nBond's next play, ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' (1965) became one of the best known [[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]s in 20th century British theatre history. ''Saved'' delves into the lives of a selection of South London working class youths suppressed \u2013 as Bond would see it \u2013 by a brutal economic system and unable to give their lives meaning, who drift eventually into barbarous mutual violence. Among them, one character, Len, persistently (and successfully) tries to maintain links between people violently tearing each other to pieces.<ref>''Saved'', Student Edition, with Commentary and Notes by David Davis, London, Methuen Drama, 2008</ref> The play shows the social causes of violence and opposes them with individual freedom. This would remain the major theme throughout Bond's work.\n\nThe play was directed by [[William Gaskill]], then artistic director of the Royal Court. The [[Theatres Act 1843]] was still in force and required scripts to be submitted for approval by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. ''Saved'' included a scene featuring the stoning to death of a baby in its pram. The Lord Chamberlain sought to censor it, but Bond refused to alter a word, claiming that removing this pivotal scene would alter the meaning of the play.<ref>''Selections from Edward Bond's Notebooks'', edited by Ian Stuart, vol.1, London, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 2000, p.87</ref> He was firmly backed by Gaskill and the Royal Court although threatened with serious trouble. Formation of a theatre club normally allowed plays that had been banned for their language or subject matter to be performed under \"club\" conditions \u2013 such as that at the [[Comedy Theatre]], however the [[English Stage Society]] were prosecuted. An active campaign sought to overturn the prosecution, with a passionate defence presented by [[Laurence Olivier]], then Artistic Director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]. The court found the English Stage Society guilty and they were given a [[conditional discharge]].<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.39-42</ref><ref>David Davis: \"Commentary\" in E.

This portrays a [[lesbian]] relationship between [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Florence Nightingale]], the royal Princes as [[Siamese twins]], [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Disraeli]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] plotting a coup and the whole dramatis personae damned to a cannibalistic Heaven after falling off [[Beachy Head]]. The Royal Court produced the play despite the imposition of a total ban and within a year the law was finally repealed.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.65-69</ref> In 1969, when the Royal Court was finally able to perform Bond's work legally, it put on and toured the three plays in Europe, winning the [[Belgrade International Theatre Festival]] prize.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.103</ref> The experience of prosecution and mutual support sealed a link between Bond and the Royal Court where all his plays (except external commissions) would be premiered until 1976, most directed by Gaskill.\n\nWhile Bond's work remained banned for performance in Britain, ''Saved'' became the greatest international success of its time with more than thirty different productions around the world between 1966 and 1969, often by notorious directors such as [[Peter Stein]] in Germany or [[Claude R\u00e9gy]] in France.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts (ed.): ''Bond a Companion to the Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, 1978, p.37-40</ref> At that time, the play was controversial everywhere but is now considered as a 20th-century classic.\n\nAfter a few commissioned works (the British Empire satire ''[[Narrow Road to the Deep North]]'' (1968) for the Coventry People and City Festival, two [[agit-prop]] plays for festival performances, ''Black Mass'' (1970) to commemorate the [[Sharpeville Massacre]] and ''Passion'' (1971) for the [[CND]] Easter Festival), Bond composed his new major work, ''[[Lear (play)|Lear]]'', based on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]''. The play follows the decay of an aging tyrannical king. Betrayed by his two cynical daughters; hounded as a political risk following military defeat; pursued by the ghost of a man whose life he has destroyed and whose death he has caused; imprisoned and tortured until enucleated; after a life of violence he finally finds wisdom and peace in a radical opposition to power. The end of the play shows him as a forced labourer in a camp setting an example for future rebellion by sabotaging the wall he once built, which subsequent regimes keep perpetuating.<ref>''Lear'', Student Edition, with Commentary and Notes by Patricia Hern, Londres, Methuen Drama, 1983</ref>\n\nIn 1974 Bond translated ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'' (1891) by the German playwright [[Frank Wedekind]], about the suppression of adolescent sexuality. The play had always been censored or presented with major cuts since its writing, and Bond's was the first translation to restore Wedekind's original text, including its most controversial scenes.\n\nThe subdued Edwardian-set comedy ''[[The Sea (play)|The Sea]]'' (1973) shows a seaside community on England's East Coast a few years before World War I, dominated by a dictatorial lady and overwhelmed by the drowning of one of its young citizens. Nurtured by his experience as a child evacuee to the seaside, the play is (rightly) subtitled \"a comedy\" and was intended as optimistic after the gloomy mood of his previous plays.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts (ed.): ''Bond a Companion to the Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, 1978</ref><ref>Philip Roberts (ed.): ''Bond on File'', London, Methuen, 1985, p.55-56</ref> This is encapsulated by the successful escape of a young and promising couple from this narrow and oppressive society. This play would be the last plays of Bond's directed by Gaskill.\n\nBond then produced two pieces exploring the place of the artist in society. ''[[Bingo (play)|Bingo]]'' (1974) portrayed the retired [[Shakespeare]] as an exploitative landlord, an impotent yet compassionate witness of social violence, who eventually commits suicide, repeatedly asking himself \"Was anything done?\". ''[[The Fool (Edward Bond play)|The Fool]]'' (1975) reinterprets the life of the rural 19th century poet [[John Clare]]. It involves Clare in the [[Ely and Littleport riots 1816|Littleport Riots]] of 1816, and then makes his own poetry the depository of the spirit of this rural rebellion against the growth of modern industrial capitalism. The failure of this historical class war eventually drives him to a madhouse. In 1976 ''Bingo'' won the [[Obie award]] as Best Off-Broadway play and ''The Fool'' was voted best play of the year by ''Plays and Players''.\n\n==From the 1970s to the mid-1980s: broaden scope of practice and political experiments==\n\nBond remained a successful playwright in England all through the 1970s, expanding his range of writing and his collaborations. His plays were requested by institutional and community theatres, for premieres and revivals, and he was commissioned to write plays both by renowned institutions and fringe activist companies. For example, in 1976 he wrote, on one hand ''Stone'' and ''A-A-America'' (pronounced as a sneeze), two [[agit-prop]]-style plays, respectively for Gay Sweatshop and the [[Almost Free Theatre]] and, on the other, an adaptation of [[John Webster|Webster]]'s ''[[The White Devil]]'' for [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] to re-open the [[Old Vic]] and a libretto for the German composer [[Hans Werner Henze]] to open at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]]: ''[[We Come to the River]]''. (In 1982 the pair collaborated again, less successfully on another opera, ''[[The English Cat]]'').\n\nHowever, Bond's working relationship with the Royal Court progressively slackened, and by the mid-1970s he had found a new partner in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC)]]. Beginning with ''Bingo'' in 1976, the RSC revived and toured his plays regularly until the early 1990s, and Bond, though often disagreeing with the aesthetic choices of its productions <ref name=\"David Hirst 1985, p.132\">David Hirst : ''Edward Bond'', New York, [[Grove Press]], Modern Dramatists, 1985, p.132</ref> or protesting at not being consulted sufficiently, recognized the genuine support the company gave to his work.<ref>Bond: Letter to A. Noble, 24 September 1988, ''Letters'' I, Luxembourg, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994, p.135</ref> In 1977 the RSC commissioned a new play for the opening of their new London theatre, the [[Donmar Warehouse|Warehouse]], which would be ''The Bundle''. Set in an imaginary [[history of Japan|medieval Japan]] and based on an anecdote from the classical Japanese poet [[Bash\u014d]],<ref>Bash\u014d: ''Narrow Road to the Interior'' (''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'') 1689</ref> the play shows an eventually successful revolution whose leader nevertheless constantly faces the human cost of political change and experiences as futile an ideology of compassion, being (in Bond's view) politically counterproductive and supportive of reactionary violence.\n\nBond assigned the same political concern to his next play, ''The Woman'', set in a fantasy [[Trojan War]] and based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Trojan Women]]''. Comparable to ''[[Lear (play)|Lear]]'', it shows the fight of the decayed Trojan queen, [[Hecuba]], against the [[Delian League|Athenian empire]], succeeding only when she abandons the aristocracy and the interests of the state to physically meet the proletariat and join the people's cause.\n\nIn 1977, Bond accepted an honorary [[doctorate in letters]] by [[Yale University]] (although, thirty years previously, he had not been allowed to sit for his [[eleven-plus]] examination) and he began to take up students workshops in Newcastle, Durham and Birmingham, for which he wrote several plays. The most accomplished among them was ''The Worlds'',  written for the [[Newcastle University]] Theatre Society, based on the recent events in the UK, both the [[Northern Ireland conflict]] and the social crisis of the [[winter of Discontent]].\n\nHis early 1980s plays were directly influenced by the coming to power of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the profound social changes they were bringing about. ''Restoration'', as a half-musical parody of [[Restoration comedies]], deals with working class support for the [[Tories]] by showing a servant accepting his conviction and eventual execution for a murder committed by his cynical and silly master. ''Summer'' deals with the moral ambiguities of capitalism through the conflict of two women in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|socialist Yugoslavia]]. One is the daughter of former landlords, whose compassionate nature does not prevent them from being exploiters and collaborationists during the [[German occupation of Yugoslavia|German occupation]]. The other, the daughter of servants, rejects the values of the former, whom she once saved from a firing squad. ''Derek'', written for a youth festival, alludes directly to the [[Falklands war]] and shows an idiotic aristocrat stealing the brain of a gifted worker and sending him to die in a war in a country that \"sounds like the name of a disease\".\n\n==Controversial directing attempts and quarrels with the institutions==\nDuring the late 1970s, Bond felt he needed practical contact with the stage to experiment with his ideas on drama and improve his writing.<ref name=\"Malcolm Hay 1980, p.240-244\">Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.240-244</ref> He therefore began directing his own plays and progressively he made this a condition of their first production. After staging ''Lear'' in German at the [[Burgtheater]], in Vienna in 1973, Bond directed his last four plays in London between 1978 and 1982: ''The Worlds'' and ''Restoration'' at the Royal Court and ''The Woman'' and ''Summer'' at the National Theatre.<ref>see Ian Stuart: Politics in Performance, the Production Work of Edward Bond, 1978 1990, New-York, Peter Lang Publishing, 1996</ref> These latter two introduced the South African actress [[Yvonne Bryceland]], whom Bond admired, considering her the ideal female interpreter.<ref>see Bond's obituary for ''The Guardian'': \"A Power to Hold the Stage, Yvonne Bryceland: An Appreciation\" 17 January 1992, in ''Letters'' III, Amsterdam, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994,pp.28\u201330</ref>\n\n''The Woman'' was the first contemporary play performed in the recently opened [[Royal National Theatre#Architecture|Olivier auditorium]] and, though poorly reviewed, the production was acclaimed as an aesthetic success, especially for its innovative use of the huge [[open stage]].<ref name=\"Malcolm Hay 1980, p.240-244\"/><ref>Ian Stuart: \"Edward Bond on the English Stages in 1991\u201392 in New Theatre Quarterly 1992\"</ref><ref>P. Hall: ''Diaries, The Story of a Dramatic Battle'', London, [[Hamish Hamilton]], 1983, see: July\u2013August 1978</ref> However, Bond's working relationships as a director with both the National Theatre and the Royal Court were highly conflicted. The theatres and their actors accused him of being authoritarian and abstract in his direction<ref name=\"David Hirst 1985, p.132\"/> and unrealistic in his production requirements, and Bond complained undiplomatically about their lack of artistic engagement<ref>Bond : ''Commentary on The War Plays'', in ''Plays'' 6, London, Methuen, p.316, p.318, p.324</ref><ref>Bond: Letters to T.

Arendt: \"Massey reveals her acting nightmare\" in ''The Guardian'' 9 May 2006</ref> He felt that British theatre had no understanding of his intention to revitalise modern drama and could no longer fulfil his artistic demands.\n\nWith his notoriously uncompromising attitude, Bond gained the reputation of a \"difficult author\", which contributed to keeping him away from the major English stages. During the mid-1980s, [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]] at the National Theatre repeatedly refused to allow him to direct his new play ''Human Cannon'', written for Yvonne Bryceland and the wide stage of the Olivier.<ref>Letter to T. Hands, 10 January 1986, to Yvonne Bryceland 17 December 1986, to B. Alexander, 6 January 1988, in ''Letters'' II, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1996, p.88-90, p.58 & p.68</ref> In 1985, he attempted to direct his ''War Plays'' at the RSC, accepting very bad working conditions, but left the rehearsals before the premiere after disastrous sessions, and then violently criticized the production and the theatre.<ref>see Ian Stuart: ''Politics in Performance, the Production Work of Edward Bond'', 1978 1990, New-York, Peter Lang Publishing, 1996, p.142 sqq</ref><ref>Bond: Letters to T.

Jansen, 3 October 1989, in ''Letters'' I, Luxembourg, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994, p.143</ref> He then decided not to allow his plays to be premiered in London by institutional theatres without proper working conditions. He only agreed to return to the RSC in 1996 when he directed ''In the Company of Men'', but considered this production a failure. He nevertheless regularly accepted revivals and sometimes got involved in these productions, although remaining generally unsatisfied,<ref>Letter to D. Jansen, 3 October 1989, in ''Letters'' I, Luxembourg, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994, p.143</ref> and he directed workshops for RSC actors with [[Cicely Berry]].<ref>\"A Political Language for The Theatre: Edward Bond and the Royal Shakespeare Company\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'' 1994</ref> Except for two plays written for the BBC in the early 1990s (''Olly's Prison'' and ''Tuesday''), Bond continued writing plays in the knowledge that they would not be staged in Britain except by amateur companies.\n\nThese conflicts are still highly controversial, and Bond and those with whom he has clashed continue to settle scores in letters, books and interviews.<ref>see: [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/03/theatre \"If you\u2019re going to despair, stop writing\", interview with M.

Motivated by the threats of the last years of the [[Second Cold War|Cold War]] and the [[CND#The second wave 1980-89|political activism]] it provoked in Britain and Europe, Bond had planned to write about [[Nuclear warfare#The 1980s|nuclear war]] since the early 1980s. He found a means to do so after testing a storyline with Sicilian students in [[Palermo]]. To point to the barbarity of a society which planned to kill the enemy's children to protect their own (that being how he saw the logic of [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrence]]), he suggested an improvisation in which a soldier was ordered to kill a child of his community to curb mass starvation. According to Bond, each student who improvised as the soldier refused to kill a foreign child and paradoxically returned home to kill their own sibling instead.<ref>Bond : ''Commentary on The War Plays'', in ''Plays'' 6, London, Methuen, p.247</ref> He saw in this a deeply rooted force in the individual preserving an innate sense of justice that he theorized as 'Radical Innocence'.<ref>Bond : ''Commentary on The War Plays'', in ''Plays'' 6, London, Methuen, p.250 sqq.</ref> Subsequently, he built on this concept a comprehensive theory of drama in its anthropological and social role that he intended to go beyond [[Brecht]]'s theories on political drama.<ref>see Bond : ''The Hidden Plot, Notes on Theatre and the State'', London, Methuen, 2000</ref> This discovery also gave him the key to write on nuclear war, not to just to condemn the atrocity of war in a general way but, from a political perspective, questioning public acceptance of it and collaboration with it by ordinary citizens.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985 he wrote three plays to meet various requests, which he united as ''The War Plays''. The first, ''Red Black and Ignorant'' (written for a Festival dedicated to [[George Orwell]]), is a short agit-prop play in which a child, aborted and burnt to death in the nuclear global bombings, comes from the future to accuse the society of the audience of his murder. The second, ''The Tin Can People'' (written for a young activists' company), denounces capitalist society's ideology of death. It shows a community of survivors living on an infinite supply of canned food running berserk when they feel threatened by a stranger and destroying all they have as in a reduced nuclear war. The third, ''Great Peace'' (written for the RSC) re-enacts the Palermo improvisation in a city barely surviving in the aftermath of nuclear bombardment. It focuses on a soldier who kills his baby sister and his mother who tries to kill her neighbour's child to save her own. The play then follows her twenty years later, in the sterile global wilderness that nuclear war has made of the world, where she rebuilds her humanity bit by bit by meeting other survivors.\n\nThese desperate efforts to stay human or be human anew in an inhuman situation would be the purpose of most of the characters in Bond's subsequent plays, the scope of which will be to explore the limits and possibilities of humanity. His next play, ''Jackets'', again uses the Palermo improvisation and sets up a confrontation between two young men manipulated by military conspiracies, first in medieval Japan, then in contemporary urban riots. ''In the Company of Men'' shows a desperate fight by the adoptive son of an armaments factory manager to be who he is in a cynical, intrigue-ridden neo-liberal business world that Bond considers the mirror of our post-modern times. In ''Olly's Prison'', a man who has killed his daughter and forgotten his crime tries to find meaning in his life. In ''Tuesday'', a young deserter tries to tell the truth about the war but is destroyed by society. More innovative in structure, ''Coffee'' exposes the cultural roots of violence. It contrasts an initial, imaginary section resembling a gloomy fairy tale, in which a mother kills her child because she can no longer feed her, with a second, realistic part reproducing the historical [[Babi Yar]] massacre, where the same characters are among the victims. As in the Palermo improvisation, a soldier realises he cannot shoot the victims any more, and eventually decides instead to shoot his officer and escape with the girl.\n\n==Recent years==\n\nFrom 1997 to 2008, Bond's plays explored in depth a gloomy vision of a future society (in 2077) where the potential menaces of social breakdown and bio-political control have become real and structural.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The first in this cycle, ''The Crime of the 21st Century'', shows a few outcasts who have fled the over-controlled cities to hide in a no-man's-land where they try in vain to rebuild their humanity by creating a semblance of community. ''Have I None'', ''Chair'' and ''The Under Room'' show the monotonous life of the cities, where social relationships and memory have been abolished, consumption and possession standardized, and where people are harassed by the resistance of their imagination and panicked by strangers. ''Born'' and ''Innocence'' follow the actions of militarized policemen, the 'Wapos', who perpetrate atrocities on reluctant civilians during mass deportations, but some of whom try to find a human dimension to their lives and desperately attempt to escape the alienated and criminal conditions they are trapped in.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThough isolated from the institutional British theatres, Bond found two new partners in the mid-90s who would keep alive his impulse for writing. One was the [[Birmingham]]-based theatre-in-education company Big Brum, of which he remains an associate artist. From 1995 to 2009 he wrote seven very different plays dedicated to young audiences for this company: ''At the Inland Sea'' (1995), in which a youth confronts the legacy of the holocaust; ''Eleven Vests'' (1997), on scholastic and military [[authoritarianism]]; ''Have I None'' (2000), ''The Balancing Act'' (2003), ''The Under Room'' (2005) ''Tune'' (2007) and ''A Window'' (2009). Big Brum appears to be the only professional company in England for more than two decades that Bond is openly writing for and allowing to premiere his plays. This collaboration has brought Bond's theories on drama to broader attention in England, where they are now relayed by the National Association for Teaching of Drama.

Among recent productions are revivals of ''[[Lear (play)|Lear]]'' at the [[Crucible Theatre]] [[Sheffield]] featuring [[Ian McDiarmid]] and ''Restoration'' with added songs, toured in early 2006 by the [[Headlong (theatre company)|Oxford Stage Company]]. During the autumn of 2010 [[The Cock Tavern Theatre]] in London produced six of his plays simultaneously  (one chosen from each decade), including a new one, provisionally entitled ''There Will Be More'', commissioned for this occasion and performed although unfinished.

He is the author of some fifty plays, among them ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' (1965), the production of which was instrumental in the abolition of [[Theatre censorship|theatre censorship in the UK]]. Bond is broadly considered one among the major living [[dramatist]]s but he has always been and remains highly controversial because of the violence shown in his plays, the radicalism of his statements about modern theatre and society, and his theories on drama.\n\n==Early life==\nEdward Bond was born on 18 July 1934 into a lower-working-class family in [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], North London. As a child during World War II he was evacuated to the countryside but was present during the [[The Blitz|bombings on London]] in 1940 and 1944. This early exposure to the violence and terror of war probably shaped themes in his work, while his experience of the evacuation gave him an awareness of social alienation which would characterise his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Drama and the Dialectic of Violence\", interview with A. Arnold in: ''Theatre Quarterly'', vol.2, n\u00b05, Cambridge, 1972</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">\"Something of Myself\" in David Davis (ed.) : ''Edward Bond and the Dramatic Child, Edward Bond's Plays for Young People'', London, Trentham Books, 2005</ref>\n\nHis first contact with theatre was music-hall, where his sister used to be sawn in two in a conjuror's sideshow.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', Londres, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 19792, p.13</ref> At fourteen, with his class he saw a performance of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[Donald Wolfit]] which was revelatory. He later explained that this performance was the first time he had been presented with traumatic experiences comparable to his own in a way he could apprehend and give meaning to.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAt fifteen, he left school with only a very basic education, something from which he derived a deep sense of social exclusion<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> that contributed significantly to his political orientation.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.15</ref> Bond then educated himself, driven by an impressive eagerness for knowledge.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', Londres, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 1979, p.12</ref> After various jobs in factories and offices, he did his national service in the British Army occupation forces in [[History of Vienna#Allied occupation|Vienna]] between 1953 and 1955. During his time in the army he discovered the naked violence hidden behind normal social behaviour, and decided to start writing.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', London, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 1979, p.12</ref>\n\nBack in London, he educated himself in theatre while working, saw everything he could on stage and exercised his skill by writing drama sketches.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', Londres, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 1979, p.13</ref> He was especially impressed by the performances of the [[Berliner Ensemble]] in the summer of 1956. In June 1958, after submitting two plays to the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (''The Fiery Tree'' and ''Klaxon in Atreus' Place'', which Bond keeps unpublished) he was invited to join its newly formed writers' group.<ref>Tony Coult: ''The Plays of Edward Bond'', London, Eyre Methuen Theatre File, 1979, p.14</ref><ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.14-22</ref>\n\n==Mid-1960s to mid-1970s: first plays and association with the Royal Court==\n\nAfter three years studying with writers his age but already well-known (like [[John Arden]], [[Arnold Wesker]], and [[Ann Jellicoe]]), Bond had his first real play, ''The Pope's Wedding'', staged as a Sunday night \"performance without d\u00e9cor\" at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in 1962.<ref>[[Malcolm Hay]] & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, [[Eyre Methuen]], Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.23</ref> This is a falsely naturalistic drama (the title refers to \"an impossible ceremony\")<ref>Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.23</ref> set in contemporary [[Essex]] which shows, through a set of tragic circumstances, the death of rural society brought about by modern post-war urban living standards.\n\nBond's next play, ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' (1965) became one of the best known [[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]s in 20th century British theatre history. ''Saved'' delves into the lives of a selection of South London working class youths suppressed \u2013 as Bond would see it \u2013 by a brutal economic system and unable to give their lives meaning, who drift eventually into barbarous mutual violence. Among them, one character, Len, persistently (and successfully) tries to maintain links between people violently tearing each other to pieces.<ref>''Saved'', Student Edition, with Commentary and Notes by David Davis, London, Methuen Drama, 2008</ref> The play shows the social causes of violence and opposes them with individual freedom. This would remain the major theme throughout Bond's work.\n\nThe play was directed by [[William Gaskill]], then artistic director of the Royal Court. The [[Theatres Act 1843]] was still in force and required scripts to be submitted for approval by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. ''Saved'' included a scene featuring the stoning to death of a baby in its pram. The Lord Chamberlain sought to censor it, but Bond refused to alter a word, claiming that removing this pivotal scene would alter the meaning of the play.<ref>''Selections from Edward Bond's Notebooks'', edited by Ian Stuart, vol.1, London, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 2000, p.87</ref> He was firmly backed by Gaskill and the Royal Court although threatened with serious trouble. Formation of a theatre club normally allowed plays that had been banned for their language or subject matter to be performed under \"club\" conditions \u2013 such as that at the [[Comedy Theatre]], however the [[English Stage Society]] were prosecuted. An active campaign sought to overturn the prosecution, with a passionate defence presented by [[Laurence Olivier]], then Artistic Director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]. The court found the English Stage Society guilty and they were given a [[conditional discharge]].<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.39-42</ref><ref>David Davis: \"Commentary\" in E. Bond: ''Saved'' Student Editions, Methuen, 2008, p.lii</ref><ref>Samantha Ellis: \"Edward Bond, Saved, Novembre 1965\", \"Curtain Up\" n\u00b07, in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 Avril, 2003 https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/apr/23/theatre.samanthaellis</ref>\n\nBond and the Royal Court continued to defy the censor, and in 1967 produced a new play, the surreal ''[[Early Morning (play)|Early Morning]]''. This portrays a [[lesbian]] relationship between [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Florence Nightingale]], the royal Princes as [[Siamese twins]], [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Disraeli]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] plotting a coup and the whole dramatis personae damned to a cannibalistic Heaven after falling off [[Beachy Head]]. The Royal Court produced the play despite the imposition of a total ban and within a year the law was finally repealed.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.65-69</ref> In 1969, when the Royal Court was finally able to perform Bond's work legally, it put on and toured the three plays in Europe, winning the [[Belgrade International Theatre Festival]] prize.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.103</ref> The experience of prosecution and mutual support sealed a link between Bond and the Royal Court where all his plays (except external commissions) would be premiered until 1976, most directed by Gaskill.\n\nWhile Bond's work remained banned for performance in Britain, ''Saved'' became the greatest international success of its time with more than thirty different productions around the world between 1966 and 1969, often by notorious directors such as [[Peter Stein]] in Germany or [[Claude R\u00e9gy]] in France.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts (ed.): ''Bond a Companion to the Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, 1978, p.37-40</ref> At that time, the play was controversial everywhere but is now considered as a 20th-century classic.\n\nAfter a few commissioned works (the British Empire satire ''[[Narrow Road to the Deep North]]'' (1968) for the Coventry People and City Festival, two [[agit-prop]] plays for festival performances, ''Black Mass'' (1970) to commemorate the [[Sharpeville Massacre]] and ''Passion'' (1971) for the [[CND]] Easter Festival), Bond composed his new major work, ''[[Lear (play)|Lear]]'', based on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]''. The play follows the decay of an aging tyrannical king. Betrayed by his two cynical daughters; hounded as a political risk following military defeat; pursued by the ghost of a man whose life he has destroyed and whose death he has caused; imprisoned and tortured until enucleated; after a life of violence he finally finds wisdom and peace in a radical opposition to power. The end of the play shows him as a forced labourer in a camp setting an example for future rebellion by sabotaging the wall he once built, which subsequent regimes keep perpetuating.<ref>''Lear'', Student Edition, with Commentary and Notes by Patricia Hern, Londres, Methuen Drama, 1983</ref>\n\nIn 1974 Bond translated ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'' (1891) by the German playwright [[Frank Wedekind]], about the suppression of adolescent sexuality. The play had always been censored or presented with major cuts since its writing, and Bond's was the first translation to restore Wedekind's original text, including its most controversial scenes.\n\nThe subdued Edwardian-set comedy ''[[The Sea (play)|The Sea]]'' (1973) shows a seaside community on England's East Coast a few years before World War I, dominated by a dictatorial lady and overwhelmed by the drowning of one of its young citizens. Nurtured by his experience as a child evacuee to the seaside, the play is (rightly) subtitled \"a comedy\" and was intended as optimistic after the gloomy mood of his previous plays.<ref>Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts (ed.): ''Bond a Companion to the Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, 1978</ref><ref>Philip Roberts (ed.): ''Bond on File'', London, Methuen, 1985, p.55-56</ref> This is encapsulated by the successful escape of a young and promising couple from this narrow and oppressive society. This play would be the last plays of Bond's directed by Gaskill.\n\nBond then produced two pieces exploring the place of the artist in society. ''[[Bingo (play)|Bingo]]'' (1974) portrayed the retired [[Shakespeare]] as an exploitative landlord, an impotent yet compassionate witness of social violence, who eventually commits suicide, repeatedly asking himself \"Was anything done?\". ''[[The Fool (Edward Bond play)|The Fool]]'' (1975) reinterprets the life of the rural 19th century poet [[John Clare]]. It involves Clare in the [[Ely and Littleport riots 1816|Littleport Riots]] of 1816, and then makes his own poetry the depository of the spirit of this rural rebellion against the growth of modern industrial capitalism. The failure of this historical class war eventually drives him to a madhouse. In 1976 ''Bingo'' won the [[Obie award]] as Best Off-Broadway play and ''The Fool'' was voted best play of the year by ''Plays and Players''.\n\n==From the 1970s to the mid-1980s: broaden scope of practice and political experiments==\n\nBond remained a successful playwright in England all through the 1970s, expanding his range of writing and his collaborations. His plays were requested by institutional and community theatres, for premieres and revivals, and he was commissioned to write plays both by renowned institutions and fringe activist companies. For example, in 1976 he wrote, on one hand ''Stone'' and ''A-A-America'' (pronounced as a sneeze), two [[agit-prop]]-style plays, respectively for Gay Sweatshop and the [[Almost Free Theatre]] and, on the other, an adaptation of [[John Webster|Webster]]'s ''[[The White Devil]]'' for [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] to re-open the [[Old Vic]] and a libretto for the German composer [[Hans Werner Henze]] to open at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]]: ''[[We Come to the River]]''. (In 1982 the pair collaborated again, less successfully on another opera, ''[[The English Cat]]'').\n\nHowever, Bond's working relationship with the Royal Court progressively slackened, and by the mid-1970s he had found a new partner in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC)]]. Beginning with ''Bingo'' in 1976, the RSC revived and toured his plays regularly until the early 1990s, and Bond, though often disagreeing with the aesthetic choices of its productions <ref name=\"David Hirst 1985, p.132\">David Hirst : ''Edward Bond'', New York, [[Grove Press]], Modern Dramatists, 1985, p.132</ref> or protesting at not being consulted sufficiently, recognized the genuine support the company gave to his work.<ref>Bond: Letter to A. Noble, 24 September 1988, ''Letters'' I, Luxembourg, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994, p.135</ref> In 1977 the RSC commissioned a new play for the opening of their new London theatre, the [[Warehouse]], which would be ''The Bundle''. Set in an imaginary [[history of Japan|medieval Japan]] and based on an anecdote from the classical Japanese poet [[Bash\u014d]],<ref>Bash\u014d: ''Narrow Road to the Interior'' (''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'') 1689</ref> the play shows an eventually successful revolution whose leader nevertheless constantly faces the human cost of political change and experiences as futile an ideology of compassion, being (in Bond's view) politically counterproductive and supportive of reactionary violence.\n\nBond assigned the same political concern to his next play, ''The Woman'', set in a fantasy [[Trojan War]] and based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Trojan Women]]''. Comparable to ''[[Lear (play)|Lear]]'', it shows the fight of the decayed Trojan queen, [[Hecuba]], against the [[Delian League|Athenian empire]], succeeding only when she abandons the aristocracy and the interests of the state to physically meet the proletariat and join the people's cause.\n\nIn 1977, Bond accepted an honorary [[doctorate in letters]] by [[Yale University]] (although, thirty years previously, he had not been allowed to sit for his [[eleven-plus]] examination) and he began to take up students workshops in Newcastle, Durham and Birmingham, for which he wrote several plays. The most accomplished among them was ''The Worlds'',  written for the [[Newcastle University]] Theatre Society, based on the recent events in the UK, both the [[Northern Ireland conflict]] and the social crisis of the [[winter of Discontent]].\n\nHis early 1980s plays were directly influenced by the coming to power of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the profound social changes they were bringing about. ''Restoration'', as a half-musical parody of [[Restoration comedies]], deals with working class support for the [[Tories]] by showing a servant accepting his conviction and eventual execution for a murder committed by his cynical and silly master. ''Summer'' deals with the moral ambiguities of capitalism through the conflict of two women in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|socialist Yugoslavia]]. One is the daughter of former landlords, whose compassionate nature does not prevent them from being exploiters and collaborationists during the [[German occupation of Yugoslavia|German occupation]]. The other, the daughter of servants, rejects the values of the former, whom she once saved from a firing squad. ''Derek'', written for a youth festival, alludes directly to the [[Falklands war]] and shows an idiotic aristocrat stealing the brain of a gifted worker and sending him to die in a war in a country that \"sounds like the name of a disease\".\n\n==Controversial directing attempts and quarrels with the institutions==\nDuring the late 1970s, Bond felt he needed practical contact with the stage to experiment with his ideas on drama and improve his writing.<ref name=\"Malcolm Hay 1980, p.240-244\">Malcolm Hay & Philip Roberts: ''Bond a Study of his Plays'', London, Eyre Methuen, Modern Theatre Series, 1980, p.240-244</ref> He therefore began directing his own plays and progressively he made this a condition of their first production. After staging ''Lear'' in German at the [[Burgtheater]], in Vienna in 1973, Bond directed his last four plays in London between 1978 and 1982: ''The Worlds'' and ''Restoration'' at the Royal Court and ''The Woman'' and ''Summer'' at the National Theatre.<ref>see Ian Stuart: Politics in Performance, the Production Work of Edward Bond, 1978 1990, New-York, Peter Lang Publishing, 1996</ref> These latter two introduced the South African actress [[Yvonne Bryceland]], whom Bond admired, considering her the ideal female interpreter.<ref>see Bond's obituary for ''The Guardian'': \"A Power to Hold the Stage, Yvonne Bryceland: An Appreciation\" 17 January 1992, in ''Letters'' III, Amsterdam, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994,pp.28\u201330</ref>\n\n''The Woman'' was the first contemporary play performed in the recently opened [[Royal National Theatre#Architecture|Olivier auditorium]] and, though poorly reviewed, the production was acclaimed as an aesthetic success, especially for its innovative use of the huge [[open stage]].<ref name=\"Malcolm Hay 1980, p.240-244\"/><ref>Ian Stuart: \"Edward Bond on the English Stages in 1991\u201392 in New Theatre Quarterly 1992\"</ref><ref>P. Hall: ''Diaries, The Story of a Dramatic Battle'', London, [[Hamish Hamilton]], 1983, see: July\u2013August 1978</ref> However, Bond's working relationships as a director with both the National Theatre and the Royal Court were highly conflicted. The theatres and their actors accused him of being authoritarian and abstract in his direction<ref name=\"David Hirst 1985, p.132\"/> and unrealistic in his production requirements, and Bond complained undiplomatically about their lack of artistic engagement<ref>Bond : ''Commentary on The War Plays'', in ''Plays'' 6, London, Methuen, p.316, p.318, p.324</ref><ref>Bond: Letters to T. Hands, 4 December 1985, in ''Letters'' II, Luxembourg, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1995, p.89-90 ; to M.

Jansen, 3 October 1989, in ''Letters'' I, Luxembourg, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994, p.143</ref> and had crude rows both with some reluctant actors and theatre managers.<ref>P.

Arendt: \"Massey reveals her acting nightmare\" in ''The Guardian'' 9 May 2006</ref> He felt that British theatre had no understanding of his intention to revitalise modern drama and could no longer fulfil his artistic demands.\n\nWith his notoriously uncompromising attitude, Bond gained the reputation of a \"difficult author\", which contributed to keeping him away from the major English stages. During the mid-1980s, [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]] at the National Theatre repeatedly refused to allow him to direct his new play ''Human Cannon'', written for Yvonne Bryceland and the wide stage of the Olivier.<ref>Letter to T. Hands, 10 January 1986, to Yvonne Bryceland 17 December 1986, to B. Alexander, 6 January 1988, in ''Letters'' II, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1996, p.88-90, p.58 & p.68</ref> In 1985, he attempted to direct his ''War Plays'' at the RSC, accepting very bad working conditions, but left the rehearsals before the premiere after disastrous sessions, and then violently criticized the production and the theatre.<ref>see Ian Stuart: ''Politics in Performance, the Production Work of Edward Bond'', 1978 1990, New-York, Peter Lang Publishing, 1996, p.142 sqq</ref><ref>Bond: Letters to T.

Jansen, 3 October 1989, in ''Letters'' I, Luxembourg, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994, p.143</ref> He then decided not to allow his plays to be premiered in London by institutional theatres without proper working conditions. He only agreed to return to the RSC in 1996 when he directed ''In the Company of Men'', but considered this production a failure. He nevertheless regularly accepted revivals and sometimes got involved in these productions, although remaining generally unsatisfied,<ref>Letter to D. Jansen, 3 October 1989, in ''Letters'' I, Luxembourg, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1994, p.143</ref> and he directed workshops for RSC actors with [[Cicely Berry]].<ref>\"A Political Language for The Theatre: Edward Bond and the Royal Shakespeare Company\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'' 1994</ref> Except for two plays written for the BBC in the early 1990s (''Olly's Prison'' and ''Tuesday''), Bond continued writing plays in the knowledge that they would not be staged in Britain except by amateur companies.\n\nThese conflicts are still highly controversial, and Bond and those with whom he has clashed continue to settle scores in letters, books and interviews.<ref>see: [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/03/theatre \"If you\u2019re going to despair, stop writing\", interview with M.

Motivated by the threats of the last years of the [[Second Cold War|Cold War]] and the [[CND#The second wave 1980-89|political activism]] it provoked in Britain and Europe, Bond had planned to write about [[Nuclear warfare#The 1980s|nuclear war]] since the early 1980s. He found a means to do so after testing a storyline with Sicilian students in [[Palermo]]. To point to the barbarity of a society which planned to kill the enemy's children to protect their own (that being how he saw the logic of [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrence]]), he suggested an improvisation in which a soldier was ordered to kill a child of his community to curb mass starvation. According to Bond, each student who improvised as the soldier refused to kill a foreign child and paradoxically returned home to kill their own sibling instead.<ref>Bond : ''Commentary on The War Plays'', in ''Plays'' 6, London, Methuen, p.247</ref> He saw in this a deeply rooted force in the individual preserving an innate sense of justice that he theorized as 'Radical Innocence'.<ref>Bond : ''Commentary on The War Plays'', in ''Plays'' 6, London, Methuen, p.250 sqq.</ref> Subsequently, he built on this concept a comprehensive theory of drama in its anthropological and social role that he intended to go beyond [[Brecht]]'s theories on political drama.<ref>see Bond : ''The Hidden Plot, Notes on Theatre and the State'', London, Methuen, 2000</ref> This discovery also gave him the key to write on nuclear war, not to just to condemn the atrocity of war in a general way but, from a political perspective, questioning public acceptance of it and collaboration with it by ordinary citizens.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985 he wrote three plays to meet various requests, which he united as ''The War Plays''. The first, ''Red Black and Ignorant'' (written for a Festival dedicated to [[George Orwell]]), is a short agit-prop play in which a child, aborted and burnt to death in the nuclear global bombings, comes from the future to accuse the society of the audience of his murder. The second, ''The Tin Can People'' (written for a young activists' company), denounces capitalist society's ideology of death. It shows a community of survivors living on an infinite supply of canned food running berserk when they feel threatened by a stranger and destroying all they have as in a reduced nuclear war. The third, ''Great Peace'' (written for the RSC) re-enacts the Palermo improvisation in a city barely surviving in the aftermath of nuclear bombardment. It focuses on a soldier who kills his baby sister and his mother who tries to kill her neighbour's child to save her own. The play then follows her twenty years later, in the sterile global wilderness that nuclear war has made of the world, where she rebuilds her humanity bit by bit by meeting other survivors.\n\nThese desperate efforts to stay human or be human anew in an inhuman situation would be the purpose of most of the characters in Bond's subsequent plays, the scope of which will be to explore the limits and possibilities of humanity. His next play, ''Jackets'', again uses the Palermo improvisation and sets up a confrontation between two young men manipulated by military conspiracies, first in medieval Japan, then in contemporary urban riots. ''In the Company of Men'' shows a desperate fight by the adoptive son of an armaments factory manager to be who he is in a cynical, intrigue-ridden neo-liberal business world that Bond considers the mirror of our post-modern times. In ''Olly's Prison'', a man who has killed his daughter and forgotten his crime tries to find meaning in his life. In ''Tuesday'', a young deserter tries to tell the truth about the war but is destroyed by society. More innovative in structure, ''Coffee'' exposes the cultural roots of violence. It contrasts an initial, imaginary section resembling a gloomy fairy tale, in which a mother kills her child because she can no longer feed her, with a second, realistic part reproducing the historical [[Babi Yar]] massacre, where the same characters are among the victims. As in the Palermo improvisation, a soldier realises he cannot shoot the victims any more, and eventually decides instead to shoot his officer and escape with the girl.\n\n==Recent years==\n\nFrom 1997 to 2008, Bond's plays explored in depth a gloomy vision of a future society (in 2077) where the potential menaces of social breakdown and bio-political control have become real and structural.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The first in this cycle, ''The Crime of the 21st Century'', shows a few outcasts who have fled the over-controlled cities to hide in a no-man's-land where they try in vain to rebuild their humanity by creating a semblance of community. ''Have I None'', ''Chair'' and ''The Under Room'' show the monotonous life of the cities, where social relationships and memory have been abolished, consumption and possession standardized, and where people are harassed by the resistance of their imagination and panicked by strangers. ''Born'' and ''Innocence'' follow the actions of militarized policemen, the 'Wapos', who perpetrate atrocities on reluctant civilians during mass deportations, but some of whom try to find a human dimension to their lives and desperately attempt to escape the alienated and criminal conditions they are trapped in.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThough isolated from the institutional British theatres, Bond found two new partners in the mid-90s who would keep alive his impulse for writing. One was the [[Birmingham]]-based theatre-in-education company Big Brum, of which he remains an associate artist. From 1995 to 2009 he wrote seven very different plays dedicated to young audiences for this company: ''At the Inland Sea'' (1995), in which a youth confronts the legacy of the holocaust; ''Eleven Vests'' (1997), on scholastic and military [[authoritarianism]]; ''Have I None'' (2000), ''The Balancing Act'' (2003), ''The Under Room'' (2005) ''Tune'' (2007) and ''A Window'' (2009). Big Brum appears to be the only professional company in England for more than two decades that Bond is openly writing for and allowing to premiere his plays. This collaboration has brought Bond's theories on drama to broader attention in England, where they are now relayed by the National Association for Teaching of Drama. In 1999, he wrote ''The Children'' to be played by pupils at Manor Community College in [[Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xaazgs_edward-bond-l-aventure-des-enfants_creation|title=Edward Bond - L'aventure des enfants - Rencontre - vid\u00e9o Dailymotion|date=28 August 2009|website=Dailymotion|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> This other contribution to drama intended for young audiences has been performed ever since in many schools and theatres in England and abroad and counts as one of Bond's international successes.\n\nBond's other partnership of recent years has been with French director Alain Fran\u00e7on who premiered ''In the Company of Men''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xac30i_edward-bond-dans-la-compagnie-des-h_creation|title=Dans la compagnie des hommes / E.

In France, he has held several conferences with participants drawn from a wide audience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/playlist/x146yx_www-colline-fr_revue-edward-bond|title=Revue Edward Bond|website=Dailymotion|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> and has directed many workshops in Paris and elsewhere. He has been invited to take part in conferences and workshops all over Europe and America. In the United States, [[Robert Woodruff (director)|Robert Woodruff]] and the [[American Repertory Theatre]] produced ''Olly's Prison'' in 2005; Woodruff also directed ''Saved'' (2001) and ''Chair'' (2008) at Theatre for a New Audience in New York. In Germany, interest in his plays has remained high since the seventies.<ref>[[:de:Edward Bond#St\u00fccke]]</ref> In Britain his plays are now regularly revived in community theatre and in 2008, he had his first West End production in a career of almost fifty years with [[Jonathan Kent (director)|Jonathan Kent]]'s revival of ''[[The Sea (play)|The Sea]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]], with [[David Haig]] and [[Eileen Atkins]]. Among recent productions are revivals of ''[[Lear (play)|Lear]]'' at the [[Crucible Theatre]] [[Sheffield]] featuring [[Ian McDiarmid]] and ''Restoration'' with added songs, toured in early 2006 by the [[Headlong (theatre company)|Oxford Stage Company]]. During the autumn of 2010 [[The Cock Tavern Theatre]] in London produced six of his plays simultaneously  (one chosen from each decade), including a new one, provisionally entitled ''There Will Be More'', commissioned for this occasion and performed although unfinished.
