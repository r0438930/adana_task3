It is thus classified as a [[duct flute]]. \n\nUsually it is made from a tube of wood approximately 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in.) length. [[Tone hole]]s are cut or burnt into the tube and a fipple made at one end. If the fipple is in the top of the instrument on the same plane as the playing holes, instead of the underside, the instrument is a '''kosa dudka''' ({{lang-uk|\u041a\u043e\u0441\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0434\u043a\u0430}}), though they may fail to be distinguished. The internal diameter is usually 12 to 14 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in.) with the walls of the tube being 2 to 3 mm (0.08 to 0.12 in.) thick. In the traditional instruments the tuning varied with the length of the tube, but was usually [[diatonic scale|diatonic]], with a [[musical range|range]] of two and a half octaves.\n\nSome dentsivkas (from [[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]]) have only five tone holes. In recent times [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] ten-hole [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] was developed for this instrument that has carried on to most of the other instruments in the sopilka family. \n\nThe dentsivka is made in a number of sizes from piccolo tuned in F, prima in C, alto in G, tenor in F to the bass in C.

It consists of two dentsivkas joined together into one instrument. Only one of the pipes has fingerholes. The other acts as a drone. The [[Drone (music)|drone]] pipe in a pivtoradentsivka is usually shorter than the playing pipe. The instrument has the same fingering as the standard dentsivka.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ukrainian folk music]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Humeniuk, A. - ''Ukrainski narodni muzychni instrumenty'' - Kiev: Naukova dumka, 1967.\n*Mizynec, V. - ''Ukrainian Folk Instruments'' - Melbourne: Bayda books, 1984.\n*Cherkasky, L. - ''Ukrainski narodni muzychni instrumenty'' // Tekhnika, Kiev, Ukraine, 2003 - 262 pages. {{ISBN|966-575-111-5}}.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101202041233/http://vasyltkach.com/ru/content/samples Samples and Pictures of Ukrainian Instruments]\n\n{{Flutes}}\n\n[[Category:Internal fipple flutes]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian musical instruments]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox instrument\n|name=Dentsivka, Dvodentsivka, & Pivtoradentsivka\n|image=\n|caption=\n|classification= [[Aerophone]]\n|hornbostel_sachs=421.221-12\n|range= c<sup>3</sup>-g<sup>5</sup>\n|related= \n* [[Floyara]]\n* [[Frilka]]\n* [[Sopel (instrument)]]\n* [[Sopilka]]\n* [[Zubivka]]\n}}\nThe '''dentsivka''' ({{lang-uk|\u0414\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0456\u0432\u043a\u0430}}) ([[Denchivka]]) is a [[woodwind instrument|woodwind musical instrument]].\nThe dentsivka is often commonly called a [[sopilka]], however, it differs from the true sopilka in that the dentsivka has a [[fipple]], like the western European [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]].
