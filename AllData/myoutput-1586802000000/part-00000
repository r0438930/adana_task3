After the team locates Kort and finally kills him, Tony visits Gibbs and announces he will resign so he can take care of Tali as a single dad, intending on taking her to Israel to \"look for some answers\" and then to Paris, as \"Ziva loves Paris,\" showing his belief that Ziva may still be alive as her body had never been found.
