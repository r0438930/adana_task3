After shuffling, a [[Solitaire terminology|tableau]] of seven fanned piles of cards are laid from left to right. From left to right, each pile contains one more card than the last. The first and left-most pile contains a single upturned card, the second pile contains two cards (one downturned, one upturned), the third contains three (two downturned, one upturned), and so on, until the seventh pile which contains seven cards (six downturned, one upturned). The topmost card of each pile is turned face up.  The remaining cards form the [[Talon (cards)|stock]] are placed facedown at the upper left of the layout.\n\nThe four [[Solitaire terminology|foundations]] (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be [[Solitaire terminology|built down by alternate colors]]. Every face-up card in a partial pile, or a complete pile, can be moved, as a unit, to another tableau pile on the basis of their highest card. Any empty piles can be filled with a King, or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up four stacks of cards starting with Ace and ending with King, all of the same suit, on one of the four foundations, at which time the player would have won.\nThere are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck from the stock to the [[Solitaire terminology|waste]], including the following:\n* Turning three cards at once to the waste, with no limit on passes through the deck.\n* Turning three cards at once to the waste, with three passes through the deck.\n* Turning one card at a time to the waste, with three passes through the deck.\n* Turning one card at a time to the waste with only a single pass through the deck, and playing it if possible.\n* Turning one card at a time to the waste, with no limit on passes through the deck.\n\nIf the player can no longer make any meaningful moves, the game is considered lost.

Thoughtful Klondike is not quite the same as simply playing with all cards face up, as this would allow an impossible movement of a pile if the top downturned card happened to be in sequence with the upturned card underneath it. Using physical cards, Thoughtful Klondike can be played by peeking at the face-down cards, while with electronic programs Thoughtful Klondike can be played by allowing unlimited use of undos to return to the start if a choice turns out to be unfavourable. \n \nBecause the only difference between the two games (regular and thoughtful) is the knowledge of card location, all thoughtful games with solutions will also have solutions in Klondike. Since any winnable Klondike game must necessarily be winnable when played thoughtfully, the results on Thoughtful Klondike tells us that 82% is an upper bound on the winnability of regular Klondike when we don't know the location of all cards.  The true probability with best play might be much smaller, because the difference between a right and wrong move cannot be known in advance whenever more than one move is possible and some cards are still hidden.  Ultimately, very little is known about the winnability of regular Klondike. The number of games a skilled player can probabilistically expect to win has been estimated as at least 43%<ref name=\"jsp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jupiterscientific.org/sciinfo/KlondikeSolitaireReport.html|title=Winning Chances for Klondike Solitaire|publisher=}}</ref> , but this gives a massive gap of almost 40% between that number and 82%.\n\n== Scoring ==\nStandard scoring in the Windows Solitaire game is determined as follows:<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/101766/en-us Highest Score in Windows Solitaire], Microsoft Help and Support, KB101766.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, if the card is first moved to a Tableau, and then to a Foundation, then an extra 5 points are received for a total of 15.  Thus in order to receive a maximum score, no cards should be moved directly from the Waste to Foundation.\n\nTime can also play a factor in Windows Solitaire, if the '''Timed game''' option is selected.  For every 10 seconds of play, 2 points are taken away.  Bonus points are calculated with the formula of (20,000 / (seconds to finish)) * 35 (where / is integer division), if the game takes at least 30 seconds. If the game takes less than 30 seconds, no bonus points are awarded.\n\n== Variations ==\n\n===Single 52-card deck===\nBelow are some variations of the game of Klondike:\n* In '''[[Agnes (card game)|Agnes]]''', the stock is dealt in batches of seven on  reserve piles and every one is available. Furthermore, the bases of the foundations depends on the twenty-ninth card, which is dealt on the foundations.\n* In '''Easthaven''' (a.k.a. '''[[Aces Up]]'''), twenty-one cards are dealt into seven piles of three, two face-down and one face-up. A space in this game can only be filled by a king or any sequence starting with a king (although they can simplify the rule and put any card or a sequence in an empty space, as it does in several rules), and when a play goes to a standstill, seven new cards are dealt to the tableau, one top of each pile. Easthaven may include 2 or 3 card decks. The two deck version is either called Double Easthaven or Gypsy.\n* In '''Nine Across''' nine columns of cards are dealt, as opposed to the seven of conventional Klondike. The player can choose which cards to form the foundations; if one or more eights are exposed, for example, the player may decide to build on eights, and the piles are built up 8-9-10-J-Q-K-Ace-2-3-4-5-6-7. If eights are built on, sevens fill up spaces and so forth. The stock is dealt through one by one as many times as required.\n* In '''Thumb and Pouch''', a card in the tableau can be built upon another that is any suit other than its own (e.g. spades cannot be placed over spades) and spaces can be filled by any card or sequence.\n* In '''Whitehead''', ''all'' cards are dealt face up, building is by color (red on red, black on black), a sequence made up of cards that are of the same suit can be moved as a unit, and a space can be filled by any card or sequence.\n* In '''[[Westcliff (solitaire)|Westcliff]]''', thirty cards are dealt into ten piles of three cards, two face down and one face up. A space in this game can be filled with any card or sequence.\n\n=== Tarot deck ===\nThe game can be played with a Tarot-style 78-card deck (such as a [[Tarot Nouveau]]).  There are two ways of doing this.  Each has nine increasing tableau stacks.\n* Klondike Nouveau Run: use five foundations, and either use the Fool as the first card in the trumps foundation, or remove it before playing.  The Knight (Chevalier) appears between the Jack and the Queen.\n* Klondike Tarot Evens: use six foundations; the usual four, and then use the red knights (cavaliers) as the royals for trumps 1-10, and the black knights as the royals for trumps 11-21.\n\n== Computerized versions ==\n* The [[Atari Program Exchange]] published Mark Reid's implementation of Klondike for the [[Atari 8-bit family]], simply titled ''Solitaire'', in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solitaire|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-solitaire_4788.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref>\n* Michael A.
