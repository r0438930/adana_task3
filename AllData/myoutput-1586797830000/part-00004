In the overtime period the Blazers would find the endzone first but the 49ers would match them. Seeking to get the program's first win of a frustrating year, Coach Lambert would go for two for the win; and after running in the matching touchdown Quarterback Hasaan Klugh would get the call again as he hauled in the game winning pass from Chris Montgomery to give the Niners' program it's only win of the season and first ever Homecoming victory.\n\nTop performers of the game were UAB Quarterback A.

Charlotte had to return to Hattiesburg for the second year in a row and it was clear by the midway point that the game's outcome wasn't in doubt, and that the Golden Eagles were looking to make a statement. Turnovers also proved detrimental to any 49er comeback attempt.\n\nSouthern Miss dominated the top performances. Quarterback Kwadra Griggs passed for 221 yards and a touchdown. Rusher Ito Smith had 15 carries for 153 yards and three touchdowns. The Golden Eagles Korey Robertson had 6 receptions for 91 yards and a touchdown. Charlotte quarterback Hasaan Klugh again was the 49ers' top rusher with 7 carries for 56 yards and a touchdown. He also had 96 passing yards for another touchdown and two interceptions.\n\n'''Game notes:'''\n\n*In 2016 Charlotte became the first team in Conference USA history to beat both Marshall and Southern Miss on the road in the same season.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Florida Atlantic Owls===\n{{see also|2017 Florida Atlantic Owls football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title ='''Florida Atlantic at Charlotte'''\n| Visitor =Owls\n| Host ='''49ers'''\n| V1 = 10| V2 = 14| V3 = 7| V4 = 0\n| H1 = 0| H2 = 6| H3 = 6| H4 = 0\n| Date = October 7\n| Location = [[Jerry Richardson Stadium]]<br/>[[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte, NC]]\n| TimeZone=EST\n| StartTime = 2:06 pm\n| ElapsedTime = 2:34\n| Attendance = 8,330\n| Weather = 60F, Partly Cloudy, 0 mph\n| Referee = Justin Elliott\n| TVAnnouncers= [[Damon Amendolara]], [[Geoff Schwartz]], Shae Peppler\n| TVStation= [[Stadium (sports network)|Stadium]] for [[Facebook]]\n}}\n*'''Sources:'''<ref Name=\"TPA:FAU\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Game Notes: Charlotte Hosts FAU in Season Finale|url=https://charlotte49ers.com/news/2017/11/21/football-game-notes-charlotte-hosts-fau-in-season-finale.aspx?path=football|publisher=University of North Carolina at Charlotte Department of Athletics|date=November 21, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=49ers Drop Season-Finale to C-USA East Champs|url=https://charlotte49ers.com/news/2017/11/25/football-49ers-drop-season-finale-to-c-usa-east-champs.aspx?path=football|publisher=University of North Carolina at Charlotte Department of Athletics|date=November 25, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Scoring Summary (Final) 2017 Charlotte Football Florida Atlantic vs Charlotte (Nov 25, 2017 at Charlotte, NC)|url=https://charlotte49ers.com/documents/2017/11/25//CHAFB12.pdf|publisher=University of North Carolina at Charlotte Department of Athletics|date=November 25, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Florida Atlantic vs Charlotte \u2013 Game Summary|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400938667|work=[[ESPN]]|date=November 24, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=After 1\u201311 season, why 49ers coach Brad Lambert says he\u2019s still \u2018right guy for this place\u2019|first=David |last=Scott|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/college/article186531988.html|newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|date=November 25, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref>\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1|Time=9:48|Team=FAU|Event=[[Devin Singletary]] 6 Yd Run ([[Greg Joseph]] Kick)|Score=FAU 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|Quarter=1|Time=4:11|Team=FAU|Event=Greg JOSEPH 37 Yd Field Goal|Score=FAU 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|Quarter=2|Time=8:48|Team=FAU|Event=Kamrin SOLOMAN 20 Yd pass from Jason DRISKEL (Greg JOSEPH Kick)|Score=FAU 17\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|Quarter=2|Time=5:49|Team=CHAR|Event=Benny LEMAY 28 Yd pass from Hasaan KLUGH (Kyle CORBETT PAT failed)|Score=FAU 17\u20136}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|Quarter=2|Time=1:00|Team=FAU|Event=Willie WRIGHT 41 Yd pass from Jason DRISKEL (Greg JOSEPH Kick)|Score=FAU 24\u20136}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|Quarter=3|Time=10:02|Team=FAU|Event=Devin SINGLETARY 1 Yd Run (Greg JOSEPH Kick)|Score=FAU 31\u20136}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|Quarter=3|Time=1:48|Team=CHAR|Event=Hasaan KLUGH 6 Yd Run (Two-Point Run Conversion Failed)|Score=FAU 31\u201312}|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Charlotte 49ers|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1\u20131\n| 2016\n| '''W''' 28\u201323\n|}\nCharlotte garnered their first ever C-USA win after a dramatic last second endzone catch was waved off for the Owls in Boca Raton the previous season.
