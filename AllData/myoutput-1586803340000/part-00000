As stated in  \"Ghetto Superman\" and \"More Than A Girl\" from ''[[The Phoenix (Lyfe Jennings album)|The Phoenix]]'', Lyfe lost his father at a young age. When he was a teenager, Lyfe Jennings started to perform with the group called \"The Dotsons\". \"The Dotsons\" consisted of himself, his brother, and two cousins. In the beginning of the 90s, however, the band disbanded. During this time, Lyfe  began to get into legal trouble and his musical career came to a halt when he was sent to prison at then age of 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/events/2008/feb/01/407/|title=Lyfe Jennings: Friday, Feb. 1, 9 p.m. -|website=lasvegassun.com}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===2002-2005===\n\nIn 2002, after serving 10 years in prison, Lyfe returned to his musical aspirations. Two days after his December 2002 release from prison, he recorded a four-song demo CD.After a month post release, he performed at the Apollo. He was booed as he walked onto the stage, but when the Apollo audience heard his gritty falsetto and lyrical songwriting, they were swayed to the tune of five amateur-night victories in a row. Lyfe sold about 1,000 copies of his four-song demo CD during his Apollo \"residency.\" His growing success, influenced Lyfe to move to [[New York City]] and pursue a major-label deal. [[Columbia Records]] provided him with a contract and released his debut, [[Lyfe 268-192]] in August 2004. A year after its original release, the album was reissued with a new version of \"Hypothetically\" added as bonus track featuring American Idol winner, Fantasia.\n\n===2005-2013===\n\nLyfe released a more hip-hop-oriented follow-up ''[[The Phoenix (Lyfe Jennings album)|The Phoenix]]'' arrived in August 2006, with [[Three 6 Mafia]] and [[Young Buck]] making guest appearances. ''[[Lyfe Change]]'' released in April 2008, featuring a handful of new production associates as well as a verse from rapper [[T.I.]]. Subsequently, Lyfe accepted a new deal with [[Warner Bros.]] and began working on another album, tentatively titled Sooner or Later, which he stated would be his last. The album was finally released in August 2010 and featured guest spots from [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], [[Warryn Campbell]], Fabolous, [[Bobby Valentino (American musician)|Bobby Valentino]], [[Ludacris]], [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]], and [[Jazmine Sullivan]]. Lyfe completed another prison stint for his actions stemming from a 2008 domestic dispute.\n\n===2013-Present===\n\nHe returned to music in October 2013 with ''[[Lucid (album)|Lucid]]'', released on the Mass Appeal label.
