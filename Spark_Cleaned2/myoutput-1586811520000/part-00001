After showing some hitting potential with a .269 [[batting average (baseball)|average]] in his rookie season with Toronto, the Dodgers were enthusiastic to trade for him.\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nIzturis was designated as the everyday starting shortstop from Opening Day of the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 season]], and he quickly established himself in the Dodgers' infield. But he showed no patience at the plate, resulting in a decline in average and very few [[Base on balls|walks]]. After two years of barely adequate hitting (though compensated by his stellar glovework), he improved markedly in 2004, when he hit .288 with 62 [[Run batted in|RBI]] and 25 [[stolen base]]s in 159 games. At the end of the season, he earned his first [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]], the first by a Dodger shortstop since [[Maury Wills]]' back-to-back honors in [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961]] and [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]].\n\nIn [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], Izturis hit .348 through June 1 and led the entire majors in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]. He was selected for the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] team, but his batting average later dipped all the way down into the .250 range. Curiously, his defense also seemed to suffer. After two trips to the [[disabled list]], Izturis underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] in his right elbow, and returned in mid-June, 2006.\n\nWith the uncertainty around Izturis, the Dodgers acquired shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]] in the off-season. That move seemed to have put Izturis' future with the Dodgers in doubt. With a $13 million annual salary, Furcal did not seem a likely candidate to be benched.\n\n===Chicago Cubs/Pittsburgh Pirates/St. Louis Cardinals===\nAt the 2006 trade deadline, Izturis was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[Greg Maddux]] and cash considerations.\n\nOn July 19, 2007, Izturis and cash were traded to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for a player to be named later.\n\nOn November 16, 2007, the Pirates declined an option on Izturis, and he became a free agent. Shortly thereafter on November 30, 2007, Izturis signed a one-year, $2.85 million deal with the St. Louis Cardinals.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|title = Izturis deal nudges out Eckstein|accessdate = December 1, 2007|last = Strauss|first = Joe|date = December 1, 2007|publisher = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202040229/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/EAC9E2342BE58705862573A400164658?OpenDocument|archivedate = December 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\nOn December 16, 2008, Izturis signed a two-year deal with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081216&content_id=3718637&vkey=pr_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal|title=Orioles sign shortstop Izturis|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]], he led all starting shortstops in [[range factor]], at 4.89.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/position/ss/sort/rangeFactor/order/true \"MLB Player Fielding Stats \u2013 As ss \u2013 2009\"] ''ESPN'', accessed October 6, 2009</ref>\n\nOn December 10, 2010, Izturis re-signed with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to a 1-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121005051.html|title=Orioles, SS Izturis agree to $1.5M, 1-year deal|last=Ginsburg|first=David|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}</ref>\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nOn December 21, 2011 he signed a minor league contract with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].
