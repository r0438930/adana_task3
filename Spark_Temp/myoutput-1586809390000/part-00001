The station is owned by [[Tegna Inc.]] WLTX's studios are located on Garners Ferry Road ([[U.S. Route 76 in South Carolina|US 76]]\u2013[[U.S. Route 378|378]]) in southeastern Columbia, and its transmitter is located on Screaming Eagle Road (southeast of [[Interstate 20 in South Carolina|I-20]]) in rural northeast [[Richland County, South Carolina|Richland County]]. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is available on [[Spectrum (cable service)|Charter Spectrum]] channel 9 in both [[standard-definition television|standard]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on September 1, 1953 as '''WNOK-TV''', originally broadcasting on UHF channel 67. It is the second oldest continuously operating television station in South Carolina, having signed on two months before [[WIS (TV)|WIS-TV]] (channel 10). The station has always been a CBS affiliate, but carried a secondary affiliation with the [[DuMont Television Network]] until 1955, one year before that network ceased operations. The station originally maintained studio facilities located in the Jefferson Hotel in downtown Columbia, where it was based alongside sister radio property WNOK (1230 AM, now [[WPCO]], and [[WNOK|104.7 FM]]). On June 30, 1961, the station switched channel positions, moving to UHF channel 19. In June 1967, WNOK-AM-FM-TV moved to a new studio facility on Garners Ferry Road, located {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of downtown Columbia and {{convert|1|mi|km}} from [[Interstate 77|I-77]] and the campus of the [[University of South Carolina]] School of Medicine. In 1977, the station was sold to Lewis Broadcasting and changed its call letters to '''WLTX'''.\n\nHistorically, channel 19 was well behind long-dominant WIS in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], especially in news programming. This was partly because the station was hampered by a weak signal. Although channel 19 decently covered Columbia itself as well as [[Lexington County|Lexington]] and [[Sumter County, South Carolina|Sumter]] counties, it was practically unviewable in the outlying areas of the market. Until cable television arrived in the Columbia market in the 1970s, viewers in the outlying portions of the market had to rely on [[broadcast range|grade B]] signals from [[WRDW-TV]] in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] or [[WBTV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. However, in 1985, WLTX activated a new tall transmission tower in Lugoff that nearly doubled the station's signal and expanded its over-the-air coverage to 24 counties.\n\n[[Image:Logo WLTX .png|145px|thumb|left|WLTX's logo before 1999.]]\nIn January 1995, WLTX became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]); it carried the network's programming on a secondary basis during weekend afternoon timeslots when CBS had only limited sports programming (namely [[PGA Tour on CBS|PGA Tour]] golf, tennis, [[NASCAR on CBS|NASCAR]] [[auto racing]], and an expanded [[College Basketball on CBS|college basketball]] schedule). The station dropped UPN programming after [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]]-licensed WQHB (channel 63, now a primary [[The CW|CW]] and secondary [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate) signed on in September 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Lewis Broadcasting sold WLTX to the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]]. Gannett invested heavily in WLTX, doubling the size of the station in 2001 and providing the staff with all new news gathering equipment. Soon after taking control, Gannett hired longtime WIS meteorologist Jim Gandy to serve as the station's chief meteorologist; however since Gandy was initially prohibited from appearing on the station's newscasts until a one-year [[non-compete clause]] in his WIS contract expired, Gannett used him as a consultant at WLTX and to serve as a substitute meteorologist at the company's other stations, including [[WXIA-TV]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2002, WLTX became the flagship broadcaster of the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].\n\nIn May 2002, the station was the first commercial station in Columbia to broadcast in digital. WLTX's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, Gannett entered a [[Carriage dispute|dispute]] against [[Dish Network]] regarding [[Retransmission consent|compensation]] fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper [[digital video recorder]]s. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WLTX. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (such as WLTX) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Loose|first=Ashley|title=DISH customers may lose Gannett programming, including 12 News KPNX, over AutoHop feature|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|accessdate=October 6, 2012|publisher=[[KNXV-TV]]|date=October 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011013154/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|archive-date=October 11, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vuong|first=Andy|title=Gannett threatening to black out stations in its dispute with Dish|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21710959/gannett-threatening-black-out-stations-its-dispute-dish|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=October 6, 2012}}</ref> The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.<ref>{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Melodie|title=Dish, Gannett Reach New Deal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444897304578044401930225948|accessdate=October 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media.

In fact, WLTX was one of the few stations in the United States to use digital technology to broadcast all games of March Madness using all digital channels.\n\n==Programming==\nWLTX carries the entire CBS network schedule. It airs the ''[[CBS Dream Team]]'' block two hours earlier (although the third hour of the block is aired by the station on Sunday mornings) and ''[[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|CBS This Morning Saturday]]'' two hours later on Saturday mornings than most CBS stations in the time zone. [[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs broadcast by WLTX include ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[The Doctors (talk show)|The Doctors]]'', and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WLTX News 19 News Title Card Oct 2015.png|225px|right|thumb|''News 19 at 4:30 a.m.'' Title Card as of Oct 2015.{{deletable image-caption|Monday, 27 June 2016}}]] -->\nWLTX presently broadcasts 30\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours on weekdays, two hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLTX has been a solid, if usually distant, runner-up to WIS. Indeed, for a time in the 1980s, WLTX didn't air a newscast at 11 p.m., even after activating its new tower. However, in recent years, WLTX has taken the lead at noon due to having [[CBS Daytime]] as a lead-in, and has frequently traded the lead in the early morning timeslot with WIS.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, WLTX launched a weekly news segment titled \"News 19: Player of the Week,\" which recognized the accomplishments of high school student athletes in the classroom and in their sport. Future NBA star [[Ray Allen]] won the award several times while playing at Hillcrest High School (now Hillcrest Middle School) in [[Dalzell, South Carolina|Dalzell]]. After being acquired by Gannett, the station also debuted feature segments for its newscast such as \"On Your Side\", \"Restaurant Report Card\" and \"Big Money Monday.\"\n\nIn 2001, WLTX premiered a half-hour 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. WLTX's popular morning anchor team of J.R. Berry and Darci Strickland were promoted to anchoring the evening newscasts that year. During the May 2007 ratings period, WLTX's midday newscast continued to place at #1 in the noon timeslot (traditionally having [[The Price Is Right (American game show)|the same lead-in]] since 1979), while it also won first on weekday mornings during the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour. On August 20, 2007, WLTX debuted an hour-long 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast titled ''News 19: Friends @ Five''; the program won a Southeast Regional [[Emmy Award]] on June 23, 2008, for its innovative approach to connecting with viewers. The station's 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast also won an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast\" for the second year in a row. On June 26, 2010, the station's 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast took home an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2011, WLTX became the third television station in the Columbia market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. In July 2013, WLTX became the second station in Columbia to expand its weekday morning newscast into the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. timeslot; later on October 5, 2013, WLTX premiered an hour-long Saturday morning newscast at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., becoming the second station in Columbia to air a morning news program on weekends (after WIS).\n\nOn January 20, 2015, WLTX was awarded the prestigious [[Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont Award]] for its series of over 40 reports on the dysfunction of South Carolina's Department of Social Services.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Joel Connable]] (deceased)\n* [[Ainsley Earhardt]] (now at [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]])\n* [[Natasha Curry]] (now at [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.wltx.com/}}\n*{{TVQ|WLTX}}\n*{{BIA|WLTX|TV|TV}}\n*[https://www.shoppersvila.com/wltx-tv-schedule/ WLTX Tv Schedule & Tv Listings Guide]\n\n{{Columbia TV}}\n{{CBS South Carolina}}\n{{Tegna}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wltx}}\n[[Category:Tegna Inc.]]\n[[Category:CBS network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Justice Network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Antenna TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Quest (American TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Columbia, South Carolina|LTX]]\n[[Category:Former Gannett subsidiaries]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|CBS affiliate in Columbia, South Carolina}}\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = WLTX\n| city                     = \n| station_logo             = WLTX hdtv.png\n| logo_size                = 250px\n| station_branding         = ''WLTX News 19''\n| station_slogan           = ''On Your Side''\n| digital                  = 15 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n| virtual                  = 19 ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]])\n| subchannels              = \n| other_chs                = \n| affiliations             = '''19.1:''' [[CBS]]<br>'''19.2:''' [[Justice Network]] ('''[[owned-and-operated station|O&O]]''')<br>'''19.3:''' [[Antenna TV]]<br>'''19.4:''' [[Quest (American TV network)|Quest]] ('''O&O''')\n| owner                    = [[Tegna Inc.]]\n| licensee                 = Pacific and Southern, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]\n| location                 = [[Columbia, South Carolina]]\n| country                  = United States\n| airdate                  = {{start date and age|1953|9|1|p=y}}\n| enddate                  = \n| callsign_meaning         = '''L'''ewis '''T'''elevision<br/>(former owner, used same callsign format for other stations, such as [[WLTZ]])\n| sister_stations          = \n| former_callsigns         = WNOK-TV (1953\u20131977)\n| former_channel_numbers   = '''Analog:'''<br>67 (UHF, 1953\u20131961)<br/>19 (UHF, 1961\u20132009)<br>'''Digital:'''<br>17 (UHF, 2000\u20132019)\n| former_affiliations      = {{ubl|''All secondary''|[[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] (1953\u20131955)|[[UPN]] (1995\u20131997)}}\n| effective_radiated_power = 700 [[kilowatt|kW]]\n| HAAT                     = {{convert|531.7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}\n| facility_id              = 37176\n| coordinates              = {{nowrap|{{coord|34|5|50|N|80|45|50|W|type:landmark_scale:2000}}}}\n| licensing_authority      = [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]\n| homepage                 = {{url|https://www.wltx.com/}}\n}}\n\n'''WLTX''', [[virtual channel]] 19 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 15), is a [[CBS]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Columbia, South Carolina]], United States.

Indeed, for a time in the 1980s, WLTX didn't air a newscast at 11 p.m., even after activating its new tower.

After being acquired by Gannett, the station also debuted feature segments for its newscast such as \"On Your Side\", \"Restaurant Report Card\" and \"Big Money Monday.\"\n\nIn 2001, WLTX premiered a half-hour 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. WLTX's popular morning anchor team of J.R. Berry and Darci Strickland were promoted to anchoring the evening newscasts that year. During the May 2007 ratings period, WLTX's midday newscast continued to place at #1 in the noon timeslot (traditionally having [[The Price Is Right (American game show)|the same lead-in]] since 1979), while it also won first on weekday mornings during the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour. On August 20, 2007, WLTX debuted an hour-long 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast titled ''News 19: Friends @ Five''; the program won a Southeast Regional [[Emmy Award]] on June 23, 2008, for its innovative approach to connecting with viewers. The station's 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast also won an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast\" for the second year in a row. On June 26, 2010, the station's 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast took home an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2011, WLTX became the third television station in the Columbia market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]].
