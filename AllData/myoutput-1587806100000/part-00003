Beginning in February, thousands of citizens launched daily protests demanding reimbursement by the government, which they believed was profiting from the schemes. On 1 March, Prime Minister [[Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi]] resigned and on 2 March, President [[Sali Berisha]] declared a [[state of emergency]]. On 11 March the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] won a major victory when its leader, [[Bashkim Fino]], was appointed prime minister. However, the transfer of power did not halt the unrest, and protests spread to northern Albania. Although the government quelled revolts in the north, the ability of the government and military to maintain order began to collapse, especially in the southern half of Albania, which fell under the control of rebels and criminal gangs.<ref name=\"globalsecurity\">{{cite web|first=John|last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/albania.htm |title=Albanian Civil War (1997) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAll major population centres were engulfed in demonstrations by 13 March and foreign countries began to evacuate their citizens.

In the mid-1990s Albania was adopting a [[market economy]], after decades of a [[Stalinist]] [[command economy]] under the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]]. The rudimentary financial system became dominated by [[Ponzi scheme]]s, and government officials endorsed a series of [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid investment funds]]. By January 1997 the schemes (many of which were fronts for [[Money laundering|laundering money]] and [[arms trafficking]]) could no longer make payments. The number of investors who had been lured by the promise of getting rich quick grew to include two-thirds of the population.<ref name=IMF2000/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/alpha/albania1997.htm |title=On War article |publisher=On War article |date=27 November 2003 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref> It is estimated that close to $1.5 billion was invested in companies offering monthly interest rates ranging from 10%-25%, while the average monthly income was around $80. A significant number of Albanians sold their homes to invest, and immigrants working in Greece and Italy transferred additional resources to the schemes.<ref>[http://conflict-prevention.net/page.php?id=40&formid=73&action=show&surveyid=29 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223195348/http://conflict-prevention.net/page.php?id=40&formid=73&action=show&surveyid=29 |date=23 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1996 elections ===\n{{Main|1996 Albanian parliamentary election}}\nOn 26 May 1996, general elections were held and the Democratic Party won by a large margin. The Socialists (PS) accused the government of fraud and rejected the results. PS left the counting process and boycotted the parliament. On 20 October local elections were held. The Democratic Party won again, but the Socialists also rejected this result.\n\n=== Pyramid schemes ===\n{{Main|Pyramid schemes in Albania}}\n\nThe pyramid schemes started operations in 1991. Their activity was based on making payments to old investors using money contributed by new investors. The first scheme was that of Hajdin Sejdis\u00eb, who later fled to Switzerland with several million dollars. It was followed by \"Sudja\" of shoe factory worker Maksude Kad\u00ebna in 1993, then the \"Populli\" foundations run by an opposition politician, and \"Xhaferri\". By the end of 1996 the schemes peaked. The interest rates they offered were very tempting; Sudja offered 100% interest. The schemes were not criticised immediately because of a banking law adopted in 1994 which\u2014on [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) advice\u2014contained no provision that the [[National Bank of Albania]] act as a supervisor of commercial banks. The IMF changed that advice two years later, after the consequences had become visible. Despite IMF advice to close these schemes, the government continued to allow their activities, often participating in them.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Between 8\u201316 January 1997 the schemes collapsed. On 22 January the government froze the Xhaferri and Populli firms. \"Gjallica\", another firm, was nearly bankrupt, while \"Vefa\", which had invested in Albanian hotels, fuel and factories, continued normal activity.\n\nThe first protest was on 16 January in the South. On 19 January in [[Tirana]] demonstrators protested the Sudja creditors. On 24 January the ''de facto'' rebellion began. Thousands of people in Lushnja marched on city hall in protest against the government's support of the schemes. The protest quickly descended into violence. Police forces were routed and the city hall and adjoining cinema were burned. One day later, on 25 January, Democratic Party chair Tritan Shehu was sent to Lushnje to resolve the situation. On his arrival he was held hostage for several hours at City Stadium and assaulted by the protesters. Albanian Special Forces units intervened to extract Shehu. By the morning every government institution in the city was looted and destroyed, except for the Interior Ministry building, which was protected by the Director of Communications, seven of his engineers and a guard who refused to abandon his post.\n\nOn 26 and 27 January violence erupted in other southern towns, such as Vlora. On 30 January the Forum for Democracy was formed by opposition parties to lead the protests. Anger was also directed against Berisha and the government for allowing the schemes to continue despite IMF advice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As allegations grew that Berisha and others in government had personally profited from the schemes,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} many{{Who|date=January 2012}} became convinced that the Democratic Party had to be removed by force. This was especially true in Vlora. On 4 February distribution of a portion of lost money began at the counters of the National Commercial Bank, owned by the state. Rather than quieting the protests, this action increased people's suspicion. A check for $550,000 paid by the \"Gjallica\" firm on 7 January to the Socialist Party accelerated the firm's collapse. On 5 February Gjallica declared bankruptcy and on 6 February violent protests resumed in Vlora. On 9 February state police were attacked in Vlora and a day later, also in the south, 50 Special Forces troops attacked and brutally dispersed protesters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n=== North-South conflict ===\nOne of the main themes of Western media and analysts during the March riots was the north-south division. Various newspapers and TV stations claimed that the rebellion was not just a showdown between the two main political forces but a clash between the northerners ([[Ghegs]]) who supported Berisha and southerners ([[Tosks]]) who supported the Socialist Party.\n\n== Hunger strike at the University of Vlora ==\n\nOn 20 February 1997, about 50 students at the [[University of Vlora]] began a [[hunger strike]] on campus, they demanded the government's resignation and the full return of invested money. On 22 February the Forum for Democracy declared its support for the strike. Students from Gjirokast\u00ebr and Elbasan also came to give their support. They were then driven by the FRESSH (Youth Wing of Socialist Party) activists of Vlor\u00eb to Tirana. In contrast, the students of University Luigj Gurakuqi in Shkodra did not take part, and its Students Union declared, \"The students share the pain of the citizens of Vlora in losing money in pyramid schemes, but on the other hand, think that freedom and democracy, homeland and nation have a higher price\".\n\nOn 26 February thousands of people surrounded the building of the university to defend it from a rumoured attack by SHIK (Sh\u00ebrbimi Informativ Komb\u00ebtar), the national intelligence service. The same day a group of strikers requested more medical help, raising doubts about the doctors near them. On 27 February in Vlora Shkodra, mayor Bahri Borici of the United Right declared his support for the hunger strike. The next day was a decisive moment in Albanian history\u2014after strengthening their perimeter around the building of the university, the rebel forces, without warning, attacked the SHIK building. In fighting between the rebels and government forces, nine people\u2014six officers and three civilians\u2014were killed. This incident marked the start of a ten-day civil war and a year of violence in southern Albania.<ref>http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ac905c.html</ref>\n\n[[File:97-9.jpg|thumb|Angry protesters throwing stones at government forces.]]\n\n==Looting and opening of weapon depots==\n [[File:Viti97.jpg|thumb|Weapon depots looting in 1997.]]\nThe ''Opening of the depots'' ({{sq|Hapja e depove}}) was the opening of weapons depots in the north, for protection against the violence of the south.

The event was described as the one of the greatest robberies in the history of the [[Balkans]]. A group of six people attacked the fortified building of the State Treasury with an [[antitank weapon]]. The total amount of money that was inside the building was US$8 million, but the robbers only managed to acquire US$6 million. The few police still in the city soon arrived at the scene and took control of the remaining assets. Later, the thieves were seen by several witnesses meeting at the outskirts of Shkod\u00ebr, where they divided the money between themselves. After the robbery, the police and investigators began investigations in Shkod\u00ebr. In the spring of 1998, more than a year later, the investigators closed the file and it was given to the police for further investigation.

After that hour the streets were deserted and the only people who moved were gang members. Gangs announced through speakers and flyers that other people were not to go out as there would be fighting. Each night brought attacks with explosives and shooting, leaving dozens dead. In Berat Altin Dardha's rule was even more severe. In Lushnje Aldo Bare's gang had control.

A massive explosion destroyed an arms storage facility.{{where|date=February 2018}} Himar\u00eb was burning, including police buildings in Gjirokastra.\n* 2 March: [[Alexander Meksi]]'s government resigned after failing to resolve the crisis.

Immediately Gazidede ordered indefinite closure of schools throughout the country and imposed restrictions on the press and consumer goods. In Kavaja, bastion of PD, over 5000 people voluntarily armed to defend the city from an envisioned attack by armed gangs. Italian news agency ANSA commented: \"The whole scenario is emerging as a politico-military strategy and not as a manifestation of spontaneous popular. To gather people in the Flag Square are available for days special machines.\"\n* 3 March: President Berisha was re-elected with the votes of DP members of the parliament alone. This led to massive riots in southern and central Albania. The remaining warehouses exploded and remaining bands of the military formed committees. The city of [[Saranda]] was also captured by rebels, with fighters based out of Vlora arriving by boat and burning every government building in the city, including the library. In Vlora, a local detention facility was broken into and more than 400 guns were seized. Gunmen burned down the Vocational Training Centre in Vlora. Meanwhile, SHIK tried to contain the rebellion to Vlora, Saranda and [[Delvina]] to stop it from spreading to the rest of the country. Destruction and killings continued throughout southern Albania. The seven million dollar Vocational Training Centre in Vlora was burned, which had cost the Albanian government. A group of approximately 100-member \"Adipetrol\" was held responsible and their compound in Gjirokastra was raided. Masked raiders captured a warship and rebels attacked Saranda, where police and government buildings were burned.

The army recovered control of Fier and  began to disarm the population.\n* 4 March: The Committee of Public Salvation was formed in Vlore, headed by Albert Shyti. This committee began to act as a parallel government. Snipers occupied every building in Vlore and every street put up barricades to prevent attacks by SHIK. The Mifoli Bridge over the [[Vjos\u00eb|River Vjos\u00eb]] was blocked and mined (this bridge\u2014which separated the two parts of Albania\u2014would become a symbol of the rebellion).

Outside Saranda one member of SHIK was burnt alive and another was taken hostage, while two others escaped. Fifty soldiers joined the rebels and two Albanian Air Force pilots [[Desertion of 4 March 1997|defected and flew their planes to Italy]]. The pilots claimed they were ordered to attack civilians. Gazidede's plan to isolate the insurgency in Vlora failed, as it spread across the south. After fierce fighting in Delvina, the rebels forced the army to pull back. In Saranda, the rebels put up roadblocks. In the South, more depots exploded. Rebels placed snipers in mansions, locked the Mifolit bridge and raised barricades to prevent entry of the military and SHIK. In Shkodra, the army capitulated and the hunger strike ended. In Saranda, organised gangs raided an Albanian Navy base  and captured thousands of weapons. The [[Salvation Committees|Public Salvation Committee of Vlore]] was formed. It began to act as a parallel government by conducting a \"de facto\" coup. Its leader was Albert Shyti. The main collaborator of the \"Committee\" was Myrteza Caushi, known as Zani \"The strongman of Vlora\". Under the example of  Vlora, Shyti created \"Salvation Committees\" everywhere in Albania. Demonstrators would never have succeeded in overpowering the [[Vlora]] police if they had not been armed and organised by local [[organised crime]] bosses and former members of the Communist-era [[secret police]] ([[Sigurimi]]), who saw this as their chance to damage the new political system. Typical of the latter was Albert Shyti, who returned from Greece with a private arsenal and set himself up as the head of the Vlora \"[[Committee of Public Salvation|Salvation Committees]]\"\u2014a pattern replicated in other towns and cities in southern Albania.\n* 5 March: Warehouses in Memaliaj and other places were blown up. Rebels burned police buildings in these cities. Greek TV \"Mega\" stated, \"Today, armed groups in southern Albania raised the banner of Northern Epirus for the first time.

In the mid-1990s Albania was adopting a [[market economy]], after decades of a [[Stalinist]] [[command economy]] under the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]]. The rudimentary financial system became dominated by [[Ponzi scheme]]s, and government officials endorsed a series of [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid investment funds]]. By January 1997 the schemes (many of which were fronts for [[Money laundering|laundering money]] and [[arms trafficking]]) could no longer make payments. The number of investors who had been lured by the promise of getting rich quick grew to include two-thirds of the population.<ref name=IMF2000/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/alpha/albania1997.htm |title=On War article |publisher=On War article |date=27 November 2003 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref> It is estimated that close to $1.5 billion was invested in companies offering monthly interest rates ranging from 10%-25%, while the average monthly income was around $80. A significant number of Albanians sold their homes to invest, and immigrants working in Greece and Italy transferred additional resources to the schemes.<ref>[http://conflict-prevention.net/page.php?id=40&formid=73&action=show&surveyid=29 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223195348/http://conflict-prevention.net/page.php?id=40&formid=73&action=show&surveyid=29 |date=23 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1996 elections ===\n{{Main|1996 Albanian parliamentary election}}\nOn 26 May 1996, general elections were held and the Democratic Party won by a large margin. The Socialists (PS) accused the government of fraud and rejected the results. PS left the counting process and boycotted the parliament. On 20 October local elections were held. The Democratic Party won again, but the Socialists also rejected this result.\n\n=== Pyramid schemes ===\n{{Main|Pyramid schemes in Albania}}\n\nThe pyramid schemes started operations in 1991. Their activity was based on making payments to old investors using money contributed by new investors. The first scheme was that of Hajdin Sejdis\u00eb, who later fled to Switzerland with several million dollars. It was followed by \"Sudja\" of shoe factory worker Maksude Kad\u00ebna in 1993, then the \"Populli\" foundations run by an opposition politician, and \"Xhaferri\". By the end of 1996 the schemes peaked. The interest rates they offered were very tempting; Sudja offered 100% interest. The schemes were not criticised immediately because of a banking law adopted in 1994 which\u2014on [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) advice\u2014contained no provision that the [[National Bank of Albania]] act as a supervisor of commercial banks. The IMF changed that advice two years later, after the consequences had become visible. Despite IMF advice to close these schemes, the government continued to allow their activities, often participating in them.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Between 8\u201316 January 1997 the schemes collapsed. On 22 January the government froze the Xhaferri and Populli firms. \"Gjallica\", another firm, was nearly bankrupt, while \"Vefa\", which had invested in Albanian hotels, fuel and factories, continued normal activity.\n\nThe first protest was on 16 January in the South. On 19 January in [[Tirana]] demonstrators protested the Sudja creditors. On 24 January the ''de facto'' rebellion began. Thousands of people in Lushnja marched on city hall in protest against the government's support of the schemes. The protest quickly descended into violence. Police forces were routed and the city hall and adjoining cinema were burned. One day later, on 25 January, Democratic Party chair Tritan Shehu was sent to Lushnje to resolve the situation. On his arrival he was held hostage for several hours at City Stadium and assaulted by the protesters. Albanian Special Forces units intervened to extract Shehu. By the morning every government institution in the city was looted and destroyed, except for the Interior Ministry building, which was protected by the Director of Communications, seven of his engineers and a guard who refused to abandon his post.\n\nOn 26 and 27 January violence erupted in other southern towns, such as Vlora. On 30 January the Forum for Democracy was formed by opposition parties to lead the protests. Anger was also directed against Berisha and the government for allowing the schemes to continue despite IMF advice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As allegations grew that Berisha and others in government had personally profited from the schemes,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} many{{Who|date=January 2012}} became convinced that the Democratic Party had to be removed by force. This was especially true in Vlora. On 4 February distribution of a portion of lost money began at the counters of the National Commercial Bank, owned by the state. Rather than quieting the protests, this action increased people's suspicion. A check for $550,000 paid by the \"Gjallica\" firm on 7 January to the Socialist Party accelerated the firm's collapse. On 5 February Gjallica declared bankruptcy and on 6 February violent protests resumed in Vlora. On 9 February state police were attacked in Vlora and a day later, also in the south, 50 Special Forces troops attacked and brutally dispersed protesters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n=== North-South conflict ===\nOne of the main themes of Western media and analysts during the March riots was the north-south division. Various newspapers and TV stations claimed that the rebellion was not just a showdown between the two main political forces but a clash between the northerners ([[Ghegs]]) who supported Berisha and southerners ([[Tosks]]) who supported the Socialist Party.\n\n== Hunger strike at the University of Vlora ==\n\nOn 20 February 1997, about 50 students at the [[University of Vlora]] began a [[hunger strike]] on campus, they demanded the government's resignation and the full return of invested money. On 22 February the Forum for Democracy declared its support for the strike. Students from Gjirokast\u00ebr and Elbasan also came to give their support. They were then driven by the FRESSH (Youth Wing of Socialist Party) activists of Vlor\u00eb to Tirana. In contrast, the students of University Luigj Gurakuqi in Shkodra did not take part, and its Students Union declared, \"The students share the pain of the citizens of Vlora in losing money in pyramid schemes, but on the other hand, think that freedom and democracy, homeland and nation have a higher price\".\n\nOn 26 February thousands of people surrounded the building of the university to defend it from a rumoured attack by SHIK (Sh\u00ebrbimi Informativ Komb\u00ebtar), the national intelligence service. The same day a group of strikers requested more medical help, raising doubts about the doctors near them. On 27 February in Vlora Shkodra, mayor Bahri Borici of the United Right declared his support for the hunger strike. The next day was a decisive moment in Albanian history\u2014after strengthening their perimeter around the building of the university, the rebel forces, without warning, attacked the SHIK building. In fighting between the rebels and government forces, nine people\u2014six officers and three civilians\u2014were killed. This incident marked the start of a ten-day civil war and a year of violence in southern Albania.<ref>http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ac905c.html</ref>\n\n[[File:97-9.jpg|thumb|Angry protesters throwing stones at government forces.]]\n\n==Looting and opening of weapon depots==\n [[File:Viti97.jpg|thumb|Weapon depots looting in 1997.]]\nThe ''Opening of the depots'' ({{sq|Hapja e depove}}) was the opening of weapons depots in the north, for protection against the violence of the south.

The event was described as the one of the greatest robberies in the history of the [[Balkans]]. A group of six people attacked the fortified building of the State Treasury with an [[antitank weapon]]. The total amount of money that was inside the building was US$8 million, but the robbers only managed to acquire US$6 million. The few police still in the city soon arrived at the scene and took control of the remaining assets. Later, the thieves were seen by several witnesses meeting at the outskirts of Shkod\u00ebr, where they divided the money between themselves. After the robbery, the police and investigators began investigations in Shkod\u00ebr. In the spring of 1998, more than a year later, the investigators closed the file and it was given to the police for further investigation.

Movement in the city started at 10:00, when people gathered in [[Flag's Square]] to hear the Committee of Rescue, and ended at 13:00. After that hour the streets were deserted and the only people who moved were gang members. Gangs announced through speakers and flyers that other people were not to go out as there would be fighting. Each night brought attacks with explosives and shooting, leaving dozens dead. In Berat Altin Dardha's rule was even more severe. In Lushnje Aldo Bare's gang had control.

Demonstrators would never have succeeded in overpowering the [[Vlora]] police if they had not been armed and organised by local [[organised crime]] bosses and former members of the Communist-era [[secret police]] ([[Sigurimi]]), who saw this as their chance to damage the new political system.
