This is derived from the Old English tribal name ''[[H\u00e6stingas]]'', meaning `the constituency (followers) of H\u00e6sta'. [[Symeon of Durham]] records the victory of [[Offa]] in 771 over the ''Hestingorum gens'', that is, \"the people of the Hastings tribe.\" [[Hastingleigh]] in Kent was named after that tribe.

However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that ''H\u00e6stingaceaster'' may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at [[Pevensey]].<ref>Pamela Combes and Malcolm Lyne, \"Hastings, Haestingaceaster and Haestingaport: a question of identity,\" ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'', 133 (1995), 213\u201324. {{ISSN|0143-8204}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of prehistoric settlements have been found at the town site: flint arrowheads and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts have been found. [[Iron Age]] forts have been excavated on both the East and West Hills. This suggests that the inhabitants moved early to the safety of the valley in between the forts. The settlement was already based on the port when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] arrived in Britain for the first time in 55&nbsp;BC. At this time, they began to [[Iron industry of Ashdown Forest|exploit the iron]] (Wealden rocks provide a plentiful supply of the ore), and shipped it out by boat. Iron was worked locally at [[Beauport Park]], to the north of the town. It employed up to one thousand men and is considered to have been the third-largest mine in the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"OpenLearn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|title=Beauport Park, East Sussex|date=22 June 2006|work=[[OpenLearn]]|publisher=[[Open University]]|accessdate=10 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006145624/http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There was also a possible iron-working site near Blacklands Church in the town - the old name of 'Ponbay Bridge' for a bridge that used to exist in the area is a corruption of 'Pond Bay' as suggested by Thomas Ross (Mayor of Hastings and author of an 1835 guide book)<ref name=\"historymap.info\">Historical Hastings Wiki: [http://wiki.historymap.info/Iron_Working Iron Working - Historical Hastings Wiki], accessdate: 10 December 2019</ref>\n\nWith the departure of the Romans, the town suffered setbacks. The Beauport site was abandoned, and the town suffered from problems from nature and man-made attacks. The Sussex coast has always suffered from occasional violent storms; with the additional hazard of [[longshore drift]] (the eastward movement of shingle along the coast), the coastline has been frequently changing.

It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the town's outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That \"New Burgh\" was founded in 1069 and is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as such. [[William the Conqueror|William]] defeated and killed [[Harold Godwinson]], the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army, thus opening England to the Norman conquest.\n\nWilliam caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.\n\nHastings was shown as a [[borough]] by the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086); it had also given its name to the [[Rape of Hastings]], one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\". By a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589, the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.\n\nMuslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], writing c.1153, described Hastings as \"a town of large extent and many inhabitants, flourishing and handsome, having markets, workpeople and rich merchants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |title=Al-Idrisi; The Book of Roger The description of L'Angleterre |accessdate=2016-12-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922081246/http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Hastings and the sea===\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Fish Market at Hastings Beach - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Fish Market at Hastings Beach'', [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] (1810)]]\n\nBy the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland (since demolished). It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.\n\nIn the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the [[Cinque Ports]]; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Dover]] and [[New Romney]] being the first, Hastings and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] followed, all finally being joined by [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Winchelsea]], at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated with the group.\n\n[[File:Hastings Castle 2012-07-28.jpg|thumb|[[Hastings Castle]], with the Pier and Town Centre in the background, and [[Eastbourne]] on the horizon]]\n\nIn the 13th century, much of the town and half of [[Hastings Castle]] was washed away in the [[South England flood of February 1287]]. During a [[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|naval campaign of 1339]], and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings' days were finished.\n\n[[File:Hastings town centre postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings town centre and the Memorial from an old postcard]]\nHastings had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.\n\nHastings was then just a small fishing settlement, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling; the town was ideally located for that purpose.<ref name=\"Smuggling on the Sussex Coast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |title=Hastings Museum |publisher=Smuggling on the Sussex Coast |accessdate=10 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318003820/http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are \"[[St Clement's Caves]]\", partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called health-giving properties of seawater, as well as the local springs and Roman baths. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley.\n\n[[File:Bottle Alley Hastings.jpg|thumb|right|The double decker promenade that runs from Hastings Pier beyond Marine Court (seen in the distance), with a break at Warrior Square, was built in the 1930s by the borough engineer [[Sidney Little]]]]\nIt was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent (designed by architect [[Joseph Kay (architect)|Joseph Kay]]) is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle (its name recalling the old chapel in the castle above) now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]].\n\nThe extensive development meant that a large transient work-force was required. Many of the people coming in to Hastings at this time, settled on some waste-ground to the west of the main town called the [[America Ground]]. This land, originally a shingle spit created by the great storm of 1287, was declared to be Crown Property after an inquiry held at [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] during 1827 and the land was cleared in preparation for the development of this area of land by [[Patrick Francis Robertson]].<ref>[http://wiki.historymap.info/Category:America_Ground Hastings local history Wiki]</ref>\n\n{{main|Hastings Old Town}}\n\n[[File:Historische Altstadt-Hastings.JPG|thumb|left|George Street, Old town]]\nLike many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the [[Victorian era]]. In 1801, its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831, it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891, it was almost sixty thousand.\n\nThe last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the \"Harbour arm\" remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.\n\nBetween 1903 and 1919 Fred Judge FRPS photographed many of the towns events and disasters.  These included storms, the first tram, visit of the Lord Mayor of London, Hastings Marathon Race and the pier fire of 1917. Many of these images were produced as picture postcards by the British Postcard manufacturer he founded now known as [[Judges Postcards]].\n\nIn the 1930s, the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt, and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, later became a holiday camp before closing in 1986. It was demolished, but the area is still known by locals as \"The Old Bathing Pool\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|title=The Bathing Pool at Hastings and St Leonards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517053426/http://seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Hastings Old Town July 1965.jpg|thumb|Hastings Old Town July 1965.]]\nThe 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:EastSussexHastings.png|thumb|right|Borough of Hastings, shown within East Sussex]]\n\n{{details|Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nHastings returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from the 14th century until 1885, since when it has returned one.

Prior to 1983, the town formed  the [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings parliamentary constituency]] by itself.\n\nHastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the [[Domesday Book]] refers to a ''new Borough'': as a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\".<ref name=\"Hastings Past\"/> Its importance was such that it also gave its name to one of the six [[Rape (county subdivision)|Rapes]] or administrative districts of Sussex.\n\n[[File:Hastings Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1197481.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Town Hall]]\nBy a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the [[Georgian era]], patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby [[Brighton]]) gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a [[County Borough]], responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], that status was abolished.\n\nHastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below [[East Sussex County Council]].

In Victorian times and later the town has spread westwards and northwards, and now forms a single urban centre with the more suburban area of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] to the west. Roads from the Old Town valley lead towards the Victorian area of Clive Vale and the former village of [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]], from which \"The Ridge\", marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]]. Beyond [[Bulverhythe]], the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as [[Glyne Gap]], separating it from [[Bexhill-on-Sea]].\n\nThe sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of [[Fairlight, East Sussex|Fairlight]].\n\nThe beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide. The town is generally built upon a series of low hills rising to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at \"The Ridge\" before falling back in the river valley further to the north.\n\n[[File:Fossilised dinosaur footprint fairlght cliffs 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Dinosaur footprint found amongst rocks at the cliff base]]\nThere are three [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] within the borough; [[Marline Valley Woods]], [[Combe Haven]] and [[Hastings Country Park|Hastings Cliffs To Pett Beach]]. Marline Valley Woods lies within the Ashdown ward of Hastings. It is an [[ancient woodland]] of [[Quercus robur|Pedunculate oak]]\u2014[[Carpinus betulus|hornbeam]] which is uncommon nationally.

areas===\nSome of the areas and suburbs of Hastings are [[Ore Valley]], [[St Leonards on Sea|St Leonards]], [[Silverhill, East Sussex|Silverhill]], [[Bulverhythe|West St Leonards]], and [[Hollington, East Sussex|Hollington]]. Ore, Silverhill and Hollington were once villages that have since become part of the Hastings conurbation area during rapid growth.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original part St Leonards was bought by [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]] and laid out by his son, the architect [[Decimus Burton]], in the early 19th century as a new town: a place of elegant houses designed for the well-off; it also included a central public garden, a hotel, an archery, [[assembly rooms]] and [[St Leonard's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea|a church]]. Today's St Leonards has extended well beyond that original design, although the original town still exists within it.<ref name=\"1066stl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|title=Burton's St Leonards|publisher=1066online|accessdate=29 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101223206/http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|archivedate=1 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nThe population of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the [[High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and [[Rother District|Rother]] district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades.<ref name=\"Local Development Framework\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |title=Local Development Framework |publisher=Hastings Online |accessdate=17 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309142442/http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2006 }}</ref> This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm|title=House of Commons - Communities and Local Government Committee - Second Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027065240/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

[[Symeon of Durham]] records the victory of [[Offa]] in 771 over the ''Hestingorum gens'', that is, \"the people of the Hastings tribe.\" [[Hastingleigh]] in Kent was named after that tribe.

However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that ''H\u00e6stingaceaster'' may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at [[Pevensey]].<ref>Pamela Combes and Malcolm Lyne, \"Hastings, Haestingaceaster and Haestingaport: a question of identity,\" ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'', 133 (1995), 213\u201324. {{ISSN|0143-8204}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of prehistoric settlements have been found at the town site: flint arrowheads and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts have been found. [[Iron Age]] forts have been excavated on both the East and West Hills. This suggests that the inhabitants moved early to the safety of the valley in between the forts. The settlement was already based on the port when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] arrived in Britain for the first time in 55&nbsp;BC. At this time, they began to [[Iron industry of Ashdown Forest|exploit the iron]] (Wealden rocks provide a plentiful supply of the ore), and shipped it out by boat.

The Beauport site was abandoned, and the town suffered from problems from nature and man-made attacks. The Sussex coast has always suffered from occasional violent storms; with the additional hazard of [[longshore drift]] (the eastward movement of shingle along the coast), the coastline has been frequently changing.

It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the town's outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That \"New Burgh\" was founded in 1069 and is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as such. [[William the Conqueror|William]] defeated and killed [[Harold Godwinson]], the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army, thus opening England to the Norman conquest.\n\nWilliam caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.\n\nHastings was shown as a [[borough]] by the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086); it had also given its name to the [[Rape of Hastings]], one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\". By a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589, the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.\n\nMuslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], writing c.1153, described Hastings as \"a town of large extent and many inhabitants, flourishing and handsome, having markets, workpeople and rich merchants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |title=Al-Idrisi; The Book of Roger The description of L'Angleterre |accessdate=2016-12-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922081246/http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Hastings and the sea===\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Fish Market at Hastings Beach - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Fish Market at Hastings Beach'', [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] (1810)]]\n\nBy the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland (since demolished). It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.\n\nIn the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the [[Cinque Ports]]; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Dover]] and [[New Romney]] being the first, Hastings and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] followed, all finally being joined by [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Winchelsea]], at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated with the group.\n\n[[File:Hastings Castle 2012-07-28.jpg|thumb|[[Hastings Castle]], with the Pier and Town Centre in the background, and [[Eastbourne]] on the horizon]]\n\nIn the 13th century, much of the town and half of [[Hastings Castle]] was washed away in the [[South England flood of February 1287]]. During a [[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|naval campaign of 1339]], and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings' days were finished.\n\n[[File:Hastings town centre postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings town centre and the Memorial from an old postcard]]\nHastings had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.\n\nHastings was then just a small fishing settlement, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling; the town was ideally located for that purpose.<ref name=\"Smuggling on the Sussex Coast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |title=Hastings Museum |publisher=Smuggling on the Sussex Coast |accessdate=10 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318003820/http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are \"[[St Clement's Caves]]\", partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called health-giving properties of seawater, as well as the local springs and Roman baths. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley.\n\n[[File:Bottle Alley Hastings.jpg|thumb|right|The double decker promenade that runs from Hastings Pier beyond Marine Court (seen in the distance), with a break at Warrior Square, was built in the 1930s by the borough engineer [[Sidney Little]]]]\nIt was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent (designed by architect [[Joseph Kay (architect)|Joseph Kay]]) is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle (its name recalling the old chapel in the castle above) now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]].\n\nThe extensive development meant that a large transient work-force was required. Many of the people coming in to Hastings at this time, settled on some waste-ground to the west of the main town called the [[America Ground]]. This land, originally a shingle spit created by the great storm of 1287, was declared to be Crown Property after an inquiry held at [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] during 1827 and the land was cleared in preparation for the development of this area of land by [[Patrick Francis Robertson]].<ref>[http://wiki.historymap.info/Category:America_Ground Hastings local history Wiki]</ref>\n\n{{main|Hastings Old Town}}\n\n[[File:Historische Altstadt-Hastings.JPG|thumb|left|George Street, Old town]]\nLike many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the [[Victorian era]]. In 1801, its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831, it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891, it was almost sixty thousand.\n\nThe last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the \"Harbour arm\" remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.\n\nBetween 1903 and 1919 Fred Judge FRPS photographed many of the towns events and disasters.  These included storms, the first tram, visit of the Lord Mayor of London, Hastings Marathon Race and the pier fire of 1917. Many of these images were produced as picture postcards by the British Postcard manufacturer he founded now known as [[Judges Postcards]].\n\nIn the 1930s, the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt, and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, later became a holiday camp before closing in 1986. It was demolished, but the area is still known by locals as \"The Old Bathing Pool\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|title=The Bathing Pool at Hastings and St Leonards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517053426/http://seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Hastings Old Town July 1965.jpg|thumb|Hastings Old Town July 1965.]]\nThe 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:EastSussexHastings.png|thumb|right|Borough of Hastings, shown within East Sussex]]\n\n{{details|Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nHastings returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from the 14th century until 1885, since when it has returned one. Since 1983, it has been part of the  [[Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary constituency of Hastings and Rye]]; the current MP, since [[2019 United Kingdom general election|December 2019]], is [[Sally-Ann Hart]] of the Conservative Party. Prior to 1983, the town formed  the [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings parliamentary constituency]] by itself.\n\nHastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the [[Domesday Book]] refers to a ''new Borough'': as a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\".<ref name=\"Hastings Past\"/> Its importance was such that it also gave its name to one of the six [[Rape (county subdivision)|Rapes]] or administrative districts of Sussex.\n\n[[File:Hastings Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1197481.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Town Hall]]\nBy a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the [[Georgian era]], patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby [[Brighton]]) gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a [[County Borough]], responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], that status was abolished.\n\nHastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below [[East Sussex County Council]]. The Labour Party has an overall control of the council with 23 seats, whilst the Conservative Party holds 9 seats and one is held by an independent. The Borough is divided into sixteen [[Wards of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]]; Ashdown, Baird, Braybrooke, Castle, Central [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]], Conquest, Gensing, [[Hollington, East Sussex|Hollington]], Maze Hill, [[Hastings Old Town|Old Hastings]], [[Ore, East Sussex|Ore]], St Helens, [[Silverhill, Hastings|Silverhill]], Tressell, [[West St Leonards]] and Wishing Tree.<ref name=\"Wards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/wards/default.aspx |title=Map of ward boundaries |publisher=Hastings Online |accessdate=17 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223155044/http://hastings.gov.uk/wards/default.aspx |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref> The council leader is Peter Chowney, who stood against Sally-Ann Hart as the Labour candidate in the 2019 General Election .<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000735 |title=Hastings election result: Conservatives hold onto Hastings and Rye with significantly increased majority of 4043}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:East Cliff Lift Re-opening - geograph.org.uk - 1773330.jpg|thumb|left|The East Hill Cliff]]\n[[File:Hastings East Cliff.jpg|thumb|right|East Cliff at Hastings]]\nHastings is situated where the [[sandstone]] beds, at the heart of the [[Weald]], known geologically as the Hastings Sands, meet the [[English Channel]], forming tall cliffs to the east of the town. [[Hastings Old Town]] is in a sheltered valley between the East Hill and West Hill (on which the remains of the Castle stand). In Victorian times and later the town has spread westwards and northwards, and now forms a single urban centre with the more suburban area of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] to the west. Roads from the Old Town valley lead towards the Victorian area of Clive Vale and the former village of [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]], from which \"The Ridge\", marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]]. Beyond [[Bulverhythe]], the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as [[Glyne Gap]], separating it from [[Bexhill-on-Sea]].\n\nThe sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of [[Fairlight, East Sussex|Fairlight]].\n\nThe beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide. The town is generally built upon a series of low hills rising to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at \"The Ridge\" before falling back in the river valley further to the north.\n\n[[File:Fossilised dinosaur footprint fairlght cliffs 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Dinosaur footprint found amongst rocks at the cliff base]]\nThere are three [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] within the borough; [[Marline Valley Woods]], [[Combe Haven]] and [[Hastings Country Park|Hastings Cliffs To Pett Beach]].

Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and [[Rother District|Rother]] district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings.
