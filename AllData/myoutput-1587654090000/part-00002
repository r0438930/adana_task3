For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give misleading information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas). The proposed systematic names and their notation for these reliability coefficients are as follows: <ref name = Cho/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Systematic names of reliability coefficients\n|-\n!  !!

However, this interpretation overlooks the fact that <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> underestimes reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. At the population level, the maximum of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values is closer to reliability than the average of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values.<ref name=ChoKim/> This mathematical fact was already known even before the publication of Cronbach (1951).<ref name=Guttman>Guttman, L.

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>).

He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\nThis anomaly was first pointed out by Cronbach (1943)<ref name=c1943/> to criticize <math> \\rho_{T}</math>, but Cronbach (1951)<ref name=Cronbach/> did not comment on this problem in his article, which Cronbach and Shavelson (2004) <ref name=c2004/> described as being \"encyclopedic\" (p.396).\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math>\\rho_{T}=.9375</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>2</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>2</math> || <math>2</math> || <math>4</math>\n|}\nFor the above data, both <math>\\rho_{P}</math> and <math>\\rho_{C}</math> have a value of one.\n===A high value of tau-equivalent reliability indicates homogeneity between the items===\nMany textbooks refer to <math>\\rho_{T}</math> as an indicator of homogeneity between items. This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high <math> \\rho_{T}</math> values do not indicate unidimensionality.<ref name=Cortina>Cortina, J. M. (1993). What is coefficient alpha?

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P.

It is also recommended that the whole sample be divided into two and cross-validated.<ref name=KL/>\n\n== Ideal reliability level and how to increase reliability ==\n=== Nunnally's recommendations for the level of reliability===\nThe most frequently cited source of how much reliability coefficients should be is Nunnally's book.<ref name=n1>Nunnally, J. C. (1967). Psychometric theory. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n2>Nunnally, J. C. (1978). Psychometric theory (2nd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n3>Nunnally, J. C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

The assumption he used is essential tau-equivalence in modern terms.\n\n====Recognition of  KR-20's original formula and general formula at the time====\nThe two formulas were recognized to be exactly identical, and the expression of general formula of KR-20 was not used. Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Journal of Educational Psychology, 34(8), 485\u2013494. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0058608</ref>\n\n====Criticism of underestimation of KR-20====\nDevelopers<ref name=KR/> of this formula reported that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> consistently underestimates reliability. Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1.

Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not.

If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items. That is, <math>\\sigma^2_t=\\overline{\\sigma_{ij}}</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_T=Var(\\sum_{i=1}^k t)=k^2 \\sigma^2_t = k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} </math>\n\nLet <math> \\rho_T </math> denote the reliability when satisfying the above assumptions. <math> \\rho_T</math> is:\n\n</br><math>\\rho_T = {k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} \\over \\sigma^2_X} </math>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/spsstutorial/files/tutorials/cronbachs-alpha.pdf Cronbach's alpha SPSS tutorial]\n* The free web interface and R package cocron [http://comparingcronbachalphas.org] allows to statistically compare two or more dependent or independent cronbach alpha coefficients.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cronbach's Alpha}}\n[[Category:Comparison of assessments]]\n[[Category:Psychometrics]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology research methods]]\n", "name_user": "Eunscho", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha"}
