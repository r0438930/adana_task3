While officially an [[extended play]], it was treated as a studio album when released. According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], the album has shipped over five million copies in the United States. \"[[Patience (Guns N' Roses song)|Patience]]\" was the only single released from ''Lies'', and peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4416/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title = Allmusic (Guns N Roses charts and awards) Billboard singles|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Background and recording==\n===Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide===\n{{See also|Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide}}\n\nThe first four tracks consist of the previously released [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide]]''.

The good news is that Lies is a lot more interesting than that... The calm folk-rock melodies of these four acoustic songs reveal yet another welcome facet of Guns n\u2019 Roses.

Neither recorded live nor released by an indie label, Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide is competent bar band boogie, without the energy or danger of Appetite for Destruction. The new songs are considerably more problematic. \"Patience\" is Guns N' Roses at their prettiest and their sappiest, the most direct song they recorded to date.

These four tracks were included as bonus tracks on the 2018 reissue of [[Appetite for Destruction]].\n\n=== G N' R Lies ===\nThe last four songs were recorded with [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitars]]. They were written and recorded in only a few studio sessions (with the exception of \"You're Crazy,\" which appeared in an alternative version on ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]''), which producer [[Mike Clink]] called \"one of those magical rock and roll history moments.\"\n\nIn later interviews, Axl Rose stated that while he loved how the band sounded on the last four songs, he hated the sound of his voice. Rose recalled that his voice was husky and scratchy from the band's lengthy touring at the time, and if he could he would have re-recorded his vocal tracks in a separate session.\n\nA significantly faster version of \"You're Crazy\" with electric guitars had previously been released on the band's debut album, ''Appetite for Destruction'', and was now recorded as originally intended.<ref name=\"yourecrazy\">{{cite web|url=http://gnrsource.com/songinfo/afd/crazy.htm |title=Song info at GNRSource.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071021005816/http://gnrsource.com/songinfo/afd/crazy.htm |archivedate= 2007-10-21}}</ref> \n\"[[Used to Love Her]]\" was written as a joke after [[Izzy Stradlin]] disliked a song he heard on the radio featuring \"some guy whining about a broad who was treating him bad\".

The good news is that Lies is a lot more interesting than that... The calm folk-rock melodies of these four acoustic songs reveal yet another welcome facet of Guns n\u2019 Roses.

Neither recorded live nor released by an indie label, Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide is competent bar band boogie, without the energy or danger of Appetite for Destruction. The new songs are considerably more problematic. \"Patience\" is Guns N' Roses at their prettiest and their sappiest, the most direct song they recorded to date.
