The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] and bore the expected hallmarks of [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial]] origin.\n\nAstronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. He was so impressed by the result that he circled the reading on the computer printout, \"6EQUJ5\", and wrote the comment ''\"Wow!\"'' on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126510251|title=Aliens Found In Ohio?

Many hypotheses have been advanced on the origin of the emission, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them adequately explain the signal.<ref name=Skeptoid/>\n\nAlthough the Wow! signal had no detectable [[modulation]]\u2014a technique used to transmit information over radio waves\u2014it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.<ref name=Skeptoid/>\n\n== Background ==\nIn a 1959 paper, [[Cornell University]] physicists [[Philip Morrison]] and [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] had speculated that any [[extraterrestrial civilization]] attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of {{val|1420}} [[megahertz]] ({{val|21}} [[centimeters]]), which is [[Hydrogen line|naturally emitted by hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\">{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/chasing-ufos/articles/what-is-the-wow-signal/|title=What is the Wow! signal?|last=Kiger|first=Patrick J.|date=2012-06-21|website=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, after completing an extensive [[Ohio Sky Survey|survey of extragalactic radio sources]], Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] (nicknamed \"Big Ear\") to the scientific [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), in the longest-running program of its kind in history. The radio telescope was located near the [[Perkins Observatory]] on the campus of [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]].\n\nBy 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an [[IBM 1130]] computer and recorded on [[line printer]] paper. While perusing data collected on August 15 at 22:16&nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (02:16&nbsp;[[UTC]]), he spotted a series of values of signal intensity and frequency that left him and his colleagues astonished.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\" />\nThe event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory's director.<ref name=Kraus>John Kraus, Director, Ohio State Radio Observatory 31, January 1994, [http://jump2.nrao.edu/dbtw-wpd/textbase/Documents/kraus-wow-unpublished-30jan1994.pdf \"The Tantalizing WOW!

The signal itself appeared to be an unmodulated [[continuous wave]], although any [[modulation]] with a period of less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable.<ref name=\"Calib Wow\">{{cite web| last=Shuch| first=H.

The signal was [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Therefore, every 12 seconds the result for each frequency channel was outputted on the printout as a single character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a [[dimensionless]] multiple of the signal's [[standard deviation]].<ref name=\"code\">{{cite web | first = Jerry | last = Ehman | title = Explanation of the Code \"6EQUJ5\" On the Wow!

The numbers 1 to 9 denote the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above are indicated by a letter: \"A\" corresponds to intensities between 10 and 11, \"B\" to 11 to 12, and so on.

An [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]], which became the first [[local oscillator]], was ordered for the frequency of {{val|1450.4056|u=MHz}}. However, the university's purchasing department made a [[typographical error]] in the order and wrote {{val|1450.5056|u=MHz}} (i.e., {{val|0.1|u=MHz}} higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.\n\n=== Bandwidth ===\nThe Wow! signal was a [[narrowband]] emission: its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was less than {{val|10|u=kHz}}. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty {{val|10|u=kHz}}-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/>\n\n=== Time variation ===\nAt the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] (or height above the horizon), and relied instead on the [[rotation of the Earth]] to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.<ref name=Skeptoid>{{Skeptoid|id=4342|number=342|title=Was the Wow! Signal Alien?|accessdate=2016-10-08}}</ref> A continuous extraterrestrial signal, therefore, would be expected to register for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded intensity of such signal would display a gradual increase for the first 36 seconds\u2014peaking at the center of the observation window\u2014and then a gradual decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.<ref name=\"edn\">{{cite web | url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4394137/Big-Ear-receives--Wow--Signal--August-15--1977 | title=EDN Moments | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref><ref name=\"space_com\">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/shostak_wow_20021205.htm | first = Seth | last = Shostak | title = Interstellar Signal From the 70s Continues to Puzzle Researchers | publisher = Space.com | date = 2002-12-05 | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== Celestial location ==\n[[File:Wow! signal source.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The two regions of space in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] from where the Wow! signal may have originated.

The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] and bore the expected hallmarks of [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial]] origin.\n\nAstronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. He was so impressed by the result that he circled the reading on the computer printout, \"6EQUJ5\", and wrote the comment ''\"Wow!\"'' on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126510251|title=Aliens Found In Ohio?

Many hypotheses have been advanced on the origin of the emission, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them adequately explain the signal.<ref name=Skeptoid/>\n\nAlthough the Wow! signal had no detectable [[modulation]]\u2014a technique used to transmit information over radio waves\u2014it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.<ref name=Skeptoid/>\n\n== Background ==\nIn a 1959 paper, [[Cornell University]] physicists [[Philip Morrison]] and [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] had speculated that any [[extraterrestrial civilization]] attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of {{val|1420}} [[megahertz]] ({{val|21}} [[centimeters]]), which is [[Hydrogen line|naturally emitted by hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\">{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/chasing-ufos/articles/what-is-the-wow-signal/|title=What is the Wow! signal?|last=Kiger|first=Patrick J.|date=2012-06-21|website=National Geographic Channel|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, after completing an extensive [[Ohio Sky Survey|survey of extragalactic radio sources]], Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] (nicknamed \"Big Ear\") to the scientific [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), in the longest-running program of its kind in history. The radio telescope was located near the [[Perkins Observatory]] on the campus of [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]].\n\nBy 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an [[IBM 1130]] computer and recorded on [[line printer]] paper. While perusing data collected on August 15 at 22:16&nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (02:16&nbsp;[[UTC]]), he spotted a series of values of signal intensity and frequency that left him and his colleagues astonished.<ref name=\"Nat Geo\" />\nThe event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory's director.<ref name=Kraus>John Kraus, Director, Ohio State Radio Observatory 31, January 1994, [http://jump2.nrao.edu/dbtw-wpd/textbase/Documents/kraus-wow-unpublished-30jan1994.pdf \"The Tantalizing WOW!

The signal itself appeared to be an unmodulated [[continuous wave]], although any [[modulation]] with a period of less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable.<ref name=\"Calib Wow\">{{cite web| last=Shuch| first=H.

The signal was [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Therefore, every 12 seconds the result for each frequency channel was outputted on the printout as a single character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a [[dimensionless]] multiple of the signal's [[standard deviation]].<ref name=\"code\">{{cite web | first = Jerry | last = Ehman | title = Explanation of the Code \"6EQUJ5\" On the Wow!

The numbers 1 to 9 denote the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above are indicated by a letter: \"A\" corresponds to intensities between 10 and 11, \"B\" to 11 to 12, and so on.

An [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]], which became the first [[local oscillator]], was ordered for the frequency of {{val|1450.4056|u=MHz}}. However, the university's purchasing department made a [[typographical error]] in the order and wrote {{val|1450.5056|u=MHz}} (i.e., {{val|0.1|u=MHz}} higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.\n\n=== Bandwidth ===\nThe Wow! signal was a [[narrowband]] emission: its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was less than {{val|10|u=kHz}}. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty {{val|10|u=kHz}}-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/>\n\n=== Time variation ===\nAt the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] (or height above the horizon), and relied instead on the [[rotation of the Earth]] to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.<ref name=Skeptoid>{{Skeptoid|id=4342|number=342|title=Was the Wow!
