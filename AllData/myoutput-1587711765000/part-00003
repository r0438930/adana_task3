She founded the liver unit which was located in a temporary wooden structure on the roof of the hospital in [[Gray\u2019s Inn Road]]. Despite its location, the department attracted trainees from around the world, and many current leaders in the field of hepatology spent time there. Research in several different areas of liver disease was undertaken: including; [[bilirubin]] metabolism, [[haemochromatosis]], [[cholestasis]], [[Hepatotoxicity|drug-induced liver disease]], [[albumin]] synthesis, portal hypertension and ascites, [[Autoimmune hepatitis|autoimmune liver disease]] and its treatment with [[corticosteroid]]s, and the use of [[liver biopsy]] in the diagnosis of liver disease were all studied. In 1974 the department moved to the new hospital in Hampstead, where it was situated close to the clinical wards, on the 10th floor. Research continued there, with viral hepatitis, [[liver transplantation]] and [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] treatment of [[Esophageal varices|varices]] all becoming important areas of study. She retired from the Chair of Medicine in 1983, but continued to see patients, conduct research, and write.\n\n===Affiliations===\n* Co-founder (with Hans Popper) and president, International Association for the Study of the Liver (1958\u20131962)\n* Councillor (1964-1968), Censor (1970\u201372), Senior Censor and Vice President (1976\u201377) [[Royal College of Physicians]]<ref name=\":1\" /> - Sherlock was the first woman Vice President of the Royal College of Physicians\n* President, [[British Society of Gastroenterology]] (1973)\n* Member of Senate, [[University of London]] (1976\u201377)<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Founder, and later President, [[The British Liver Trust|British Liver Trust]] (1988\u20132001)\n* Founder, American Association for the Study of Liver Disease\nShe delivered several of the Royal College of Physicians lectures including the [[Bradshaw Lecture]] (1961), Humphry Davy Rolleston (1968) and [[Lumleian Lectures]] (1978) and [[Harveian Oration]] (1985).<ref name=\"MunksRoll\">{{cite web|url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/5114|title=Munks Roll - Sheila Patricia Violet Sherlock|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Publications===\nSherlock was known as a clear and succinct writer, and she published over 600 papers in scientific journals.

She founded the liver unit which was located in a temporary wooden structure on the roof of the hospital in [[Gray\u2019s Inn Road]]. Despite its location, the department attracted trainees from around the world, and many current leaders in the field of hepatology spent time there. Research in several different areas of liver disease was undertaken: including; [[bilirubin]] metabolism, [[haemochromatosis]], [[cholestasis]], [[Hepatotoxicity|drug-induced liver disease]], [[albumin]] synthesis, portal hypertension and ascites, [[Autoimmune hepatitis|autoimmune liver disease]] and its treatment with [[corticosteroid]]s, and the use of [[liver biopsy]] in the diagnosis of liver disease were all studied. In 1974 the department moved to the new hospital in Hampstead, where it was situated close to the clinical wards, on the 10th floor. Research continued there, with viral hepatitis, [[liver transplantation]] and [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] treatment of [[Esophageal varices|varices]] all becoming important areas of study. She retired from the Chair of Medicine in 1983, but continued to see patients, conduct research, and write.\n\n===Affiliations===\n* Co-founder (with Hans Popper) and president, International Association for the Study of the Liver (1958\u20131962)\n* Councillor (1964-1968), Censor (1970\u201372), Senior Censor and Vice President (1976\u201377) [[Royal College of Physicians]]<ref name=\":1\" /> - Sherlock was the first woman Vice President of the Royal College of Physicians\n* President, [[British Society of Gastroenterology]] (1973)\n* Member of Senate, [[University of London]] (1976\u201377)<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Founder, and later President, [[The British Liver Trust|British Liver Trust]] (1988\u20132001)\n* Founder, American Association for the Study of Liver Disease\nShe delivered several of the Royal College of Physicians lectures including the [[Bradshaw Lecture]] (1961), Humphry Davy Rolleston (1968) and [[Lumleian Lectures]] (1978) and [[Harveian Oration]] (1985).<ref name=\"MunksRoll\">{{cite web|url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/5114|title=Munks Roll - Sheila Patricia Violet Sherlock|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Publications===\nSherlock was known as a clear and succinct writer, and she published over 600 papers in scientific journals.

Her approach improved the understanding of the pathology of liver disease and is continues to be used in the diagnosis of liver diseases today. The liver unit that she set up at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] became the centre for both research into liver disease and the education of trainees in the specialty.\n\nIn 1966, she developed, with [[Deborah Doniach]] of the [[Middlesex Hospital]], the standard test for [[Primary biliary cirrhosis|Primary Biliary Cirrhosis]]<ref name=\"Doniach1966\">{{cite journal |author=D.
