'''''Arkham Horror''''' is a cooperative [[adventure board game]] designed by Richard Launius, originally published in 1987 by [[Chaosium]]. The game is based on Chaosium's [[roleplaying game]] [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'']], which is set in the [[Cthulhu mythos]] of [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and other [[horror fiction|horror]] writers. The game's second edition was released by [[Fantasy Flight Games]] in 2005, with a third edition in 2019.

==Overview==
<!-- Note: Try to keep the overview general to _both_ editions of game.  Edition specific things should be in the edition specific sections below. -->
The game board is set in Lovecraft's fictional [[Massachusetts]] town of [[Arkham]] in 1926. Street, building and outdoor locations are featured. Gates to other [[Parallel universe (fiction)|planes]] open throughout the town (represented by tokens placed on the board.)  Players take on the role of investigators, represented by a character card. Each investigator has several attributes (such as \"sanity\"), and cards representing items, spells, and other things. The investigators travel through the city, avoiding or fighting the monsters that enter through the gates, visiting city locations to acquire tools, and ultimately entering the gates.  After traveling to the other world and returning, the investigator can try to close the gate.  While exploring city locations or other worlds, the investigators face random events which may benefit or harm them.  As gates open, a \"Doom Track\" advances; if the track reaches its end, a powerful horrific creature known as the Ancient One breaks through into Arkham.  In the 1987 edition of the game, this ends the game, and all players lose.  In the second edition, when the doom track fills, this typically begins a final opportunity for the players to directly defeat the creature and win; otherwise they lose.

==History==
''Arkham Horror'' was originally submitted to Chaosium Inc. by Richard Launius as ''Call of Cthulhu: The Board Game'', a new strategic game based on their [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing game]]. It was edited in-house by Chaosium, who added such features as the Doom Track, a method to track progress toward the total failure of the players, and was published in 1987 as ''Arkham Horror''.  The game won the \"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1987\" award in the [[Origins Awards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgames.com/awards/1987 |title=1987 List of Winners |accessdate=2007-07-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528075839/http://www.originsgames.com/awards/1987 |archivedate=2007-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> becoming the first Lovecraft themed board game to achieve significant popularity.<ref name=\"NPR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/530186764/h-p-lovecrafts-monster-is-wrapping-family-game-night-up-in-tentacles|title=H.P.

''Arkham Horror'' was one of several Lovecraft-based board games submitted by Launius, with other designs from the same period including 'The Trail of the Brotherhood', 'DreamQuests', and 'Imprisoned with the Pharaohs'. ''Arkham Horror'' was the only of these games to see professional publication.

The original printing of ''Arkham Horror'' sold out. Chaosium announced reprints several times, but they never occurred, and Chaosium discontinued production of the game in 1991.<ref name=dragon168 />

In 2004 online game company [[Skotos]] acquired the rights to ''Arkham Horror'' from Richard Launius, and later arranged publication with Fantasy Flight Games. The game underwent several revisions in this process. Skotos reorganized many of the elements in the game for improved cohesion and arranged for it to more carefully follow the maps of Arkham created by Chaosium and used in their own ''[[Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night]]'' online game. Launius added several new elements, including clue tokens and some rearrangements to the decks of cards. Finally, [[Kevin Wilson (game designer)|Kevin Wilson]] at Fantasy Flight massively revamped the game, throwing out a [[roll-and-move]] system as well as other concepts and also expanding much of the gameplay.  The 2005 edition shares art and other elements with Fantasy Flight Games' other Cthulhu Mythos-based game: ''[[Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game]]''.

The new edition was released in July 2005 and sold out, with a second reprinting also being released in 2005.

In early 2011, Fantasy Flight released ''[[Elder Sign (card game)|Elder Sign]]'', a game based on ''Arkham Horror'' but which provides a much faster paced alternative. By streamlining many of ''Arkham Horror’s'' mechanics and using dice to solve encounters, games of ''Elder Sign'' lasts 90 minutes on average, rather than 2–4 hours.

In 2016 at Arkham Nights, a celebration of Cthulhu games by Fantasy Flight Games, the original designer Richard Launius returned to host a special event using a modified version of the original game.  Multiple games were held over the course of the weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/9/28/the-gate-has-closed/|title=The Gate Has Closed|website=www.fantasyflightgames.com|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref>

==1987 edition==
[[File:Arkham Horror 1987 box.jpg|thumb|left|The box cover of the 1987 edition of ''Arkham Horror'']]
The 1987 version of ''Arkham Horror'' has the following game components: a board map of the town of Arkham; 99 playing cards with various events; 50 monster counters; two 4-page investigator rules sheets; eight investigator cards; eight pawns; and markers.<ref name=dragon168>{{cite journal|last=Rolston|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Rolston| date=April 1991 |title=Role-playing review: Game bored? Try these adventure board games!|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=168|pages=38}}</ref>  The cards and tokens are illustrated with black and white drawings and silhouettes. The map of Arkham consists of a set of intertwined routes with a large number of spaces. There are several locations off the routes, such as Miskatonic University or Dark's Carnival, where a player's investigator may have encounters, or where a gate to another world may appear. The other worlds themselves are in a row at the top of the game board. Encounter events in Arkham are determined by rolling a die and consulting a table for that location.

Investigators usually move a random number of spaces based on the roll of two six-sided dice. The investigator cards are pre-made, with four fixed attributes: Fast Talk, Fight, Knowledge, and Sneak. To successfully use an attribute, the player rolls one six-sided die to get a value equal or below the attribute's value. Paperclips are used to track two numbers that frequently change: Sanity and Strength.

The turns of the investigators are preceded by the \"Mythos Phase\", where a gate and monsters may appear. Monsters that appear move throughout the town, attacking any investigators they happen upon; seeing some monsters results in a sanity loss. In true Lovecraft fashion, if an investigator in the town loses all Sanity or Strength, they are ignored by the monsters. The collapsed investigator is transported to the Sanitarium or Hospital, as appropriate, for treatment. Such vital losses in the other worlds result in the death of the investigator, and the player must start a new one.

For each new gate that opens, the Doom Counter increases by one; the \"Doom of Arkham\" occurs if the Doom Counter reaches 14. If this happens, all players lose.

Victory is achieved by closing all of the gates that have opened. Closing a gate requires passing into it to another world, and taking two encounters there; upon return to Arkham, the investigator must attack the gate successfully to close it. Closing a gate reduces the Doom Counter by one.

===Reception===
In the April 1991 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue 168), [[Ken Rolston]] called the game his \"first choice for a board game with [fantasy role-playing game] feel. It has everything I want in this respect.\" Rolston was saddened that Chaosium had just discontinued production, saying, \"If you see a copy of this gem, buy it. Period.\"<ref name=dragon168 />

===Gameplay===
[[File:Deskohraní 2012 - 6749.JPG|thumbnail|A game of ''Arkham Horror'' being played in Prague in 2012]]
Each player selects an investigator character that is provided with the game. These characters have three pairs of statistics to represent their strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to \"slide\" their current focus on each scale towards either extreme or keep it relatively average. For example, ''Lore'' and ''Luck'' is one pair - if you maximize your character's Lore, you simultaneously minimize his or her Luck. Characters are further defined by a starting inventory and special abilities. Most importantly, each character has the stats of ''Sanity'' and ''Stamina''. These respectively measure the character's mental stability and physical health (i.e. [[hit points]]). The back of each card includes a brief history for the character, in case players wish to add an element of [[roleplaying]] to the game.

Each player's character is placed on the game board at the location specified on their card. They are given any items specified as well as their starting Sanity and Stamina tokens. At this time, the players should also pick which Ancient One they will be attempting to defeat. This is usually done by randomly drawing the Ancient One's card, but can also be selected intentionally if the players choose to do so.

The basic resolution mechanic is to roll a number of [[Dice|six-sided dice]] equal to the statistic, plus any modifiers. Results of a five or a six on a die is considered a success. Most checks only require a single success, with the general exception of Combat rolls when fighting monsters. For instance, a card may require a Lore -1 roll. If the character has a Lore stat of 4, they would roll three dice and if at least one die lands on a five or six the character has passed the roll (and may gain a benefit), otherwise he or she has failed (and may suffer a consequence).

Characters may also become Blessed, which allows them to succeed on a four or higher; or Cursed, which means they can only succeed on a roll of six. Throughout the game, characters collect Clue tokens; a Clue token can be spent to get a bonus die during a roll (after the original roll fails to produce enough successes). There are Skill cards that can be acquired, increasing a statistic by one as well as granting an extra bonus die when you spend a Clue token on that particular type of roll.

Each turn, the players move their characters on the board and either have Encounters at a location (by drawing cards specific to that board location) or fight monsters. They may also purchase items at some locations, or take advantage of other special features. For example, characters who spend a turn at Arkham Asylum will regain a point to their sanity score, or they may spend $2 in-game to regain their maximum sanity. Either way, it takes the place of their normal Encounter card draw for that turn.

Characters who encounter monsters have the option to sneak past them or fight them. Fighting a monster first involves a Sanity check, needing only a single success but losing Sanity tokens indicated on the monster if the roll fails. After that check, the character may cast spells or use weapons to affect the combat. If the monster is not immediately destroyed or removed from the board, they then roll Fight plus any bonuses from weapons, items or spells. Some monsters only require a single success, while others may require several to destroy.

At the end of each turn, the first player draws a card from the Mythos deck. This causes a gate to another world to open, as well as releasing new monsters onto the board, causing existing monsters to move on the board and often adding a new effect to gameplay. If enough monsters appear on the board, they are recycled, and the terror level of Arkham increases, indicating that Arkham is slowly being completely overrun by monsters. If the terror level rises high enough, stores begin to close and potential allies flee, and the Ancient One will awaken even faster once Arkham becomes completely infested. Weather may make it more difficult to move through the streets or a rumor might require investigators to complete an action in a certain number of turns to prevent even worse effects from happening. After the Mythos card is resolved, play passes clockwise to the next player to start a new turn.

Certain events add tokens to the Ancient One's card, representing how close it is to awakening. Typically, when a new gate opens a token goes onto the Ancient One's card. Gates may be closed by investigators through a die roll. Alternately, a gate may be sealed by spending Clue tokens, or with an [[Elder Sign (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Sign]] item. Sealing a gate prevents another gate from opening in that location again, and using an Elder Sign removes a token from the Ancient One.

If the Ancient One's card reaches a specified number, it awakens and investigators must immediately deal with the threat. Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves making rolls to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost.

===Expansions===
An expansion entitled ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'' was released in June, 2006, with a revised version released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkham Horror: The Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion (Revised Edition)|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/95683/arkham-horror-the-curse-of-the-dark-pharaoh-expans}}</ref> This expansion added many new cards to the game, including items and encounters. The theme was that a travelling museum exhibit from Egypt has arrived in Arkham, bringing with it accursed artifacts and strange happenings. Heavy emphasis is placed on [[Nyarlathotep]], one of Lovecraft's iconic Outer Gods.

The second expansion entitled ''Dunwich Horror'' was released during [[Gen Con]] 2006. Based on Lovecraft's short story ''[[The Dunwich Horror]]'', it includes a new board that is placed against the original Arkham Horror board. This new board features locations in the town of Dunwich. Investigators may visit Dunwich by travelling through the Train Station in Arkham or using certain vehicle items. In addition, the game includes new Encounter, Mythos and item cards as well as new mechanics, such as the stalking monster movement, and new Great Old Ones. When a character loses their last point of Sanity, they may take a Madness card which imposes restrictions on the character and restores their maximum Sanity, instead of losing half of their items and clues. A similar Injury deck is provided for investigators who reach zero Stamina. Plus, a new monster, the Dunwich Horror itself, is provided as a special monster whose powers vary from combat to combat.

A third expansion, ''The King in Yellow'', was confirmed in October 2006 and released in June 2007. Like ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'', it is a card-only expansion, which this time focuses on a mysterious play that is being performed in Arkham. Based on the [[Robert W. Chambers]] story ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', this expansion introduces the mechanic of the Herald&nbsp;— a special card that permanently alters the game rules.  The first Herald is The King in Yellow himself, which causes the Doom track to increase every time the Terror track does unless you take a permanent penalty. Support for The Dark Pharaoh has since been added on the ''Fantasy Flight Games'' website as a Herald for the ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'' expansion. A third Herald has also been added on  the Fantasy Flight Games website for the ''Dunwich Horror'' expansion.

A fourth expansion, ''[[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]] Horror'', was released in June 2008. It is similar to [[Dunwich Horror]] in that it is board-based rather than card-based.  This expansion adds the additional locations of Kingsport, a new game element of Dimensional Rifts, and aquatic monsters that may move to any other \"aquatic\" location instead of following normal routes.  The expansion also includes new Ancient Ones, new Investigators, new Heralds and introduces Guardians which assist the players much the way Heralds hinder them.

A fifth expansion, ''Black Goat of the Woods'', was released at [[Gen Con]] in August 2008. Another cards-only expansion, the set adds another Herald, a new membership similar to the Silver Twilight Lodge, a new element called Corruption, and difficulty cards that allow you to make the game optionally easier or harder.  In addition, the expansion includes additional Mythos, Gate, Encounter, Spell, Skill, and Unique and Common item cards to be incorporated into the original game.

A sixth expansion, ''[[Innsmouth]] Horror'', was announced on the Fantasy Flight Games Website in February 2009 and released in May 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=574 | title =   Innsmouth Horror is now on sale!   | accessdate = 2009-05-28 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090601061237/http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=574| archivedate= 1 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The third board expansion adds the town of Innsmouth as well as 16 new investigators, 8 new Ancient Ones, and two new Heralds. Also included are new personal stories cards for investigators, monsters, and encounter cards.

A seventh expansion, ''The Lurker at the Threshold'' was announced in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com./edge_news.asp?eidn=1107 | title = Announcing The Lurker at the Threshold - an expansion for Arkham Horror  | accessdate = 2010-02-15 }}</ref> It was released by Fantasy Flight Games in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1484 | title =   Cross the Threshold   3     | accessdate = 2010-07-16 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719101535/http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1484| archivedate= 19 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> This is a small expansion, including a new herald sheet along with over 100 location cards, new Mythos, Gate cards, spells, etc. This expansion includes 18 Gate Markers, designed to replace original ones, and introduces new challenges for investigators trying to seal them. In addition new special Relationship cards were included, which describe how the investigator to your left is related to you and grants some benefit. Also, a new mechanic of making pacts with the Lurker itself were introduced.

An eighth expansion, ''Miskatonic Horror'' was announced in February 2011<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1989 | title = Growing the Gathering Darkness Announcing Miskatonic Horror, a unique Arkham Horror expansion | accessdate = 2011-06-10 }}</ref> and released in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2455 | title = Miskatonic Horror, an expansion for Arkham Horror, is now available  | accessdate = 2011-10-23 }}</ref> The eighth expansion adds nearly 450 new cards, including new Skill, Gate, and Mythos cards. This expansion adds mostly to the other Arkham Horror expansions apart from the main game. Also, new player reference sheets as well as a new Institution variant has been added.

===Reception===
Ben Kuchera reviewed the game for ''[[Ars Technica]]'', and noted that in a game with 700 tokens \"brevity is not one of its strengths... A short game is still measured in hours, and learning to play the game smoothly takes some time. Even with seasoned players, simply setting everything up can take a while, and once you begin adding expansions, the amount of space you need to enjoy the game is increased.\" He concluded that this may not be a game for new players, or players not used to complicated rules systems, saying, \"it's a big, long, complicated game. It's only fun if you have a regular group of gaming friends who get don't mind learning something that's not immediately intuitive. But if you have the space, the time, and the friends... it's worth the investment.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100806190344/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/08/arkham-horror-may-not-be-easy-but-it-sure-is-great.ars | title =700 pieces, 5 hours, 1 Elder God: Hands-on with Arkham Horror | last =Kuchera | first =Ben | date =2010-08-05 | website =Ars Technica | access-date =2019-07-10}}</ref>

==2018 edition==
A third edition of ''Arkham horror'' was released by Fantasy Flight Games on November 1, 2018.<ref>https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/11/1/the-end-is-here/</ref> This version incorporates design elements from ''[[Eldritch Horror]]'' and ''[[Arkham Horror: The Card Game]]''.

'''''Arkham Horror''''' is a cooperative [[adventure board game]] designed by Richard Launius, originally published in 1987 by [[Chaosium]]. The game is based on Chaosium's [[roleplaying game]] [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'']], which is set in the [[Cthulhu mythos]] of [[H.P. Lovecraft]] and other [[horror fiction|horror]] writers. The game's second edition was released by [[Fantasy Flight Games]] in 2005, with a third edition in 2019. 

==Overview==

The game board is set in Lovecraft's fictional [[Massachusetts]] town of [[Arkham]] in 1926. Street, building and outdoor locations are featured. Gates to other [[Parallel universe (fiction)|planes]] open throughout the town (represented by tokens placed on the board.)  Players take on the role of investigators, represented by a character card. Each investigator has several attributes (such as \"sanity\"), and cards representing items, spells, and other things. The investigators travel through the city, avoiding or fighting the monsters that enter through the gates, visiting city locations to acquire tools, and ultimately entering the gates.  After traveling to the other world and returning, the investigator can try to close the gate.  While exploring city locations or other worlds, the investigators face random events which may benefit or harm them.  As gates open, a \"Doom Track\" advances; if the track reaches its end, a powerful horrific creature known as the Ancient One breaks through into Arkham.  In the 1987 edition of the game, this ends the game, and all players lose.  In the second edition, when the doom track fills, this typically begins a final opportunity for the players to directly defeat the creature and win; otherwise they lose.

These respectively measure the character's mental stability and physical health (i.e. [[hit points]]). The back of each card includes a brief history for the character, in case players wish to add an element of [[roleplaying]] to the game.

Each player's character is placed on the game board at the location specified on their card. They are given any items specified as well as their starting Sanity and Stamina tokens. At this time, the players should also pick which Ancient One they will be attempting to defeat. This is usually done by randomly drawing the Ancient One's card, but can also be selected intentionally if the players choose to do so.

The basic resolution mechanic is to roll a number of [[Dice|six-sided dice]] equal to the statistic, plus any modifiers. Results of a five or a six on a die is considered a success. Most checks only require a single success, with the general exception of Combat rolls when fighting monsters. For instance, a card may require a Lore -1 roll. If the character has a Lore stat of 4, they would roll three dice and if at least one die lands on a five or six the character has passed the roll (and may gain a benefit), otherwise he or she has failed (and may suffer a consequence).

Characters may also become Blessed, which allows them to succeed on a four or higher; or Cursed, which means they can only succeed on a roll of six. Throughout the game, characters collect Clue tokens; a Clue token can be spent to get a bonus die during a roll (after the original roll fails to produce enough successes). There are Skill cards that can be acquired, increasing a statistic by one as well as granting an extra bonus die when you spend a Clue token on that particular type of roll.

Each turn, the players move their characters on the board and either have Encounters at a location (by drawing cards specific to that board location) or fight monsters. They may also purchase items at some locations, or take advantage of other special features. For example, characters who spend a turn at Arkham Asylum will regain a point to their sanity score, or they may spend $2 in-game to regain their maximum sanity. Either way, it takes the place of their normal Encounter card draw for that turn.

Characters who encounter monsters have the option to sneak past them or fight them. Fighting a monster first involves a Sanity check, needing only a single success but losing Sanity tokens indicated on the monster if the roll fails. After that check, the character may cast spells or use weapons to affect the combat. If the monster is not immediately destroyed or removed from the board, they then roll Fight plus any bonuses from weapons, items or spells. Some monsters only require a single success, while others may require several to destroy.

At the end of each turn, the first player draws a card from the Mythos deck. This causes a gate to another world to open, as well as releasing new monsters onto the board, causing existing monsters to move on the board and often adding a new effect to gameplay. If enough monsters appear on the board, they are recycled, and the terror level of Arkham increases, indicating that Arkham is slowly being completely overrun by monsters. If the terror level rises high enough, stores begin to close and potential allies flee, and the Ancient One will awaken even faster once Arkham becomes completely infested. Weather may make it more difficult to move through the streets or a rumor might require investigators to complete an action in a certain number of turns to prevent even worse effects from happening. After the Mythos card is resolved, play passes clockwise to the next player to start a new turn.

Certain events add tokens to the Ancient One's card, representing how close it is to awakening. Typically, when a new gate opens a token goes onto the Ancient One's card. Gates may be closed by investigators through a die roll. Alternately, a gate may be sealed by spending Clue tokens, or with an [[Elder Sign (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Sign]] item. Sealing a gate prevents another gate from opening in that location again, and using an Elder Sign removes a token from the Ancient One.

If the Ancient One's card reaches a specified number, it awakens and investigators must immediately deal with the threat. Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves making rolls to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost. 

===Expansions===
An expansion entitled ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'' was released in June, 2006, with a revised version released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkham Horror: The Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion (Revised Edition)|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/95683/arkham-horror-the-curse-of-the-dark-pharaoh-expans}}</ref> This expansion added many new cards to the game, including items and encounters. The theme was that a travelling museum exhibit from Egypt has arrived in Arkham, bringing with it accursed artifacts and strange happenings. Heavy emphasis is placed on [[Nyarlathotep]], one of Lovecraft's iconic Outer Gods.

The second expansion entitled ''Dunwich Horror'' was released during [[Gen Con]] 2006. Based on Lovecraft's short story ''[[The Dunwich Horror]]'', it includes a new board that is placed against the original Arkham Horror board. This new board features locations in the town of Dunwich. Investigators may visit Dunwich by travelling through the Train Station in Arkham or using certain vehicle items. In addition, the game includes new Encounter, Mythos and item cards as well as new mechanics, such as the stalking monster movement, and new Great Old Ones. When a character loses their last point of Sanity, they may take a Madness card which imposes restrictions on the character and restores their maximum Sanity, instead of losing half of their items and clues. A similar Injury deck is provided for investigators who reach zero Stamina. Plus, a new monster, the Dunwich Horror itself, is provided as a special monster whose powers vary from combat to combat.

A third expansion, ''The King in Yellow'', was confirmed in October 2006 and released in June 2007. Like ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'', it is a card-only expansion, which this time focuses on a mysterious play that is being performed in Arkham. Based on the [[Robert W. Chambers]] story ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', this expansion introduces the mechanic of the Herald&nbsp;— a special card that permanently alters the game rules.  The first Herald is The King in Yellow himself, which causes the Doom track to increase every time the Terror track does unless you take a permanent penalty. Support for The Dark Pharaoh has since been added on the ''Fantasy Flight Games'' website as a Herald for the ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'' expansion. A third Herald has also been added on  the Fantasy Flight Games website for the ''Dunwich Horror'' expansion.

A fourth expansion, ''[[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]] Horror'', was released in June 2008. It is similar to [[Dunwich Horror]] in that it is board-based rather than card-based.  This expansion adds the additional locations of Kingsport, a new game element of Dimensional Rifts, and aquatic monsters that may move to any other \"aquatic\" location instead of following normal routes.  The expansion also includes new Ancient Ones, new Investigators, new Heralds and introduces Guardians which assist the players much the way Heralds hinder them.

A fifth expansion, ''Black Goat of the Woods'', was released at [[Gen Con]] in August 2008. Another cards-only expansion, the set adds another Herald, a new membership similar to the Silver Twilight Lodge, a new element called Corruption, and difficulty cards that allow you to make the game optionally easier or harder.  In addition, the expansion includes additional Mythos, Gate, Encounter, Spell, Skill, and Unique and Common item cards to be incorporated into the original game.

A sixth expansion, ''[[Innsmouth]] Horror'', was announced on the Fantasy Flight Games Website in February 2009 and released in May 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=574 | title =   Innsmouth Horror is now on sale!   | accessdate = 2009-05-28 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090601061237/http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=574| archivedate= 1 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The third board expansion adds the town of Innsmouth as well as 16 new investigators, 8 new Ancient Ones, and two new Heralds. Also included are new personal stories cards for investigators, monsters, and encounter cards.

A seventh expansion, ''The Lurker at the Threshold'' was announced in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com./edge_news.asp?eidn=1107 | title = Announcing The Lurker at the Threshold - an expansion for Arkham Horror  | accessdate = 2010-02-15 }}</ref> It was released by Fantasy Flight Games in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1484 | title =   Cross the Threshold   3     | accessdate = 2010-07-16 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719101535/http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1484| archivedate= 19 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> This is a small expansion, including a new herald sheet along with over 100 location cards, new Mythos, Gate cards, spells, etc. This expansion includes 18 Gate Markers, designed to replace original ones, and introduces new challenges for investigators trying to seal them. In addition new special Relationship cards were included, which describe how the investigator to your left is related to you and grants some benefit. Also, a new mechanic of making pacts with the Lurker itself were introduced.

An eighth expansion, ''Miskatonic Horror'' was announced in February 2011<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1989 | title = Growing the Gathering Darkness Announcing Miskatonic Horror, a unique Arkham Horror expansion | accessdate = 2011-06-10 }}</ref> and released in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2455 | title = Miskatonic Horror, an expansion for Arkham Horror, is now available  | accessdate = 2011-10-23 }}</ref> The eighth expansion adds nearly 450 new cards, including new Skill, Gate, and Mythos cards. This expansion adds mostly to the other Arkham Horror expansions apart from the main game. Also, new player reference sheets as well as a new Institution variant has been added.

===Reception===
Ben Kuchera reviewed the game for ''[[Ars Technica]]'', and noted that in a game with 700 tokens \"brevity is not one of its strengths... A short game is still measured in hours, and learning to play the game smoothly takes some time. Even with seasoned players, simply setting everything up can take a while, and once you begin adding expansions, the amount of space you need to enjoy the game is increased.\" He concluded that this may not be a game for new players, or players not used to complicated rules systems, saying, \"it's a big, long, complicated game. It's only fun if you have a regular group of gaming friends who get don't mind learning something that's not immediately intuitive. But if you have the space, the time, and the friends... it's worth the investment.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100806190344/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/08/arkham-horror-may-not-be-easy-but-it-sure-is-great.ars | title =700 pieces, 5 hours, 1 Elder God: Hands-on with Arkham Horror | last =Kuchera | first =Ben | date =2010-08-05 | website =Ars Technica | access-date =2019-07-10}}</ref>

'''''Memphis Belle''''' is a 1990 British-American [[war film|war]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Michael Caton-Jones]] and written by Monte Merrick. The film features an [[all-star]] cast with [[Matthew Modine]], [[Eric Stoltz]], and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] (in his film debut) in leading roles. ''Memphis Belle'' is a fictionalization of the 1944 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]'' by director [[William Wyler]], about the 25th and last mission of an American [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[bomber]], the ''[[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|Memphis Belle]]'', based in [[England]] during [[World War II]].<ref>Orriss 1984, p. 83.</ref> The 1990 version was co-produced by David Puttnam and Wyler's daughter Catherine and dedicated to her father. The film<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parkcircus.com/film/110046-Memphis-Belle|title=Memphis Belle|website=Park Circus|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> closes with a dedication to all airmen, friend or foe, who fought in the skies above Europe during World War II.

==Plot==
In May 1943, the crew of the ''Memphis Belle'', a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress of the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Force]], are grounded in England while their aircraft is repaired. The group is under the command of Col. Craig Harriman ([[David Strathairn]]), a no-nonsense, stoical leader who has been given the task of keeping the pressure on Adolf targets. An Army publicist, Lt. Col. Bruce Derringer ([[John Lithgow]]) is visiting the base, to interview the ''Belle'' crew in anticipation of their flying their 25th mission, a requirement to complete their tour of duty. Derringer is eager to use the crew on a war bonds tour stateside. He believes their success would help the war effort and confides to Harriman that many people back home are upset at the losses the Air Force has suffered. Some are beginning to think [[Combined Bomber Offensive|daylight bombing]] is ineffective, while Harriman openly favors it. Derringer informs him that it's his job to show this to the American public as a means of getting their support.

The officers of the squadron are informed the target for the day will be [[Bremen]], Germany. After a delay due to poor weather over the target, the ''Memphis Belle'' and her squadron are airborne. They are soon assembled in formation with bomb group and their escort of [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighters. They face frequent harassment by defending German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters along the way. Eventually, the escorting fighters, low on fuel, turn away, while the bombers continue alone.

Back at the base, Harriman and Derringer have harsh words after the latter starts decorating the mess hall for a celebration upon the Belle's return. Derringer accuses Harriman of being cold-hearted, concerned only with advancing his military career, and not really knowing the men under his command. In response, Harriman brings Derringer into his office and angrily dumps a pile of letters on his desk, then forces Derringer to read one of them. They are replies Harriman received from the grieving families of lost airmen to the condolence letters which he had sent, and partway through the first, Derringer is struck by the realization that the colonel had in fact known even the enlisted men who had been killed. The words of other letters are voiced by those who had written them, over film footage of actual Luftwaffe attacks on B-17s. 

Meanwhile, the bombers have suffered significant losses. The German interceptors focus their attacks on the leading aircraft in the formation. The first lead bomber, ''Windy City'', loses its engines and explodes in front of the ''Belle'', piloted by Captain Dennis Dearborn ([[Matthew Modine]]) and co-pilot 1st Lt. Luke Sinclair ([[Tate Donovan]]). More attacks ensue, and the replacement lead bomber, ''C Cup'', is forced to break formation when its nose is damaged by gunfire from an attacking Bf 109. The crew of the ''Belle'' watch in horror when they see an airman fall out of the stricken aircraft without a parachute. The ''Belle'' is then given the task of leading the formation to the target.

Finding the target – an aircraft assembly plant – becomes difficult as bombardier 1st Lt. Val Kozlowski ([[Billy Zane]]) can't see the target because of a smokescreen the Germans have created. Dearborn aborts the initial bomb run and orders the formation to circle around for a second attempt, which frustrates the Belle crew who have had to endure the ongoing attacks from the Germans. On the second run, Kozlowski spots the assembly plant through a gap in the smokescreen and the bombers successfully hit their target. Once clear of the anti-aircraft fire, they are again attacked by fighters. Staff Sgt. Richard \"Rascal\" Moore's ([[Sean Astin]]) ball turret is destroyed, but he is saved by the safety strap. The attacks continue, blasting a hole in the fuselage, tearing off a large chunk of the tail, and setting the number four engine on fire. Radio operator Staff Sgt. (T/3) Danny \"Danny Boy\" Daly ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is wounded in the attacks, which puts Kozlowski in a difficult position when the crew enlists his self-exaggerated medical \"expertise\" to save the injured radioman. Meanwhile, Dearborn and Sinclair skillfully drop the aircraft into a steep dive and put the fire out, despite great risk of losing the aircraft.

As the B-17 limps closer to base, the crew find that the wheels cannot be lowered due to electrical failure caused by battle damage, but they are able to manually crank their [[landing gear]] down just before landing. The ground crew and a humbled Lt. Colonel Derringer race to greet them with jubilant cheers. The crew exits the battered bomber and celebrate their victory with Daly on an ambulance.

==Production==
[[File:Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress '124485 - DF-A' (G-BEDF) (14423153306).jpg|thumb|right|B-17G \"Sally B\".]]
Five real B-17 [[warbird]]s were used in the filming of ''Memphis Belle'', out of eight B-17s that were airworthy during the late 1980s. Two were located in America (N3703G and N17W), two were in France (F-BEEA, which was destroyed in a takeoff accident<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\">[http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources/Boeing%20B17G%20Flying%20Fortress,%20F-BEEA%2011-89.pdf \"Boeing B17G Flying Fortress, F-BEEA 11-89 .\"] ''[[Air Accident Investigation Branch]]''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.)</ref> and F-AZDX [[The Pink Lady (aircraft)|''The Pink Lady'']]), and one was in England (G-BEDF ''[[Sally B]]''). The original Memphis Belle was a B-17F model, so any B-17Gs used in the film were heavily modified to look like an earlier F model, having chin turrets removed, tail gun positions retrofitted with older designs and being painted olive drab green. During filming, two B-17s portrayed the Belle (one was the movie version of the ''Memphis Belle'' (N3703G) and the other was ''Sally B'' for scenes requiring pyrotechnics such as smoke and sparks indicating machine gun \"hits\" while the rest had nose art and squadron markings changed numerous times to make it appear there were more aircraft.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 31.</ref>

Ground sequences for the movie (including takeoff and landing scenes) were filmed at the non-operational [[RAF Binbrook]] in [[Lincolnshire]], England with a period control tower and vehicles being placed on site. Flying sequences were flown from the airfield site of the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]]. All the [[Extra (actor)|extras]] for the film were obtained from auditions held in the area and included current and former members of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The filmmakers also used [[Pinewood Studios]] to shoot interior scenes and to shoot various models of B-17s.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/83270/Memphis-Belle/original-print-info.html \"Original print information: Memphis Belle (1990).\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.</ref>

A [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] was used to film the majority of the aerial scenes with several fixed and trainable cameras also mounted on the available B-17s and fighter aircraft for action shots. A [[Grumman TBM Avenger]] (with its tail section painted the same olive drab tones used on the B-17s) was used as back-up for a short time when the B-25 became unserviceable during filming.<ref>Carlson 2012 p. 120.</ref>

The film pilots were warbird display pilots coming from the UK, USA, France, Germany, New Zealand and Norway, the roster changing several times as pilots had to return to their full-time jobs during filming. The flying sequences were devised and planned under the coordination of Old Flying Machine Company (OFMC) pilots [[Ray Hanna]] and his son Mark, who also acted as chief pilots for the fighter aircraft used and flew the camera-equipped fighter and TBM Avenger aircraft during filming.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 37.</ref>

Due to a shortage of actual B-17 airframes, wooden [[silhouette]] mock-ups were made and placed at distant parts of the airfield.

===Filming accident===
A French B-17G (F-BEEA), used as a filming platform, hit a tree and a pile of gravel after losing engine power and swinging during takeoff from Binbrook and was destroyed by the subsequent fire. All 10 of the crew escaped with only minor injuries, the most serious of which being a broken leg. While lined up on runway 21 awaiting takeoff, a puff of smoke was observed by a ground engineer from the vicinity of engine three which he conjectured could have been due to an over-boost. The aircraft commenced its ground roll and after about 100 yards swung slightly to the left, which the commander (the handling pilot) corrected with the rudder and by reducing power to number 3 and 4 engines. Once corrected full power on all engines was resumed but the aircraft swung right. The commander applied corrective rudder and reduced power to number 1 and 2 engines, but this was not immediately effective and the aircraft left the runway before straightening, parallel to the runway. Knowing that the aircraft was capable of being operated from grass landing strips, the pilot opted to continue the takeoff; however, after 400–500 yards and at an airspeed of 90-95&nbsp;mph the aircraft swung right and its course was obstructed by a tree which was hit by the left wing and a pile of gravel which was hit by the number 4 propeller. The aircraft yawed to the right and came to rest in a cornfield; the fuselage broke into two sections aft of the bomb bay and caught fire.<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\" />

==Historical accuracy==
With the exception of the aircraft names, this film is fiction based only very loosely on fact. The characters are composites, the names are not those of the real crew of the ''Memphis Belle'' and the incidents shown are supposed to be representative of B-17 missions in general. Indeed, the characters and situations of the film bear little resemblance to the crew of the actual ''Memphis Belle,'' the nature of her final mission, the accuracy of strategic bombing, or Allied policy on the bombing of civilians. No optimistic official celebration on the evening before the ''Belle's'' 25th mission occurred, and there was no special welcome for the crew when the mission was over. The aircraft's participation in the [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|Bremen campaign]] occurred in April 1943; the final, 25th mission of the ''Belle'' was a month later to Lorient, France before being flown back to the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

For the fighters, seven P-51 Mustangs were used, five of the P-51s were painted in the markings of the first USAAF Merlin-engined Mustang squadron to operate in Britain (a few months later in 1943 than the actual mission).{{#tag:ref|[[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolts]] were the escort at the time in 1943.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 32.</ref>|group=N}} As there were no surviving flyable Messerschmitt Bf 109s, Luftwaffe fighter aircraft were represented by [[Hispano Aviación HA-1112|Ha-1112]]s, a Spanish version of the Bf 109 (which were also used to represent Bf 109s in the 1969 film [[Battle of Britain (film)|''Battle of Britain'']]) in mid-war generic paint schemes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''''Memphis Belle''''' is a 1990 British-American [[war film|war]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Michael Caton-Jones]] and written by Monte Merrick. The film features an [[all-star]] cast with [[Matthew Modine]], [[Eric Stoltz]], and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] (in his film debut) in leading roles. ''Memphis Belle'' is a fictionalization of the 1944 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]'' by director [[William Wyler]], about the 25th and last mission of an American [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[bomber]], the ''[[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|Memphis Belle]]'', based in [[England]] during [[World War II]].<ref>Orriss 1984, p. 83.</ref> The 1990 version was co-produced by David Puttnam and Wyler's daughter Catherine and dedicated to her father. The film closes with a dedication to all airmen, friend or foe, who fought in the skies above Europe during World War II.

==Plot==
In May 1943, the crew of the ''Memphis Belle'', a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress of the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Force]], are grounded in England while their aircraft is repaired. The group is under the command of Col. Craig Harriman ([[David Strathairn]]), a no-nonsense, stoical leader who has been given the task of keeping the pressure on Adolf targets. An Army publicist, Lt. Col. Bruce Derringer ([[John Lithgow]]) is visiting the base, to interview the ''Belle'' crew in anticipation of their flying their 25th mission, a requirement to complete their tour of duty. Derringer is eager to use the crew on a war bonds tour stateside. He believes their success would help the war effort and confides to Harriman that many people back home are upset at the losses the Air Force has suffered. Some are beginning to think [[Combined Bomber Offensive|daylight bombing]] is ineffective, while Harriman openly favors it. Derringer informs him that it's his job to show this to the American public as a means of getting their support.

The officers of the squadron are informed the target for the day will be [[Bremen]], Germany. After a delay due to poor weather over the target, the ''Memphis Belle'' and her squadron are airborne. They are soon assembled in formation with bomb group and their escort of [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighters. They face frequent harassment by defending German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters along the way. Eventually, the escorting fighters, low on fuel, turn away, while the bombers continue alone.

Back at the base, Harriman and Derringer have harsh words after the latter starts decorating the mess hall for a celebration upon the Belle's return. Derringer accuses Harriman of being cold-hearted, concerned only with advancing his military career, and not really knowing the men under his command. In response, Harriman brings Derringer into his office and angrily dumps a pile of letters on his desk, then forces Derringer to read one of them. They are replies Harriman received from the grieving families of lost airmen to the condolence letters which he had sent, and partway through the first, Derringer is struck by the realization that the colonel had in fact known even the enlisted men who had been killed. The words of other letters are voiced by those who had written them, over film footage of actual Luftwaffe attacks on B-17s. 

Meanwhile, the bombers have suffered significant losses. The German interceptors focus their attacks on the leading aircraft in the formation. The first lead bomber, ''Windy City'', loses its engines and explodes in front of the ''Belle'', piloted by Captain Dennis Dearborn ([[Matthew Modine]]) and co-pilot 1st Lt. Luke Sinclair ([[Tate Donovan]]). More attacks ensue, and the replacement lead bomber, ''C Cup'', is forced to break formation when its nose is damaged by gunfire from an attacking Bf 109. The crew of the ''Belle'' watch in horror when they see an airman fall out of the stricken aircraft without a parachute. The ''Belle'' is then given the task of leading the formation to the target.

Finding the target – an aircraft assembly plant – becomes difficult as bombardier 1st Lt. Val Kozlowski ([[Billy Zane]]) can't see the target because of a smokescreen the Germans have created. Dearborn aborts the initial bomb run and orders the formation to circle around for a second attempt, which frustrates the Belle crew who have had to endure the ongoing attacks from the Germans. On the second run, Kozlowski spots the assembly plant through a gap in the smokescreen and the bombers successfully hit their target. Once clear of the anti-aircraft fire, they are again attacked by fighters. Staff Sgt. Richard \"Rascal\" Moore's ([[Sean Astin]]) ball turret is destroyed, but he is saved by the safety strap. The attacks continue, blasting a hole in the fuselage, tearing off a large chunk of the tail, and setting the number four engine on fire. Radio operator Staff Sgt. (T/3) Danny \"Danny Boy\" Daly ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is wounded in the attacks, which puts Kozlowski in a difficult position when the crew enlists his self-exaggerated medical \"expertise\" to save the injured radioman. Meanwhile, Dearborn and Sinclair skillfully drop the aircraft into a steep dive and put the fire out, despite great risk of losing the aircraft.

As the B-17 limps closer to base, the crew find that the wheels cannot be lowered due to electrical failure caused by battle damage, but they are able to manually crank their [[landing gear]] down just before landing. The ground crew and a humbled Lt. Colonel Derringer race to greet them with jubilant cheers. The crew exits the battered bomber and celebrate their victory with Daly on an ambulance.

==Production==
[[File:Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress '124485 - DF-A' (G-BEDF) (14423153306).jpg|thumb|right|B-17G \"Sally B\".]]
Five real B-17 [[warbird]]s were used in the filming of ''Memphis Belle'', out of eight B-17s that were airworthy during the late 1980s. Two were located in America (N3703G and N17W), two were in France (F-BEEA, which was destroyed in a takeoff accident<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\">[http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources/Boeing%20B17G%20Flying%20Fortress,%20F-BEEA%2011-89.pdf \"Boeing B17G Flying Fortress, F-BEEA 11-89 .\"] ''[[Air Accident Investigation Branch]]''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.)</ref> and F-AZDX [[The Pink Lady (aircraft)|''The Pink Lady'']]), and one was in England (G-BEDF ''[[Sally B]]''). The original Memphis Belle was a B-17F model, so any B-17Gs used in the film were heavily modified to look like an earlier F model, having chin turrets removed, tail gun positions retrofitted with older designs and being painted olive drab green. During filming, two B-17s portrayed the Belle (one was the movie version of the ''Memphis Belle'' (N3703G) and the other was ''Sally B'' for scenes requiring pyrotechnics such as smoke and sparks indicating machine gun \"hits\" while the rest had nose art and squadron markings changed numerous times to make it appear there were more aircraft.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 31.</ref>

Ground sequences for the movie (including takeoff and landing scenes) were filmed at the non-operational [[RAF Binbrook]] in [[Lincolnshire]], England with a period control tower and vehicles being placed on site. Flying sequences were flown from the airfield site of the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]]. All the [[Extra (actor)|extras]] for the film were obtained from auditions held in the area and included current and former members of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The filmmakers also used [[Pinewood Studios]] to shoot interior scenes and to shoot various models of B-17s.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/83270/Memphis-Belle/original-print-info.html \"Original print information: Memphis Belle (1990).\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.</ref>

A [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] was used to film the majority of the aerial scenes with several fixed and trainable cameras also mounted on the available B-17s and fighter aircraft for action shots. A [[Grumman TBM Avenger]] (with its tail section painted the same olive drab tones used on the B-17s) was used as back-up for a short time when the B-25 became unserviceable during filming.<ref>Carlson 2012 p. 120.</ref>

The film pilots were warbird display pilots coming from the UK, USA, France, Germany, New Zealand and Norway, the roster changing several times as pilots had to return to their full-time jobs during filming. The flying sequences were devised and planned under the coordination of Old Flying Machine Company (OFMC) pilots [[Ray Hanna]] and his son Mark, who also acted as chief pilots for the fighter aircraft used and flew the camera-equipped fighter and TBM Avenger aircraft during filming.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 37.</ref>

Due to a shortage of actual B-17 airframes, wooden [[silhouette]] mock-ups were made and placed at distant parts of the airfield.

===Filming accident===
A French B-17G (F-BEEA), used as a filming platform, hit a tree and a pile of gravel after losing engine power and swinging during takeoff from Binbrook and was destroyed by the subsequent fire. All 10 of the crew escaped with only minor injuries, the most serious of which being a broken leg. While lined up on runway 21 awaiting takeoff, a puff of smoke was observed by a ground engineer from the vicinity of engine three which he conjectured could have been due to an over-boost. The aircraft commenced its ground roll and after about 100 yards swung slightly to the left, which the commander (the handling pilot) corrected with the rudder and by reducing power to number 3 and 4 engines. Once corrected full power on all engines was resumed but the aircraft swung right. The commander applied corrective rudder and reduced power to number 1 and 2 engines, but this was not immediately effective and the aircraft left the runway before straightening, parallel to the runway. Knowing that the aircraft was capable of being operated from grass landing strips, the pilot opted to continue the takeoff; however, after 400–500 yards and at an airspeed of 90-95&nbsp;mph the aircraft swung right and its course was obstructed by a tree which was hit by the left wing and a pile of gravel which was hit by the number 4 propeller. The aircraft yawed to the right and came to rest in a cornfield; the fuselage broke into two sections aft of the bomb bay and caught fire.<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\" />

==Historical accuracy==
With the exception of the aircraft names, this film is fiction based only very loosely on fact. The characters are composites, the names are not those of the real crew of the ''Memphis Belle'' and the incidents shown are supposed to be representative of B-17 missions in general. Indeed, the characters and situations of the film bear little resemblance to the crew of the actual ''Memphis Belle,'' the nature of her final mission, the accuracy of strategic bombing, or Allied policy on the bombing of civilians. No optimistic official celebration on the evening before the ''Belle's'' 25th mission occurred, and there was no special welcome for the crew when the mission was over. The aircraft's participation in the [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|Bremen campaign]] occurred in April 1943; the final, 25th mission of the ''Belle'' was a month later to Lorient, France before being flown back to the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

For the fighters, seven P-51 Mustangs were used, five of the P-51s were painted in the markings of the first USAAF Merlin-engined Mustang squadron to operate in Britain (a few months later in 1943 than the actual mission).{{#tag:ref|[[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolts]] were the escort at the time in 1943.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 32.</ref>|group=N}} As there were no surviving flyable Messerschmitt Bf 109s, Luftwaffe fighter aircraft were represented by [[Hispano Aviación HA-1112|Ha-1112]]s, a Spanish version of the Bf 109 (which were also used to represent Bf 109s in the 1969 film [[Battle of Britain (film)|''Battle of Britain'']]) in mid-war generic paint schemes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Scientific contributions==
=== Superplasticity ===
The first comprehensive treatment of the subject ‘Superplasticity’ was authored by Padmanabhan and G.J. Davies, which was published in 1980 by Springer Verlag.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783642814587 |title= The first comprehensive treatment of the subject 'Superplasticity'|isbn= 9783642814587|publisher= Springer|year= 1980|series= Materials Research and Engineering}}</ref> In 2012, it was identified as one of about 40 books out of a few thousand books published by [[Springer-Verlag]] during 1843 – 2005 (163 Years) and published in both print and e-book form. Two other books on the same subject, ‘Superplastic Flow: Phenomenology and Mechanics’<ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783540678427|title= Superplastic Flow: Phenomenology and Mechanics|isbn= 9783540678427|publisher= Springer|year= 2001|series= Engineering Materials}}</ref> and ‘Superplasticity: Common Basis for a Near-Ubiquitous Phenomenon’ <ref>{{cite book |url= https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783642319563 |title= Superplasticity: Common Basis for a Near-Ubiquitous Phenomenon|isbn= 9783642319563|publisher= Springer|year= 2018|series= Engineering Materials}}</ref> were also published in 2001 and 2018. Additionally, Padmanabhan has contributed 6 book chapters and more than 280 research publications, with a majority on Superplasticity.

=== Mechanical processing ===
A procedure for the superplastic forming of hemispherical domes of Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium alloy ([[Ti-6Al-4V]]) was developed by Padmanabhan for the Integrated Missiles Technology Program of the Defense R&D Laboratory, Government of India.
He developed a multi-stage closed die forging technology for the production of undercarriage base plate fitting component for the air frame of high-performance (supersonic) Aircraft for the Indian Aeronautical Development Agency([[Aeronautical Development Agency]]).

=== Materials development ===
Padmanabhan developed for the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO), an alloy equivalent to [[AFNOR]] 7020 alloy (a French alloy) for use as construction material for water tankages. The technology was transferred to an ordnance factory for productionization.

The development of an austenitic steel having only 1% nickel for the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) was successfully completed and today nearly 800,000 tonnes of this grade of steel is made by Indian industries.

=== Materials plasticity under different loading conditions ===
His work for the [[Department of Atomic Energy]] (DAE) was mainly concerned with the physical and mechanical metallurgy aspects (deformation, fracture, stress corrosion cracking and low cycle fatigue) of AISI 304, 304 LN, 316 and 316 LN austenitic stainless steels and an improved grade D9, all construction materials for the Fast Breeder Reactor program.

He was a consultant to the R & D Centre for Iron and Steel, [[Steel Authority of India]] Limited (SAIL), when they produced for the first time in the country both Extra Deep Drawing (EDD) and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) grades of steel.

He was a consultant to Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (now known as [[Tata Motors]]) when they introduced the micro-alloyed ferrite - pearlite steel (first generation), 49MnVS3, for the first time in India for the forging of crankshafts.

=== Basic research and nanostructured materials ===
Padmanabhan proposed a new concept ‘mesoscopic grain boundary sliding’ for explaining the origins of the phenomenon of Superplasticity (K.A. Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf 1996).<ref> K.A. Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf (1996): A Model for Grain Boundary Sliding and its Relevance to Optimal Structural Superplasticity: 1. Theory. In Mater. Sci. Technol., 12, pp. 391–399.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28–38.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2012) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2012): A Mechanism for the Deformation of Disordered States of Matter. In Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 16, pp. 243–253.</ref>, (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) <ref> H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559–571.</ref>.

His model for grain boundary sliding and its application to superplastic flow in micro-crystalline metallic materials and ceramics questioned the dominant idea of the time in high-temperature deformation modelling that Grain Boundary Sliding is an inherently fast process, which at no stage could be controlling the rate of high-temperature deformation (K. A. Padmanabhan 2009) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan (2009): Grain Boundary Sliding Controlled Flow and its Relevance to Superplasticity in Metals, Alloys, Ceramics and Intermetallics and Strain-Rate Dependent Flow in Nanostructured Materials. In Journal of Materials Science 44, pp. 2226–2238.</ref>, (K.A. Padmanabhan and M. Raviathul Basariya 2019) <ref> K.A. Padmanabhan and M. Raviathul Basariya (2019): A theory of steady state structural superplasticity in different classes of materials. A materials-agnostic analysis. In Materials Science & Engineering A (744), pp. 704–715.</ref>. 

His model for inverse Hall-Petch effect in nano-crystalline and quasi-crystalline materials extends the ideas contained in the above model to explain why when the grain size in a nano-crystalline material goes below a value ~ 10-15&nbsp;nm, there is grain size softening, rather than the usual increase in hardness with decreasing grain size. At the international conference on \"[[Severe plastic deformation]]\" held in Russia in 2011 this paper of 1997 was named the most significant publication in this area (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) <ref> H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559–571. </ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan, G. P. Dinda, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter 2007) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan, G. P. Dinda, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter (2007): On the inverse Hall - Petch Effect and Related Phenomena in Nano- and Microcrystalline Materials. In Mater. Sci. Eng A, pp. 452–453.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan, S. Sripathi, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter 2014) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan, S. Sripathi, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter (2014): Inverse Hall-Petch Effect in Quasi- and Nanocrystalline Materials. In Materials Letters 133, pp. 151–154. </ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28–38. </ref>.

His model with H. Gleiter extends the above ideas to cover superplastic deformation in metals and ceramics of micro-crystalline, sub-micron and nano-crystalline grain sizes. Using Herring's equation a physical justification is given for mesoscopic boundary sliding/plane interface formation using the minimization of the total free energy as the key criterion. This paper was described by Nature Materials as a \"break-through from India\" (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28–38. </ref>.

He developed a model for predicting the [[formability]] of steels and aluminium alloys under different stress states (A. Kanni Raj and K. A. Padmanabhan 1997a) <ref> A. Kanni Raj and K. A. Padmanabhan (1997a): Room Temperature Plastic Flow and Strain-Induced Martensitic Transformation in 1.2 % Ni Metastable Austenitic Stainless Steel Sheets. In J. Mater. Sci. Lett. 16, pp. 1920–1924. </ref>, (A. Kanni Raj and K.A. Padmanabhan 1998) <ref> A. Kanni Raj and K.A. Padmanabhan (1998): Tensile Properties and Formability of Low Ni (1.2 mass % Ni) Metastable Austenite Stainless Steel Sheets. In Materials Transactions - JIM 39, pp. 614–617.</ref>, (Kanni Raj and K.A. Padmanabhan 1998) <ref> A. Kanni Raj and K.A. Padmanabhan (1998): Tensile Properties and Formability of Low Ni (1.2 mass % Ni) Metastable Austenite Stainless Steel Sheets. In Materials Transactions - JIM 39, pp. 614–617.</ref>, (A.

Padmanabhan and J. Schlipf (1996): A Model for Grain Boundary Sliding and its Relevance to Optimal Structural Superplasticity: 1. Theory. In Mater. Sci. Technol., 12, pp. 391–399.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28–38.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2012) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2012): A Mechanism for the Deformation of Disordered States of Matter. In Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 16, pp. 243–253.</ref>, (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) <ref> H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559–571.</ref>.

His model for grain boundary sliding and its application to superplastic flow in micro-crystalline metallic materials and ceramics questioned the dominant idea of the time in high-temperature deformation modelling that Grain Boundary Sliding is an inherently fast process, which at no stage could be controlling the rate of high-temperature deformation (K. A. Padmanabhan 2009) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan (2009): Grain Boundary Sliding Controlled Flow and its Relevance to Superplasticity in Metals, Alloys, Ceramics and Intermetallics and Strain-Rate Dependent Flow in Nanostructured Materials. In Journal of Materials Science 44, pp. 2226–2238.</ref>, (K.A. Padmanabhan and M. Raviathul Basariya 2019) <ref> K.A. Padmanabhan and M. Raviathul Basariya (2019): A theory of steady state structural superplasticity in different classes of materials. A materials-agnostic analysis. In Materials Science & Engineering A (744), pp. 704–715.</ref>. 

His model for inverse Hall-Petch effect in nano-crystalline and quasi-crystalline materials extends the ideas contained in the above model to explain why when the grain size in a nano-crystalline material goes below a value ~ 10-15&nbsp;nm, there is grain size softening, rather than the usual increase in hardness with decreasing grain size. At the international conference on \"[[Severe plastic deformation]]\" held in Russia in 2011 this paper of 1997 was named the most significant publication in this area (H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan 1997) <ref> H. Hahn and K.A. Padmanabhan (1997): A Model for the Deformation of Nanocrystalline Materials. In Philos. Mag. (76B), pp. 559–571. </ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan, G. P. Dinda, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter 2007) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan, G. P. Dinda, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter (2007): On the inverse Hall - Petch Effect and Related Phenomena in Nano- and Microcrystalline Materials. In Mater. Sci. Eng A, pp. 452–453.</ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan, S. Sripathi, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter 2014) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan, S. Sripathi, H. Hahn and H. Gleiter (2014): Inverse Hall-Petch Effect in Quasi- and Nanocrystalline Materials. In Materials Letters 133, pp. 151–154. </ref>, (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28–38. </ref>.

His model with H. Gleiter extends the above ideas to cover superplastic deformation in metals and ceramics of micro-crystalline, sub-micron and nano-crystalline grain sizes. Using Herring's equation a physical justification is given for mesoscopic boundary sliding/plane interface formation using the minimization of the total free energy as the key criterion. This paper was described by Nature Materials as a \"break-through from India\" (K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter 2004) <ref> K. A. Padmanabhan and H. Gleiter (2004): Optimal Structural Superplasticity in Metals and Ceramics of Microcrystalline- and Nanocrystalline- Grain Sizes. In Materials Science and Engineering A (381), pp. 28–38. </ref>.

He developed a model for predicting the [[formability]] of steels and aluminium alloys under different stress states (A. Kanni Raj and K. A. Padmanabhan 1997a) <ref> A. Kanni Raj and K. A. Padmanabhan (1997a): Room Temperature Plastic Flow and Strain-Induced Martensitic Transformation in 1.2 % Ni Metastable Austenitic Stainless Steel Sheets. In J. Mater. Sci.

[[File:Sons of Liberty Broadside, 1765.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1765 [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]], regarding the \"Sons of Liberty\" organizations and their principles]]

The '''Sons of Liberty''' was a secret revolutionary organization that was founded by [[Samuel Adams]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|Thirteen American Colonies]] to advance the [[Rights of Englishmen|rights of the European colonists]] and to fight taxation by the British government. It played a major role in most colonies in battling the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765.<ref>John Phillips Resch, ed., culture, and the homefront'' (MacMillan Reference Library, 2005) 1: 174-75</ref>  The group officially disbanded after the Stamp Act was repealed. However, the name was applied to other local separatist groups during the years preceding the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Axelrod|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to the American Revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00axel_0|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Alpha Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00axel_0/page/89 89]|isbn=9780028633794}}</ref>

In the popular thought, the Sons of Liberty was a formal underground organization with recognized members and leaders. More likely, the name was an underground term for any men resisting new Crown taxes and laws.<ref name=\"GregoryFremontBarnes\">Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies'' (2007) 1:688</ref>  The well-known label allowed organizers to make or create anonymous summons to a [[Liberty Tree]], \"[[Liberty Pole]]\", or other public meeting-place.  Furthermore, a unifying name helped to promote inter-Colonial efforts against Parliament and the Crown's actions. Their motto became \"[[No taxation without representation]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Lambert|title=James Habersham: loyalty, politics, and commerce in colonial Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1O8bFseJBfkC&pg=PA173|year=2005|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2539-2|page=173}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Philip Dawe (attributed), The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering (1774) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Bostonian Paying the Excise-Man'', 1774 British propaganda print, referring to the tarring and feathering, of Boston Commissioner of Customs [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] four weeks after the Boston Tea Party. The men also poured hot tea down Malcolm's throat; note the noose hanging on the [[Liberty Tree]] and the [[Stamp Act]] posted upside-down]]

In 1765, the British government needed money to afford the 10,000 officers and soldiers living in the colonies, and intended that the colonists living there should contribute.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative. This became commonly known as \"[[No Taxation without Representation]].\" Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies despite the fact that the colonists had no representative in Parliament.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943)</ref> The most incendiary tax was the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which caused a firestorm of opposition through legislative resolutions (starting in the colony of [[History of Virginia|Virginia]]), public demonstrations,<ref>Such as by the local judges and Frederick, Maryland. See {{cite book|author=Thomas John Chew Williams|title=History of Frederick County, Maryland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6w1YPiY0nYC&pg=PA79|year=1979|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co.|pages=78–79|isbn=9780806379739}}</ref> threats, and occasional hurtful losses.<ref>Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' pp. 121, 129–130</ref>

The organization spread hour by hour, after independent starts in several different colonies. In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.

In Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear. i realy was friends with one :)

Early in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].

The Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H. Irvin, \"Tar, feathers, and the enemies of American liberties, 1768-1776.\" ''New England Quarterly'' (2003): 197-238. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559903 in JSTOR]</ref>

===New York===
In December 1773, a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the ''Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York,\" which formally stated that they were opposed to the [[Tea Act]] and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was \"an enemy to the liberties of America\" and that \"whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions, we will not deal with, or employ, or have any connection with him.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=T. H. Breen|title=The Marketplace of Revolution: How Consumer Politics Shaped American Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Skum_IkNN5gC&pg=PT446|year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=446|isbn=9780199840113}}</ref>

After the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Isaac Sears]], [[Marinus Willet]], and [[John Lamb (general)|John Lamb]] in New York City revived the Sons of Liberty. In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty.

==Flags==
In 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.  This flag was also associated with the Sons of Liberty. Red and white were common colors of the flags, although other color combinations were used, such as green and white or yellow and white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%5Erv.html|title=Colonial and Revolutionary War Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-librt.html#sons|title=Liberty Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=raven&id=raven_2004_0011_0001_0060|title=The First Navy Jack|first1=Peter|last1=Ansoff|first2=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-américaine de|last2=vexillologie|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|journal=Raven: A Journal of Vexillology|volume=11|pages=1–60|accessdate=10 January 2018|doi=10.5840/raven2004111}}</ref>

==Later societies==
At various times, small secret organizations took the name \"Sons of Liberty.”  They generally left very few records. [[Bennington, Vermont]] had an organization named the Sons of Liberty in the early 1800's that included local notables such as [[Martin Scott (military officer)]] and Hiram Harwood.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shalhope|first=Robert|title=A Tale of New England|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8018-7127-1|location=Baltimore|pages=92-96}}</ref>
 
The name was also used during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Baker, pg. 341</ref> By 1864, the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] group the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] set up an offshoot called ''Order of the Sons of Liberty''.  They both came under federal prosecution in 1864 for treason, especially in Indiana.<ref>{{cite book|author=David C. Keehn|title=Knights of the Golden Circle: Secret Empire, Southern Secession, Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZWIaUunq60C&pg=PA173|year=2013|publisher=Louisiana State UP|page=173|isbn=9780807150047}}</ref>

A radical wing of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] launched a boycott in the U.S. against British films in 1948, in response to British policies in Palestine. It called itself the \"Sons of Liberty.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Kerry Segrave|title=Foreign Films in America: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVVp0omSDBIC&pg=PA86|year=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8162-0|page=86}}</ref>

[[File:Sons of Liberty Broadside, 1765.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1765 [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]], regarding the \"Sons of Liberty\" organizations and their principles]]

The '''Sons of Liberty''' was a secret revolutionary organization that was founded by [[Samuel Adams]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|Thirteen American Colonies]] to advance the [[Rights of Englishmen|rights of the European colonists]] and to fight taxation by the British government. It played a major role in most colonies in battling the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765.<ref>John Phillips Resch, ed., culture, and the homefront'' (MacMillan Reference Library, 2005) 1: 174-75</ref>  The group officially disbanded after the Stamp Act was repealed. However, the name was applied to other local separatist groups during the years preceding the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Axelrod|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to the American Revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00axel_0|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Alpha Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00axel_0/page/89 89]|isbn=9780028633794}}</ref>

In the popular thought, the Sons of Liberty was a formal underground organization with recognized members and leaders. More likely, the name was an underground term for any men resisting new Crown taxes and laws.<ref name=\"GregoryFremontBarnes\">Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies'' (2007) 1:688</ref>  The well-known label allowed organizers to make or create anonymous summons to a [[Liberty Tree]], \"[[Liberty Pole]]\", or other public meeting-place.  Furthermore, a unifying name helped to promote inter-Colonial efforts against Parliament and the Crown's actions. Their motto became \"[[No taxation without representation]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Lambert|title=James Habersham: loyalty, politics, and commerce in colonial Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1O8bFseJBfkC&pg=PA173|year=2005|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2539-2|page=173}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Philip Dawe (attributed), The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering (1774) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Bostonian Paying the Excise-Man'', 1774 British propaganda print, referring to the tarring and feathering, of Boston Commissioner of Customs [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] four weeks after the Boston Tea Party. The men also poured hot tea down Malcolm's throat; note the noose hanging on the [[Liberty Tree]] and the [[Stamp Act]] posted upside-down]]

In 1765, the British government needed money to afford the 10,000 officers and soldiers living in the colonies, and intended that the colonists living there should contribute.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative. This became commonly known as \"[[No Taxation without Representation]].\" Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies despite the fact that the colonists had no representative in Parliament.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943)</ref> The most incendiary tax was the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which caused a firestorm of opposition through legislative resolutions (starting in the colony of [[History of Virginia|Virginia]]), public demonstrations,<ref>Such as by the local judges and Frederick, Maryland. See {{cite book|author=Thomas John Chew Williams|title=History of Frederick County, Maryland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6w1YPiY0nYC&pg=PA79|year=1979|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co.|pages=78–79|isbn=9780806379739}}</ref> threats, and occasional hurtful losses.<ref>Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' pp. 121, 129–130</ref>

The organization spread hour by hour, after independent starts in several different colonies. In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.

In Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.

Early in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].

The Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H. Irvin, \"Tar, feathers, and the enemies of American liberties, 1768-1776.\" ''New England Quarterly'' (2003): 197-238. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559903 in JSTOR]</ref>

===New York===
In December 1773, a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the ''Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York,\" which formally stated that they were opposed to the [[Tea Act]] and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was \"an enemy to the liberties of America\" and that \"whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions, we will not deal with, or employ, or have any connection with him.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=T. H. Breen|title=The Marketplace of Revolution: How Consumer Politics Shaped American Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Skum_IkNN5gC&pg=PT446|year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=446|isbn=9780199840113}}</ref>

After the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Isaac Sears]], [[Marinus Willet]], and [[John Lamb (general)|John Lamb]] in New York City revived the Sons of Liberty. In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty. 

==Flags==
In 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.  This flag was also associated with the Sons of Liberty. Red and white were common colors of the flags, although other color combinations were used, such as green and white or yellow and white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%5Erv.html|title=Colonial and Revolutionary War Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-librt.html#sons|title=Liberty Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=raven&id=raven_2004_0011_0001_0060|title=The First Navy Jack|first1=Peter|last1=Ansoff|first2=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-américaine de|last2=vexillologie|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|journal=Raven: A Journal of Vexillology|volume=11|pages=1–60|accessdate=10 January 2018|doi=10.5840/raven2004111}}</ref>

==Later societies==
At various times, small secret organizations took the name \"Sons of Liberty.”  They generally left very few records. [[Bennington, Vermont]] had an organization named the Sons of Liberty in the early 1800's that included local notables such as [[Martin Scott (military officer)]] and Hiram Harwood.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shalhope|first=Robert|title=A Tale of New England|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8018-7127-1|location=Baltimore|pages=92-96}}</ref>
 
The name was also used during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Baker, pg. 341</ref> By 1864, the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] group the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] set up an offshoot called ''Order of the Sons of Liberty''.  They both came under federal prosecution in 1864 for treason, especially in Indiana.<ref>{{cite book|author=David C. Keehn|title=Knights of the Golden Circle: Secret Empire, Southern Secession, Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZWIaUunq60C&pg=PA173|year=2013|publisher=Louisiana State UP|page=173|isbn=9780807150047}}</ref>

A radical wing of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] launched a boycott in the U.S. against British films in 1948, in response to British policies in Palestine. It called itself the \"Sons of Liberty.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Kerry Segrave|title=Foreign Films in America: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVVp0omSDBIC&pg=PA86|year=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8162-0|page=86}}</ref>

[[File:Sons of Liberty Broadside, 1765.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1765 [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]], regarding the \"Sons of Liberty\" organizations and their principles]]

The '''Sons of Liberty''' was a secret revolutionary organization that was founded by [[Samuel Adams]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|Thirteen American Colonies]] to advance the [[Rights of Englishmen|rights of the European colonists]] and to fight taxation by the British government. It played a major role in most colonies in battling the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765.<ref>John Phillips Resch, ed., culture, and the homefront'' (MacMillan Reference Library, 2005) 1: 174-75</ref>  The group officially disbanded after the Stamp Act was repealed. However, the name was applied to other local separatist groups during the years preceding the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Axelrod|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to the American Revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00axel_0|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Alpha Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00axel_0/page/89 89]|isbn=9780028633794}}</ref>

In the popular thought, the Sons of Liberty was a formal underground organization with recognized members and leaders. More likely, the name was an underground term for any men resisting new Crown taxes and laws.<ref name=\"GregoryFremontBarnes\">Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies'' (2007) 1:688</ref>  The well-known label allowed organizers to make or create anonymous summons to a [[Liberty Tree]], \"[[Liberty Pole]]\", or other public meeting-place.  Furthermore, a unifying name helped to promote inter-Colonial efforts against Parliament and the Crown's actions. Their motto became \"[[No taxation without representation]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Lambert|title=James Habersham: loyalty, politics, and commerce in colonial Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1O8bFseJBfkC&pg=PA173|year=2005|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2539-2|page=173}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Philip Dawe (attributed), The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering (1774) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Bostonian Paying the Excise-Man'', 1774 British propaganda print, referring to the tarring and feathering, of Boston Commissioner of Customs [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] four weeks after the Boston Tea Party. The men also poured hot tea down Malcolm's throat; note the noose hanging on the [[Liberty Tree]] and the [[Stamp Act]] posted upside-down]]

 history is my thing In 1765, the British government needed money to afford the 10,000 officers and soldiers living in the colonies, and intended that the colonists living there should contribute.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative. This became commonly known as \"[[No Taxation without Representation]].\" Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies despite the fact that the colonists had no representative in Parliament.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943)</ref> The most incendiary tax was the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which caused a firestorm of opposition through legislative resolutions (starting in the colony of [[History of Virginia|Virginia]]), public demonstrations,<ref>Such as by the local judges and Frederick, Maryland. See {{cite book|author=Thomas John Chew Williams|title=History of Frederick County, Maryland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6w1YPiY0nYC&pg=PA79|year=1979|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co.|pages=78–79|isbn=9780806379739}}</ref> threats, and occasional hurtful losses.<ref>Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' pp. 121, 129–130</ref>

The organization spread hour by hour, after independent starts in several different colonies. In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.

In Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.

Early in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].

The Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H. Irvin, \"Tar, feathers, and the enemies of American liberties, 1768-1776.\" ''New England Quarterly'' (2003): 197-238. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559903 in JSTOR]</ref>

===New York===
In December 1773, a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the ''Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York,\" which formally stated that they were opposed to the [[Tea Act]] and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was \"an enemy to the liberties of America\" and that \"whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions, we will not deal with, or employ, or have any connection with him.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=T. H. Breen|title=The Marketplace of Revolution: How Consumer Politics Shaped American Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Skum_IkNN5gC&pg=PT446|year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=446|isbn=9780199840113}}</ref>

After the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Isaac Sears]], [[Marinus Willet]], and [[John Lamb (general)|John Lamb]] in New York City revived the Sons of Liberty. In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty.

==Flags==
In 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.  This flag was also associated with the Sons of Liberty. Red and white were common colors of the flags, although other color combinations were used, such as green and white or yellow and white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%5Erv.html|title=Colonial and Revolutionary War Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-librt.html#sons|title=Liberty Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=raven&id=raven_2004_0011_0001_0060|title=The First Navy Jack|first1=Peter|last1=Ansoff|first2=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-américaine de|last2=vexillologie|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|journal=Raven: A Journal of Vexillology|volume=11|pages=1–60|accessdate=10 January 2018|doi=10.5840/raven2004111}}</ref>

==Later societies==
At various times, small secret organizations took the name \"Sons of Liberty.”  They generally left very few records. [[Bennington, Vermont]] had an organization named the Sons of Liberty in the early 1800's that included local notables such as [[Martin Scott (military officer)]] and Hiram Harwood.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shalhope|first=Robert|title=A Tale of New England|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8018-7127-1|location=Baltimore|pages=92-96}}</ref>
 
The name was also used during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Baker, pg. 341</ref> By 1864, the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] group the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] set up an offshoot called ''Order of the Sons of Liberty''.  They both came under federal prosecution in 1864 for treason, especially in Indiana.<ref>{{cite book|author=David C.

A radical wing of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] launched a boycott in the U.S. against British films in 1948, in response to British policies in Palestine. It called itself the \"Sons of Liberty.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Kerry Segrave|title=Foreign Films in America: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVVp0omSDBIC&pg=PA86|year=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8162-0|page=86}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Philip Dawe (attributed), The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering (1774) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Bostonian Paying the Excise-Man'', 1774 British propaganda print, referring to the tarring and feathering, of Boston Commissioner of Customs [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] four weeks after the Boston Tea Party. The men also poured hot tea down Malcolm's throat; note the noose hanging on the [[Liberty Tree]] and the [[Stamp Act]] posted upside-down]]

In 1765, the British government needed money to afford the 10,000 officers and soldiers living in the colonies, and intended that the colonists living there should contribute.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative. This became commonly known as \"[[No Taxation without Representation]].\" Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies despite the fact that the colonists had no representative in Parliament.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943)</ref> The most incendiary tax was the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which caused a firestorm of opposition through legislative resolutions (starting in the colony of [[History of Virginia|Virginia]]), public demonstrations,<ref>Such as by the local judges and Frederick, Maryland. See {{cite book|author=Thomas John Chew Williams|title=History of Frederick County, Maryland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6w1YPiY0nYC&pg=PA79|year=1979|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co.|pages=78–79|isbn=9780806379739}}</ref> threats, and occasional hurtful losses.<ref>Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' pp. 121, 129–130</ref>

The organization spread hour by hour, after independent starts in several different colonies. In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.

In Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.

Early in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].

The Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H. Irvin, \"Tar, feathers, and the enemies of American liberties, 1768-1776.\" ''New England Quarterly'' (2003): 197-238. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559903 in JSTOR]</ref>

===New York===
In December 1773, a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the ''Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York,\" which formally stated that they were opposed to the [[Tea Act]] and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was \"an enemy to the liberties of America\" and that \"whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions, we will not deal with, or employ, or have any connection with him.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=T. H. Breen|title=The Marketplace of Revolution: How Consumer Politics Shaped American Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Skum_IkNN5gC&pg=PT446|year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=446|isbn=9780199840113}}</ref>

After the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Isaac Sears]], [[Marinus Willet]], and [[John Lamb (general)|John Lamb]] in New York City revived the Sons of Liberty. In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty. 

==Flags==
In 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.  This flag was also associated with the Sons of Liberty. Red and white were common colors of the flags, although other color combinations were used, such as green and white or yellow and white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%5Erv.html|title=Colonial and Revolutionary War Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-librt.html#sons|title=Liberty Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=raven&id=raven_2004_0011_0001_0060|title=The First Navy Jack|first1=Peter|last1=Ansoff|first2=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-américaine de|last2=vexillologie|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|journal=Raven: A Journal of Vexillology|volume=11|pages=1–60|accessdate=10 January 2018|doi=10.5840/raven2004111}}</ref>

==Later societies==
At various times, small secret organizations took the name \"Sons of Liberty.”  They generally left very few records. [[Bennington, Vermont]] had an organization named the Sons of Liberty in the early 1800's that included local notables such as [[Martin Scott (military officer)]] and Hiram Harwood.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shalhope|first=Robert|title=A Tale of New England|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8018-7127-1|location=Baltimore|pages=92-96}}</ref>
 
The name was also used during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Baker, pg. 341</ref> By 1864, the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] group the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] set up an offshoot called ''Order of the Sons of Liberty''.  They both came under federal prosecution in 1864 for treason, especially in Indiana.<ref>{{cite book|author=David C.

A radical wing of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] launched a boycott in the U.S. against British films in 1948, in response to British policies in Palestine. It called itself the \"Sons of Liberty.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Kerry Segrave|title=Foreign Films in America: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVVp0omSDBIC&pg=PA86|year=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8162-0|page=86}}</ref>

The '''Sky Ryders Drum and Bugle Corps''' was an Open Class (since renamed \"World Class\") competitive junior [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] from 1955 to 1994. Based in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] and later in [[DeSoto, Texas]], the Sky Ryders was a member corps of [[Drum Corps International]] and a six time DCI World Championship Finalist.<ref name=\"sky\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Sky Ryders History]</ref>

==History==
The organization was first established as a junior corps in 1952 called the Lysle Rishel Post 68 Drum & Bugle Corps and led by director Ken Fairbrother, a former member of the Hawthorne Caballeros. In 1955, under the direction of H.D. \"Prof\" McCosh, the corps was reorganized and adopted the name Sky Ryders.  In 1957, they began winning competitions in Kansas, and in 1959 they started competing in American Legion national competitions. They won their first [[American Legion]] Kansas state Championship in 1959, repeated in 1960-62, and won another in 1964. In 1959, the corps also attended its first American Legion National championship, placing tenth of 24 junior corps. This was followed by American Legion Nationals finishes of 6th, 5th, and 4th the following three seasons and 3rd in 1964.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\">{{cite book | title=A History of Drum & Bugle Corps | volume=Vol. 2 | first=Steve | last=Vickers | publisher=Drum Corps World | date=2003}}</ref>

The corps experienced financial and membership issues in 1966, taking the season off after nearly disbanding. When it returned in 1967, it was largely with members of their feeder corps, the Jets, and with girls allowed into the brass and percussion sections rather than being restricted to the color guard.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In 1969, brass instructor John Simpson recruited Larry Kerchner to collaborate on the corps' music. The corps had a successful year, again winning the Kansas American Legion title and placing 7th at the American Legion Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1967 through 1971, the corps mostly confined its travel to Kansas and the surrounding states. At around that same time, the Sky Ryders were one of the first corps to make the switch from French horns to mellophones for mid-range voices.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In 1972, the Sky Ryders traveled to [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] for the inaugural Drum Corps International World Championship, placing 20th of the 39 corps from across the USA and Canada. The corps would not return to the DCI Championships until competing as a Class A corps at [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Denver]] in 1977, where they finished in 3rd place. Up until that time, the Sky Ryders had always been a hometown corps, drawing its members exclusively from the Hutchinson area, but in 1977, the corps began to recruit from a wider area.  In 1978, the corps switched from Class A to Open Class and had increasing success, placing 31st in Denver that year and to 22nd  and 17th in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] the next two years. During that time, corps director George Tuthill and brass instructor John Simpson attracted many members from Oklahoma and Texas, and Kerchner's unique and melodic arrangements were popular with fans and judges.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In the early 1980s, Tuthill set out to get the Sky Ryders into DCI's elite Top 12. In 1981, they placed 14th in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] at the first DCI Championships held outside the United States. In 1982, Tuthill's goal was accomplished with a 10th-place finish in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The corps' huge rainbow flag, unfolded behind the corps during their show and displayed in the stands afterwards, and their closing number of \"Over the Rainbow\" quickly became Sky Ryders traditions.  In 1983, the Sky Ryders received particular attention performing Kerchner's Grammy-nominated jazz arrangement of \"Home on the Range,\" and for the second year in a row, the corps placed in DCI's Top 12 with a 12th-place finish in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

The corps dropped out of DCI Finals in 1984, placing 17th in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1985, the corps had a stronger year with a 15th-place finish at [[Camp Randall Stadium]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], performing the first of two successive productions of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Starting in 1986, under the direction of alumnus Dale Antoine and a design team led by Tommy Keenum, the Sky Ryders returned to DCI's Top 12. Over the next three years, they entertained audiences with dramatized productions of the popular musicals \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"West Side Story,\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and gained a reputation as \"The Great Story Tellers.\" Their \"Wizard of Oz\" show in 1986 included elements such as a Wicked Witch riding a bicycle, gold lamé \"yellow brick road\" flags, and colorful guard costumes for the various characters in the film. They finished the year with the corps' highest placement of 9th in Madison.1987's \"West Side Story\" placed 12th as did 1988's \"The Sound of Music\", with both of those programs also containing costuming and actions that helped to tell the story.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

After achieving popularity, the corps suddenly switched directions in 1989 with cadet-style uniforms and a more darkly themed show, including \"March (from Symphonic Metamorphosis)\" and selections from \"Carmina Burana.\" The corps finished the season out of DCI Finals with a Semifinals tie for 14th place. The stylistic change and the fall from Finals were elements in the  financial difficulties the corps faced in 1990. From its roots as a hometown corps, the Sky Ryders had evolved into a corps with mostly out-of-state members, with the bulk of those members coming from Texas, so, in order to survive, the corps' leadership relocated the organization to [[De Soto, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].  After the challenges of the move to Texas, the corps finished the 1990 season in 19th place during DCI Semifinals in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In 1991, the Sky Ryders once again regained DCI Top 12 status with a return to the corps' tradition of popular musicals, this time with Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot.\" The corps placed 12th in DCI Finals held in their new hometown of Dallas. The corps performed another popular Lerner and Loewe musical in 1992 with the Scottish-themed \"Brigadoon,\" but during DCI's 20th Anniversary Championships in Madison, the corps only placed 15th in Semifinals.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In 1993, the Sky Ryders once more abandoned their successful formula for a \"more contemporary show\", including \"Connotations\" by Edward Gregson and \"Symphony No. 2\" by David Diamond, and the corps finished their last full season of competition with a placement of 20th in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. Despite plans for a 1994 season, the corps' continuing financial difficulties resulted in bankruptcy and the disbanding of the corps. Although the corps had departed the scene, the efforts of the unit's director during its Texas tenure, Paul Proctor, saw that all of the corps' substantial debt was eventually paid off.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

==Sky Ryders Alumni Scholarship==
In 2011, the Sky Ryders Alumni established an annual scholarship campaign which benefits members of the [[Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps]].

The '''Sky Ryders Drum and Bugle Corps''' was an Open Class (since renamed \"World Class\") competitive junior [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] from 1955 to 1994. Based in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] and later in [[DeSoto, Texas]], the Sky Ryders was a member corps of [[Drum Corps International]] and a six time DCI World Championship Finalist.<ref name=\"sky\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Sky Ryders History]</ref>

==History==
The organization was first established as a junior corps in 1952 called the Lysle Rishel Post 68 Drum & Bugle Corps and led by director Ken Fairbrother, a former member of the Hawthorne Caballeros. In 1955, under the direction of H.D. \"Prof\" McCosh, the corps was reorganized and adopted the name Sky Ryders.  In 1957, they began winning competitions in Kansas, and in 1959 they started competing in American Legion national competitions. They won their first [[American Legion]] Kansas state Championship in 1959, repeated in 1960-62, and won another in 1964. In 1959, the corps also attended its first American Legion National championship, placing tenth of 24 junior corps. This was followed by American Legion Nationals finishes of 6th, 5th, and 4th the following three seasons and 3rd in 1964.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\">{{cite book | title=A History of Drum & Bugle Corps | volume=Vol. 2 | first=Steve | last=Vickers | publisher=Drum Corps World | date=2003}}</ref>

The corps experienced financial and membership issues in 1966, taking the season off after nearly disbanding. When it returned in 1967, it was largely with members of their feeder corps, the Jets, and with girls allowed into the brass and percussion sections rather than being restricted to the color guard.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In 1969, brass instructor John Simpson recruited Larry Kerchner to collaborate on the corps' music. The corps had a successful year, again winning the Kansas American Legion title and placing 7th at the American Legion Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1967 through 1971, the corps mostly confined its travel to Kansas and the surrounding states. At around that same time, the Sky Ryders were one of the first corps to make the switch from French horns to mellophones for mid-range voices.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In 1972, the Sky Ryders traveled to [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] for the inaugural Drum Corps International World Championship, placing 20th of the 39 corps from across the USA and Canada. The corps would not return to the DCI Championships until competing as a Class A corps at [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Denver]] in 1977, where they finished in 3rd place. Up until that time, the Sky Ryders had always been a hometown corps, drawing its members exclusively from the Hutchinson area, but in 1977, the corps began to recruit from a wider area.  In 1978, the corps switched from Class A to Open Class and had increasing success, placing 31st in Denver that year and to 22nd  and 17th in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] the next two years. During that time, corps director George Tuthill and brass instructor John Simpson attracted many members from Oklahoma and Texas, and Kerchner's unique and melodic arrangements were popular with fans and judges.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In the early 1980s, Tuthill set out to get the Sky Ryders into DCI's elite Top 12. In 1981, they placed 14th in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] at the first DCI Championships held outside the United States. In 1982, Tuthill's goal was accomplished with a 10th-place finish in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The corps' huge rainbow flag, unfolded behind the corps during their show and displayed in the stands afterwards, and their closing number of \"Over the Rainbow\" quickly became Sky Ryders traditions.  In 1983, the Sky Ryders received particular attention performing Kerchner's Grammy-nominated jazz arrangement of \"Home on the Range,\" and for the second year in a row, the corps placed in DCI's Top 12 with a 12th-place finish in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

The corps dropped out of DCI Finals in 1984, placing 17th in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1985, the corps had a stronger year with a 15th-place finish at [[Camp Randall Stadium]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], performing the first of two successive productions of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Starting in 1986, under the direction of alumnus Dale Antoine and a design team led by Tommy Keenum, the Sky Ryders returned to DCI's Top 12. Over the next three years, they entertained audiences with dramatized productions of the popular musicals \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"West Side Story,\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and gained a reputation as \"The Great Story Tellers.\" Their \"Wizard of Oz\" show in 1986 included elements such as a Wicked Witch riding a bicycle, gold lamé \"yellow brick road\" flags, and colorful guard costumes for the various characters in the film. They finished the year with the corps' highest placement of 9th in Madison.1987's \"West Side Story\" placed 12th as did 1988's \"The Sound of Music\", with both of those programs also containing costuming and actions that helped to tell the story.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

After achieving popularity, the corps suddenly switched directions in 1989 with cadet-style uniforms and a more darkly themed show, including \"March (from Symphonic Metamorphosis)\" and selections from \"Carmina Burana.\" The corps finished the season out of DCI Finals with a Semifinals tie for 14th place. The stylistic change and the fall from Finals were elements in the  financial difficulties the corps faced in 1990. From its roots as a hometown corps, the Sky Ryders had evolved into a corps with mostly out-of-state members, with the bulk of those members coming from Texas, so, in order to survive, the corps' leadership relocated the organization to [[De Soto, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].  After the challenges of the move to Texas, the corps finished the 1990 season in 19th place during DCI Semifinals in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In 1991, the Sky Ryders once again regained DCI Top 12 status with a return to the corps' tradition of popular musicals, this time with Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot.\" The corps placed 12th in DCI Finals held in their new hometown of Dallas. The corps performed another popular Lerner and Loewe musical in 1992 with the Scottish-themed \"Brigadoon,\" but during DCI's 20th Anniversary Championships in Madison, the corps only placed 15th in Semifinals.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

In 1993, the Sky Ryders once more abandoned their successful formula for a \"more contemporary show\", including \"Connotations\" by Edward Gregson and \"Symphony No. 2\" by David Diamond, and the corps finished their last full season of competition with a placement of 20th in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. Despite plans for a 1994 season, the corps' continuing financial difficulties resulted in bankruptcy and the disbanding of the corps. Although the corps had departed the scene, the efforts of the unit's director during its Texas tenure, Paul Proctor, saw that all of the corps' substantial debt was eventually paid off.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>

'''''The Devil's Rejects''''' is a 2005 American [[horror film]]  written, produced and directed by [[Rob Zombie]], and it is the second film in the [[List of Firefly (film series) characters|''Firefly'' film series]], a [[sequel]] to his 2003 film ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]''. The film is centered on the run of three members of the psychopathic<ref>{{cite journal  | last1 = Leistedt | first1 = Samuel J. | last2 = Linkowski | first2 = Paul | title = Psychopathy and the Cinema: Fact or Fiction? | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | date = January 2014 | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 167–174 | doi = 10.1111/1556-4029.12359 | pmid = 24329037 | ref = harv}}</ref> antagonist [[List of Rob Zombie characters#Firefly Family|family from the previous film]], now seen as [[villain]]ous protagonists, with [[Sid Haig]], [[Bill Moseley]], and Zombie's wife [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] reprising their roles, and [[Leslie Easterbrook]] replacing [[Karen Black]] as the matriarch.

The film was released on July 22, 2005, to minor commercial success and mixed but more positive reviews over its predecessor. At the time of release and in the years since, the film has garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]]. This is the final film to feature actor [[Matthew McGrory]] before his death the same year (although McGrory did have an uncredited posthumous cameo in 2017's ''[[The Evil Within (2017 film)|The Evil Within]]'', which was filmed in 2002). The film's DVD release is dedicated to his \"loving memory\".

==Plot==
Seven months later after the Halloween sacrifice, on May 18, 1978, [[Texas]] Sheriff John Quincey Wydell and a large posse of [[state troopers]] issue a [[search and destroy]] mission on the Firefly family for over 75 [[homicide]]s and disappearances over the past several years. The family arm themselves and fire on the officers. Rufus is killed and Mother Firefly is taken into custody, while Otis and Baby escape. They steal a car and, after killing the driver, they go to Kahiki Palms, a run-down motel.

While at the motel, Otis and Baby take a band called Banjo and Sullivan hostage in their room, and Otis shoots the roadie when he returns. Meanwhile, Baby's father, [[Captain Spaulding]], decides to rendezvous with Baby and Otis. En route, his truck runs out of gas, and he frightens a boy and assaults the boy's mother before stealing her car. Back at the motel, Otis rapes Roy's wife Gloria and demands Adam and Roy come with him on an errand.

Otis drives his two prisoners to a place where he buried weapons. While walking to the location, the two prisoners attack Otis, but Otis bludgeons Roy and cuts Adam's face off. Back at the motel, Adam's wife Wendy tries to escape out the bathroom window. When Gloria attempts to rebel, Baby kills her. Wendy runs out of the motel but is caught by Captain Spaulding, who knocks her unconscious. Otis returns, and all three leave the motel together in the band's van.

The motel maid comes to clean the room, and she discovers the murder scene. The maid enters the bathroom, where she sees \"The Devil's Rejects\" written on the wall in blood; she is startled by Wendy, who is accidentally killed when she runs out to the highway to seek help while she is in shock. Wydell calls a pair of amoral bounty hunters—the \"Unholy Two\"—Rondo and Billy Ray, to help him find the Fireflys. While investigating, they discover an associate of Spaulding's named Charlie Altamont. Wydell begins to lose his sanity when Mother Firefly reveals that she murdered his brother. After having a dream in which his brother commands him to avenge his death, Wydell stabs Mother Firefly to death. The surviving Fireflys gather at a brothel owned by Charlie, where he offers them shelter from the police.

After he leaves the brothel, Wydell threatens Charlie to give up the Fireflys. With the help of the \"Unholy Two\", the sheriff takes the family back to the Firefly house where he tortures them, using similar methods they used on their own victims. He nails Otis' hands to his chair and staples crime scene photographs to Otis's and Baby's stomachs; he then beats and shocks Captain Spaulding and Otis with a cattle prod and taunts Baby about the death of her mother.

Wydell sets the house on fire and leaves Otis and Spaulding to burn, but he lets Baby loose outside so he can hunt her for sport. Charlie returns to save the Firefly family, but he is killed by Wydell. Baby gets shot in the calf of her left leg, brutally horse-whipped, and then strangled by Wydell. Tiny suddenly arrives and intervenes, breaking Wydell's neck and saving the Firefly family. Otis, Baby, and Spaulding escape in Charlie's 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]], leaving behind Tiny, who [[Suicide|walks back into the burning house]]. The trio drives, badly injured and seemingly humbled by their experience with a clearer understanding of the torment and anguish that they had put their past victims through. As Otis drives down the road with Baby and Spaulding asleep in the back seat he notices a police barricade ahead of them. Realizing that they will not make it out alive, he wakes Baby and Spaulding and hands them each a gun. As [[Free Bird|a song playing on the radio declares they \"can't change\"]], they speed toward the barricade, guns blazing, as the police return fire.

'''''The Devil's Rejects''''' is a 2005 American [[horror film]]  written, produced and directed by [[Rob Zombie]], and it is the second film in the [[List of Firefly (film series) characters|''Firefly'' film series]], a [[sequel]] to his 2003 film ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]''.

The film was released on July 22, 2005, to minor commercial success and mixed but more positive reviews over its predecessor. At the time of release and in the years since, the film has garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]]. This is the final film to feature actor [[Matthew McGrory]] before his death the same year (although McGrory did have an uncredited posthumous cameo in 2017's ''[[The Evil Within (2017 film)|The Evil Within]]'', which was filmed in 2002). The film's DVD release is dedicated to his \"loving memory\".

==Plot==
Seven months later after the Halloween sacrifice, on May 18, 1978, [[Texas]] Sheriff John Quincey Wydell and a large posse of [[state troopers]] issue a [[search and destroy]] mission on the Firefly family for over 75 [[homicide]]s and disappearances over the past several years. The family arm themselves and fire on the officers. Rufus is killed and Mother Firefly is taken into custody, while Otis and Baby escape. They steal a car and, after killing the driver, they go to Kahiki Palms, a run-down motel.

While at the motel, Otis and Baby take a band called Banjo and Sullivan hostage in their room, and Otis shoots the roadie when he returns. Meanwhile, Baby's father, [[Captain Spaulding]], decides to rendezvous with Baby and Otis. En route, his truck runs out of gas, and he frightens a boy and assaults the boy's mother before stealing her car. Back at the motel, Otis rapes Roy's wife Gloria and demands Adam and Roy come with him on an errand.

Otis drives his two prisoners to a place where he buried weapons. While walking to the location, the two prisoners attack Otis, but Otis bludgeons Roy and cuts Adam's face off. Back at the motel, Adam's wife Wendy tries to escape out the bathroom window. When Gloria attempts to rebel, Baby kills her. Wendy runs out of the motel but is caught by Captain Spaulding, who knocks her unconscious. Otis returns, and all three leave the motel together in the band's van.

The motel maid comes to clean the room, and she discovers the murder scene. The maid enters the bathroom, where she sees \"The Devil's Rejects\" written on the wall in blood; she is startled by Wendy, who is accidentally killed when she runs out to the highway to seek help while she is in shock. Wydell calls a pair of amoral bounty hunters—the \"Unholy Two\"—Rondo and Billy Ray, to help him find the Fireflys. While investigating, they discover an associate of Spaulding's named Charlie Altamont. Wydell begins to lose his sanity when Mother Firefly reveals that she murdered his brother. After having a dream in which his brother commands him to avenge his death, Wydell stabs Mother Firefly to death. The surviving Fireflys gather at a brothel owned by Charlie, where he offers them shelter from the police.

After he leaves the brothel, Wydell threatens Charlie to give up the Fireflys. With the help of the \"Unholy Two\", the sheriff takes the family back to the Firefly house where he tortures them, using similar methods they used on their own victims. He nails Otis' hands to his chair and staples crime scene photographs to Otis's and Baby's stomachs; he then beats and shocks Captain Spaulding and Otis with a cattle prod and taunts Baby about the death of her mother.

Wydell sets the house on fire and leaves Otis and Spaulding to burn, but he lets Baby loose outside so he can hunt her for sport. Charlie returns to save the Firefly family, but he is killed by Wydell. Baby gets shot in the calf of her left leg, brutally horse-whipped, and then strangled by Wydell. Tiny suddenly arrives and intervenes, breaking Wydell's neck and saving the Firefly family. Otis, Baby, and Spaulding escape in Charlie's 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]], leaving behind Tiny, who [[Suicide|walks back into the burning house]]. The trio drives, badly injured and seemingly humbled by their experience with a clearer understanding of the torment and anguish that they had put their past victims through. As Otis drives down the road with Baby and Spaulding asleep in the back seat he notices a police barricade ahead of them. Realizing that they will not make it out alive, he wakes Baby and Spaulding and hands them each a gun. As [[Free Bird|a song playing on the radio declares they \"can't change\"]], they speed toward the barricade, guns blazing, as the police return fire.

===European Cup Winners' Cup===
{{main|1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup}}

After winning the Scottish Cup in 1982, Aberdeen qualified for the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup. After a large preliminary round victory over Sion of Switzerland, the Dons knocked out Dinamo Tirana of Albania and Lech Poznan of Poland to set up a quarter final tie with the West Germans Bayern Munich. After a 0-0 draw in Munich, Aberdeen fell behind early on at home in the second leg before Neil Simpson equalised. Another goal for Bayern Munich seemed to put the game beyond Aberdeen, but two quick goals in the last 20 minutes gave Aberdeen a 3-2 victory. In the semi finals, Belgian team Waterschei of Genk were beaten 5-2 over two legs, and put Aberdeen into the final. Thousands of fans made the trip from Aberdeen to Gothenburg in Sweden to see the Scottish Cup holders play the Spaniards Real Madrid. In a wet evening at the Ullevi Stadium, Aberdeen won 2-1 after extra time to win their first European trophy.

===European Cup Winners' Cup===
{{main|1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup}}

After winning the Scottish Cup in 1982, Aberdeen qualified for the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup. After a large preliminary round victory over Sion of Switzerland, the Dons knocked out Dinamo Tirana of Albania and Lech Poznan of Poland to set up a quarter final tie with the West Germans Bayern Munich. After a 0-0 draw in Munich, Aberdeen fell behind early on at home in the second leg before Neil Simpson equalised. Another goal for Bayern Munich seemed to put the game beyond Aberdeen, but two quick goals in the last 20 minutes gave Aberdeen a 3-2 victory. In the semi finals, Belgian team Waterschei of Genk were beaten 5-2 over two legs, and put Aberdeen into the final. Thousands of fans made the trip from Aberdeen to Gothenburg in Sweden to see the Scottish Cup holders play the Spaniards Real Madrid. In a wet evening at the Ullevi Stadium, Aberdeen won 2-1 after extra time to win their first European trophy.

Upon his arrival to Nightwish, several songs were written to contain duets with then [[Nightwish]] vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]], allowing songwriter and band leader [[Tuomas Holopainen]] to take advantage of Hietala's distinctive raucous voice to add a new dimension to the band. A famous example is Nightwish's cover of \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" from the album \"Century Child.\"

During Nightwish's shows, Turunen would take a break halfway through the set. Before Hietala joined the band, the band would perform an instrumental song during this time. After Hietala joined the band, they performed covers of well-known songs, with Hietala singing the lead vocal part in this break. The band has performed [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s \"[[Crazy Train]]\", [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]'s \"Wild Child\", [[Dio (band)|Dio]]'s \"Don't Talk to Strangers\", [[Megadeth]]'s \"[[Symphony of Destruction]]\" and [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]\". Some of these songs have been put up for sale as well on various Nightwish album releases. Following Turunen's departure from Nightwish, Hietala was much more involved with the production of ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', which was released in September 2007. He sang some songs, completely, and wrote the music for the song \"[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]\", on which he also plays acoustic guitar instead of bass. Hietala is also credited alongside [[Tuomas Holopainen|Holopainen]] for co-writing the song \"[[The Crow, the Owl and the Dove]]\" from Nightwish's 2011 album, ''[[Imaginaerum]]''.

In [[Delain]], Hietala played bass for the album ''[[Lucidity (album)|Lucidity]]'' and was also the main male vocalist on the album with featured vocals on the song ''The Gathering''. He is also featured as vocalist in two of the songs on [[Delain]]'s second album ''[[April Rain]]'' and two songs from [[Delain]]'s fourth album ''[[The Human Contradiction]]''.

In March 2009, Hietala joined the band [[Sapattivuosi]]. They cover [[Black Sabbath]] songs in Finnish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122574 |title=Marco Hietala's Black Sabbath Tribute Band To Play in Poland |date=June 25, 2009 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=March 19, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In this band, however, Hietala does not play bass; he only performs vocals.

On 1 April 2010 it was said that Hietala would leave the band to concentrate on a [[choir]] career.  This was identified as an April Fool's joke, but was also a reference to his participation in ''Kuorosota'' (the localized Finnish version of ''[[Clash of the Choirs]]'') in 2010.  Hietala was the master of the [[Kuopio]] choir in the program's second season.  He came second in the contest, losing in the finals to the [[Joensuu]] choir, headed by pop rock singer [[Ilkka Alanko]].  Tarot's single \"I Walk Forever,\" from the ''[[Gravity of Light (Tarot album)|Gravity of Light]]'' album, was performed for the first time by Hietala, [[Tommi Salmela|Tommi \"Tuple\" Salmela]] and the Kuopio choir during Kuorosota 2010; other songs performed included \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]],\" which Hietala has covered with Nightwish as well.

In June 2010, Hietala joined the heavy metal supergroup HAIL! on two occasions, performing [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Neon Knights]] with [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|Ripper Owens]], [[Andreas Kisser]], [[James LoMenzo]] and [[Paul Bostaph]] at two of their shows in [[Finland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HAIL! Performs With NIGHTWISH's MARCO HIETALA at Finland's SAUNA OPEN AIR|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=141637|publisher=[[BlabberMouth]]}}</ref>

On 14 August 2013 Hietala was the first singer to be confirmed by [[Arjen Anthony Lucassen|Arjen Lucassen]] to guest on [[Ayreon]]'s new album [[The Theory of Everything (Ayreon album)|''The Theory of Everything'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEc6ch6mPPw |title=Marco Hietala guests on Ayreon Theory of Everything |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>

Hietala released his first solo album ''Mustan sydämen rovio'' in May 2019. He released the album under his birthname Marko Hietala and will be using the name also in his other projects in the future. Hietala has described his solo material as \"hard [[progressive rock|prog]]\".<ref name=\"yle3-10761251\">https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10761251</ref> An English version of the album, titled ''[[Pyre of the Black Heart]]'' ([[Nuclear Blast]]), followed in January 2020.<ref name=\"nuclearblast\">https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/6361050.6134325.marko-hietala-announce-first-solo-album.html</ref> Joining him on the albums are drummer [[Anssi Nykänen]], keyboardist [[Vili Ollila]] and guitarist [[Tuomas Wäinölä]] with whom he also toured in Finland in the summer and autum of 2019.<ref name=\"yle3-10761251\" /> The band will embark on a European tour in February 2020.<ref name=\"nuclearblast\" />

==Equipment==
Hietala uses [[Warwick (bass guitar)|Warwick]] bass guitars, particularly the Infinity NT (birdseye maple top) and Vampyre NT (flame maple top) 4-string models tuned D Standard (DGCF) and Drop C (CGCF). He also owns a Warwick Buzzard JE with a rusty finish equipped with a detuner (Used, among others, in the music videoes for Elan and Endless Forms Most Beautiful), and a Kramer bass. He uses Warwick's Hellborg amplifier and cabs. After joining Nightwish he used a SansAmp GT2 distortion pedal for some time. ¨¨

Hietala also uses a custom made Warwick/Framus doubleneck bass/electric guitar, based on the Warwick Infinity.

From Century Child until the End of an Era Hietala used an Infinity almost exclusively for live and studio applications. Later, the Vampyre became his axe of choice (almost for the whole period with Anette as Nightwish's vocalist). The first time he can be seen with a Vampyre is the Bye Bye Beautiful music video. From the Imaginaerum tour going forward Buzzard became his preferred brand, but occasionally he still can be seen with an Infinity.

==Influences==
Hietala has stated that the biggest influence on him as a bassist is [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Bob Daisley]], while [[Ronnie James Dio]] and [[Rob Halford]] are his biggest influence as a vocalist. He has also stated that he listens to wide array of music ranging from \"really sensitive stuff to a lot of really hard stuff\", saying that he \"tend[s] to soak up almost everything\" which \"somehow ends up being used\" when he writes his own music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQgZtMjhVE|title=Marco Hietala interview|date=July 5, 2009|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingsofdarkness.net/php/profile_marco.php |title=~ Wings of Darkness ~ The Official Tarot Website |publisher=Wingsofdarkness.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Hietala has two children with his ex-wife Manki, twin boys Antto and Miro. He and his family currently live in [[Kuopio]], Finland. When he is not touring, he enjoys reading books, playing video games, and watching movies. He especially likes [[fantasy]], horror and science fiction books. In 2016, a Finnish newspaper reported that Hietala had filed for divorce.<ref>[http://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000001177177.html]</ref> In August 2018 he married Camila Cavalcanti<ref>[https://www.seiska.fi/Uutiset/Vau-mika-morsian-Kesalla-avioitunut-Nightwish-Marco-ja-Cami-vaimo-juhlivat-naimisiinmenoaan]</ref>

Upon his arrival to Nightwish, several songs were written to contain duets with then [[Nightwish]] vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]], allowing songwriter and band leader [[Tuomas Holopainen]] to take advantage of Hietala's distinctive raucous voice to add a new dimension to the band. A famous example is Nightwish's cover of \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" from the album \"Century Child.\"

During Nightwish's shows, Turunen would take a break halfway through the set. Before Hietala joined the band, the band would perform an instrumental song during this time. After Hietala joined the band, they performed covers of well-known songs, with Hietala singing the lead vocal part in this break. The band has performed [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s \"[[Crazy Train]]\", [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]'s \"Wild Child\", [[Dio (band)|Dio]]'s \"Don't Talk to Strangers\", [[Megadeth]]'s \"[[Symphony of Destruction]]\" and [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]\". Some of these songs have been put up for sale as well on various Nightwish album releases. Following Turunen's departure from Nightwish, Hietala was much more involved with the production of ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', which was released in September 2007. He sang some songs, completely, and wrote the music for the song \"[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]\", on which he also plays acoustic guitar instead of bass. Hietala is also credited alongside [[Tuomas Holopainen|Holopainen]] for co-writing the song \"[[The Crow, the Owl and the Dove]]\" from Nightwish's 2011 album, ''[[Imaginaerum]]''.

In [[Delain]], Hietala played bass for the album ''[[Lucidity (album)|Lucidity]]'' and was also the main male vocalist on the album with featured vocals on the song ''The Gathering''. He is also featured as vocalist in two of the songs on [[Delain]]'s second album ''[[April Rain]]'' and two songs from [[Delain]]'s fourth album ''[[The Human Contradiction]]''.

In March 2009, Hietala joined the band [[Sapattivuosi]]. They cover [[Black Sabbath]] songs in Finnish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122574 |title=Marco Hietala's Black Sabbath Tribute Band To Play in Poland |date=June 25, 2009 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=March 19, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In this band, however, Hietala does not play bass; he only performs vocals.

On 1 April 2010 it was said that Hietala would leave the band to concentrate on a [[choir]] career.  This was identified as an April Fool's joke, but was also a reference to his participation in ''Kuorosota'' (the localized Finnish version of ''[[Clash of the Choirs]]'') in 2010.  Hietala was the master of the [[Kuopio]] choir in the program's second season.  He came second in the contest, losing in the finals to the [[Joensuu]] choir, headed by pop rock singer [[Ilkka Alanko]].  Tarot's single \"I Walk Forever,\" from the ''[[Gravity of Light (Tarot album)|Gravity of Light]]'' album, was performed for the first time by Hietala, [[Tommi Salmela|Tommi \"Tuple\" Salmela]] and the Kuopio choir during Kuorosota 2010; other songs performed included \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]],\" which Hietala has covered with Nightwish as well.

In June 2010, Hietala joined the heavy metal supergroup HAIL! on two occasions, performing [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Neon Knights]] with [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|Ripper Owens]], [[Andreas Kisser]], [[James LoMenzo]] and [[Paul Bostaph]] at two of their shows in [[Finland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HAIL! Performs With NIGHTWISH's MARCO HIETALA at Finland's SAUNA OPEN AIR|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=141637|publisher=[[BlabberMouth]]}}</ref>

On 14 August 2013 Hietala was the first singer to be confirmed by [[Arjen Anthony Lucassen|Arjen Lucassen]] to guest on [[Ayreon]]'s new album [[The Theory of Everything (Ayreon album)|''The Theory of Everything'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEc6ch6mPPw |title=Marco Hietala guests on Ayreon Theory of Everything |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>

Hietala released his first solo album ''Mustan sydämen rovio'' in May 2019. He released the album under his birthname Marko Hietala and will be using the name also in his other projects in the future. Hietala has described his solo material as \"hard [[progressive rock|prog]]\".<ref name=\"yle3-10761251\">https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10761251</ref> An English version of the album, titled ''[[Pyre of the Black Heart]]'' ([[Nuclear Blast]]), followed in January 2020.<ref name=\"nuclearblast\">https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/6361050.6134325.marko-hietala-announce-first-solo-album.html</ref> Joining him on the albums are drummer [[Anssi Nykänen]], keyboardist [[Vili Ollila]] and guitarist [[Tuomas Wäinölä]] with whom he also toured in Finland in the summer and autum of 2019.<ref name=\"yle3-10761251\" /> The band will embark on a European tour in February 2020.<ref name=\"nuclearblast\" />

==Equipment==
Hietala uses [[Warwick (bass guitar)|Warwick]] bass guitars, particularly the Infinity NT (birdseye maple top) and Vampyre NT (flame maple top) 4-string models tuned D Standard (DGCF) and Drop C (CGCF). He also owns a Warwick Buzzard JE with a rusty finish equipped with a detuner (Used, among others, in the music videoes for Elan and Endless Forms Most Beautiful), and a Kramer bass. He uses Warwick's Hellborg amplifier and cabs. After joining Nightwish he used a SansAmp GT2 distortion pedal for some time. ¨¨

Hietala also uses a custom made Warwick/Framus doubleneck bass/electric guitar, based on the Warwick Infinity.

From Century Child until the End of an Era Hietala used an Infinity almost exclusively for live and studio applications. Later, the Vampyre became his axe of choice (almost for the whole period with Anette as Nightwish's vocalist). The first time he can be seen with a Vampyre is the Bye Bye Beautiful music video. From the Imaginaerum tour going forward Buzzard became his preferred brand, but occasionally he still can be seen with an Infinity.

==Influences==
Hietala has stated that the biggest influence on him as a bassist is [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Bob Daisley]], while [[Ronnie James Dio]] and [[Rob Halford]] are his biggest influence as a vocalist. He has also stated that he listens to wide array of music ranging from \"really sensitive stuff to a lot of really hard stuff\", saying that he \"tend[s] to soak up almost everything\" which \"somehow ends up being used\" when he writes his own music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQgZtMjhVE|title=Marco Hietala interview|date=July 5, 2009|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingsofdarkness.net/php/profile_marco.php |title=~ Wings of Darkness ~ The Official Tarot Website |publisher=Wingsofdarkness.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Hietala has two children with his ex-wife Manki, twin boys Antto and Miro. He and his family currently live in [[Kuopio]], Finland. When he is not touring, he enjoys reading books, playing video games, and watching movies. He especially likes [[fantasy]], horror and science fiction books. In 2016, a Finnish newspaper reported that Hietala had filed for divorce.<ref>[http://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000001177177.html]</ref> In August 2018 he married Camila Cavalcanti<ref>[https://www.seiska.fi/Uutiset/Vau-mika-morsian-Kesalla-avioitunut-Nightwish-Marco-ja-Cami-vaimo-juhlivat-naimisiinmenoaan]</ref>

The '''Fifth Crusade''' (1217&ndash;1221) was an attempt by Western Europeans to reacquire [[Jerusalem]] and the rest of the [[Holy Land]] by first conquering [[Cairo]], the capital of the powerful [[Ayyubid]] state in [[Egypt]].

[[Pope Innocent III]] and his successor [[Pope Honorius III]] organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]], and an attack against [[Jerusalem]] ultimately left the city in Muslim hands.  Later in 1218, a German army led by [[Oliver of Paderborn]], and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]] under [[Kaykaus I]] and attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.

After occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. On the way, they laid siege to [[Aswan]] from the north side, but were turned back after they were trapped and their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat. Sultan [[al-Kamil]] ordered the destruction of the dam blocking the Nile River which lead to the flooding of the Crusader camp. They retreated to a nearby hilltop where they resisted to the point of starvation. The siege resulted in a great number of Crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army. Al-Kamil forced Europe to retreat from Damietta - and Egypt altogether - and to an eight-year peace agreement.

==Preparations==
[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'', calling all of Christendom to join a new [[crusade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Thomas W.|date=2019|title=How to craft a crusade call: Pope Innocent III and Quia maior (1213)|journal=Historical Research|language=en|volume=92|issue=255|pages=2–23|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12258|issn=1468-2281}}</ref> This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.<ref name=\"cf\">{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman| authorlink = Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02387-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer }}</ref>

===France===
The message of the crusade was preached in France by [[Robert of Courçon]]; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.

In 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.

===Hungary and Germany===
[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew was estimated to have the largest royal army in the history of the crusades. (Stated strengths of 20,000 knights, 12,000 castle-garrisons and 200,000 foot soldiers were likely an exaggeration).<ref>Wolff, Robert L. and Hazard, H. W., ''A History of the Crusades: Volume Two, The Later Crusades 1187-1311'', The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, 1977, pg. 389</ref>

===Portugal===
According to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts [[William I of Holland]] and [[George of Weid]] they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217-1218\", ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History'' 15 (2019)</ref>
At their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the [[Almohad]] controlled city of [[Alcácer do Sal]]. The [[Frisians]] according to ''[[De itinere frisonum]],'' however, refused on account of [[Innocent III]]'s disqualification of the venture at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].<ref>Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alcácer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref> The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured [[Alcácer do Sal]] with the help of the [[Military order (religious society)|military orders]] on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of [[Seville]], [[Badajoz]], and [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]] to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alcácer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>

===Georgia===
Pope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]] in 1222.  After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>

Decades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.

==Campaign==
[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|left|180px|King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]

===Holy Land===
The first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387–388}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387–388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147–148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. They landed on 9 October on [[Cyprus]] from where they sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and joined [[John of Brienne]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Hugh I of Cyprus]], and Prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]] to fight against the [[Ayyubids]] in [[Syria]]. Until his return to Hungary, King Andrew remained the leader of Christian forces in the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Thomas Keightley, Dionysius Lardner: ''Outlines of history: from the earliest period to the present time'' (page 210)</ref> In October 1217, the leaders of the crusaders - Masters of Hospitallers, Templars and Teutonic knights with the leaders and dignitaries of the crusade - held a war council in Acre, over which King Andrew II presided.<ref>Kenneth M. Setton, Norman P. Zacour, Harry W. Hazard: ''A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East'' (page 358)</ref>

King Andrew's well-mounted army defeated sultan [[Al-Adil I]] at [[Bethsaida]] on the [[Jordan River]] on 10 November 1217. Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics. At the beginning of 1218 Andrew, who was very sick, decided to return to Hungary.<ref>(Jean Richard: ''The Crusades'', c 1071-c. 1291) page 298.</ref><ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title= The Crusades: A History of One of the Most Epic Military Campaigns of All Time |author= Jonathan Howard |year= 2011 |publisher= BookCaps Study Guides [for Kindle; Golgotha Press for paperback] |page= |isbn= 9781610428040 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWEUg5pMqJYC&pg=PT22 |access-date=12 May 2015 }}</ref>

Andrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, and Bohemund and Hugh also returned home.<ref name=Howard/>

===Alliance with the Sultanate of Rum===
Later in 1218 Oliver of Cologne arrived with a new German army and the count of Holland [[William I, Count of Holland|William I]] arrived with a mixed army consisting of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers. With Leopold and John they discussed attacking [[Damietta]] in Egypt. To accomplish this, they allied with [[Kaykaus I]], Seljuq Sultan of Rûm in [[Anatolia]], who attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RAbaJ3EbWjUC&pg=PR11&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title=The 14th and Final Crusade to the Middle East: Crusades from the 11th Century to the 21st Century |last1=Conte |first1=Joseph J. |website=[[Google Books]] |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn=9781452055466 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bWQFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT203&dq=kaykaus+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=kaykaus%20fifth%20crusade&f=false |title= A Clash of Thrones: The Power-crazed Medieval Kings, Popes and Emperors of Europe |last1=Rawson|first1=Andrew |website=[[Google Books]] |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9780750966788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UCblDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT301&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title= Afghanistan's Experiences: The History of the Most Horrifying Events Involving Politics, Religion, and Terrorism |last1=Hadi |first1=Hamdi |website=[[Google Books]] |date=31 March 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9781524600068 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tKSjW-j2G1YC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=sultanate+of+rum+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=sultanate%20of%20rum%20fifth%20crusade&f=false

===Egypt===
In July 1218 the crusaders began their [[Siege of Damietta (1218–19)|siege of Damietta]], and despite resistance from the unprepared sultan [[Al-Adil]], the tower outside the city was taken on August 25. They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Courçon]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.

Immediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. 

Then in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.

By now al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Kaykaus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.

==Aftermath==
The terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.

The failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.

==Impact on literature==
The ''[[Palästinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

The '''Fifth Crusade''' (1217&ndash;1221) was an attempt by Western Europeans to reacquire [[Jerusalem]] and the rest of the [[Holy Land]] by first conquering [[Cairo]], the capital of the powerful [[Ayyubid]] state in [[Egypt]].

[[Pope Innocent III]] and his successor [[Pope Honorius III]] organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]], and an attack against [[Jerusalem]] ultimately left the city in Muslim hands.  Later in 1218, a German army led by [[Oliver of Paderborn]], and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]] under [[Kaykaus I]] and attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.

After occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. On the way, they laid siege to [[Aswan]] from the north side, but were turned back after they were trapped and their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat. Sultan [[al-Kamil]] ordered the destruction of the dam blocking the Nile River which lead to the flooding of the Crusader camp. They retreated to a nearby hilltop where they resisted to the point of starvation. The siege resulted in a great number of Crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army. Al-Kamil forced Europe to retreat from Damietta - and Egypt altogether - and to an eight-year peace agreement.

==Preparations==
[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'', calling all of Christendom to join a new [[crusade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Thomas W.|date=2019|title=How to craft a crusade call: Pope Innocent III and Quia maior (1213)|journal=Historical Research|language=en|volume=92|issue=255|pages=2–23|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12258|issn=1468-2281}}</ref> This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.<ref name=\"cf\">{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman| authorlink = Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02387-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer }}</ref>

===France===
The message of the crusade was preached in France by [[Robert of Courçon]]; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.

In 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.

===Hungary and Germany===
[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew was estimated to have the largest royal army in the history of the crusades. (Stated strengths of 20,000 knights, 12,000 castle-garrisons and 200,000 foot soldiers were likely an exaggeration).<ref>Wolff, Robert L. and Hazard, H. W., ''A History of the Crusades: Volume Two, The Later Crusades 1187-1311'', The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, 1977, pg. 389</ref>

===Portugal===
According to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts [[William I of Holland]] and [[George of Weid]] they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217-1218\", ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History'' 15 (2019)</ref>
At their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the [[Almohad]] controlled city of [[Alcácer do Sal]]. The [[Frisians]] according to ''[[De itinere frisonum]],'' however, refused on account of [[Innocent III]]'s disqualification of the venture at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].<ref>Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alcácer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref> The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured [[Alcácer do Sal]] with the help of the [[Military order (religious society)|military orders]] on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of [[Seville]], [[Badajoz]], and [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]] to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristizábal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alcácer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>

===Georgia===
Pope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]] in 1222.  After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>

Decades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.

===Holy Land===
The first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387–388}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387–388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147–148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. They landed on 9 October on [[Cyprus]] from where they sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and joined [[John of Brienne]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Hugh I of Cyprus]], and Prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]] to fight against the [[Ayyubids]] in [[Syria]]. Until his return to Hungary, King Andrew remained the leader of Christian forces in the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Thomas Keightley, Dionysius Lardner: ''Outlines of history: from the earliest period to the present time'' (page 210)</ref> In October 1217, the leaders of the crusaders - Masters of Hospitallers, Templars and Teutonic knights with the leaders and dignitaries of the crusade - held a war council in Acre, over which King Andrew II presided.<ref>Kenneth M. Setton, Norman P. Zacour, Harry W. Hazard: ''A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East'' (page 358)</ref>

King Andrew's well-mounted army defeated sultan [[Al-Adil I]] at [[Bethsaida]] on the [[Jordan River]] on 10 November 1217. Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics. At the beginning of 1218 Andrew, who was very sick, decided to return to Hungary.<ref>(Jean Richard: ''The Crusades'', c 1071-c. 1291) page 298.</ref><ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title= The Crusades: A History of One of the Most Epic Military Campaigns of All Time |author= Jonathan Howard |year= 2011 |publisher= BookCaps Study Guides [for Kindle; Golgotha Press for paperback] |page= |isbn= 9781610428040 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWEUg5pMqJYC&pg=PT22 |access-date=12 May 2015 }}</ref>

Andrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, and Bohemund and Hugh also returned home.<ref name=Howard/>

===Alliance with the Sultanate of Rum===
Later in 1218 Oliver of Cologne arrived with a new German army and the count of Holland [[William I, Count of Holland|William I]] arrived with a mixed army consisting of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers. With Leopold and John they discussed attacking [[Damietta]] in Egypt. To accomplish this, they allied with [[Keykavus I]], Seljuq Sultan of Rum in [[Anatolia]], who attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RAbaJ3EbWjUC&pg=PR11&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title=The 14th and Final Crusade to the Middle East: Crusades from the 11th Century to the 21st Century |last1=Conte |first1=Joseph J. |website=[[Google Books]] |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn=9781452055466 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bWQFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT203&dq=kaykaus+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=kaykaus%20fifth%20crusade&f=false |title= A Clash of Thrones: The Power-crazed Medieval Kings, Popes and Emperors of Europe |last1=Rawson|first1=Andrew |website=[[Google Books]] |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9780750966788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UCblDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT301&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title= Afghanistan's Experiences: The History of the Most Horrifying Events Involving Politics, Religion, and Terrorism |last1=Hadi |first1=Hamdi |website=[[Google Books]] |date=31 March 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9781524600068 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tKSjW-j2G1YC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=sultanate+of+rum+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=sultanate%20of%20rum%20fifth%20crusade&f=false

===Egypt===
In July 1218 the crusaders began their [[Siege of Damietta (1218–19)|siege of Damietta]], and despite resistance from the unprepared sultan [[Al-Adil]], the tower outside the city was taken on August 25. They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Courçon]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to Al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.

Immediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. 

Then in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of Al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.

By now Al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Keykavus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.

==Aftermath==
The terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to Al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.

The failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.

==Impact on literature==
The ''[[Palästinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

''Home Again'' received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 72, based on 25 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>

Alexis Petredis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave high praise to Butler's production for capturing early '70s soul music and Kiwanuka's vocals and lyrics for feeling authentic, saying that, \"''Home Again''{{'}}s strength lies in the fact that it manages to tick a lot of boxes without sounding like it set out to tick a lot of boxes.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Gareth James of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' also praised Butler for his soft, acoustic production and compared Kiwanuka's vocals positively to [[Bill Withers]], calling the album \"an absolute treat for fans of rootsy vintage soul and a remarkable statement of intent for a debut release.\"<ref name=\"Clash\"/> Helen Brown of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' praised the production aesthetics for sounding complex and easy-going, saying that, \"Despite its lyrical portrait of a constant worrier who feels lost and lonely, ''Home Again'' is a remarkably assured and sophisticated album.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> Hilary Saunders of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' admired Kiwanuka's vocals and lyrics for resembling '70s soul artists like [[Otis Redding]] and [[Marvin Gaye]], concluding with, \"On ''Home Again'', the young Kiwanuka proves that youth and wisdom are not mutually exclusive and his insights and talents, albeit still a bit raw, suggest great things to come.\"<ref name=\"Paste\"/>

Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] noted that Butler's vintage sounding production felt paint-by-numbers at times and Kiwanuka's lyrical content needed fine-tuning, concluding with, \"Despite difficulties, ''Home Again'' is a promising debut by an artist who will no doubt deliver big if developed properly.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' also found Kiwanuka's vocals and lyrics needing a bit more urgency and edge to them but called the album \"a pleasant enough handful of easy-going songs, in which the focus on warmth has left them lacking bite.\"<ref name=\"Independent\"/> Emily Mackay of ''[[NME]]'' questioned the album's lack of gritty lyrics and false authenticity but said there were tracks that felt like genuine work, concluding that \"''Home Again'' provides a sumptuously soft place for tired ears to rest. Enough for many, for now, and a good start.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> Aaron Lavery of [[Drowned in Sound]] felt the album was depressing at times but said that \"[I]t’s a minor quibble however, of a record that has clearly been crafted with great care and a terrific talent behind both the songwriting and the production.\"<ref name=\"DiS\"/>

''Home Again'' received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 72, based on 25 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>

Alexis Petredis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave high praise to Butler's production for capturing early '70s soul music and Kiwanuka's vocals and lyrics for feeling authentic, saying that, \"''Home Again''{{'}}s strength lies in the fact that it manages to tick a lot of boxes without sounding like it set out to tick a lot of boxes.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Gareth James of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' also praised Butler for his soft, acoustic production and compared Kiwanuka's vocals positively to [[Bill Withers]], calling the album \"an absolute treat for fans of rootsy vintage soul and a remarkable statement of intent for a debut release.\"<ref name=\"Clash\"/> Helen Brown of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' praised the production aesthetics for sounding complex and easy-going, saying that, \"Despite its lyrical portrait of a constant worrier who feels lost and lonely, ''Home Again'' is a remarkably assured and sophisticated album.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> Hilary Saunders of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' admired Kiwanuka's vocals and lyrics for resembling '70s soul artists like [[Otis Redding]] and [[Marvin Gaye]], concluding with, \"On ''Home Again'', the young Kiwanuka proves that youth and wisdom are not mutually exclusive and his insights and talents, albeit still a bit raw, suggest great things to come.\"<ref name=\"Paste\"/>

Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] noted that Butler's vintage sounding production felt paint-by-numbers at times and Kiwanuka's lyrical content needed fine-tuning, concluding with, \"Despite difficulties, ''Home Again'' is a promising debut by an artist who will no doubt deliver big if developed properly.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' also found Kiwanuka's vocals and lyrics needing a bit more urgency and edge to them but called the album \"a pleasant enough handful of easy-going songs, in which the focus on warmth has left them lacking bite.\"<ref name=\"Independent\"/> Emily Mackay of ''[[NME]]'' questioned the album's lack of gritty lyrics and false authenticity but said there were tracks that felt like genuine work, concluding that \"''Home Again'' provides a sumptuously soft place for tired ears to rest. Enough for many, for now, and a good start.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> Aaron Lavery of [[Drowned in Sound]] felt the album was depressing at times but said that \"[I]t’s a minor quibble however, of a record that has clearly been crafted with great care and a terrific talent behind both the songwriting and the production.\"<ref name=\"DiS\"/>

In 2011, Jackson criticized the TV show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' for showing a kiss between two male actors, citing the [[Bible]] to justify her criticism.

In 2012, after [[Todd Akin]]'s remarks regarding pregnancies resulting from [[rape]], Jackson said, \"If I got raped, I would have the baby. And if I didn't want to keep it because I had these horrible nightmares, I would adopt it out.

==Data arrangement==
===Text buffer===
Each screen character is represented by two [[octet (computing)|bytes]] aligned as a 16-bit word accessible by the CPU in a single operation. The lower, or character, byte is the actual code point for the current character set, and the higher, or attribute, byte is a [[bit field]] used to select various video attributes such as color, blinking, character set, and so forth.<ref name=\"vgatext\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/vgatext.htm |title=VGA/SVGA Video Programming-VGA Text Mode Operation |website=Osdever.net |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> This byte-pair scheme is among the features that the VGA inherited from the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], and ultimately from the [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]].

#{{note|text_buffer_1}} Depending on the mode setup, attribute bit 7 may be either the blink bit or the fourth background color bit (which allows all 16 colors to be used as background colours).
#{{note|text_buffer_2}} Attribute bit 3 (foreground intensity) also selects between fonts A and B (see [[#Fonts|below]]). Therefore, if these fonts are not the same, this bit is simultaneously an additional code point bit.
#{{note|text_buffer_3}} Attribute bit 0 also enables underline, if certain other attribute bits are set to zero (see [[#Underline|below]]).

Colors are assigned in the same way as in 4-bit indexed color graphic modes (see [[Video Graphics Array#Color palette|VGA color palette]]).
{{anchor|MDA features}}VGA modes have no need for the MDA's reverse and bright attributes because foreground and background colors can be set explicitly.

=== Underline ===
The VGA hardware has the ability to enable an [[underline]] on any character that has attribute bit 0 set. However, since this is an MDA-compatible feature,<ref name=\"mda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/mda.html |title=Monochrome Display Adapter Notes |website=Seasip.info |date=2005-11-06 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> the attribute bits not used by the MDA must be set to zero or the underline will not be shown.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> This means that only bits 3 (intensity) and 7 (blink) can be set concurrently with bit 0 (underline). With the default VGA palette, setting bit 0 to enable underline will also change the text colour to blue. This means text in only two colors can be underlined (5555FF and 0000AA with the default palette).

Despite all this, the underline is not normally visible in color modes, as the location of the underline defaults to a scanline below the character glyph, rendering it invisible.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> If the underline location is set to a visible scanline (as it is by default when switching to an MDA-compatible monochrome text mode), then the underline will appear.

=== Fonts ===

[[Image:Codepage-737.png|296px|thumb|right|VGA shows us the [[code page 737]] with Greek letters]]
Screen fonts used in EGA and VGA are [[monospace font|monospace]] [[raster font]]s containing 256 glyphs. All glyphs in a font are the same size, but this size can be changed. Typically, glyphs are 8 dots wide and 8–16 dots high, however the height can be any value up to a maximum of 32. Each row of a glyph is coded in an [[octet (computing)|8 bit byte]], with high bits to the left of the glyph and low bits to the right. Along with several hardware-dependent fonts stored in the adapter's [[Read-only memory|ROM]], the text mode offers 8<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> loadable fonts. Two active font pointers (font&nbsp;A and font&nbsp;B) select two of the available fonts, although they usually point to the same font. When they each point to different fonts, attribute bit 3 (see [[#Text buffer|above]]) acts as a font selection bit instead of as a foreground color bit. On real VGA hardware, this overrides the bit's use for color selection, but on many clones and emulators, the color selection remains&nbsp;— meaning one font is displayed as normal intensity, and the other as high-intensity. This error can be overcome by changing the palette registers to contain two copies of an 8-color palette.

There are modes with a character box width of 9 dots (e.g. the default 80×25 mode), however the 9th column is used for spacing between characters, so the content cannot be changed. It is always blank, and drawn with the current background colour.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> An exception to this is in ''Line Graphics Enable'' mode, which causes code points [[Hexadecimal|0x]]C0 to 0xDF inclusive<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> to have the 8th column repeated as the 9th. These code points cover those [[box drawing characters]] which must extend all the way to the right side of the glyph box. For this reason, placing letter-like characters in code points 0xC0–0xDF should be avoided. The box drawing characters from 0xB0 to 0xBF are not extended, as they do not point to the right and so do not require extending.

=== Cursor ===
[[Image:itmouse.png|thumb|320px|Mouse cursor in [[Impulse Tracker]]]]
The shape of the cursor is restricted to a [[rectangle]] the full width of the character box, and [[flood fill|filled]] with the foreground color of the character at the cursor's current location. Its height and position may be arbitrary within a character box;.<ref name=\"textcur\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/textcur.htm |title=VGA/SVGA Video Programming-Manipulating the Text-mode Cursor |website=Osdever.net |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> The EGA and many VGA clones allowed a split-box cursor (appearing as two rectangles, one at the top of the character box and one at the bottom), by setting the end of the cursor before the start, however if this is done on the original VGA, the cursor is completely hidden instead.<ref name=\"textcur\"/> The VGA standard does not provide a way to alter the blink rate,<ref name=\"textcur\"/> although common workarounds involve hiding the cursor and using a normal character glyph to provide a so-called software cursor.

A [[computer mouse|mouse]] cursor in TUI (when implemented) is not usually the same thing as a hardware cursor, but a moving rectangle with altered background or a special glyph.

Some text-based interfaces, such as that of [[Impulse Tracker]], went to even greater lengths to provide a smoother and more graphic-looking mouse cursor. This was done by constantly re-generating character glyphs in real-time according to the cursor's on-screen position and the underlying characters.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Access methods ==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2019}}

There are generally two ways to access VGA text-mode for an application: through the [[Video BIOS]] interface or by directly accessing video [[random access memory|RAM]]<ref name=\"pcmag tutor\" /> and I/O ports. The latter method is considerably faster, and allows quick reading of the text buffer, for which reason it is preferred for advanced TUI programs.

The VGA text buffer is located at physical memory address 0xB8000.<ref name=\"cyrix\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/cyborgs/manuals/soft_vga.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816220334/http://www.eyetap.org/cyborgs/manuals/soft_vga.pdf|archive-date=2015-08-16|author=Cyrix|title=VGA Function Specification GXm/MXi Processors|date=1998-01-16}}</ref> Since this is usually used by [[16-bit]] [[x86]] processes operating in real-mode, it is the first half of memory [[x86 memory segmentation|segment]] 0xB800. The text buffer data can be read and written, and [[bitwise operation]]s can be applied. A part of text buffer memory above the scope of the current mode is accessible, but is not shown.

The same physical addresses are used in [[protected mode]]. Applications may either have this part of memory mapped to their [[address space]] or access it via the [[operating system]]. When an application (on a modern [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] OS) does not have control over the [[system console|console]], it accesses a part of system RAM instead of the actual text buffer.

For computers in the 1980s, very fast manipulation <!-- there were some difficulties when same memory was accessed simultaneously by CPU and character generator, but I can’t remember details --> of the text buffer, with the hardware generating the individual pixels as fast as they could be displayed, was extremely useful for a fast UI. Even on relatively modern hardware, the [[computational overhead|overhead]] of text mode emulation via hardware [[All Points Addressable|APA]] (graphics) modes (in which the program generates individual pixels and stores them into the video buffer) may be noticeable.

== Modes and timings ==

=== Video signal ===
From the monitor's side, there is no difference in input signal in a text mode and an [[All Points Addressable|APA]] mode of the same size. A text mode signal may have the same [[video signal timing|timings]] as [[VESA]] standard modes. The same registers are used on adapter's side to set up these parameters in a text mode as in APA modes. The text mode output signal is essentially the same as in graphic modes, but its source is a text buffer and character generator, not a [[framebuffer]] as in APA.

=== PC common text modes ===
Depending on the graphics adapter used, a variety of text modes are available on [[IBM PC compatible]] computers. They are listed on the table below:<ref name=\"PC Mag\">{{cite book|last=Roschi|first=Winn L.|title=VGA Compatibles: Gaining on the New Standard|journal=PC Mag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeosrkjnlM8C&pg=PA177|date=16 February 1988|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|page=177|issn=0888-8507}}</ref>

VGA and compatible cards support MDA, CGA and EGA modes. All colored modes have the same design of text attributes. MDA modes have some specific features (see [[#MDA features|above]])&nbsp;— a text could be emphasized with bright, underline, reverse and blinking attributes.

The most common text mode used in DOS environments and initial Windows consoles is the default 80 columns by 25 rows, or 80×25, with 16 colors and 8×16 pixels large characters. VGA cards always have a built-in font of this size whereas other sizes may require downloading a differently sized font.<ref name=\"openbsd\">{{Cite web|url=https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/vga.4|date=1999-03-20|title=OpenBSD Programmer's Manual, vga|quote=16 different colors can be displayed at the same time. Characters are 8×16 pixels large, and a font consists of 256 characters. A built-in font of this size is always present on a VGA card.}}</ref> This mode was available on practically all [[IBM]] and compatible personal computers.

Two other VGA text modes, 80×40 and 80×50, exist but are less common. [[Windows NT 4.0]] displayed its system messages during the boot process in 80×50 text mode.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApzVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA223|author=Olga Kokoreva|title=Windows XP Registry: A Complete Guide to Customizing and Optimizing Windows XP|quote=On obvious difference between Windows 2000/XP and Windows NT 4.0 is the fact that all system messages that appear during the Windows NT 4.0 boot process are displayed in 80×50 text mode, while Windows 2000 and Windows XP display these messages in VGA mode.}}</ref>

Character sizes and graphical resolutions for the extended [[VESA BIOS Extensions|VESA]]-compatible [[Super VGA]] text modes are manufacturer's dependent. Some cards (e.g. [[S3 Graphics|S3]]) supported custom very large text modes, like 132×43 and 132×25.<ref name=\"S3 manual\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.aub.edu.lb/pub/os/drivers/VGA/S3VIRGE1/375/VC963-3D.TXT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413190535/https://web.aub.edu.lb/pub/os/drivers/VGA/S3VIRGE1/375/VC963-3D.TXT|archive-date=2020-04-13|author=S3 Graphics|title=VC963-3D (S3 ViRGE/DX) User Manual|quote=The S3 ViRGE supports 132×43 and 132×25 extended text modes for text applications. This also allows you to emulate terminals requiring 132 columns of text.}}</ref> Like as in graphic modes, graphic adapters of 2000s commonly are capable to set up an arbitrarily-sized text mode (in reasonable limits) instead of choosing its parameters from some list.

=== SVGATextMode ===
On [[Linux]] and DOS systems with so named SVGA cards, a program called SVGATextMode<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freshmeat.net/projects/svgatextmode|url-status=dead|archive-date=2001-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010203143900/http://freshmeat.net/projects/svgatextmode|title=Project details for SVGATextMode|date=2000-03-19|quote=SVGATextMode uses extra features on SVGA cards to enhance Linux textmodes. It allows setting of the pixel clock, H/V timings, font size, cursor size, etc, and lets you use your video card and monitor to their full potential in textmode.}}</ref> can be used to set up better looking text modes than EGA and VGA standard ones. This is particularly useful for [[Computer monitor#Screen size|large]] (≥&nbsp;17\") monitors, where the normal 80&times;25 VGA text mode's 720&times;400 pixel resolution is far lower than a typical graphics mode would be. SVGATextMode allows setting of the [[pixel clock]] and higher [[refresh rate]], larger font size, cursor size, etc., and allows a better use of the potential of a video card and monitor. In non-Windows systems, the use of SVGATextMode (or alternative options such as the [[Linux framebuffer]]) to obtain a sharp text is critical for [[LCD monitor]]s of [[1280×1024]] (or higher resolution) because none of so named standard text modes fits to this matrix size. SVGATextMode also allows a fine tuning of video signal timings.

Despite the name of this program, only a few of its supported modes conform to SVGA (i.e. VESA) standards.

== General restrictions ==
VGA text mode has some hardware-imposed limitations. Because these are too restrictive for modern (post 2000) applications, the hardware text mode on VGA compatible video adapters only has a limited use.

Colors are assigned in the same way as in 4-bit indexed color graphic modes (see [[Video Graphics Array#Color palette|VGA color palette]]).
{{anchor|MDA features}}VGA modes have no need for the MDA's reverse and bright attributes because foreground and background colors can be set explicitly.

=== Underline ===
The VGA hardware has the ability to enable an [[underline]] on any character that has attribute bit 0 set. However, since this is an MDA-compatible feature,<ref name=\"mda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/mda.html |title=Monochrome Display Adapter Notes |website=Seasip.info |date=2005-11-06 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> the attribute bits not used by the MDA must be set to zero or the underline will not be shown.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> This means that only bits 3 (intensity) and 7 (blink) can be set concurrently with bit 0 (underline). With the default VGA palette, setting bit 0 to enable underline will also change the text colour to blue. This means text in only two colors can be underlined (5555FF and 0000AA with the default palette).

Despite all this, the underline is not normally visible in color modes, as the location of the underline defaults to a scanline below the character glyph, rendering it invisible.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> If the underline location is set to a visible scanline (as it is by default when switching to an MDA-compatible monochrome text mode), then the underline will appear.

=== Fonts ===
[[Image:Norton Utilities 6.01 UI.png|thumb|360px|[[Norton Utilities]] 6.01, an example of advanced [[text user interface|TUI]] which redefines the character set to show tiny graphical [[GUI widget|widget]]s, [[icon (computer)|icon]]s and an arrow pointer in text mode.]]
[[Image:Codepage-737.png|296px|thumb|right|VGA shows us the [[code page 737]] with Greek letters]]
Screen fonts used in EGA and VGA are [[monospace font|monospace]] [[raster font]]s containing 256 glyphs. All glyphs in a font are the same size, but this size can be changed. Typically, glyphs are 8 dots wide and 8–16 dots high, however the height can be any value up to a maximum of 32. Each row of a glyph is coded in an [[octet (computing)|8 bit byte]], with high bits to the left of the glyph and low bits to the right. Along with several hardware-dependent fonts stored in the adapter's [[Read-only memory|ROM]], the text mode offers 8<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> loadable fonts. Two active font pointers (font&nbsp;A and font&nbsp;B) select two of the available fonts, although they usually point to the same font. When they each point to different fonts, attribute bit 3 (see [[#Text buffer|above]]) acts as a font selection bit instead of as a foreground color bit. On real VGA hardware, this overrides the bit's use for color selection, but on many clones and emulators, the color selection remains&nbsp;— meaning one font is displayed as normal intensity, and the other as high-intensity. This error can be overcome by changing the palette registers to contain two copies of an 8-color palette.

There are modes with a character box width of 9 dots (e.g. the default 80×25 mode), however the 9th column is used for spacing between characters, so the content cannot be changed. It is always blank, and drawn with the current background colour.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> An exception to this is in ''Line Graphics Enable'' mode, which causes code points [[Hexadecimal|0x]]C0 to 0xDF inclusive<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> to have the 8th column repeated as the 9th. These code points cover those [[box drawing characters]] which must extend all the way to the right side of the glyph box. For this reason, placing letter-like characters in code points 0xC0–0xDF should be avoided. The box drawing characters from 0xB0 to 0xBF are not extended, as they do not point to the right and so do not require extending.

=== Cursor ===
[[Image:itmouse.png|thumb|320px|Mouse cursor in [[Impulse Tracker]]]]
The shape of the cursor is restricted to a [[rectangle]] the full width of the character box, and [[flood fill|filled]] with the foreground color of the character at the cursor's current location. Its height and position may be arbitrary within a character box;.<ref name=\"textcur\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/textcur.htm |title=VGA/SVGA Video Programming-Manipulating the Text-mode Cursor |website=Osdever.net |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> The EGA and many VGA clones allowed a split-box cursor (appearing as two rectangles, one at the top of the character box and one at the bottom), by setting the end of the cursor before the start, however if this is done on the original VGA, the cursor is completely hidden instead.<ref name=\"textcur\"/> The VGA standard does not provide a way to alter the blink rate,<ref name=\"textcur\"/> although common workarounds involve hiding the cursor and using a normal character glyph to provide a so-called software cursor.

A [[computer mouse|mouse]] cursor in TUI (when implemented) is not usually the same thing as a hardware cursor, but a moving rectangle with altered background or a special glyph.

Some text-based interfaces, such as that of [[Impulse Tracker]], went to even greater lengths to provide a smoother and more graphic-looking mouse cursor. This was done by constantly re-generating character glyphs in real-time according to the cursor's on-screen position and the underlying characters.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The text buffer data can be read and written, and [[bitwise operation]]s can be applied. A part of text buffer memory above the scope of the current mode is accessible, but is not shown.

The same physical addresses are used in [[protected mode]]. Applications may either have this part of memory mapped to their [[address space]] or access it via the [[operating system]]. When an application (on a modern [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] OS) does not have control over the [[system console|console]], it accesses a part of system RAM instead of the actual text buffer.

For computers in the 1980s, very fast manipulation <!-- there were some difficulties when same memory was accessed simultaneously by CPU and character generator, but I can’t remember details --> of the text buffer, with the hardware generating the individual pixels as fast as they could be displayed, was extremely useful for a fast UI. Even on relatively modern hardware, the [[computational overhead|overhead]] of text mode emulation via hardware [[All Points Addressable|APA]] (graphics) modes (in which the program generates individual pixels and stores them into the video buffer) may be noticeable.

== Modes and timings ==

=== Video signal ===
From the monitor's side, there is no difference in input signal in a text mode and an [[All Points Addressable|APA]] mode of the same size. A text mode signal may have the same [[video signal timing|timings]] as [[VESA]] standard modes. The same registers are used on adapter's side to set up these parameters in a text mode as in APA modes. The text mode output signal is essentially the same as in graphic modes, but its source is a text buffer and character generator, not a [[framebuffer]] as in APA.

=== PC common text modes ===
Depending on the graphics adapter used, a variety of text modes are available on [[IBM PC compatible]] computers. They are listed on the table below:<ref name=\"PC Mag\">{{cite book|last=Roschi|first=Winn L.|title=VGA Compatibles: Gaining on the New Standard|journal=PC Mag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeosrkjnlM8C&pg=PA177|date=16 February 1988|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|page=177|issn=0888-8507}}</ref>

VGA and compatible cards support MDA, CGA and EGA modes. All colored modes have the same design of text attributes. MDA modes have some specific features (see [[#MDA features|above]])&nbsp;— a text could be emphasized with bright, underline, reverse and blinking attributes.

The most common text mode used in DOS environments and initial Windows consoles is the default 80 columns by 25 rows, or 80×25, with 16 colors and 8×16 pixels large characters. VGA cards always have a built-in font of this size whereas other sizes may require downloading a differently sized font.<ref name=\"openbsd\">{{Cite web|url=https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/vga.4|date=1999-03-20|title=OpenBSD Programmer's Manual, vga|quote=16 different colors can be displayed at the same time. Characters are 8×16 pixels large, and a font consists of 256 characters. A built-in font of this size is always present on a VGA card.}}</ref> This mode was available on practically all [[IBM]] and compatible personal computers.

Two other VGA text modes, 80×40 and 80×50, exist but are less common. [[Windows NT 4.0]] displayed its system messages during the boot process in 80×50 text mode.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApzVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA223|author=Olga Kokoreva|title=Windows XP Registry: A Complete Guide to Customizing and Optimizing Windows XP|quote=On obvious difference between Windows 2000/XP and Windows NT 4.0 is the fact that all system messages that appear during the Windows NT 4.0 boot process are displayed in 80×50 text mode, while Windows 2000 and Windows XP display these messages in VGA mode.}}</ref>

Character sizes and graphical resolutions for the extended [[VESA BIOS Extensions|VESA]]-compatible [[Super VGA]] text modes are manufacturer's dependent. Some cards (e.g. [[S3 Graphics|S3]]) supported custom very large text modes, like 132×43 and 132×25.<ref name=\"S3 manual\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.aub.edu.lb/pub/os/drivers/VGA/S3VIRGE1/375/VC963-3D.TXT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413190535/https://web.aub.edu.lb/pub/os/drivers/VGA/S3VIRGE1/375/VC963-3D.TXT|archive-date=2020-04-13|author=S3 Graphics|title=VC963-3D (S3 ViRGE/DX) User Manual|quote=The S3 ViRGE supports 132×43 and 132×25 extended text modes for text applications. This also allows you to emulate terminals requiring 132 columns of text.}}</ref> Like as in graphic modes, graphic adapters of 2000s commonly are capable to set up an arbitrarily-sized text mode (in reasonable limits) instead of choosing its parameters from some list.

=== SVGATextMode ===
On [[Linux]] and DOS systems with so named SVGA cards, a program called SVGATextMode<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freshmeat.net/projects/svgatextmode|url-status=dead|archive-date=2001-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010203143900/http://freshmeat.net/projects/svgatextmode|title=Project details for SVGATextMode|date=2000-03-19|quote=SVGATextMode uses extra features on SVGA cards to enhance Linux textmodes. It allows setting of the pixel clock, H/V timings, font size, cursor size, etc, and lets you use your video card and monitor to their full potential in textmode.}}</ref> can be used to set up better looking text modes than EGA and VGA standard ones. This is particularly useful for [[Computer monitor#Screen size|large]] (≥&nbsp;17\") monitors, where the normal 80&times;25 VGA text mode's 720&times;400 pixel resolution is far lower than a typical graphics mode would be. SVGATextMode allows setting of the [[pixel clock]] and higher [[refresh rate]], larger font size, cursor size, etc., and allows a better use of the potential of a video card and monitor. In non-Windows systems, the use of SVGATextMode (or alternative options such as the [[Linux framebuffer]]) to obtain a sharp text is critical for [[LCD monitor]]s of [[1280×1024]] (or higher resolution) because none of so named standard text modes fits to this matrix size. SVGATextMode also allows a fine tuning of video signal timings.

Despite the name of this program, only a few of its supported modes conform to SVGA (i.e. VESA) standards.

== General restrictions ==
VGA text mode has some hardware-imposed limitations. Because these are too restrictive for modern (post 2000) applications, the hardware text mode on VGA compatible video adapters only has a limited use.

'''Stanisław Marian Waltoś''' (born 9 February 1932) is a Polish [[Jurisprudence|jurist]] and [[Academy#Academic personnel|academic]] specializing in [[criminal law]] and [[legal history]], [[professor]] of legal sciences, member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Polish Academy of Learning]], professor of the [[Jagiellonian University]], who was Head of the Criminal Proceedings Department at the Faculty of Law of the Jagiellonian University from 1974, as well as the director of the [[Collegium Maius, Kraków|Jagiellonian University Museum]] between 1977–2011.

In the 1990s he was an expert of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Government of Latvia|government of the Republic of Latvia]]. In 1987–1995 he was a member of the Commission for the Reform of Criminal Law in Poland. He participated in the work on Polish criminal codifications of 1997. He was the initiator of the introduction to the Polish criminal procedure of an anonymous witness and a [[turn state's evidence]]. In 2000–2002 he was a member of the Legislative Council by the [[Prime Minister of Poland]].

He authored about 400 academic papers and other works, including the regularly updated and re-issued academic textbook ''Criminal Trial: The System Outline'' (''Proces karny: zarys systemu''). Between 1985–2002 he was the editor-in-chief of the journals ''Archivum Iuridicum Cracoviense'' and ''Opuscula Muzealia'' (he became the editor-in-chief of the latter again in 2006). In 2006 he was chosen the chairman of the Scientific Council of the [[Ossolineum|Ossolineum National Institute]].

=== Academic work ===
After completing his studies, he was prescripted to work at the [[Prosecutor#Poland|District Prosecutor's Office]] in [[Kraków]], where he was employed successively as an assessor, referendary and sub-prosecutor.<ref name=\"kierownicy\" /> In 1956 he became an assistant in the Department of Criminal Procedure at the Jagiellonian University. He was offered a position at the university by Marian Cieślak, who read his critical article on the penal code draft modeled on the Stalinist code.<ref name=\"kierownicy\" />

In 1962 he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] upon the dissertation ''Functions and forms of the indictment in a criminal trial'', supervised by Marian Cieślak and subsequently awarded by the journal ''Państwo i Prawo''. Between 1962–1964 he was a counselor at the District Prosecutor's Office in Kraków. In 1964 he received a habilitation scholarship and resigned from the work at the prosecutor's office.

In 1968 he obtained [[habilitation]] upon the work ''A model of preparatory proceedings against a comparative law background''.<ref name=\"edukacja\">{{citejournal|title=Procedury trzeciego tysiąclecia.

He published as author, co-author or editor about four hundred [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|academic papers]],<ref name=\"kierownicy\" /> mainly in the field of criminal proceedings. These include the academic textbook ''Criminal Trial: The System Outline'' (''Proces karny: zarys systemu''), that has been resumed and updated several times. His research interests over the years have included: [[Procedural law|procedural rules]], organization of the prosecutor's office, preparatory proceedings model, [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] issues (including the institution of the [[turn state's evidence]] and incognito [[witness]]), the Anglo-Saxon principle of the [[fruit of the poisonous tree]], as well as various aspects of the course of the trial, such as [[Consensus decision-making|consensualism]], analysis of the rights of participants in the proceedings against the background of the constitutional standard, [[press laws]], special proceedings, issues of the validation of procedural acts, pragmatism and anti-pragmatism in criminal proceedings, procedural obstruction, i.e. abuse of law, excessive length of proceedings.<ref name=\"kierownicy\" />

He collaborated on publications including with Kazimierz Buchała, Marian Cieślak and Andrzej Marek. In September 2004, he was awarded the Kraków Book of the Month Award for the book ''Na tropach doktora Fausta i inne szkice '' (''On the Traces of Dr. Faust and Other Sketches'').

He promoted three hundred and seventy master's theses and seventeen doctoral dissertations. A number of his doctoral students subsequently became specialists in law and criminal proceedings, including: Barbara Nita-Światłowska, Andrzej Światłowski, Dobrosław Szumało-Kulczyk and Antoni Bojańczyk.

Before Hurtigruten opened, only [[Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab]] was willing to make the trip through the then poorly-charted waters; the voyage was especially difficult during the long, dark winters. Hurtigruten was a substantial breakthrough for communities along its path. Mail from central Norway to Hammerfest, which used to take three weeks in summer and five months in winter, could now be delivered in seven days.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Encouraged by Vesteraalens' early success, several other shipping companies obtained a concession to operate the route, extended to run between Bergen in the southwest and Kirkenes in the far northeast. A fleet of 11 ships visits each of the 34 ports daily, both northbound and southbound.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Until the 1940s most ports north of Trondheim could not be reached by road from Oslo, so the sea was the only means of access. Beginning in the 1960s, the role of Hurtigruten changed, in part because of the construction of a local airport network and road improvements. Operating subsidies were gradually phased out, and the operators put more emphasis on tourism. New, bigger and more luxurious ships were introduced in the 1980s, with attention given to hot tubs, bars, restaurants and other comforts. However, Hurtigruten still serves important passenger and cargo needs, and operates 365 days a year. The last two independent shipping companies, [[Ofotens og Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab]] (OVDS) and [[Troms Fylkes Dampskibsselskap]] (TFDS), merged on 1 March 2006 as the [[Hurtigruten Group]], a year later becoming Hurtigruten ASA. In 2015 Hurtigruten was delisted from the Oslo stock exchange after the company was acquired by the private equity group [[TDR Capital]].<ref>{{cite web|title=tdrcapital.com|url=http://www.tdrcapital.com/hurtigruten|website=tdrcapital.com|accessdate=February 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Bloomberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-26/cruise-operator-hurtigruten-said-to-attract-private-equity-firms|title=Cruise Operator Hurtigruten Said to Attract Private Equity Firms|last1=Syed|first1=Sara|last2=Porter|first2=Kiel|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> In addition to the voyages in Norway, the company operates expedition cruises to Greenland, Canada, South America, Iceland, Svalbard and Antarctica.

==New contracts==
The Ministry of Transport and Communications in Norway announced in 2017 that the Hurtigruten contract was split into three contracts. The contracts were put up for bid and in the end, two were granted to Hurtigruten AS and one to Havila Kystruten AS, with each operating seven and four ships respectively. The two companies will alternate departure days for the entire route from Bergen to Kirkenes.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newsinenglish.no/2018/03/23/hurtigruten-gets-new-coastal-rival/|title=Hurtigruten gets new coastal rival|website=www.newsinenglish.no|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>

Havila Kystruten AS is building four new vessels to serve the route, while Hurtigruten AS will be refitting seven of its vessels to meet the stricter emissions requirements.<ref name=\":0\" />

The four new vessels from Havila will run on LNG and battery power. LNG will cut CO₂ emissions by 25 per cent, and the battery power will yield additional savings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theexplorer.no/solutions/hybrid-cruiseliners-cut-coastal-emissions/|title=Hybrid cruiseliners cut coastal emissions|website=www.theexplorer.no|language=en|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> The vessels will be named Havila Capella, Havila Castor, Havila Polaris and Havila Pollux.

As part of its [[slow television]] series, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] transmitted non-stop the Hurtigruten ship {{MS|Nordnorge|1996|6}}'s 134-hour voyage from [[Bergen]] to [[Kirkenes]], which started on June 16, 2011.<ref name=\"NRK Beta\">{{cite web|last=Hofseth|first=Anders|title=Hurtigruten: 5 day TV marathon in the midnight sun|website=NRK|date=16 June 2011|url=https://nrkbeta.no/2011/06/16/hurtigruten-eng/}}</ref>

==Post-World War II accidents and incidents==
[[File:Memorial 1958 MS Earling Jarl.jpg|thumb|Memorial in [[Bodø]] commemorating the incident on board ''Erling Jarl'' in 1958. Total height: 2,3 meters. Sculptor: [[Istvan Lisztes]].]]

Before World War II, a number of ships perished, usually because they ran aground in bad visibility.

Most of the Hurtigruten fleet was sunk during World War II.

In September 1954 {{SS|Nordstjernen|1937|6}} ran aground in [[Raftsundet]] at night. The ship started taking on water and sank. Five persons died. There were 157 passengers and a crew of 46 on board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vol.no/nyheter/article409004.ece|author=Rydheim, Per|title=D/S Nordstjernen|website=Vol.no|date=28 November 2010|access-date=28 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurtigrutemuseet.no/nb/ulykkerogforlis|title=Ulykker og forlis|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Accidents and shipwrecks|website=Hurtigrutemuseet|access-date=28 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222195030/http://www.hurtigrutemuseet.no/nb/ulykkerogforlis|archivedate=22 February 2013}}</ref>

On January 8, 1958, a fire broke out on board MS ''Erling Jarl'' while the vessel was docked at [[Bodø]]. Due to the thick smoke 14 people died of smoke inhalation. Today a memorial to the incident stands at Bodø.<ref>{{cite web|title=History Erling Jarl (1949)|url=http://hurtigrutemuseet.no/nb/historien-erling-jarl-1949|website=The Virtual Museum of Hurtigruten|access-date=9 October 2016}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Elling Finnanger Snøfugl|title=Klart for minnesmerke|url=https://www.an.no/nyheter/klart-for-minnesmerke/s/1-33-4218481|website=Avisa nordland|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>

On October 21, 1962 MS ''Sanct Svithun'' ran onto a reef in the maritime area [[Folda, Nord-Trøndelag|Folda]] in [[Nord-Trøndelag]] because of a major navigational error after leaving [[Trondheim]].

'''Hurtigruten''' (\"Express Route\", formally The coastal route Bergen-Kirkenes) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] public coastal route transporting passengers that travel locally, regionally and between the ports of call, and also cargo between ports north of [[Tromsø]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/transport-and-communications/kollektivtransport/the-coastal-route-bergen-kirkenes/id2517170/|title=The coastal route Bergen-Kirkenes|last=Communications|first=Ministry of Transport and|date=2016-12-16|website=Government.no|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>

Hurtigruten provides daily, year-round and consistent traffic between [[Bergen]] and [[Kirkenes]] with 34 ports of call on northbound and 33 ports of call on southbound sailings. The Ministry of Transport and Communications in Norway has set minimum capacity requirements of 320 passengers, 120 berths and cargo for 150 Euro-pallets. The current agreement with the privately held company [[Hurtigruten AS]] entered into force on 1 January 2012 and expired on 31 December 2019, with an optional 1-year extension. From 2021 the two companies Hurtigruten AS and [[Havila Kystruten]] AS will operate the route.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/transport-og-kommunikasjon/kollektivtransport/kystruten/id2517170/|title=Kystruten Bergen-Kirkenes|last=Samferdselsdepartementet|date=2016-12-15|website=Regjeringen.no|language=no|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:DS Vesteraalen fra siden.jpg|thumb|{{SS|Vesteraalen|1890|2}} near [[Bodø]] on her first round-trip in 1893.]]

Hurtigruten was established in 1893{{Fix|text=under what name?}} by government contract to improve communications along Norway's long, jagged coastline. {{SS|Vesteraalen|1890|2}} began the first round-trip journey from Trondheim on 2 July 1893 bound for [[Hammerfest (town)|Hammerfest]], with calls at [[Rørvik]], [[Brønnøy]], [[Sandnessjøen]], [[Bodø]], [[Svolvær]], [[Lødingen]], [[Harstad]], [[Tromsø]] and [[Skjervøy]]. The ship arrived at Svolvær on Monday 3 July at 8pm after 35½ hours and at Hammerfest on Wednesday 5 July after 67 hours. She was commanded by Hurtigruten founder [[Richard With]]. As of 2008, the Trondheim–Svolvær trip took 33 hours and the Trondheim–Hammerfest trip took 41 hours 15 min.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Before Hurtigruten opened, only [[Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab]] was willing to make the trip through the then poorly-charted waters; the voyage was especially difficult during the long, dark winters. Hurtigruten was a substantial breakthrough for communities along its path. Mail from central Norway to Hammerfest, which used to take three weeks in summer and five months in winter, could now be delivered in seven days.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

[[File:MS Narvik in Svolvaer.jpg|thumb|left|The 1982-built [[MS Narvik (1982)|''Narvik'']] in [[Svolvær]]. The ship was sold in 2007.]]

Encouraged by Vesteraalens' early success, several other shipping companies obtained a concession to operate the route, extended to run between Bergen in the southwest and Kirkenes in the far northeast. A fleet of 11 ships visits each of the 34 ports daily, both northbound and southbound.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

New, bigger and more luxurious ships were introduced in the 1980s, with attention given to hot tubs, bars, restaurants and other comforts. However, Hurtigruten still serves important passenger and cargo needs, and operates 365 days a year. The last two independent shipping companies, [[Ofotens og Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab]] (OVDS) and [[Troms Fylkes Dampskibsselskap]] (TFDS), merged on 1 March 2006 as the [[Hurtigruten Group]], a year later becoming Hurtigruten ASA. In 2015 Hurtigruten was delisted from the Oslo stock exchange after the company was acquired by the private equity group [[TDR Capital]].<ref>{{cite web|title=tdrcapital.com|url=http://www.tdrcapital.com/hurtigruten|website=tdrcapital.com|accessdate=February 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Bloomberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-26/cruise-operator-hurtigruten-said-to-attract-private-equity-firms|title=Cruise Operator Hurtigruten Said to Attract Private Equity Firms|last1=Syed|first1=Sara|last2=Porter|first2=Kiel|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> In addition to the voyages in Norway, the company operates expedition cruises to Greenland, Canada, South America, Iceland, Svalbard and Antarctica.

==New contracts==
The Ministry of Transport and Communications in Norway announced in 2017 that the Hurtigruten contract was split into three contracts. The contracts were put up for bid and in the end, two were granted to Hurtigruten AS and one to Havila Kystruten AS, with each operating seven and four ships respectively. The two companies will alternate departure days for the entire route from Bergen to Kirkenes.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newsinenglish.no/2018/03/23/hurtigruten-gets-new-coastal-rival/|title=Hurtigruten gets new coastal rival|website=www.newsinenglish.no|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>

Havila Kystruten AS is building four new vessels to serve the route, while Hurtigruten AS will be refitting seven of its vessels to meet the stricter emissions requirements.<ref name=\":0\" />

The four new vessels from Havila will run on LNG and battery power. LNG will cut CO₂ emissions by 25 per cent, and the battery power will yield additional savings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theexplorer.no/solutions/hybrid-cruiseliners-cut-coastal-emissions/|title=Hybrid cruiseliners cut coastal emissions|website=www.theexplorer.no|language=en|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> The vessels will be named Havila Capella, Havila Castor, Havila Polaris and Havila Pollux.

==Live television broadcast==

As part of its [[slow television]] series, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] transmitted non-stop the Hurtigruten ship {{MS|Nordnorge|1996|6}}'s 134-hour voyage from [[Bergen]] to [[Kirkenes]], which started on June 16, 2011.<ref name=\"NRK Beta\">{{cite web|last=Hofseth|first=Anders|title=Hurtigruten: 5 day TV marathon in the midnight sun|website=NRK|date=16 June 2011|url=https://nrkbeta.no/2011/06/16/hurtigruten-eng/}}</ref>

==Post-World War II accidents and incidents==
[[File:Memorial 1958 MS Earling Jarl.jpg|thumb|Memorial in [[Bodø]] commemorating the incident on board ''Erling Jarl'' in 1958. Total height: 2,3 meters. Sculptor: [[Istvan Lisztes]].]]

Before World War II, a number of ships perished, usually because they ran aground in bad visibility.

Most of the Hurtigruten fleet was sunk during World War II.

In September 1954 {{SS|Nordstjernen|1937|6}} ran aground in [[Raftsundet]] at night. The ship started taking on water and sank. Five persons died. There were 157 passengers and a crew of 46 on board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vol.no/nyheter/article409004.ece|author=Rydheim, Per|title=D/S Nordstjernen|website=Vol.no|date=28 November 2010|access-date=28 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurtigrutemuseet.no/nb/ulykkerogforlis|title=Ulykker og forlis|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Accidents and shipwrecks|website=Hurtigrutemuseet|access-date=28 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222195030/http://www.hurtigrutemuseet.no/nb/ulykkerogforlis|archivedate=22 February 2013}}</ref>

On January 8, 1958, a fire broke out on board MS ''Erling Jarl'' while the vessel was docked at [[Bodø]]. Due to the thick smoke 14 people died of smoke inhalation. Today a memorial to the incident stands at Bodø.<ref>{{cite web|title=History Erling Jarl (1949)|url=http://hurtigrutemuseet.no/nb/historien-erling-jarl-1949|website=The Virtual Museum of Hurtigruten|access-date=9 October 2016}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Elling Finnanger Snøfugl|title=Klart for minnesmerke|url=https://www.an.no/nyheter/klart-for-minnesmerke/s/1-33-4218481|website=Avisa nordland|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>

On October 21, 1962 MS ''Sanct Svithun'' ran onto a reef in the maritime area [[Folda, Nord-Trøndelag|Folda]] in [[Nord-Trøndelag]] because of a major navigational error after leaving [[Trondheim]].

The '''Football League Trophy 1995–96''', known as the '''Auto Windscreens Shield 1995–96''' for sponsorship reasons, was the 13th staging of the [[Football League Trophy]], a knock-out competition for [[English football]] clubs in the [[Football League Second Division|Second]] and [[Football League Third Division|Third]] Divisions (now known as [[Football League One|League One]] and [[Football League Two|Two]]).

The winners were [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], who defeated [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] 2–1 in the final.

The competition began on 25 September 1995 and ended with the final on 14 April 1996.

The tournament begins with clubs divided into a Northern and a Southern section, and teams entering a group stage. Each section then gradually eliminates the qualifying teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists face each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

The '''Football League Trophy 1995–96''', known as the '''Auto Windscreens Shield 1995–96''' for sponsorship reasons, was the 13th staging of the [[Football League Trophy]], a knock-out competition for [[English football]] clubs in the [[Football League Second Division|Second]] and [[Football League Third Division|Third]] Divisions (now known as [[Football League One|League One]] and [[Football League Two|Two]]).

The winners were [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], who defeated [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] 2–1 in the final.

The competition began on 25 September 1995 and ended with the final on 14 April 1996.

The tournament begins with clubs divided into a Northern and a Southern section, and teams entering a group stage. Each section then gradually eliminates the qualifying teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists face each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

[[File:Pubic hair - Triangle style.jpg|thumb|A woman's pubic area after a partial Brazilian wax]]

'''Bikini waxing''' is the removal of [[pubic hair]] using a special wax, which can be hot or cold, that adheres to hairs and pulls them out when the wax is removed quickly from the skin, usually with a cloth strip. While the practice is mainly associated with women, [[male waxing]] is sometimes done to remove men's pubic hair.<ref>{{citation|last=Barker|first=Olivia|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2005-08-23-waxing_x.htm|title=The male resistance to waxing is melting away|magazine=USA Today|date=August 23, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}</ref>

A '''bikini line''' is the area of the upper leg and inner thigh in which pubic hair grows that is normally not covered by the bottom part of a swimsuit.<ref name=\"Embod1\" /> In some cultures, visible pubic hair in this region is disliked and/or considered embarrassing and so it is sometimes removed.<ref name=\"Embod1\">{{citation|first1=Heinz|last1=Tschachler|first2=Maureen|last2=Devine|first3=Michael|last3=Draxlbauer|title=The EmBodyment of American Culture|pages=61–62|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=2003|isbn=978-3-8258-6762-1}}</ref> However, some people remove pubic hair that will not be exposed for reasons like aesthetics, personal grooming and hygiene, culture, religion or fashion.

== Technique ==
Pubic hair can be removed in a number of ways, such as [[waxing]], [[shaving]], [[Sugaring (epilation)|sugaring]], [[electrology|electrolysis]], [[laser hair removal]] or with [[chemical depilatory]] creams. Waxing involves applying melted, usually hot, wax to the pubic hair that an individual would like to remove. The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away. Waxing can be performed on oneself privately using a home kit or by a [[cosmetologist]] at a salon or spa.<ref name=Cosmo/>

The three major types are described below:

=== American waxing ===
''American waxing'' is the removal of only the pubic hair that is exposed by a swimsuit, depending on the style of the swimsuit. For a bikini, it would be hair at the top of the thighs and under the navel. It is also known as a \"basic bikini wax\",<ref name=milady /><ref name=essort /><ref name=BrBi /> \"triangle\", or \"bikini line\", as it involves waxing hair from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair cannot be seen while wearing a swimsuit.<ref name=landingstrip>{{cite web|last1=Grey|first1=Maggie|title=Basic Pubic Hairstyles|url=http://www.landingstrip.org/basic-pubic-hairstyles/|website=The Landing Strip|accessdate=June 13, 2014|date=2012-06-30}}</ref> Bikini bottoms or underwear are usually worn while getting an American wax. A normal American waxing job takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.<ref name=milady />

=== {{anchor|The Landing Strip}} French waxing ===
''French waxing'' (sometimes called a ''landing strip'' or a ''partial Brazilian wax'') leaves a vertical strip of pubic hair about {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|3|in|cm}} long just above the [[vulva]].<ref name=milady /><ref name=essort /><ref name=SalE /> Hair around the anus area and [[labia (genitalia)|labia]] may be removed. The landing strip wax has become popular with models who must wear garments of an extreme narrowness in the crotch region.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} To create the \"landing strip\" (a line of hair) practitioners and clients prefer either lying face up or lying face down. Sometimes hard wax is used, though strip wax works as effectively.<ref name=milady />

=== Brazilian waxing ===
''Brazilian waxing'' (or the ''sphinx wax''<ref name=\"weigle\">Weigle, Elizabeth Anne. The American trend of female pubic hair removal. Diss. uga, 2009.</ref>) is the removal of all pubic hair from the pelvic region, [[vulva]], [[labia]], [[perineum]],<ref name=salon>{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/1999/09/03/bikini/singleton/ | title = Faster Pussycat, Wax!

In [[Islam]], the removal of unwanted body hair is known as an act of ''[[fitrah]]''.{{cn|date=January 2020}} According to ethnologist F.

In relation to pubic hair, with the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the coming into fashion and popularity of the [[bikini]] since 1946, and the elimination of the skirt on swimsuits, the styling of pubic hair has also come into vogue.<ref name=Embod1 /> The practice to remove more pubic hair continued with the popularity or fashion of even briefer swimwear, such as the [[Thong (clothing)|thong]], which exposed the buttocks.

Changes in lingerie styles also encouraged the removal of pubic hair,<ref name=milady />{{Rp|page=139}} and the nude crotch{{nsmdns}}i.e., the total removal of pubic hair, such as in a full Brazilian or the Sphinx style{{nsmdns}}became considered by many to be [[erotic]] and [[Glamour (presentation)|glamorous]].

[[File:Pubic hair - Triangle style.jpg|thumb|A woman's pubic area after a partial Brazilian wax]]

'''Bikini waxing''' is the removal of [[pubic hair]] using a special wax, which can be hot or cold, that adheres to hairs and pulls them out when the wax is removed quickly from the skin, usually with a cloth strip. While the practice is mainly associated with women, [[male waxing]] is sometimes done to remove men's pubic hair.<ref>{{citation|last=Barker|first=Olivia|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2005-08-23-waxing_x.htm|title=The male resistance to waxing is melting away|magazine=USA Today|date=August 23, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}</ref>

A '''bikini line''' is the area of the upper leg and inner thigh in which pubic hair grows that is normally not covered by the bottom part of a swimsuit.<ref name=\"Embod1\" /> In some cultures, visible pubic hair in this region is disliked and/or considered embarrassing and so it is sometimes removed.<ref name=\"Embod1\">{{citation|first1=Heinz|last1=Tschachler|first2=Maureen|last2=Devine|first3=Michael|last3=Draxlbauer|title=The EmBodyment of American Culture|pages=61–62|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=2003|isbn=978-3-8258-6762-1}}</ref> However, some people remove pubic hair that will not be exposed for reasons like aesthetics, personal grooming and hygiene, culture, religion or fashion.

== Technique ==
Pubic hair can be removed in a number of ways, such as [[waxing]], [[shaving]], [[Sugaring (epilation)|sugaring]], [[electrology|electrolysis]], [[laser hair removal]] or with [[chemical depilatory]] creams. Waxing involves applying melted, usually hot, wax to the pubic hair that an individual would like to remove. The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away. Waxing can be performed on oneself privately using a home kit or by a [[cosmetologist]] at a salon or spa.<ref name=Cosmo/>

Some people modify their pubic hair either to fit in with societal trends or simply as an expression of their own style or lifestyle, while others object to any styling or do not practice it because of cost considerations.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|title=Pubic hair is back|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10452327/Pubic-hair-is-back-ladies.-The-men-dont-care-and-the-women-cant-be-bothered.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=2013-11-15|last1=Turner|first1=Beverley}}</ref><ref name=thedailybeast>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/10/waxing-damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don-t-how-pubic-hair-became-political.html|title=Waxing: Damned if You Do and Damned if You Don’t: How Pubic Hair Became Political|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|first=Emily|last=Shire|date=October 4, 2014}}</ref>

The three major types are described below:

=== American waxing ===
''American waxing'' is the removal of only the pubic hair that is exposed by a swimsuit, depending on the style of the swimsuit. For a bikini, it would be hair at the top of the thighs and under the navel. It is also known as a \"basic bikini wax\",<ref name=milady /><ref name=essort /><ref name=BrBi /> \"triangle\", or \"bikini line\", as it involves waxing hair from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair cannot be seen while wearing a swimsuit.<ref name=landingstrip>{{cite web|last1=Grey|first1=Maggie|title=Basic Pubic Hairstyles|url=http://www.landingstrip.org/basic-pubic-hairstyles/|website=The Landing Strip|accessdate=June 13, 2014|date=2012-06-30}}</ref> Bikini bottoms or underwear are usually worn while getting an American wax. A normal American waxing job takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.<ref name=milady />

=== {{anchor|The Landing Strip}} French waxing ===
''French waxing'' (sometimes called a ''landing strip'' or a ''partial Brazilian wax'') leaves a vertical strip of pubic hair about {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|3|in|cm}} long just above the [[vulva]].<ref name=milady /><ref name=essort /><ref name=SalE /> Hair around the anus area and [[labia (genitalia)|labia]] may be removed. The landing strip wax has become popular with models who must wear garments of an extreme narrowness in the crotch region.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} To create the \"landing strip\" (a line of hair) practitioners and clients prefer either lying face up or lying face down. Sometimes hard wax is used, though strip wax works as effectively.<ref name=milady />

=== Brazilian waxing ===
''Brazilian waxing'' (or the ''sphinx wax''<ref name=\"weigle\">Weigle, Elizabeth Anne. The American trend of female pubic hair removal. Diss. uga, 2009.</ref>) is the removal of all pubic hair from the pelvic region, [[vulva]], [[labia]], [[perineum]],<ref name=salon>{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/1999/09/03/bikini/singleton/ | title = Faster Pussycat, Wax!

In a 2016 [[JAMA (journal)|the Journal of the American Medical Association]] published a study in which it was found that out of 3,316 American women surveyed, 84% reported a history of lifetime pubic hair grooming, with 59% reporting that the primary motivations for grooming were for hygienic purposes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rowen TS|last2=Gaither TW|last3=Awad MA|last4=Osterberg E|last5=Shindel AW|last6=Breyer BN|date=October 2016|title=Pubic Hair Grooming Prevalence and Motivation Among Women in the United States|journal=JAMA Dermatology|volume=152|issue=10|pages=1106–1113|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.2154|issn=2168-6068|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt3km422pc/qt3km422pc.pdf?t=obzy7r|pmid=27367465}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/most-women-prefer-to-go-bare-citing-hygiene-and-baffling-doctors/|title=Most Women Prefer to Go Bare, Citing Hygiene (and Baffling Doctors)|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|work=New York Times|access-date=2016-06-30|date=2016-06-29}}</ref>

== Social attitudes ==
In [[Islam]], the removal of unwanted body hair is known as an act of ''[[fitrah]]''.{{cn|date=January 2020}} According to ethnologist F. Fawcett, writing in 1901, he had observed the removal of body hair, including pubic hair about the [[vulva]], as a custom of women from the [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] caste.<ref>{{cite book|author=F. Fawcett|title=Nâyars of Malabar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eF-pMrcqw5UC&pg=PA195|accessdate=June 23, 2011|year=2004|origyear=1901|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0171-0|page=195}}</ref> In [[Western world|Western]] societies, removal of female body hair (except for head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows) has traditionally been considered appropriate when it was visible.<ref name=Embod1 />

In relation to pubic hair, with the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the coming into fashion and popularity of the [[bikini]] since 1946, and the elimination of the skirt on swimsuits, the styling of pubic hair has also come into vogue.<ref name=Embod1 /> The practice to remove more pubic hair continued with the popularity or fashion of even briefer swimwear, such as the [[Thong (clothing)|thong]], which exposed the buttocks.

Changes in lingerie styles also encouraged the removal of pubic hair,<ref name=milady />{{Rp|page=139}} and the nude crotch{{nsmdns}}i.e., the total removal of pubic hair, such as in a full Brazilian or the Sphinx style{{nsmdns}}became considered by many to be [[erotic]] and [[Glamour (presentation)|glamorous]]. A nude crotch is considered by some to be more youthful looking.<ref name=Embod1 />{{Rp|59}} According to Tschachler, Devine and Draxlbauer, removal of all visible body hair has come to be seen as an important aspect of femininity.<ref name=Embod1 />{{Rp|60}}

[[File:Sunday-Times-Fast-Track-100-Logo.jpg|frame|right|Sunday Times Fast Track 100 logo]]

The '''Sunday Times Fast Track 100''' is a list published annually in December in partnership with [[The Sunday Times]] newspaper in the UK. It ranks Britain's fastest-growing privately-held companies by sales growth (% per annum) over the last three years. The list is produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research company, and has been sponsored by the [[Virgin Group]] since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>

== Limitations ==
The Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.

On the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].

== Entry criteria ==
For entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:

* Unquoted
* Registered in the UK
* Non-subsidiary, independent
* 10 or more employees
* Annualised sales of at least £250,000 in 2009/10
* Annualised sales of at least £5m in 2012/13
* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth
* Not a technology company

== Other Fast Track lists ==
Fast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:
* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales
* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies
* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales
* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits
* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales
* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies

The '''Sunday Times Fast Track 100''' is a list published annually in December in partnership with [[The Sunday Times]] newspaper in the UK. It ranks Britain's fastest-growing privately-held companies by sales growth (% per annum) over the last three years. The list is produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research company, and has been sponsored by the [[Virgin Group]] since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>

== Limitations ==
The Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.

On the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].

== Entry criteria ==
For entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:

* Unquoted
* Registered in the UK
* Non-subsidiary, independent
* 10 or more employees
* Annualised sales of at least £250,000 in 2009/10
* Annualised sales of at least £5m in 2012/13
* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth
* Not a technology company

== Other Fast Track lists ==
Fast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:
* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales
* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies
* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales
* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits
* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales
* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies

The agouti gene ([[Agouti-signaling protein|ASIP]]) is responsible for variations in color in many species. ''Agouti'' works with ''[[extension gene|extension]]'' to regulate the color of [[melanin]] which is produced in hairs. The agouti protein causes red to yellow pheomelanin to be produced, while the competing molecule [[Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone|α-MSH]] signals production of brown to black eumelanin. In wildtype mice, alternating cycles of agouti and α-MSH production cause [[agouti (coloration)|agouti coloration]]. Each hair has bands of yellow which grew during agouti production, and black which grew during α-MSH production. Wildtype mice also have light-colored bellies. The hairs there are a creamy color the whole length because the agouti protein was produced the whole time the hairs were growing.<ref name=Furumura1996>{{cite journal | title = The Interaction of Agouti Signal Protein and Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone to Regulate Melanin Formation in Mammals | last1 = Furumura | first1 = Minao | last2 = Sakai | first2 = Chie | last3 = Abdel-Malek | first3 = Zalfa | last4 = Barsh | first4 = Gregory | last5 = Hearing | first5 = Vincent | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0749.1996.tb00109.x | date = August 1996 | journal = Pigment Cell Research | volume = 9 | issue = 4}}</ref><ref name=OMIM-ASIP>{{OMIM|600201}}</ref>

In mice and other species, loss of function mutations generally cause a darker color, while gain of function mutations cause a yellower coat.<ref name=Fontanesi2010/>

==Mice==
[[File:Agouti_Mice.jpg|thumb|right|Both of these mice are viable yellow agouti a<sup>vy</sup>; however, the mouse on the right does not express it due to epigenetic methylation.]]
As of 1979, there were 17 known alleles of agouti in mice.<ref name=Silvers1979>{{cite web |url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/wksilvers/frames/frame2-1.shtml |title=The Agouti and Extension series of Alleles, Umbrous and Sable |access-date=2019-05-11 |last=Silvers |first=Willys K. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Springer Verlag |website=The Jackson Laboratory |date=1979}}<!-- What to do with a book published in 1979, posted on the web in 2003, and revised in 2008? --></ref>

*Lethal yellow ''A<sup>y</sup>'' causes yellow coloration and obesity. It is dominant to all other alleles in the series. When homozygous, it is lethal early in development.<ref name=Silvers1979/>
*Viable yellow ''A<sup>vy</sup>'' looks similar to lethal yellow and also causes obesity, but is not lethal when homozygous. Homozygous viable yellow mice can be variable in color from clear yellow through mottled black and yellow to a darker color similar to the agouti color.<ref name=Silvers1979/>
*Intermediate yellow ''a<sup>iy</sup>'' causes a mottled yellow coloration, which like viable yellow can sometimes resemble agouti.<ref name=Silvers1979/>
*Sienna yellow ''A<sup>sy</sup>'' heterozygotes are a dark yellow, while homozygotes are generally a clearer yellow.<ref name=Silvers1979/>
*White-bellied agouti ''A<sup>W</sup>'' mice have agouti coloration, with hairs that are black at the tips, then yellow, then black again, and white to tan bellies.<ref name=Silvers1979/>
*Agouti A looks like ''A<sup>W</sup>'' but the belly is dark like the back.<ref name=Silvers1979/>
*Black and tan ''a<sup>t</sup>'' causes a black back with a tan belly. ''A/a<sup>t</sup>'' heterozygotes look like ''A<sup>W</sup>'' mice.<ref name=Silvers1979/>
*Nonagouti ''a'' mice are almost completely black, with only a few yellow hairs around the ears and the genitals.<ref name=Silvers1979/>
*Extreme nonagouti ''a<sup>e</sup>'' mice are fully black, and is recessive to all other alleles in the series.<ref name=Silvers1979/>

This is not a complete list of mouse agouti alleles.

Lethal yellow and viable yellow cause [[obesity]], features of type II [[diabetes]], and a higher likelihood of tumors.<ref name=OMIM-ASIP/> In normal mice ''Agouti'' is only expressed in the skin during hair growth, but these dominant yellow mutations cause it to be expressed in other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] including [[liver]], [[muscle]], and [[adipose|fat]].<ref name=Klebig1995>{{cite journal | vauthors = Klebig ML, Wilkinson JE, Geisler JG, Woychik RP | title = Ectopic expression of the agouti gene in transgenic mice causes obesity, features of type II diabetes, and yellow fur | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 11 | pages = 4728–32 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7761391 | pmc = 41780 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.11.4728 | bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.4728K }}</ref>

The mouse agouti gene is found on chromosome 2.<ref name=OMIM-ASIP/>

==Dogs==
[[File:Bucuresti, Romania, acelasi dulau, frumos de Cotroceni.JPG|thumb|right|An agouti dog, also called wolf sable]]
In [[dog]]s, the agouti gene is associated with various coat colors and patterns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/tan.html|title=Dog Coat Colour Genetics|website=www.doggenetics.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>

The alleles at the A locus are related to the production of agouti-signaling protein (ASIP) and determine whether an animal expresses an [[agouti gene|agouti]] appearance and, by controlling the distribution of pigment in individual hairs, what type of agouti. There are four known alleles that occur at the A locus:
* ''A<sup>y</sup>'' = Fawn or sable (tan with black whiskers and varying amounts of black-tipped and/or all-black hairs dispersed throughout) - fawn typically referring to dogs with clearer tan and sable to those with more black shading
* ''a<sup>w</sup>'' = Wild-type agouti (each hair with 3-6 bands alternating black and tan) - also called wolf sable
* ''a<sup>t</sup>'' = Tan point (black with tan patches on the face and underside) - including saddle tan (tan with a black saddle or blanket) <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreger DL, Schmutz SM | title = A SINE insertion causes the black-and-tan and saddle tan phenotypes in domestic dogs | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = S11-8 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21846741 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/esr042 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid23519866\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreger DL, Parker HG, Ostrander EA, Schmutz SM | title = Identification of a mutation that is associated with the saddle tan and black-and-tan phenotypes in Basset Hounds and Pembroke Welsh Corgis | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 399–406 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23519866 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/est012 }}</ref>
* ''a'' = Recessive black (black, inhibition of phaeomelanin)
* ''a<sup>yt</sup>'' = Recombinant fawn (black with tan patches on the face and underside) has been identified in numerous Tibetan Spaniels and a Tibetan Mastiff. Its hierarchical position is not yet understood.

Most texts suggest that the dominance hierarchy for the A locus alleles appears to be as follows: ''A<sup>y</sup> > a<sup>w</sup> > a<sup>t</sup> > a''; however, research suggests the existence of pairwise dominance/recessiveness relationships in different families and not the existence of a single hierarchy in one family.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerns JA, Newton J, Berryere TG, Rubin EM, Cheng JF, Schmutz SM, Barsh GS | title = Characterization of the dog Agouti gene and a nonagoutimutation in German Shepherd Dogs | journal = Mammalian Genome | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 798–808 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15520882 | doi = 10.1007/s00335-004-2377-1 }}</ref>
* ''A<sup>y</sup>'' is incompletely dominant to ''a<sup>t</sup>'', so that heterozygous individuals have more black sabling, especially as puppies and ''A<sup>y</sup>a<sup>t</sup>'' can resemble the ''a<sup>w</sup>a<sup>w</sup>'' phenotype. Other genes also affect how much black is in the coat.
* ''a<sup>w</sup>'' is the only allele present in many Nordic spitzes, and is not present in most other breeds.
* ''a<sup>t</sup>'' includes tan point and saddle tan, both of which look tan point at birth. Modifier genes in saddle tan puppies cause a gradual reduction of the black area until the saddle tan pattern is achieved.
* ''a'' is only present in a handful of breeds. Most black dogs are black due to a K locus allele.

==Cats==
The dominant, wild-type ''A'' allows hairs to be banded with black and red (revealing the underlying [[Tabby cat|tabby]] pattern), while the recessive ''non-agouti'' or \"hypermelanistic\" allele, ''a'', causes black pigment production throughout the growth cycle of the hair.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eizirik E, Yuhki N, Johnson WE, Menotti-Raymond M, Hannah SS, O'Brien SJ | title = Molecular genetics and evolution of melanism in the cat family | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 448–53 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12620197 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00128-3 }}</ref> Thus, the non-agouti genotype (aa) masks or hides the tabby pattern, although sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern can be seen (called \"ghost striping\"), especially in kittens. The sex-linked orange coloration is [[epistatic]] over agouti, and prevents the production of black pigment.

===History===
The cause behind the various shades of bay, particularly the genetic factors responsible for wild bay and [[seal brown (horse)|seal brown]], have been contested for over 50 years. In 1951, zoologist [[Miguel Odriozola]] published \"A los colores del caballo\" in which he suggested four possible alleles for the \"A\" gene, ''A+'', ''A'', ''A<sup>t</sup>'', and ''a'', in order of most dominant to least.<ref name=Castle>{{cite journal | vauthors = Castle WE, Singleton WR | title = The palomino horse | journal = Genetics | volume = 46 | issue = 9 | pages = 1143–50 | date = September 1961 | pmid = 13877241 | pmc = 1210264 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/46/9/1143.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905062605/http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/46/9/1143.pdf | df =  | url-status=live | archive-date = 2008-09-05 }}</ref>

This was accepted until the 1990s, when a new theory became popular.<ref name=Kostelnik>{{cite web |url=http://www.horsecolor.com/basics/starting_point.htm |title=Starting Point |work=The Horse Colors Site | vauthors = Kostelnik B |year=2007 |access-date=2008-03-04| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080303102629/http://www.horsecolor.com/basics/starting_point.htm| archive-date= 3 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The new theory suggested that shades of bay were caused by many different genes, some which lightened the coat, some which darkened it. This theory also suggested that seal brown horses were black horses with a trait called ''pangare''. Pangaré is an ancestral trait also called \"mealy\", which outlines the soft or communicative parts of the horse in buff tan.

The combination of black and pangaré was dismissed as the cause of brown in 2001, when a French research team published ''Mutations in the agouti (ASIP), the extension (MC1R), and the brown (TYRP1) loci and their association to coat color phenotypes in horses (Equus caballus)''. This study used a DNA test to identify the recessive ''a'' allele on the Agouti locus, and found that none of the horses fitting the phenotype of seal brown were homozygous for the ''a'' allele.<ref name=\"Rieder_2001\"/>

Since 2001, the mechanisms of the variations within the \"bay\" category remain unclear. Ongoing research suggests that Odriozola's theories may have been correct,<ref name=Morgan>{{cite web |url=http://colormorgans.tripod.com/basecolors.htm |title=The Base Colors |work=Morgan Colors | first = Laura | last = Behning | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008-02-05 |access-date=2008-03-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517142810/http://colormorgans.tripod.com/basecolors.htm |archive-date=2008-05-17 |df= }}</ref> evidenced by a parallel condition in mice.

==Rabbits==
In rabbits, the wildtype is agouti with a light belly, and a recessive non-agouti allele causes a black coat. A third allele, possibly a mutation to a regulator or promoter region, is thought to cause black and tan color. The nonagouti allele is estimated to have first appeared before 1700.<ref name=Fontanesi2010>{{cite journal | title = Characterization of the rabbit agouti signaling protein (ASIP) gene: Transcripts and phylogenetic analyses and identification of the causative mutation of the nonagouti black coat colour | last1 = Fontanesi | first1 = Luca | last2 = Forestier | first2 = Lionel | last3 = Allain | first3 = Daniel | last4 = Scotti | first4 = Emilio | last5 = Beretti | first5 = Francesca | last6 = Deretz-Picoulet | first6 = Séverine | doi = 10.1016/j.ygeno.2009.11.003 | journal = Genomics | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 166–175 | date = March 2010}}</ref>

''Agouti'' is linked to the ''wideband'' gene, with about a 30% crossover rate.<ref name=Sawin1934>{{cite journal | title = LINKAGE OF \"WIDE-BAND\" AND \"AGOUTI\" GENES: The Agouti Gene and a Modifier Shown to Be Situated on the Same Chromosome in the Domesticated Rabbit |last1 = Sawin | first1 = Paul | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 25 | issue = 12 | year = 1934 | pages = 477–481 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a103864}}</ref>

Like white bellied agouti mice, rabbits with wildtype agouti produce transcripts with different untranslated 5' ends that have different dorsal and ventral expression. The 1A exon is only expressed in the belly region and may be responsible for the lighter color there.<ref name=Fontanesi2010/>

The agouti gene ([[Agouti-signaling protein|ASIP]]) is responsible for variations in color in many species. ''Agouti'' works with ''[[extension gene|extension]]'' to regulate the color of [[melanin]] which is produced in hairs. The agouti protein causes red to yellow pheomelanin to be produced, while the competing molecule [[Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone|α-MSH]] signals production of brown to black eumelanin. In wildtype mice, alternating cycles of agouti and α-MSH production cause [[agouti (coloration)|agouti coloration]]. Each hair has bands of yellow which grew during agouti production, and black which grew during α-MSH production. Wildtype mice also have light-colored bellies. The hairs there are a creamy color the whole length because the agouti protein was produced the whole time the hairs were growing. <ref name=Furumura1996>{{cite journal | title = The Interaction of Agouti Signal Protein and Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone to Regulate Melanin Formation in Mammals | last1 = Furumura | first1 = Minao | last2 = Sakai | first2 = Chie | last3 = Abdel-Malek | first3 = Zalfa | last4 = Barsh | first4 = Gregory | last5 = Hearing | first5 = Vincent | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0749.1996.tb00109.x | date = August 1996 | journal = Pigment Cell Research | volume = 9 | issue = 4}}</ref><ref name=OMIM-ASIP>{{OMIM|600201}}</ref>

==Dogs==
[[File:Bucuresti, Romania, acelasi dulau, frumos de Cotroceni.JPG|thumb|right|An agouti dog, also called wolf sable]]
In [[dog]]s, the agouti gene is associated with various coat colors and patterns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/tan.html|title=Dog Coat Colour Genetics|website=www.doggenetics.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>

The alleles at the A locus are related to the production of agouti-signaling protein (ASIP) and determine whether an animal expresses an [[agouti gene|agouti]] appearance and, by controlling the distribution of pigment in individual hairs, what type of agouti. There are four known alleles that occur at the A locus:
* ''A<sup>y</sup>'' = Fawn or sable (tan with black whiskers and varying amounts of black-tipped and/or all-black hairs dispersed throughout) - fawn typically referring to dogs with clearer tan and sable to those with more black shading
* ''a<sup>w</sup>'' = Wild-type agouti (each hair with 3-6 bands alternating black and tan) - also called wolf sable
* ''a<sup>t</sup>'' = Tan point (black with tan patches on the face and underside) - including saddle tan (tan with a black saddle or blanket) <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreger DL, Schmutz SM | title = A SINE insertion causes the black-and-tan and saddle tan phenotypes in domestic dogs | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = S11-8 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21846741 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/esr042 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid23519866\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreger DL, Parker HG, Ostrander EA, Schmutz SM | title = Identification of a mutation that is associated with the saddle tan and black-and-tan phenotypes in Basset Hounds and Pembroke Welsh Corgis | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 399–406 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23519866 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/est012 }}</ref>
* ''a'' = Recessive black (black, inhibition of phaeomelanin)
* ''a<sup>yt</sup>'' = Recombinant fawn (black with tan patches on the face and underside) has been identified in numerous Tibetan Spaniels and a Tibetan Mastiff. Its hierarchical position is not yet understood.

Most texts suggest that the dominance hierarchy for the A locus alleles appears to be as follows: ''A<sup>y</sup> > a<sup>w</sup> > a<sup>t</sup> > a''; however, research suggests the existence of pairwise dominance/recessiveness relationships in different families and not the existence of a single hierarchy in one family.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerns JA, Newton J, Berryere TG, Rubin EM, Cheng JF, Schmutz SM, Barsh GS | title = Characterization of the dog Agouti gene and a nonagoutimutation in German Shepherd Dogs | journal = Mammalian Genome | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 798–808 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15520882 | doi = 10.1007/s00335-004-2377-1 }}</ref>
* ''A<sup>y</sup>'' is incompletely dominant to ''a<sup>t</sup>'', so that heterozygous individuals have more black sabling, especially as puppies and ''A<sup>y</sup>a<sup>t</sup>'' can resemble the ''a<sup>w</sup>a<sup>w</sup>'' phenotype. Other genes also affect how much black is in the coat.
* ''a<sup>w</sup>'' is the only allele present in many Nordic spitzes, and is not present in most other breeds.
* ''a<sup>t</sup>'' includes tan point and saddle tan, both of which look tan point at birth. Modifier genes in saddle tan puppies cause a gradual reduction of the black area until the saddle tan pattern is achieved.
* ''a'' is only present in a handful of breeds. Most black dogs are black due to a K locus allele.

==Cats==
The dominant, wild-type ''A'' allows hairs to be banded with black and red (revealing the underlying [[Tabby cat|tabby]] pattern), while the recessive ''non-agouti'' or \"hypermelanistic\" allele, ''a'', causes black pigment production throughout the growth cycle of the hair.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eizirik E, Yuhki N, Johnson WE, Menotti-Raymond M, Hannah SS, O'Brien SJ | title = Molecular genetics and evolution of melanism in the cat family | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 448–53 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12620197 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00128-3 }}</ref> Thus, the non-agouti genotype (aa) masks or hides the tabby pattern, although sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern can be seen (called \"ghost striping\"), especially in kittens. The sex-linked orange coloration is [[epistatic]] over agouti, and prevents the production of black pigment.

===History===
The cause behind the various shades of bay, particularly the genetic factors responsible for wild bay and [[seal brown (horse)|seal brown]], have been contested for over 50 years. In 1951, zoologist [[Miguel Odriozola]] published \"A los colores del caballo\" in which he suggested four possible alleles for the \"A\" gene, ''A+'', ''A'', ''A<sup>t</sup>'', and ''a'', in order of most dominant to least.<ref name=Castle>{{cite journal | vauthors = Castle WE, Singleton WR | title = The palomino horse | journal = Genetics | volume = 46 | issue = 9 | pages = 1143–50 | date = September 1961 | pmid = 13877241 | pmc = 1210264 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/46/9/1143.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905062605/http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/46/9/1143.pdf | df =  | deadurl = no | archive-date = 2008-09-05 }}</ref>

This was accepted until the 1990s, when a new theory became popular.<ref name=Kostelnik>{{cite web |url=http://www.horsecolor.com/basics/starting_point.htm |title=Starting Point |work=The Horse Colors Site | vauthors = Kostelnik B |year=2007 |access-date=2008-03-04| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080303102629/http://www.horsecolor.com/basics/starting_point.htm| archive-date= 3 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The new theory suggested that shades of bay were caused by many different genes, some which lightened the coat, some which darkened it. This theory also suggested that seal brown horses were black horses with a trait called ''pangare''. Pangaré is an ancestral trait also called \"mealy\", which outlines the soft or communicative parts of the horse in buff tan.

The combination of black and pangaré was dismissed as the cause of brown in 2001, when a French research team published ''Mutations in the agouti (ASIP), the extension (MC1R), and the brown (TYRP1) loci and their association to coat color phenotypes in horses (Equus caballus)''. This study used a DNA test to identify the recessive ''a'' allele on the Agouti locus, and found that none of the horses fitting the phenotype of seal brown were homozygous for the ''a'' allele.<ref name=\"Rieder_2001\"/>

Since 2001, the mechanisms of the variations within the \"bay\" category remain unclear. Ongoing research suggests that Odriozola's theories may have been correct,<ref name=Morgan>{{cite web |url=http://colormorgans.tripod.com/basecolors.htm |title=The Base Colors |work=Morgan Colors | first = Laura | last = Behning | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008-02-05 |access-date=2008-03-04 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517142810/http://colormorgans.tripod.com/basecolors.htm |archive-date=2008-05-17 |df= }}</ref> evidenced by a parallel condition in mice.

==Rabbits==
In rabbits, the wildtype is agouti with a light belly, and a recessive non-agouti allele causes a black coat. A third allele, possibly a mutation to a regulator or promoter region, is thought to cause black and tan color. The nonagouti allele is estimated to have first appeared before 1700.<ref name=Fontanesi2010>{{cite journal | title = Characterization of the rabbit agouti signaling protein (ASIP) gene: Transcripts and phylogenetic analyses and identification of the causative mutation of the nonagouti black coat colour | last1 = Fontanesi | first1 = Luca | last2 = Forestier | first2 = Lionel | last3 = Allain | first3 = Daniel | last4 = Scotti | first4 = Emilio | last5 = Beretti | first5 = Francesca | last6 = Deretz-Picoulet | first6 = Séverine | doi = 10.1016/j.ygeno.2009.11.003 | journal = Genomics | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 166-175 | date = March 2010}}</ref>

''Agouti'' is linked to the ''wideband'' gene, with about a 30% crossover rate.<ref name=Sawin1934>{{cite journal | title = LINKAGE OF “WIDE-BAND” AND “AGOUTI” GENES: The Agouti Gene and a Modifier Shown to Be Situated on the Same Chromosome in the Domesticated Rabbit |last1 = Sawin | first1 = Paul | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 25 | issue = 12 | year = 1934 | pages = 477-481 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a103864}}</ref>

Like white bellied agouti mice, rabbits with wildtype agouti produce transcripts with different untranslated 5' ends that have different dorsal and ventral expression. The 1A exon is only expressed in the belly region and may be responsible for the lighter color there.<ref name=Fontanesi2010/>

'''Spanish Fork''' is a city in [[Utah County, Utah|Utah County]], [[Utah]], United States.<ref name=gnis/> It is part of the [[Provo, Utah|Provo]]&ndash;[[Orem, Utah|Orem]] [[Provo–Orem metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 39,961 as of a 2018 estimate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/spanishforkcityutah/POP010210#viewtop|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Spanish Fork city, Utah|website=Census Bureau QuickFacts|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> Spanish Fork, Utah is the 20th largest city in Utah based on official 2017 estimates from the US Census Bureau.<ref>http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/spanish-fork-ut-population/</ref>

Spanish Fork lies in the [[Utah Valley]], with the [[Wasatch Range]] to the east and [[Utah Lake]] to the northwest. [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] passes the northwest side of the city. [[Payson, Utah|Payson]] is approximately six miles to the southwest, [[Springville, Utah|Springville]] lies about four miles to the northeast, and [[Salem, Utah|Salem]] is approximately 4.5 miles to the south.<ref>''Utah Atlas & Gazetteer,'' DeLorme,  9th ed., 2014, p.25 {{isbn|9780899332550}}</ref><ref>https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-salem-ut-to-spanish-fork-ut</ref>

==History==
Spanish Fork was settled in 1851 by members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] as part of the [[Mormon Pioneers|Mormon Pioneers']] settlement of [[Utah Territory]]. Its name derives from a visit to the area by two [[Franciscan]] friars from [[Spain]], [[Silvestre Vélez de Escalante]] and [[Francisco Atanasio Domínguez]] in 1776, who followed the stream down Spanish Fork canyon with the objective of opening a new trail from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], to the [[Spanish missions in California]], along a route later followed by fur trappers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} They described the area inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as having \"spreading meadows, where there is sufficient irrigable land for two good settlements. Over and above these finest of advantages, it has plenty of firewood and timber in the adjacent sierra which surrounds its many sheltered spots, waters, and pasturages, for raising cattle and sheep and horses.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1851, some settlers led by William Pace set up scattered farms in the Spanish Fork bottom lands and called the area the Upper Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\">Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 823</ref> However, a larger group congregated at what became known as the Lower Settlement just over a mile northwest of the present center of Spanish Fork along the [[Spanish Fork River]]. In December 1851, [[Stephen Markham]], who was severely wounded outside [[Carthage Jail]] in [[Carthage, Illinois]] while attempting to defend [[Joseph Smith]] and other church leaders from a mob in 1844, became the [[branch president|president]] of the first church congregation (branch) at the Lower Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\"/>

In 1852, Latter-day Saints founded a settlement called [[Palmyra, Utah|Palmyra]] west of the historic center of Spanish Fork. [[George A. Smith]] supervised the laying out of a townsite, including a temple square in that year.<ref>Jenson, Andrew. ''Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1941) p. 631-632</ref> A fort and a school were built at the Palmyra site in 1852.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 824\">Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 824</ref> With the onset of the [[Walkara|Walker War]] in 1853, most of the farmers in the region who were not yet in the Palmyra fort moved in.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 631\">Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 631</ref> Some of the people did not like this site and so moved to a different site at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon, where they built a structure they called \"Fort St. Luke\".<ref>Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 256-257</ref> Also in 1854 there was a fort founded approximately {{convert|2|mi}} south of the center of Spanish Fork that later was known as the \"Old Fort\".<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\"/>

Between 1855 and 1860, the arrival of pioneers from [[Iceland]] made Spanish Fork the first permanent Icelandic settlement in the United States.<ref>Thorstina Jackson, \"Icelandic Communities in America: Cultural Backgrounds and Early Settlements,\" 681.</ref> The city also lent its name to the 1865 Treaty of Spanish Fork, where the [[Ute people|Utes]] were forced by an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to relocate to the [[Uintah Basin]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==Events==
[[File:Festival of Colors at the Krishna Temple near Spanish Fork, Utah 2012.jpg|thumb|Festival of Colors at the Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork]]Spanish Fork City hosts five large-scale events each year: Fiesta Days, Icelandic Days, the Harvest Moon Hurrah, the Festival of Lights, and the Festival of Colors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===Icelandic Days===
The Icelandic Association of Utah was founded in 1897 and hosts Iceland Days every year. The association picked June because [[Icelandic Independence Day]], or National Day, is June 17.

Spanish Fork was the first Icelandic settlement in the United States, after Icelanders who joined the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ]] were expelled from that country, according to association spokesman Glenn Grossman.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Although other nationalities helped found the town, under colonizer [[Brigham Young]], Icelanders kept their identity and celebrate it with their culture every year during the three-day event.

===Harvest Moon Hurrah===
The Harvest Moon Hurrah is sponsored by the Spanish Fork Arts Council and takes place on a Saturday in September closest to the date of the full moon. Activities include children's crafts and activities, a giant paint-it-yourself mural, storyteller, old-fashioned family photos, caricature artist, clown and balloon animals, hay rides with live bluegrass band, and live entertainment. The 2009 Hurrah was headlined by [[Peter Breinholt]], a local musician.<ref name=\"hurrah\">[http://www.spanishfork.org/dept/parkrec/arts/hurrah.php Harvest Moon Hurrah]</ref>{{Dead link|date=April 2019}}

===Fiesta Days===
Each year Spanish Fork hosts the \"Fiesta Days\". The event is held every July, and is centered around the Pioneer Day Celebration. There are a number of entertainment events, including a rodeo, craft fair, parade, duck race, and a fireworks show on the 24th.

===Festival of Colors===
The [[Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple (Spanish Fork)|Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple]] (erected by Christopher Warden, an [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] follower<ref>http://www.utahkrishnas.org/utah-krishna-pioneers-2/</ref>)  celebrates [[Holi]] and is known for the  ''Festival of Colors'' where thousands of people gather from all over the country.<ref>http://www.utahkrishnas.org/festival-colors/</ref>

The population was 39,961 as of a 2018 estimate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/spanishforkcityutah/POP010210#viewtop|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Spanish Fork city, Utah|website=Census Bureau QuickFacts|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> Spanish Fork, Utah is the 20th largest city in Utah based on official 2017 estimates from the US Census Bureau.<ref>http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/spanish-fork-ut-population/</ref>

Spanish Fork lies in the [[Utah Valley]], with the [[Wasatch Range]] to the east and [[Utah Lake]] to the northwest. [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] passes the northwest side of the city. [[Payson, Utah|Payson]] is approximately six miles to the southwest, [[Springville, Utah|Springville]] lies about four miles to the northeast, and [[Salem, Utah|Salem]] is approximately 4.5 miles to the south.<ref>''Utah Atlas & Gazetteer,'' DeLorme,  9th ed., 2014, p.25 {{isbn|9780899332550}}</ref><ref>https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-salem-ut-to-spanish-fork-ut</ref>

==History==
Spanish Fork was settled in 1851 by members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] as part of the [[Mormon Pioneers|Mormon Pioneers']] settlement of [[Utah Territory]]. Its name derives from a visit to the area by two [[Franciscan]] friars from [[Spain]], [[Silvestre Vélez de Escalante]] and [[Francisco Atanasio Domínguez]] in 1776, who followed the stream down Spanish Fork canyon with the objective of opening a new trail from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], to the [[Spanish missions in California]], along a route later followed by fur trappers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} They described the area inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as having \"spreading meadows, where there is sufficient irrigable land for two good settlements. Over and above these finest of advantages, it has plenty of firewood and timber in the adjacent sierra which surrounds its many sheltered spots, waters, and pasturages, for raising cattle and sheep and horses.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1851, some settlers led by William Pace set up scattered farms in the Spanish Fork bottom lands and called the area the Upper Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\">Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 823</ref> However, a larger group congregated at what became known as the Lower Settlement just over a mile northwest of the present center of Spanish Fork along the [[Spanish Fork River]]. In December 1851, [[Stephen Markham]], who was severely wounded outside [[Carthage Jail]] in [[Carthage, Illinois]] while attempting to defend [[Joseph Smith]] and other church leaders from a mob in 1844, became the [[branch president|president]] of the first church congregation (branch) at the Lower Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\"/>

In 1852, Latter-day Saints founded a settlement called [[Palmyra, Utah|Palmyra]] west of the historic center of Spanish Fork. [[George A. Smith]] supervised the laying out of a townsite, including a temple square in that year.<ref>Jenson, Andrew. ''Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1941) p. 631-632</ref> A fort and a school were built at the Palmyra site in 1852.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 824\">Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 824</ref> With the onset of the [[Walkara|Walker War]] in 1853, most of the farmers in the region who were not yet in the Palmyra fort moved in.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 631\">Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 631</ref> Some of the people did not like this site and so moved to a different site at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon, where they built a structure they called \"Fort St. Luke\".<ref>Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 256-257</ref> Also in 1854 there was a fort founded approximately {{convert|2|mi}} south of the center of Spanish Fork that later was known as the \"Old Fort\".<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\"/>

Between 1855 and 1860, the arrival of pioneers from [[Iceland]] made Spanish Fork the first permanent Icelandic settlement in the United States.<ref>Thorstina Jackson, \"Icelandic Communities in America: Cultural Backgrounds and Early Settlements,\" 681.</ref> The city also lent its name to the 1865 Treaty of Spanish Fork, where the [[Ute people|Utes]] were forced by an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to relocate to the [[Uintah Basin]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==Events==
[[File:Festival of Colors at the Krishna Temple near Spanish Fork, Utah 2012.jpg|thumb|Festival of Colors at the Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork]]Spanish Fork City hosts five large-scale events each year: Fiesta Days, Icelandic Days, the Harvest Moon Hurrah, the Festival of Lights, and the Festival of Colors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===Icelandic Days===
The Icelandic Association of Utah was founded in 1897 and hosts Iceland Days every year. The association picked June because [[Icelandic Independence Day]], or National Day, is June 17.

Spanish Fork was the first Icelandic settlement in the United States, after Icelanders who joined the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ]] were expelled from that country, according to association spokesman Glenn Grossman.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Although other nationalities helped found the town, under colonizer [[Brigham Young]], Icelanders kept their identity and celebrate it with their culture every year during the three-day event.

===Harvest Moon Hurrah===
The Harvest Moon Hurrah is sponsored by the Spanish Fork Arts Council and takes place on a Saturday in September closest to the date of the full moon. Activities include children's crafts and activities, a giant paint-it-yourself mural, storyteller, old-fashioned family photos, caricature artist, clown and balloon animals, hay rides with live bluegrass band, and live entertainment. The 2009 Hurrah was headlined by [[Peter Breinholt]], a local musician.<ref name=\"hurrah\">[http://www.spanishfork.org/dept/parkrec/arts/hurrah.php Harvest Moon Hurrah]</ref>{{Dead link|date=April 2019}}

===Fiesta Days===
Each year Spanish Fork hosts the \"Fiesta Days\". The event is held every July, and is centered around the Pioneer Day Celebration. There are a number of entertainment events, including a rodeo, craft fair, parade, duck race, and a fireworks show on the 24th.

===Festival of Colors===
The [[Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple (Spanish Fork)|Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple]] (erected by Christopher Warden, an [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] follower<ref>http://www.utahkrishnas.org/utah-krishna-pioneers-2/</ref>)  celebrates [[Holi]] and is known for the  ''The Festival of Colors'' where thousands of people gather from all over the country.<ref>http://www.utahkrishnas.org/festival-colors/</ref>

'''New Tang Dynasty Television''' (NTD, {{zh|t=新唐人電視臺}}) is a television broadcaster, founded by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners, based in [[New York City]] with correspondents in over 70 cities worldwide. The station was founded in 2001 as a Chinese-language broadcaster,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108190438992282143 |title=Falun Gong Fields Media Weapons |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=14 April 2004}}</ref> but has since expanded its language offerings. The company retains a focus on China in its news broadcasts, and frequently covers topics that are censored in Mainland China. Its mission is to \"promote uncensored information on China; to restore and promote traditional Chinese culture; and to facilitate mutual understanding between the East and West\".<ref>https://ntdtv.org/en/aboutus.html</ref>

==History==
NTD was founded in 2001 by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners, with its mission being to offer \"uncensored news\" about China that [[state-controlled media]] would not cover. The station has a regular focus on the promotion of traditional [[Chinese culture]], and devotes extensive news coverage to alleged [[Chinese human rights issues]]. It takes a critical stance on what it considers to be abuses of power by the [[Communist Party of China]].<ref>[http://english.ntdtv.com NTD]</ref>

Since its founding, NTD has expanded to include English, Spanish, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], French, Russian, [[Persian language|Farsi]], [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] and several other language editions. Its content offerings include news and analysis, arts and culture, travel, entertainment news, health and lifestyle, and children's programming.<ref>[http://english.ntdtv.com NTD]</ref>

The station's critical reporting on the [[Communist Party of China]] has prompted censorship by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]. NTD also alleged that the Chinese government interfered with their reporting and business operations.

==Cultural outreach==

As part of its proclaimed mission to promote “appreciation and awareness of traditional Chinese culture,” NTD organizes and produces a variety of cultural outreach programs, including Chinese classical dance, martial arts, and culinary competitions. The station frames these activities within a context of reviving \"true Chinese cultural and moral traditions that have been lost under Communist Party rule\".

From 2004 to 2006, NTD produced and televised an annual ''Chinese New Year Spectacular'', a performance featuring [[classical Chinese dance]] and [[Chinese music|music]]. The show's performances contained ethnic and folk dances, dances depicting [[Chinese legends]] and moral tales, solo musical performances, and messaging and imagery sympathetic to Falun Gong, and included \"artistic representations of the persecution of practitioners\" in China. These shows have since been continued as traveling stage productions by a dedicated organization, [[Shen Yun Performing Arts]].

In 2008, the station began organizing a series of annual competitions open to ethnic Chinese participants in fields of classical Chinese dance, martial arts, traditional clothing design, painting, music, photography, and [[Chinese cooking]].<ref>NTD, [https://competitions.ntdtv.com/en/index.php  Global Competition Series].

==Censorship==
NTD's anti-Communist Party stance and reportage on human rights issues in China has led to interference and political pressure from the Chinese Communist Party and its overseas embassies.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chinese Regime Tries to Crush Cultural Show in Canada | publisher = The Epoch Times | date = 18 January 2007 | url = http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-1-18/50601.html | accessdate = 2007-06-13}}</ref> In turn, along with dissuading government officials from attending the New Year's show, the Chinese embassy in the United States accused NTD of being used to \"spread anti-China propaganda\" and \"distorting Chinese culture\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/gyzg/t397390.htm |title=Enjoy the Holidays and Stay away from the so-called \"Chinese New Year Gala\" of the New Tang Dynasty Television |work=[[Chinese Embassy in the United States of America]] |date=January 7, 2008}}</ref>

In January 2007, a theater in South Korea scheduled to host the New Year's performance cancelled their booking at the last minute, which NTD alleged was because China threatened actions against upcoming Korean shows in Mainland China.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chinese Regime Pressures Seoul to Cancel Cultural Show | publisher = The Epoch Times | date = 10 January 2007 | url = http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-1-10/50292.html | accessdate = 2007-06-13}}</ref> It has also been reported that [[NASDAQ]] broke ties with the station around this time after Chinese pressure.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chinese State Security Demanded NASDAQ Eject Network, Cable Says | date=24 January 2012 | url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/world/chinese-regime-demanded-nasdaq-eject-network-wikileaks-cable-says-181131.html | publisher=The Epoch Times}}</ref>

In June 2008, media watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] (\"RSF\") accused [[Eutelsat]] of closing down transmissions of NTD on June 16 through its [[Eutelsat 33B|W5]] satellite to appease the Chinese government,<ref name=\"rsf\">Reporters Without Borders: [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=27818 European satellite operator Eutelsat suppresses independent Chinese-language TV station NTD to satisfy Beijing], July 10, 2008, retrieved on 2009-01-19</ref> and appealed to Eutelsat CEO Giuliano Berretta to quickly reverse its decision to suspend NTD's use of Eutelsat. According to RSF, the NTD shutdown was a \"premeditated, politically motivated decision\". RSF stated that they were in possession of a recording of a purported conversation with a Beijing employee of Eutelsat confirming the allegations.<ref name=\"rsf\"/> Eutelsat claimed that the shutdown was due to a technical failure, denied the validity of the conversation,{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} and pointed out in July 2008 that NTD is still being broadcast from the Hot Bird positions.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2008/07/28/eutelsat-defends-ntdtv-position/|title = Eutelsat defends NTDTV position|date = July 28, 2008|accessdate = April 10, 2015|website = Broadband TV News|publisher = |last = Clover|first = Julian}}</ref>

On August 20, 2008, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] released a statement calling on Eutelsat to restore NTD and three radio stations including ''[[Sound of Hope]]''. The statement accused Eutelsat of bowing down to political pressure, and argued how the approaching Beijing Olympics could have resulted in the Chinese government's increasing pressure to censor the broadcasting of NTD.<ref name=\"ifj\">International Federation of Journalists: [http://europe.ifj.org/en/articles/ifj-calls-on-eutelsat-to-end-bar-on-chinese-ntdtv-broadcasts IFJ Calls on Eutelsat To End Bar on Chinese NTDTV Broadcasts], August 20, 2008, retrieved on 2009-01-19</ref>

The European Parliament also called on Eutelsat to reverse their decision to shut down NTD. Following this, Eutelsat issued a press release and written declaration, denying all charges of censorship against NTD. The company insists that NTD's shutdown resulted solely from the technical failure experienced by W5 satellite, and adds that NTD is being broadcast across Europe via Eutelsat's HOT BIRD video neighbourhood (which unlike W5, cannot be received from China).<ref name=\"eutelsatJan15\">[http://www.eutelsat.com/news/compress/en/2009/html/PR0309/PR0309.html Eutelsat reaffirms to European institutions the irreversible and purely technical nature of the incident resulting in the interruption of consumer broadcasting services through its W5 satellite], January 15, 2009, retrieved on 2009-01-19</ref>

In June 2010 the [[Canadian Prime Minister's Office]] cancelled a press conference that NTD and Epoch Times would have attended, so that Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]] would not come into contact with the broadcaster, allegedly following terms from the Chinese consulate. According to the ''Toronto Star'', such press conferences are usually standard procedure for foreign leaders visiting the Parliament, and the cancellation was seen as an extraordinary measure to keep NTD away from the Chinese President.<ref name=\"star\">Susan Delacourt, [https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/827903--harper-helps-hu-keep-critics-away \"Harper helps Hu keep critics away\"], Fri Jun 25, 2010</ref>

'''New Tang Dynasty Television''' (NTD, {{zh|t=新唐人電視臺}}) is a television broadcaster, founded by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners, based in [[New York City]] with correspondents in over 70 cities worldwide. The station was founded in 2001 as a Chinese-language broadcaster,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108190438992282143 |title=Falun Gong Fields Media Weapons |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=14 April 2004}}</ref> but has since expanded its language offerings. The company retains a focus on China in its news broadcasts, and frequently covers topics that are censored in Mainland China. Its mission is to \"promote uncensored information on China; to restore and promote traditional Chinese culture; and to facilitate mutual understanding between the East and West\".<ref>https://ntdtv.org/en/aboutus.html</ref>

==History==
NTD was founded in 2001 by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners, with its mission being to offer \"uncensored news\" about China that [[state-controlled media]] would not cover. The station has a regular focus on the promotion of traditional [[Chinese culture]], and devotes extensive news coverage to alleged [[Chinese human rights issues]]. It takes a critical stance on what it considers to be abuses of power by the [[Communist Party of China]].<ref>[http://english.ntdtv.com NTD]</ref>

Since its founding, NTD has expanded to include English, Spanish, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], French, Russian, [[Persian language|Farsi]], [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] and several other language editions. Its content offerings include news and analysis, arts and culture, travel, entertainment news, health and lifestyle, and children's programming.<ref>[http://english.ntdtv.com NTD]</ref>

The station's critical reporting on the [[Communist Party of China]] has prompted censorship by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]. NTD also alleged that the Chinese government interfered with their reporting and business operations.

NTD began broadcasting via satellite in North America in February 2002. At present, the station's satellite coverage reaches Asia, Europe, and Australia in several languages.

NTD, along with ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' and [[Sound of Hope]], was founded by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners who had emigrated to the West. Many of its staff are Falun Gong adherents who volunteer their time and services. In an interview with the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', president Zhong Lee stated that the company's original purpose was to speak out against the Chinese government's [[persecution of Falun Gong]], but that it \"can also play a big role pushing [[democracy in China]].\"<ref name=WSJ-11-15-2007>Chen, Kathy [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119508926438693540 Chinese Dissidents Take On Beijing Via Media Empire] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' November 15, 2007</ref> The station covers several issues that are taboo in Mainland China, such as official corruption and public health scares, and also provides a platform for Chinese human rights and pro-democracy activists.<ref name=WSJ-11-15-2007/>

==Cultural outreach==

As part of its proclaimed mission to promote “appreciation and awareness of traditional Chinese culture,” NTD organizes and produces a variety of cultural outreach programs, including Chinese classical dance, martial arts, and culinary competitions. The station frames these activities within a context of reviving \"true Chinese cultural and moral traditions that have been lost under Communist Party rule\".

From 2004 to 2006, NTD produced and televised an annual ''Chinese New Year Spectacular'', a performance featuring [[classical Chinese dance]] and [[Chinese music|music]]. The show's performances contained ethnic and folk dances, dances depicting [[Chinese legends]] and moral tales, solo musical performances, and messaging and imagery sympathetic to Falun Gong, and included \"artistic representations of the persecution of practitioners\" in China. These shows have since been continued as traveling stage productions by a dedicated organization, [[Shen Yun Performing Arts]].

In 2008, the station began organizing a series of annual competitions open to ethnic Chinese participants in fields of classical Chinese dance, martial arts, traditional clothing design, painting, music, photography, and [[Chinese cooking]].<ref>NTD, [https://competitions.ntdtv.com/en/index.php  Global Competition Series].

==Censorship==
NTD's anti-Communist Party stance and reportage on human rights issues in China has led to interference and political pressure from the Chinese Communist Party and its overseas embassies.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chinese Regime Tries to Crush Cultural Show in Canada | publisher = The Epoch Times | date = 18 January 2007 | url = http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-1-18/50601.html | accessdate = 2007-06-13}}</ref> In turn, along with dissuading government officials from attending the New Year's show, the Chinese embassy in the United States accused NTD of being used to \"spread anti-China propaganda\" and \"distorting Chinese culture\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/gyzg/t397390.htm |title=Enjoy the Holidays and Stay away from the so-called \"Chinese New Year Gala\" of the New Tang Dynasty Television |work=[[Chinese Embassy in the United States of America]] |date=January 7, 2008}}</ref>

In January 2007, a theater in South Korea scheduled to host the New Year's performance cancelled their booking at the last minute, which NTD alleged was because China threatened actions against upcoming Korean shows in Mainland China.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chinese Regime Pressures Seoul to Cancel Cultural Show | publisher = The Epoch Times | date = 10 January 2007 | url = http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-1-10/50292.html | accessdate = 2007-06-13}}</ref> It has also been reported that [[NASDAQ]] broke ties with the station around this time after Chinese pressure.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chinese State Security Demanded NASDAQ Eject Network, Cable Says | date=24 January 2012 | url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/world/chinese-regime-demanded-nasdaq-eject-network-wikileaks-cable-says-181131.html | publisher=The Epoch Times}}</ref>

In June 2008, media watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] (\"RSF\") accused [[Eutelsat]] of closing down transmissions of NTD on June 16 through its [[Eutelsat 33B|W5]] satellite to appease the Chinese government,<ref name=\"rsf\">Reporters Without Borders: [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=27818 European satellite operator Eutelsat suppresses independent Chinese-language TV station NTD to satisfy Beijing], July 10, 2008, retrieved on 2009-01-19</ref> and appealed to Eutelsat CEO Giuliano Berretta to quickly reverse its decision to suspend NTD's use of Eutelsat. According to RSF, the NTD shutdown was a \"premeditated, politically motivated decision\". RSF stated that they were in possession of a recording of a purported conversation with a Beijing employee of Eutelsat confirming the allegations.<ref name=\"rsf\"/> Eutelsat claimed that the shutdown was due to a technical failure, denied the validity of the conversation,{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} and pointed out in July 2008 that NTD is still being broadcast from the Hot Bird positions.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2008/07/28/eutelsat-defends-ntdtv-position/|title = Eutelsat defends NTDTV position|date = July 28, 2008|accessdate = April 10, 2015|website = Broadband TV News|publisher = |last = Clover|first = Julian}}</ref>

On August 20, 2008, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] released a statement calling on Eutelsat to restore NTD and three radio stations including ''[[Sound of Hope]]''. The statement accused Eutelsat of bowing down to political pressure, and argued how the approaching Beijing Olympics could have resulted in the Chinese government's increasing pressure to censor the broadcasting of NTD.<ref name=\"ifj\">International Federation of Journalists: [http://europe.ifj.org/en/articles/ifj-calls-on-eutelsat-to-end-bar-on-chinese-ntdtv-broadcasts IFJ Calls on Eutelsat To End Bar on Chinese NTDTV Broadcasts], August 20, 2008, retrieved on 2009-01-19</ref>

The European Parliament also called on Eutelsat to reverse their decision to shut down NTD. Following this, Eutelsat issued a press release and written declaration, denying all charges of censorship against NTD. The company insists that NTD's shutdown resulted solely from the technical failure experienced by W5 satellite, and adds that NTD is being broadcast across Europe via Eutelsat's HOT BIRD video neighbourhood (which unlike W5, cannot be received from China).<ref name=\"eutelsatJan15\">[http://www.eutelsat.com/news/compress/en/2009/html/PR0309/PR0309.html Eutelsat reaffirms to European institutions the irreversible and purely technical nature of the incident resulting in the interruption of consumer broadcasting services through its W5 satellite], January 15, 2009, retrieved on 2009-01-19</ref>

In June 2010 the [[Canadian Prime Minister's Office]] cancelled a press conference that NTD and Epoch Times would have attended, so that Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]] would not come into contact with the broadcaster, allegedly following terms from the Chinese consulate. According to the ''Toronto Star'', such press conferences are usually standard procedure for foreign leaders visiting the Parliament, and the cancellation was seen as an extraordinary measure to keep NTD away from the Chinese President.<ref name=\"star\">Susan Delacourt, [https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/827903--harper-helps-hu-keep-critics-away \"Harper helps Hu keep critics away\"], Fri Jun 25, 2010</ref>

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years ===
Pittsboro was established as a town in 1785. The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock's land. The town's trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], Pittsboro is named for his son, [[William Pitt the Younger]].

Pittsboro was once considered as a site for both the [[University of North Carolina]] and the state capital. The university was established in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], beginning in 1789. The state capital is [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], {{convert|34|mi}} east of Pittsboro.

As the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.

=== Slavery and racial segregation ===
The area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and [[emancipation]], whites used violence and other means to enforce [[white supremacy]] and suppress the freedmen's vote. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other supremacist groups were active in the county.<ref name=\"huber\" />

In 1885 Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of four African Americans]], including a woman, that earned statewide condemnation. They were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case.<ref name=\"huber\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522619 Patrick J.

Violence continued during the stress of economic hard times at the end of the century and into the early 20th century, when the state [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]]. This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] in Pittsboro was taken down.<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/chatham-county/article237568224.html Confederate monument at the center of protests in Chatham County taken down]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/pittsboro-confederate-statue.html Confederate Statue in North Carolina Comes Down After 112 Years]</ref>

=== Early industrialization ===
During the previous decade, textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.

=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===
[[image:pittsboro1.jpeg|Chatham County Courthouse|right]]
On March 25, 2010, the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] (pictured below), while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15&nbsp;p.m.; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45&nbsp;p.m. By 5 p.m., smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.

The building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7303536/|title=Fire severely damages Chatham County courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=25 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>

On March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30&nbsp;a.m., the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.

The fire marshal's investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a [[soldering]] torch that ignited wood near the [[soffit]]. Workers attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful. On March 31, 2010, the Chatham County Commissioners voted to rebuild the courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7335504/|title=Chatham commissioners vote to rebuild courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=31 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> It reopened on April 20, 2013.<ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/04/20/2839308/historic-chatham-county-courthouse.html</ref>

== City government ==
The mayor of Pittsboro is elected [[at-large]]. The current mayor is James W. Nass. The town's five members of the Board of Commissioners are also elected [[at-large]]. They are Pamela Baldwin, J.A. (Jay) Farrell, Kyle Shipp, John Bonitz, and Michael A. Fiocco. 

Pittsboro holds elections for the Mayor and three seats on the Board of Commissioners every four years in the off-year after each midterm election. Two Pittsboro Commissioners are elected in the off-year after each presidential election.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Town of Pittsboro |title=Board of Commissioners |url=https://pittsboronc.gov/?SEC=28C95D6E-76CF-4E35-95B0-32D54119759C |website=Pittsboro North Carolina |publisher=Town of Pittsboro |accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years ===
Pittsboro was established as a town in 1785. The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock's land. The town's trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], Pittsboro is named for his son, [[William Pitt the Younger]].

Pittsboro was once considered as a site for both the [[University of North Carolina]] and the state capital. The university was established in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], beginning in 1789. The state capital is [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], {{convert|34|mi}} east of Pittsboro.

As the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.

=== Slavery and racial segregation ===
The area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and [[emancipation]], whites used violence and other means to enforce [[white supremacy]] and suppress the freedmen's vote. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other supremacist groups were active in the county.<ref name=\"huber\" />

In 1885 Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of four African Americans]], including a woman, that earned statewide condemnation. They were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case.<ref name=\"huber\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522619 Patrick J.

Violence continued during the stress of economic hard times at the end of the century and into the early 20th century, when the state [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]]. This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] in Pittsboro was taken down.<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/chatham-county/article237568224.html Confederate monument at the center of protests in Chatham County taken down]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/pittsboro-confederate-statue.html Confederate Statue in North Carolina Comes Down After 112 Years]</ref>

=== Early industrialization ===
During the previous decade, textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.

=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===
[[image:pittsboro1.jpeg|Chatham County Courthouse|right]]
On March 25, 2010, the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] (pictured below), while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15&nbsp;p.m.; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45&nbsp;p.m. By 5 p.m., smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.

The building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7303536/|title=Fire severely damages Chatham County courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=25 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>

On March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30&nbsp;a.m., the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.

The fire marshal's investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a [[soldering]] torch that ignited wood near the [[soffit]]. Workers attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful. On March 31, 2010, the Chatham County Commissioners voted to rebuild the courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7335504/|title=Chatham commissioners vote to rebuild courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=31 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> It reopened on April 20, 2013.<ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/04/20/2839308/historic-chatham-county-courthouse.html</ref>

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years ===
Pittsboro was established as a town in 1785. The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock's land. The town's trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], Pittsboro is named for his son, [[William Pitt the Younger]].

Pittsboro was once considered as a site for both the [[University of North Carolina]] and the state capital. The university was established in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], beginning in 1789. The state capital is [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], {{convert|34|mi}} east of Pittsboro.

As the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.

=== Slavery and racial segregation ===
The area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and [[emancipation]], whites used violence and other means to enforce [[white supremacy]] and suppress the freedmen's vote. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other supremacist groups were active in the county.<ref name=\"huber\" />

In 1885 Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of four African Americans]], including a woman, that earned statewide condemnation. They were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case.<ref name=\"huber\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522619 Patrick J. Huber, \"Caught Up in the Violent Whirlwind of Lynching\": The 1885 Quadruple Lynching in Chatham County, North Carolina], ''The North Carolina Historical Review'', Vol. 75, No. 2 (APRIL 1998), pp. 135-160; via JSTOR; accessed 09 June 2018</ref> Harriet Finch was one of four black women to be lynched in the state.<ref name=\"baker\">[https://www.ncpedia.org/lynching Bruce E.

Violence continued during the stress of economic hard times at the end of the century and into the early 20th century, when the state [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]]. This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] in Pittsboro was taken down.<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/chatham-county/article237568224.html Confederate monument at the center of protests in Chatham County taken down]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/pittsboro-confederate-statue.html Confederate Statue in North Carolina Comes Down After 112 Years]</ref>

=== Early industrialization ===
During the previous decade, textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.

=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===
[[image:pittsboro1.jpeg|Chatham County Courthouse|right]]
On March 25, 2010, the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] (pictured below), while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15&nbsp;p.m.; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45&nbsp;p.m. By 5 p.m., smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.

The building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7303536/|title=Fire severely damages Chatham County courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=25 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>

On March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30&nbsp;a.m., the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.

The fire marshal's investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a [[soldering]] torch that ignited wood near the [[soffit]]. Workers attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful. On March 31, 2010, the Chatham County Commissioners voted to rebuild the courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7335504/|title=Chatham commissioners vote to rebuild courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=31 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> It reopened on April 20, 2013.<ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/04/20/2839308/historic-chatham-county-courthouse.html</ref>

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years ===
Pittsboro was established as a town in 1785. The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock's land. The town's trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], Pittsboro is named for his son, [[William Pitt the Younger]].

Pittsboro was once considered as a site for both the [[University of North Carolina]] and the state capital. The university was established in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], beginning in 1789. The state capital is [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], {{convert|34|mi}} east of Pittsboro.

As the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.

=== Slavery and racial segregation ===
The area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and [[emancipation]], whites used violence and other means to enforce [[white supremacy]] and suppress the freedmen's vote. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other supremacist groups were active in the county.<ref name=\"huber\" />

In 1885 Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of four African Americans]], including a woman, that earned statewide condemnation. They were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case.<ref name=\"huber\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522619 Patrick J.

Violence continued during the stress of economic hard times at the end of the century and into the early 20th century, when the state [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]]. This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] in Pittsboro was taken down.<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/chatham-county/article237568224.html Confederate monument at the center of protests in Chatham County taken down]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/pittsboro-confederate-statue.html Confederate Statue in North Carolina Comes Down After 112 Years]</ref>

=== Early industrialization ===
During the previous decade, textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.

=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===
[[image:pittsboro1.jpeg|Chatham County Courthouse|right]]
On March 25, 2010, the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] (pictured below), while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15&nbsp;p.m.; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45&nbsp;p.m. By 5 p.m., smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.

The building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7303536/|title=Fire severely damages Chatham County courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=25 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>

On March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30&nbsp;a.m., the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.

The fire marshal's investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a [[soldering]] torch that ignited wood near the [[soffit]]. Workers attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful. On March 31, 2010, the Chatham County Commissioners voted to rebuild the courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7335504/|title=Chatham commissioners vote to rebuild courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=31 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> It reopened on April 20, 2013.<ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/04/20/2839308/historic-chatham-county-courthouse.html</ref>

The [[per capita income]] for the town was $16,863. About 19.2 percent of families and 18.3 percent of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 24.3 percent of those under age 18 and 13.7 percent of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
Once home to [[textile]]s, the largest clothing label mill in the world, and [[poultry]], the town now depends on commuter income, retail stores and a developing business in [[genetics]]. Housing developments provide relief from loss of industry as the town adjusts to a new economy.

The water supply is abundant, derived from the [[Haw River]]. In the future, Jordan Lake will provide much of the water supply. In 2010, the wastewater allotment was expanded. The town is {{convert|15|mi}} and {{convert|25|mi}} from major power plants. Major corridor highways, US 15-501 and US 64, a four-lane divided highway, intersect there.

Pittsboro is home to the Chatham County Government, the Chatham County Justice Center, and many non-profit agencies and other social service organizations. Pittsboro is also a Certified Retirement Community.

* [[John Hicks|John R. Hicks]]
* Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1939, 1946, 2nd ed.

'''Description:''' See '''Importance'''.

'''Importance:''' The book ''built'' on [[ordinal utility]]  and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the [[substitution effect]] and the [[income effect]] for an individual in [[Consumer theory|demand theory]] in the 2-good case. It generalized analysis to the case of one good and all other goods, that is, the ''[[composite good]]''. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the [[aggregation problem]], most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced [[general equilibrium theory]] to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.

==[[Macroeconomics]]==
Among the most important list of publication in macroeconomics are:

===''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''===
* [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', 1936

'''Description''': In this book, Keynes put forward a theory based upon the notion of [[aggregate demand]] to explain variations in the overall level of economic activity, such as were observed in the [[Great Depression]]. The total income in a society is defined by the sum of consumption and investment; and in a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment.

'''Importance:'''  Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence

===''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]''===
* [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]], ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', 1963

* [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]
* Princeton University Press, 1944

'''Description:''' The book by the [[mathematician]] [[John von Neumann]] and [[economist]] [[Oskar Morgenstern]]. It contained a mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy.

This is now a classic work, upon which modern-day [[game theory]] is based. Game theory has since been widely used to analyze real-world phenomena from [[arms race]]s to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. It is today established, both throughout the social sciences and in a wide range of other sciences.

'''Importance:''' Topic creator, Influence

==[[Mathematical economics]]==

===[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]===
* [[Paul A. Samuelson]]
* Harvard University Press (1947, Enlarged ed. 1983)

The book showed how operationally meaningful theorems can be described with a small number of analogous methods, thus providing \"a general theory of economic theories.\"  It moved mathematics out of the appendices (as in John R. Hicks's [[Value and Capital]]) and helped change how standard economic analysis across subjects could be done with the same mathematical methods.

===''[[Value and Capital]]''===
* [[John Hicks|John R. Hicks]]
* Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1939, 1946, 2nd ed.

'''Description:''' See '''Importance'''.

'''Importance:''' The book ''built'' on [[ordinal utility]]  and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the [[substitution effect]] and the [[income effect]] for an individual in [[Consumer theory|demand theory]] in the 2-good case. It generalized analysis to the case of one good and all other goods, that is, the ''[[composite good]]''. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the [[aggregation problem]], most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced [[general equilibrium theory]] to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.

==[[Macroeconomics]]==
Among the most important list of publication in macroeconomics are:

===''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''===
* [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', 1936

'''Description''': In this book, Keynes put forward a theory based upon the notion of [[aggregate demand]] to explain variations in the overall level of economic activity, such as were observed in the [[Great Depression]]. The total income in a society is defined by the sum of consumption and investment; and in a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment.

'''Importance:'''  Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence

===''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]''===
* [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]], ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', 1963

===[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]===
* [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]
* Princeton University Press, 1944

'''Description:''' The book by the [[mathematician]] [[John von Neumann]] and [[economist]] [[Oskar Morgenstern]]. It contained a mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy.

This is now a classic work, upon which modern-day [[game theory]] is based. Game theory has since been widely used to analyze real-world phenomena from [[arms race]]s to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. It is today established, both throughout the social sciences and in a wide range of other sciences.

'''Importance:''' Topic creator, Influence

==[[Mathematical economics]]==

===[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]===
* [[Paul A. Samuelson]]
* Harvard University Press (1947, Enlarged ed. 1983)

The book showed how operationally meaningful theorems can be described with a small number of analogous methods, thus providing \"a general theory of economic theories.\"  It moved mathematics out of the appendices (as in John R. Hicks's [[Value and Capital]]) and helped change how standard economic analysis across subjects could be done with the same mathematical methods.
