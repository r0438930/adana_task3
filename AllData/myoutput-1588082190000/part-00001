Continuity. Due to the long time required for structural adjustment, the IMF and the World Bank generally prefer to provide a series rather than a loan to ensure the periodicity and continuity of the structural adjustment plan.

Because of this, SAL has been welcomed by many developing countries and has played a role of positive for the improvement of economic conditions in these countries. \n\n'''Dispute on structural adjustment loans''' \n\nThey carry (often controversial) policy conditions, which have included: (see [[Washington Consensus]]).\n\n# [[Fiscal policy]] discipline;\n# Redirection of public spending from subsidies (\"especially indiscriminate subsidies\") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like [[primary education]], [[primary health care]] and infrastructure investment;\n# [[Tax reform]]s which broaden the [[tax base]] and lower marginal tax rates, while minimizing [[dead weight loss]] and [[market distortion]]s;\n# [[Interest rates]] that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;\n# Competitive [[exchange rates]]; [[devaluation]] of currency to stimulate exports;\n# Trade liberalization \u2013 liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any [[trade protection]] to be provided by low and relatively uniform tariffs; the conversion of [[import quotas]] to [[import tariffs]];\n# [[Liberalization]] of inward [[foreign direct investment]];\n# [[Privatization]] of state enterprises;\n# [[Deregulation]] \u2013 abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudent oversight of financial institutions;\n# Legal security for [[property rights]].\n\nStructural adjustment loans are very controversial. For criticisms, see [[structural adjustment]].\n\nTake '''South Korea after 1997''' as an example. Since the loan conditions have a huge influence on the economy of the recipient countries, there are many arguments about the loan conditions. When the Asian financial crisis occurred in 1997, South Korea accepted various loan conditions while accepting the largest financial assistance in the history of the International Monetary Fund. The United States and the International Monetary Fund evaluated South Korea as one of the successful cases of the IMF's structural adjustment. They believe that South Korea has been closer to the developed countries after the IMF's structural adjustment. However, others doubt whether South Korea is a successful case of IMF structural adjustment. In the process of South Korea and the International Monetary Fund reaching an agreement, the United States played a major role in it. The US government's structural adjustment to South Korea should be based on its own interests. <ref name=\":2\" />At present, South Korea's economic structure and financial market contain many problems, which leads to an increase in social problems in South Korea and the result of instability in South Korean society. Because the IMF is subject to the distribution of power and interests of major powers, it is difficult to implement actions with fair and objective criteria. The main reason is that the International Monetary Fund reflects the political issues of American financial hegemony and voting power to a certain extent. This has led to the request of the IMF for the aided country that may have been made while ignoring the actual situation of the aided country. It often overemphasizes market liberalization and financial market opening. In the long run, these loan conditions have brought bad results to the aided countries.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=degree&id=W2041930#|title=\u56fd\u9645\u8d27\u5e01\u57fa\u91d1\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8d37\u6b3e\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u53d7\u63f4\u56fd\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u6790\u2014\u2014\u4ee51997\u5e74\u4ee5\u540e\u7684\u97e9\u56fd\u4e3a\u4f8b|website=www.wanfangdata.com.cn|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nSome studies suggest that they have been \"weakly associated with growth and reform did seem to reduce inflation.\"<ref>Crisp, Brian; Kelly, Michael.
