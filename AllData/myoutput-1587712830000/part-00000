Mandakini \"Mukku\" Mishra ([[Sara Ali Khan]]) is the daughter of a Hindu priest who runs the hostel for pilgrims by the temple on behalf of the temple committee. She is engaged to the nephew of the head priest. He was meant to marry her older sister, but he dumped the sister and switched to her when she grew up to be prettier, and her father agreed. Out of rebellion, Mukku flirts with the local boys and convinces them to come to her house and propose in order to embarrass her father and fiance. However, Mansoor is different, as they both notice each other and then Mukku makes the first move and hires him as her regular porter as she goes from her family home to a neighbouring village to help at her uncle\u2019s shop. She talks and talks to him and flirts outrageously and finally gets enough of a reaction to know he feels the same way.  They are trapped in the rain together, share stories of their childhood, and then share a kiss. Her envious sister tells Mansoor that Mukku is just flirting with him as she has flirted with all the other boys. Mukku is unable to defend herself when he confronts her, but starts following him around everywhere, finally sitting in the rain outside his house. Her sister tries to cover for her, but she is found out and her family come for her, planning to throw out all the Muslims, which, not-so-coincidentally, will also open up space for the new luxury hotel they are planning.\n\nMukku is taken home by her family who move up her wedding. Nevertheless she keeps insisting that Mansoor will come for her. Mansoor comes, but is spotted and beaten brutally by Mukku's fiance. However, his friend pleas to save him and  carries an unconscious Mansoor back to his home. While the porter community prepares to leave the valley, Mansoor decides not to leave without Mukku.\n\nMukku is married and attempts to commit suicide, but is saved by her family; her now-husband taunts Mansoor with the news. Mansoor runs to Mukku and promises he will come back for her that night when she is recovered, so they can leave the valley together. Her husband plans to take his band of priests and kill Mansoor and drive out all the Muslims in Hindu deity [[Shiva]]\u2019s name. All of a sudden the rains and the floods begin. Mansoor sends his mother with the other porters into the mountains and runs towards Mukku. She and her family are trying to gather the guests of their hostel in a top floor, her husband and his mother arrive driven in by the storm and Mukku refuses to go to him. And then the floor crashes down and her sister and mother are swept away along with half the other people. Mukku and her father and a few others make their way to the temple, Mansoor finds them there just as the water sweeps down. He grabs her hand in the flood, and her father holds on to her and all three are saved. After the water goes down, they make their way to a house that is still standing and wave at an Indian army helicopter that is coming to save them. Mansoor sends up the woman and child who are with them first, then Mukku\u2019s father, then Mukku, and finally prepares to go himself. But there is only space for one more person and the father of the family has not gone yet, so Mansoor sacrifices himself and sends him instead. Three years later, Mukku is still seen living with her father and running the lodge, listening to Mansoor's favourite song on the radio which she dedicated to him as she smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sushant Singh Rajput]] as Mansoor Khan, a porter (pithoo) at Kedarnath, Mukku's love interest <ref>{{cite web | title=Kedarnath Trailer: Sara Ali Khan And Sushant Singh Rajput Fall In Love As Tragedy Strikes| url=https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/kedarnath-trailer-sara-ali-khan-and-sushant-singh-rajput-fall-in-love-as-tragedy-strikes-1946084| website = NDTV | accessdate = 12 November 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Sara Ali Khan]] as Mandakini \"Mukku\" Mishra, Mansoor's love interest, Brinda's younger sister <ref>{{cite web| title = Kedarnath trailer: Sara Ali Khan looks promising in this unique tale of love| url = https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/kedarnath-trailer-sara-ali-khan-sushant-singh-rajput-5442592/ | website = Indian Express | accessdate = 12 November 2018}}</ref><ref name= IndiaToday-Review/>\n* [[Nishant Dahiya]] as Kullu, Mukku's husband\n* [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] as Brijraj Mishra, Mukku's father \n* [[Alka Amin]] as Ameena Khan, Mansoor's mother \n* [[Sonali Sachdev]] as Lata Mishra, Mukku's mother \n* [[Pooja Gor]] as Brinda Mishra, Mukku's elder sister \n* [[Mir Sarwar]] as Bashir\n* [[Sunita Rajwar]] as Daddo\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Chief Priest\n* [[Faiz Khan]] as Hemchand\n* Sharad Vyas as Himalaya Tyagi\n* Priyadarshan as Tarang\n* Hitesh Bhardwaj as Helicopter Co-Pilot\n* Lalu Makhija as Uncle at party\n\n==Production==\nThe film's principal photography began on 5 September 2017.<ref name=DNA /> The first motion poster of the film released on August 19, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BX94-IihB0z/|title=Abhishek kapoor on Instagram: \"Every film is the beginning of a new journey, new learnings and new relationships and this one is gonna be a celebration like none other..\u2026\"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> The first look of Sara Ali Khan came out on October 8, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ-gCyLAcBI/|title=KriArj Entertainment on Instagram: \"Here's #SaraAliKhan's look from #Kedarnath \ud83d\ude00 @iprernaarora @gattukapoor @pragyadav @guyintheskypictures @tseries.official\u2026\"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> Rajput's portions of the shoot was completed on 16 June 2018.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rana |first1=Kamal |title=Sara Ali Khan Upcoming Movie Kedarnath Shoot is Complete!

Due to having free days as per the Kedarnath producers' court case, Khan allotted those days to film with the ''Simmba'' crew; this decision was unfitting to Kedarnath director Kapoor who took Khan to court. The two eventually settled out of court as Khan agreed to split her time between both films.<ref name=\":0\" /> The case also had an effect on the release of the film; as the producers ended up losing several lucrative prospective release slots near the end of the year; it seemed as if the film would be releasing in 2019 and that [[Rohit Shetty]]-directed ''Simmba'' would be Sara Ali Khan's debut film. However, when the producers' of Ajay Devgn-starrer ''[[Total Dhamaal]]'' relinquished their 7 December release date in favor of late February 2019, RSVP Movies was quick to secure it for Kedarnath.<ref name=\"timesnownews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/kedarnath-dialogue-promo-unabashed-sara-ali-khan-asks-for-sushant-singh-rajput-s-attention/325692|title=Kedarnath dialogue promo: Unabashed Sara Ali Khan asks for Sushant Singh Rajput's attention {{!}} Bollywood News|website=www.timesnownews.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, priests of Kedarnath demanded a ban on the film as they believed it promotes [[love jihad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/kedarnath-priests-in-the-shrine-town-threaten-to-hold-protests-if-sushant-singh-rajput-starrer-is-not-banned/story-Qdqy8nHC5ACt2siHUUEnbJ.html|title=Kedarnath: Priests in the shrine town threaten to hold protests if Sushant Singh Rajput starrer is not banned}}</ref> A [[BJP]] leader, Ajendra Ajay of [[Dehradun]]'s BJP media relations team, also took issue and urged a ban; he wrote to the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] (CBFC) asserting that the film makes fun of Hindu sentiments despite being set against the backdrop of the Uttarakhand floods.<ref name = \"NDTV Offensive\">{{cite news| title= Nothing Offensive In Film Kedarnath, Say Makers Amid BJP's Demand For Ban\n| url= https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nothing-offensive-in-film-kedarnath-say-makers-amid-bjps-demand-for-ban-1946105 |website= NDTV | accessdate = 13 November 2018}}</ref>  Speaking at the trailer launch of the film, producer Ronnie Screwvala addressed concerns by stating that he believed there was \"nothing offensive in the film,\" and that he would be \"happy to talk\" about objections once the Censor Board themselves have seen the film.

She also praised Rajput's nuanced performance, \"effortlessly mixing restraint and aggression as required.\"  She admired Kapoor's direction and the film's songs as well, yet was critical of certain tonal inconsistencies in scenes where Rajput's character is attacked, and when Khan's family finds out about the romance.

She criticized the \"archaic\" antagonists, the fiance figure (Tarun Gahlot) and the father (Nitish Bharadwaj); she also noted how the second-half wedding feels undeserved.  Yet she praised the visual effects of the natural disaster, saying that they \"rattle you\" and \"makes you believe that a natural disaster is the biggest leveller in life.\"\n\n=== Box office ===\n''Kedarnath'' earned {{INR}}7.25 crore on first day of opening from its India shows.

Mandakini \"Mukku\" Mishra ([[Sara Ali Khan]]) is the daughter of a Hindu priest who runs the hostel for pilgrims by the temple on behalf of the temple committee. She is engaged to the nephew of the head priest. He was meant to marry her older sister, but he dumped the sister and switched to her when she grew up to be prettier, and her father agreed. Out of rebellion, Mukku flirts with the local boys and convinces them to come to her house and propose in order to embarrass her father and fiance. However, Mansoor is different, as they both notice each other and then Mukku makes the first move and hires him as her regular porter as she goes from her family home to a neighbouring village to help at her uncle\u2019s shop. She talks and talks to him and flirts outrageously and finally gets enough of a reaction to know he feels the same way.  They are trapped in the rain together, share stories of their childhood, and then share a kiss. Her envious sister tells Mansoor that Mukku is just flirting with him as she has flirted with all the other boys. Mukku is unable to defend herself when he confronts her, but starts following him around everywhere, finally sitting in the rain outside his house. Her sister tries to cover for her, but she is found out and her family come for her, planning to throw out all the Muslims, which, not-so-coincidentally, will also open up space for the new luxury hotel they are planning.\n\nMukku is taken home by her family who move up her wedding. Nevertheless she keeps insisting that Mansoor will come for her. Mansoor comes, but is spotted and beaten brutally by Mukku's fiance. However, his friend pleas to save him and  carries an unconscious Mansoor back to his home. While the porter community prepares to leave the valley, Mansoor decides not to leave without Mukku.\n\nMukku is married and attempts to commit suicide, but is saved by her family; her now-husband taunts Mansoor with the news. Mansoor runs to Mukku and promises he will come back for her that night when she is recovered, so they can leave the valley together. Her husband plans to take his band of priests and kill Mansoor and drive out all the Muslims in Hindu deity [[Shiva]]\u2019s name. All of a sudden the rains and the floods begin. Mansoor sends his mother with the other porters into the mountains and runs towards Mukku. She and her family are trying to gather the guests of their hostel in a top floor, her husband and his mother arrive driven in by the storm and Mukku refuses to go to him. And then the floor crashes down and her sister and mother are swept away along with half the other people. Mukku and her father and a few others make their way to the temple, Mansoor finds them there just as the water sweeps down. He grabs her hand in the flood, and her father holds on to her and all three are saved. After the water goes down, they make their way to a house that is still standing and wave at an Indian army helicopter that is coming to save them. Mansoor sends up the woman and child who are with them first, then Mukku\u2019s father, then Mukku, and finally prepares to go himself.

The two eventually settled out of court as Khan agreed to split her time between both films.<ref name=\":0\" /> The case also had an effect on the release of the film; as the producers ended up losing several lucrative prospective release slots near the end of the year; it seemed as if the film would be releasing in 2019 and that [[Rohit Shetty]]-directed ''Simmba'' would be Sara Ali Khan's debut film.

Overall, she called it a respectable debut film for Sara Ali Khan.\n\nMeena Ayer of [[Dna India|DNA India]] gave the film 3 out of 5 stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/movie-reviews/report-kedarnath-review-sara-ali-khan-shines-in-this-gloomy-love-story-2692858|title='Kedarnath' Review: Sara Ali Khan shines in this gloomy love story|date=2018-12-06|website=dna|language=en|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>  She highly praised Khan, calling her an \"a superstar on the rise...extraordinarily-talented star kid,\" finding it \"hard to believe that this is her first film because she is so spectacular,\" noting that director Abhishek Kapoor \"does full justice to her.\" Rajput was a \"talented actor\" who \"is game to complement her without displaying any ego.\" She criticized the predictability of the love story, saying that \"the conflict is there, but it is not enough to evoke more than a certain degree of emotion.\"  In the second half of the film's disaster scenes, she praised Abhishek Kapoor for being \"a sensitive director\" who \"stayed true to the story,\" yet noted that the disaster scenes seem a bit \"disturbing\" and take up so much time that \"a pall of gloom descends on the audience.\" Yet she ultimately called it a worthy watch for Sara Ali Khan.\n\nShubra Gupta of [[The Indian Express]] gave the film 2 out of 5 stars,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/kedarnath-movie-review-sushant-singh-rajput-sara-ali-khan-5482081/|title=Kedarnath movie review: It's a weepie minus the tears|date=2018-12-06|website=The Indian Express|language=en-IN|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> calling the film a \"weepie without the tears.\" Like Rachit Gupta, she also noted the similarity of debutante Sara Ali Khan to her mother, showing a \"perky confidence.\"  Sushant Singh Rajput was on average form, and while supporting actors Nishant Dahiya, Pooja Gor, and Alka Amin made an impact, [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] \"as the angry \u2018door-ho-jaao-meri-nazaron-se-baap\u2019 is old, old hat.\"  She was more critical of the structure of the film, saying that the \"writing is sketchy, and the tone confused, never quite knowing whether to go quiet and life-like or to swell with wailing violins.\"\n\nKunal Guha of the [[Mumbai Mirror]] have the film 2.5 out of 5 stars,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-review/kedarnath-movie-review-sara-ali-khan-shines-sushant-singh-rajput-struggles-in-this-abhishek-kapoor-film/articleshow/66973038.cms|title=Kedarnath movie review: Sara Ali Khan shines, Sushant Singh Rajput struggles in this Abhishek Kapoor film|last=Guha|first=Kunal GuhaKunal|last2=Dec 6|first2=Mumbai Mirror {{!}} Updated|website=Mumbai Mirror|access-date=2018-12-06|last3=2018|last4=Ist|first4=19:41}}</ref> praising the cinematography's well-defined landscaping, Sara Ali Khan's performance, and the song \"Namo Namo.\"  He criticized the direction of Kapoor, Rajput's performance (calling it \"struggling\"), and the \"ghisa-pita formula.\" He said that Khan \"shines\" and that \"she often conveys it through her eyes alone \u2014 giving us a taste of the diverse faces she can throw on.\" He was critical of the film's flow and tonality as a whole, saying it \"seems like watching an '80s Hindi movie for an hour-and-a-half and then an '80s shark movie for another 10 minutes.\"\n\nManjusha Radhakrishnan of [[Gulf News]] gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying that the film is \"perfectly stormy and is good for a one-time watch.\" She noted that the brisk pace makes up for the lack of emotional investment in the lead character, and called Rajput \"as earnest as they come in attempting to play Mansoor.\" She praised Sara Ali Khan, calling her \"a natural,\" and that while she has rawness in a few emotional scenes, she \"has a commanding screen presence.\"  She called the film as one that evidently \"belongs to Khan as all forces are at work to display her range as an actor.\"  She said that the chemistry between the two leads worked well in the first half, but unraveled into melodrama in the second.  She criticized the \"archaic\" antagonists, the fiance figure (Tarun Gahlot) and the father (Nitish Bharadwaj); she also noted how the second-half wedding feels undeserved.  Yet she praised the visual effects of the natural disaster, saying that they \"rattle you\" and \"makes you believe that a natural disaster is the biggest leveller in life.\"\n\n=== Box office ===\n''Kedarnath'' earned {{INR}}7.25 crore on first day of opening from its India shows.
