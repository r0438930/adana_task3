Shortly after completing ''Office Space'', Judge was already about 40 pages into his follow-up script, set in the world of an extract factory, when he was convinced by his representative team that he needed to shelve that and concentrate on something more commercial. Over the next several years, he focused his energy on developing ''Idiocracy''. But years later, by the time of the film's release, audiences had decided that ''Office Space'' had struck a chord, so they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor, and thus the ''Extract'' script was given new life.<ref name=\"Nasson, Tim\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/Extract-BEHINDTHESCENES.php|title=Extract-Behind the Scenes|work=wildaboutmovies.com|author=Nasson, Tim|date=August 13, 2009|accessdate=September 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630070806/http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/Extract-BEHINDTHESCENES/|archive-date=June 30, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSeeking to keep ''Extract'' below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film.

One of these (''[[Frog Baseball]]'') was developed into the successful [[MTV]] series ''Beavis and Butt-Head'', which eventually spawned a 1996 feature film, as well as the spin-off series ''[[Daria]]'' (which Judge had no involvement in).\n\nIn 1995, Judge and former ''[[The Simpsons]]'' writer [[Greg Daniels]] developed ''King of the Hill'', which debuted on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1997 and quickly became a hit with both critics and audiences; running for 13 seasons, it became one of the [[List of longest-running United States television series|longest-running American animated series]]. During the run of the show, Judge took some time off to write and direct ''Office Space'', ''Idiocracy'', and ''Extract''. As ''King of the Hill'' was coming to an end, Judge created his third show, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Goode Family]]'', which received mixed reviews and was cancelled after 13 episodes.
