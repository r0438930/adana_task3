Later that year he married [[Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark]] with whom he eventually had five children. Although the accession of the young monarch was initially regarded auspiciously, his reign soon became controversial: Constantine's involvement in the [[Apostasia of 1965|''Apostasia'' of July 1965]] created unrest among sections of the population and aggravated the ongoing political instability that culminated in the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Colonels' Coup of 21 April 1967]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe coup was successful, leaving Constantine, as the [[head of state]], little room to manoeuvre since he had no loyal military forces on which to rely. As a result, he reluctantly agreed to inaugurate the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]] on the condition that it be made up largely of civilian ministers. On 13 December 1967, Constantine was forced to flee the country, following an unsuccessful countercoup against the junta. He remained (formally) the head of state in exile until the junta conducted the 1 June [[1973 Greek republic referendum]] which abolished the monarchy.\n\nThis abolition was confirmed after the [[metapolitefsi|fall of the junta]] by the [[1974 Greek republic referendum]] on 8 December, which established the [[Third Hellenic Republic]].

He returned to Greece with his family in 1946. King George died in 1947, and Constantine's father became the new king, making Constantine the crown prince. He was educated at a preparatory school and later a boarding school (Victoria College of Alexandria, Egypt, where his classmates included King Hussein of Jordan and actor Omar Sharif).<ref name=\"waiting\" /> A fellow student recalled him as \"a good chap, a young man with all the right instincts.

Prior to this, Constantine had already been appointed as [[regent]] for his ailing father.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ailing Greek King Names Son Regent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/21/ailing-greek-king-names-son-regent.html|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=The New York Times|date=21 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nKing Paul's long-time prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] regarded him partly responsible for his [[1963 Greek legislative election|fall from leadership in 1963]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nHowever, due to his youth, he was also perceived as a promise of change. The accession of Constantine coincided with the recent [[1964 Greek legislative election|election]] of [[Center Union|Centrist]] [[George Papandreou, senior|George Papandreou]] as [[Prime Minister of Greece|prime minister]] in February 1964, which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the [[National Radical Union]] (ERE).\n\nGreece was still feeling the effects of the [[Greek Civil War|Civil War]] of 1944\u201349 between communists and monarchists, and society was strongly polarised between the royalist/conservative right and the liberal/socialist left. It was hoped that the new young king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions.\n\nInitially, relations between the king and Papandreou seemed good, but by 1965, they had deteriorated. The conservative establishment feared the rising influence of Papandreou's left-leaning son [[Andreas Papandreou|Andreas]], and the outbreak of the purported [[ASPIDA scandal|''ASPIDA'' scandal]] seemed to confirm their suspicions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe name of Andreas Papandreou was implicated in the case, and when the defence minister, Petros Garoufalias tried to form a committee of inquiry into the alleged scandal, the prime minister forced his resignation. Immediately, George Papandreou assigned the defence portfolio to himself, which caused alarm in the palace and the conservative security circles, which interpreted this move as an attempt by Papandreou to control the army. Constantine refused to accept the self-appointment, and a new political issue resulted.\n\nConstantine proposed the appointment of any other person of the prime minister's choosing as defence minister because, as the king argued, there was a conflict of interest: the prime minister's son was allegedly involved in the scandal.\n\nPapandreou rejected the king's proposition, although he had initially shown some willingness to accept it, and submitted his own resignation, stating that it was well within his constitutional powers as the elected prime minister commanding a Parliamentary majority to appoint his ministers at his pleasure, and it was beyond the constitutional powers of the king to refuse him this right. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nA short time after his resignation, Constantine appointed a new government led by [[Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas]], who failed to ensure the [[confidence (politics)|Parliament's confidence]]. This appointment, which became known as the \"Royal Coup\" ({{lang|el|\u03a4\u03bf \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1}}), evoked much criticism as being unconstitutional. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nAccording to the critics, the appointment of this and successive governments consisting of aisle-crossers instead of the proclamation of new elections, caused a constitutional crisis and political instability that lasted for more than two years and led to the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAfter his failure, Novas was succeeded by [[Ilias Tsirimokos]], who also failed to form a stable government and was dismissed. Constantine next appointed some of Papandreou's dissidents, known as the [[Apostasia of 1965|July Apostates]] and led by [[Stefanos Stefanopoulos]], to form a government of \"king's men\", which lasted until December 1966, amidst mounting strikes and protests, supported by the right-wing ERE.\n\nWhen Stefanopoulos resigned in frustration, Constantine appointed a caretaker government under [[Ioannis Paraskevopoulos]], which called elections for May 1967. This government did not even last until the scheduled elections. It was replaced on 3 April 1967 by another caretaker government under the leader of the ERE, [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]].\n\n[[File:Constantine II of Greece (1959).jpg|thumb|Prince Constantine in 1959]]\n\n==Greek dictatorship 1967\u20131974==\n{{BLP sources|date=April 2017|reason=several lines have major [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] issues|section}}Elections were scheduled for 28 May 1967, with expectations of a wide Centrist victory. According to United States diplomat John Day, the Americans worried that, due to the old age of [[Georgios Papandreou|George Papandreou]], [[Andreas Papandreou]] would have a very powerful role in the next government.\n\nAccording to the United States diplomats Robert Keely and John Owens, who were attached to the United States embassy in Greece at the time, Constantine asked United States Ambassador [[Phillips Talbot]] what the attitude of the United States government would be to an extra-parliamentary solution to this problem. The embassy responded negatively in principle, adding that \"US reaction to such a move cannot be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at time\". To this day, Constantine denies all this. According to then-Ambassador from the United States Phillips Talbot, after this communication, Constantine met with the generals of the army, who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections. However, they were nervous by the proclamations of Andreas Papandreou and reserved to themselves the right to reconsider possible courses of action according to the results of the election.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\">TV documentary \"[http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 \u03a4\u0391 \u0394\u0399\u039a\u0391 \u039c\u0391\u03a3 60's \u2013 \u039c\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 3\u03bf: \u03a7\u0391\u039c\u0395\u039d\u0397 \u0391\u039d\u039f\u0399\u039e\u0397] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406222452/http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 |date=6 April 2008 }}\" Stelios Kouloglu</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\nA traditionalist, right-wing nationalist group of middle-ranking army officers led by Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] took action first and staged a [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' on 21 April]]. The coup leaders met Constantine at his residence in [[Tatoi]], which was surrounded by tanks to prevent resistance. Constantine later recounted that the officers of the tank platoons believed they were carrying out the coup under his orders.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\" /> The king argued with the colonels and initially dismissed them. Later in the day, he went to the Ministry of National Defence, where all coup leaders were gathered, and had a discussion with Kanellopoulos and with leading generals.

The king finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 December 1967. Since Athens was effectively in the hands of the junta militarily, Constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of [[Kavala]], east of [[Thessaloniki]]. There he hoped to be among troops loyal only to him. The vague plan he and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would advance to Thessaloniki (Greece's second biggest city and unofficial capital of northern Greece) and take it. Constantine planned to install an alternative administration there. International recognition, which he believed to be forthcoming, as well as internal pressure from the fact that Greece would have been split into two governments would, the king hoped, force the junta to resign, leaving the field clear for him to return triumphant to Athens.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 December, the king boarded the royal plane together with [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece]], their two young children, [[Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark|Princess Alexia]] and [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece|Prince Pavlos]], his mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], and his sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]]. Constantine also took with him Premier Kollias. At first things seemed to be going according to plan. Constantine was well received in Kavala which, militarily, was under the command of a general loyal to him. The air force and navy, both strongly royalist and not involved in the 1967 coup, immediately declared for him and mobilised. Another of Constantine's generals effectively cut all communication between Athens and the north. However, the king's plans were overly bureaucratic, na\u00efvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be followed. Further, the king was obsessive about avoiding \"bloodshed\" even where the junta would be the attacker.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nUnder these circumstances, rather than managing to put together a force and advancing on Thessaloniki, middle-ranking pro-junta officers neutralised and arrested his royalist generals and took command of their units, which subsequently put together a force advancing on Kavala to arrest the king. Realising that the countercoup had failed, Constantine fled Greece on board the royal plane, taking his family and hapless premier with him. They landed in [[Rome]] early in the morning of 14 December, where they remained in exile all through the rest of military rule (although he continued as king until 1 June 1973). He was never to return to Greece as a reigning king.\n\nConstantine stated, \"I am sure I shall go back the way my ancestors did.\"<ref name=b1/> The world had changed significantly though since the monarchy had made its last comeback. Constantine continued to watch events from abroad. He said to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'':\n\n<blockquote>I consider myself King of the Hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the Greek people freely decide otherwise. I fully expected that the (military) regime would depose me eventually. They are frightened of the Crown because it is a unifying force among the people.<ref name=\"waiting\"/></blockquote>\n\nWith Constantine abroad, Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] illegally appointed himself prime-minister and General [[Georgios Zoitakis|George Zoitakis]] as regent.\n\nOver the next year the junta sent intermediaries to the king to negotiate the terms on which he might return to Greece. But Constantine insisted on the full restoration of democracy under the existing constitution as a precondition, and George Papadopoulos would not agree to this. Instead the regime illegally promulgated a new constitution in November 1968, which retained the monarchy, but stripped it of its powers, and provided for a permanent regency until the king chose to accept the new order. This standoff continued until 1972, when George Papadopoulos illegally dismissed [[Georgios Zoitakis|George Zoitakis]] and appointed himself regent.\n\nIn June 1973, George Papadopoulos condemned Constantine as \"a collaborator with foreign forces and with murderers\" and accused him of \"pursuing ambitions to become a political leader\".<ref name=\"waiting\" />\nIn May, officers of the largely royalist navy staged an [[Greek destroyer Velos (D16)|abortive coup]], although Constantine himself was not involved. George Papadopoulos retaliated by declaring Greece a [[republic]] (1 June), a decision which was confirmed by a [[1973 Greek plebiscite|plebiscite]] on 29 July. The vote was widely acknowledged to be rigged. Constantine refused to accept the outcome. George Papadopoulos then declared himself [[President of Greece|president]], but in November there was a coup within the regime and he was replaced by General [[Phaidon Ghizikis]], who was a front for the new military strongman, [[Dimitrios Ioannides]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Restoration of democracy and the referendum==\nIn July 1974, [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|the events in Cyprus]] led to the downfall of the military regime, and Karamanlis returned from exile to become prime minister. The 1973 republican constitution was regarded as illegitimate, and the new administration issued a constitutional decree restoring the 1952 constitution. Constantine confidently awaited an invitation to return.<ref name=\"waiting\" /> On 24 July he declared his \"deep satisfaction with the initiative of the armed forces in overthrowing the dictatorial regime\" and welcomed the advent of Karamanlis as prime minister.\n\nThe former king visited both Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street and openly declared his hope to be shortly returning to Greece. However, the 1952 constitution was not restored with the overthrow of the illegal junta. Following Karamanlis' resounding victory in the November 1974 [[1974 Greek legislative election|parliamentary elections]] (his [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party won 54.4% of the vote), he called a [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum]] (held on 8 December 1974) on whether Greece would restore the monarchy or remain a republic.\n\nAlthough he had been the leader of the traditionally monarchist right, Karamanlis made no attempt to restore the democratic constitution of 1952. Instead he called on the Greek people to vote \"according to their conscience\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The former king was not allowed by the government to return to Greece to campaign on behalf of the benefits to Greece of the constitutional monarchy. He was only allowed to broadcast to the Greek people from London on television. Analysts claim this was a deliberate act by the government to undermine any chance to restore the monarchy.<ref>[http://www.royalchronicles.gr/1974referendumgreece/ R. Cronicles, The Referendum]</ref>\n\nThe left voted overwhelmingly for the republic because the former king was perceived by them as having engaged in political interference far beyond the scope of the monarchical prerogative. They also objected to the perceived influence exercised by members of the royal family who had no constitutional role in the political life of the country; the former king's mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], being a case in point.\n\nThe republic received overwhelming support by the centrist voters who condemned Constantine for, among other things, swearing in the junta in 1967. They also blamed his reluctance to sever all ties with the junta once in exile, and the dismissal of the legitimately elected George Papandreou administration ([[Apostasia of 1965]]), the event which some believed led to the coup.\n\nConstantine, speaking from London, freely admitted his past mistakes. He claimed to have sound democratic intentions in the future and promised that his mother would stay away from the country.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> Local monarchists campaigned on his behalf. The vote to restore the monarchy was only about 31%, having most of his support from the [[Peloponnese]] region, with almost 69% of the electorate voting against the restoration of the monarchy and for the establishment of a republic.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> The result was met with  celebrations in the streets of Athens and other major cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==In exile==\nConstantine remained in exile for almost forty years after the vote in favour of the republic.<ref name=\"waiting\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Helena|title=Greece's former king goes home after 46-year exile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/greece-former-king-exile-constantine-ii-anne-marie|website=The Guardian|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref> He was strongly discouraged from returning to Greece, and he did not return until February 1981, when the government only allowed him to return for a few hours, to attend the funeral of his mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], in the family cemetery of the former Royal Palace at [[Tatoi]].\n\nThere were also legal disputes with the Greek state. In 1992 he concluded an agreement with the conservative government of Prime Minister [[Constantine Mitsotakis]], ceding most of his land in Greece to a non-profit foundation in exchange for the former palace of Tatoi, near Athens, and the right to export a number of movables from Greece. The latter reportedly included privately owned art treasures from the royal palaces. As such, no formal account of what was removed was ever given or needed to be given. In 1993, Constantine visited Greece, but faced with government insecurity, he was asked to leave. In 1994, the second government of [[Andreas Papandreou]] passed new legislation reversing the 1992 agreement and stripping Constantine of his property in Greece and his Greek citizenship.\n\nConstantine sued Greece at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for \u20ac500 million in compensation for the seized property. He won a much smaller amount, receiving a monetary compensation of \u20ac12 million for the lost property, with a far smaller sum awarded to his unmarried younger sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]], and his aunt [[Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark|Princess Katherine]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Helena Smith|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/29/helenasmith |title=Court deals decisive blow to deposed Greek royals|work=The Guardian|date=29 November 2002|accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> The Greek government chose to pay out of the \"extraordinary natural disasters\" fund, but was not obliged by the court's decision to return any lands (the Court of Human Rights awards only monetary compensation).\n\nConstantine, in turn, announced the creation of the [[Anna Maria Foundation]], to allocate the funds in question back to the Greek people for use in \"extraordinary natural disasters\" and charitable causes. The court decision also ruled that Constantine's human rights were not violated by the Greek state's decision not to grant him Greek citizenship and passport unless he adopts a [[surname]].\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Former King Constantine & Queen Anne Marie of Greece in Colour.jpg|thumb|Constantine and his wife with their youngest children, Theodora and Philippos, by [[Allan Warren]] c.1986]]\nFollowing the abolition of the monarchy, Constantine has repeatedly stated that he recognizes the Republic, the laws and the constitution of Greece.

Later that year he married [[Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark]] with whom he eventually had five children. Although the accession of the young monarch was initially regarded auspiciously, his reign soon became controversial: Constantine's involvement in the [[Apostasia of 1965|''Apostasia'' of July 1965]] created unrest among sections of the population and aggravated the ongoing political instability that culminated in the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Colonels' Coup of 21 April 1967]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe coup was successful, leaving Constantine, as the [[head of state]], little room to manoeuvre since he had no loyal military forces on which to rely. As a result, he reluctantly agreed to inaugurate the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]] on the condition that it be made up largely of civilian ministers. On 13 December 1967, Constantine was forced to flee the country, following an unsuccessful countercoup against the junta. He remained (formally) the head of state in exile until the junta conducted the 1 June [[1973 Greek republic referendum]] which abolished the monarchy.\n\nThis abolition was confirmed after the [[metapolitefsi|fall of the junta]] by the [[1974 Greek republic referendum]] on 8 December, which established the [[Third Hellenic Republic]].

He returned to Greece with his family in 1946. King George died in 1947, and Constantine's father became the new king, making Constantine the crown prince. He was educated at a preparatory school and later a boarding school (Victoria College of Alexandria, Egypt, where his classmates included King Hussein of Jordan and actor Omar Sharif).<ref name=\"waiting\" /> A fellow student recalled him as \"a good chap, a young man with all the right instincts.

Prior to this, Constantine had already been appointed as [[regent]] for his ailing father.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ailing Greek King Names Son Regent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/21/ailing-greek-king-names-son-regent.html|accessdate=29 April 2016|work=The New York Times|date=21 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nKing Paul's long-time prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] regarded him partly responsible for his [[1963 Greek legislative election|fall from leadership in 1963]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nHowever, due to his youth, he was also perceived as a promise of change. The accession of Constantine coincided with the recent [[1964 Greek legislative election|election]] of [[Center Union|Centrist]] [[George Papandreou, senior|George Papandreou]] as [[Prime Minister of Greece|prime minister]] in February 1964, which ended 11 years of right-wing rule by the [[National Radical Union]] (ERE).\n\nGreece was still feeling the effects of the [[Greek Civil War|Civil War]] of 1944\u201349 between communists and monarchists, and society was strongly polarised between the royalist/conservative right and the liberal/socialist left. It was hoped that the new young king and the new prime minister would be able to overcome past dissensions.\n\nInitially, relations between the king and Papandreou seemed good, but by 1965, they had deteriorated. The conservative establishment feared the rising influence of Papandreou's left-leaning son [[Andreas Papandreou|Andreas]], and the outbreak of the purported [[ASPIDA scandal|''ASPIDA'' scandal]] seemed to confirm their suspicions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe name of Andreas Papandreou was implicated in the case, and when the defence minister, Petros Garoufalias tried to form a committee of inquiry into the alleged scandal, the prime minister forced his resignation. Immediately, George Papandreou assigned the defence portfolio to himself, which caused alarm in the palace and the conservative security circles, which interpreted this move as an attempt by Papandreou to control the army. Constantine refused to accept the self-appointment, and a new political issue resulted.\n\nConstantine proposed the appointment of any other person of the prime minister's choosing as defence minister because, as the king argued, there was a conflict of interest: the prime minister's son was allegedly involved in the scandal.\n\nPapandreou rejected the king's proposition, although he had initially shown some willingness to accept it, and submitted his own resignation, stating that it was well within his constitutional powers as the elected prime minister commanding a Parliamentary majority to appoint his ministers at his pleasure, and it was beyond the constitutional powers of the king to refuse him this right. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nA short time after his resignation, Constantine appointed a new government led by [[Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas]], who failed to ensure the [[confidence (politics)|Parliament's confidence]]. This appointment, which became known as the \"Royal Coup\" ({{lang|el|\u03a4\u03bf \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1}}), evoked much criticism as being unconstitutional. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nAccording to the critics, the appointment of this and successive governments consisting of aisle-crossers instead of the proclamation of new elections, caused a constitutional crisis and political instability that lasted for more than two years and led to the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAfter his failure, Novas was succeeded by [[Ilias Tsirimokos]], who also failed to form a stable government and was dismissed. Constantine next appointed some of Papandreou's dissidents, known as the [[Apostasia of 1965|July Apostates]] and led by [[Stefanos Stefanopoulos]], to form a government of \"king's men\", which lasted until December 1966, amidst mounting strikes and protests, supported by the right-wing ERE.\n\nWhen Stefanopoulos resigned in frustration, Constantine appointed a caretaker government under [[Ioannis Paraskevopoulos]], which called elections for May 1967. This government did not even last until the scheduled elections. It was replaced on 3 April 1967 by another caretaker government under the leader of the ERE, [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]].\n\n[[File:Constantine II of Greece (1959).jpg|thumb|Prince Constantine in 1959]]\n\n==Greek dictatorship 1967\u20131974==\n{{BLP sources|date=April 2017|reason=several lines have major [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] issues|section}}Elections were scheduled for 28 May 1967, with expectations of a wide Centrist victory. According to United States diplomat John Day, the Americans worried that, due to the old age of [[Georgios Papandreou|George Papandreou]], [[Andreas Papandreou]] would have a very powerful role in the next government.\n\nAccording to the United States diplomats Robert Keely and John Owens, who were attached to the United States embassy in Greece at the time, Constantine asked United States Ambassador [[Phillips Talbot]] what the attitude of the United States government would be to an extra-parliamentary solution to this problem. The embassy responded negatively in principle, adding that \"US reaction to such a move cannot be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at time\". To this day, Constantine denies all this. According to then-Ambassador from the United States Phillips Talbot, after this communication, Constantine met with the generals of the army, who promised the king that they would not take any action before the coming elections. However, they were nervous by the proclamations of Andreas Papandreou and reserved to themselves the right to reconsider possible courses of action according to the results of the election.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\">TV documentary \"[http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 \u03a4\u0391 \u0394\u0399\u039a\u0391 \u039c\u0391\u03a3 60's \u2013 \u039c\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 3\u03bf: \u03a7\u0391\u039c\u0395\u039d\u0397 \u0391\u039d\u039f\u0399\u039e\u0397] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406222452/http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 |date=6 April 2008 }}\" Stelios Kouloglu</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\nA traditionalist, right-wing nationalist group of middle-ranking army officers led by Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] took action first and staged a [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|''coup d'\u00e9tat'' on 21 April]].

Later in the day, he went to the Ministry of National Defence, where all coup leaders were gathered, and had a discussion with Kanellopoulos and with leading generals.

The king finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 December 1967. Since Athens was effectively in the hands of the junta militarily, Constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of [[Kavala]], east of [[Thessaloniki]]. There he hoped to be among troops loyal only to him. The vague plan he and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would advance to Thessaloniki (Greece's second biggest city and unofficial capital of northern Greece) and take it. Constantine planned to install an alternative administration there. International recognition, which he believed to be forthcoming, as well as internal pressure from the fact that Greece would have been split into two governments would, the king hoped, force the junta to resign, leaving the field clear for him to return triumphant to Athens.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 December, the king boarded the royal plane together with [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece]], their two young children, [[Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark|Princess Alexia]] and [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece|Prince Pavlos]], his mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], and his sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]]. Constantine also took with him Premier Kollias. At first things seemed to be going according to plan. Constantine was well received in Kavala which, militarily, was under the command of a general loyal to him. The air force and navy, both strongly royalist and not involved in the 1967 coup, immediately declared for him and mobilised. Another of Constantine's generals effectively cut all communication between Athens and the north. However, the king's plans were overly bureaucratic, na\u00efvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be followed. Further, the king was obsessive about avoiding \"bloodshed\" even where the junta would be the attacker.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nUnder these circumstances, rather than managing to put together a force and advancing on Thessaloniki, middle-ranking pro-junta officers neutralised and arrested his royalist generals and took command of their units, which subsequently put together a force advancing on Kavala to arrest the king. Realising that the countercoup had failed, Constantine fled Greece on board the royal plane, taking his family and hapless premier with him. They landed in [[Rome]] early in the morning of 14 December, where they remained in exile all through the rest of military rule (although he continued as king until 1 June 1973). He was never to return to Greece as a reigning king.\n\nConstantine stated, \"I am sure I shall go back the way my ancestors did.\"<ref name=b1/> The world had changed significantly though since the monarchy had made its last comeback. Constantine continued to watch events from abroad. He said to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'':\n\n<blockquote>I consider myself King of the Hellenes and sole expression of legality in my country until the Greek people freely decide otherwise. I fully expected that the (military) regime would depose me eventually. They are frightened of the Crown because it is a unifying force among the people.<ref name=\"waiting\"/></blockquote>\n\nWith Constantine abroad, Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] illegally appointed himself prime-minister and General [[Georgios Zoitakis|George Zoitakis]] as regent.\n\nOver the next year the junta sent intermediaries to the king to negotiate the terms on which he might return to Greece. But Constantine insisted on the full restoration of democracy under the existing constitution as a precondition, and George Papadopoulos would not agree to this. Instead the regime illegally promulgated a new constitution in November 1968, which retained the monarchy, but stripped it of its powers, and provided for a permanent regency until the king chose to accept the new order. This standoff continued until 1972, when George Papadopoulos illegally dismissed [[Georgios Zoitakis|George Zoitakis]] and appointed himself regent.\n\nIn June 1973, George Papadopoulos condemned Constantine as \"a collaborator with foreign forces and with murderers\" and accused him of \"pursuing ambitions to become a political leader\".<ref name=\"waiting\" />\nIn May, officers of the largely royalist navy staged an [[Greek destroyer Velos (D16)|abortive coup]], although Constantine himself was not involved. George Papadopoulos retaliated by declaring Greece a [[republic]] (1 June), a decision which was confirmed by a [[1973 Greek plebiscite|plebiscite]] on 29 July. The vote was widely acknowledged to be rigged. Constantine refused to accept the outcome. George Papadopoulos then declared himself [[President of Greece|president]], but in November there was a coup within the regime and he was replaced by General [[Phaidon Ghizikis]], who was a front for the new military strongman, [[Dimitrios Ioannides]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Restoration of democracy and the referendum==\nIn July 1974, [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|the events in Cyprus]] led to the downfall of the military regime, and Karamanlis returned from exile to become prime minister. The 1973 republican constitution was regarded as illegitimate, and the new administration issued a constitutional decree restoring the 1952 constitution. Constantine confidently awaited an invitation to return.<ref name=\"waiting\" /> On 24 July he declared his \"deep satisfaction with the initiative of the armed forces in overthrowing the dictatorial regime\" and welcomed the advent of Karamanlis as prime minister.\n\nThe former king visited both Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street and openly declared his hope to be shortly returning to Greece. However, the 1952 constitution was not restored with the overthrow of the illegal junta. Following Karamanlis' resounding victory in the November 1974 [[1974 Greek legislative election|parliamentary elections]] (his [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party won 54.4% of the vote), he called a [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum]] (held on 8 December 1974) on whether Greece would restore the monarchy or remain a republic.\n\nAlthough he had been the leader of the traditionally monarchist right, Karamanlis made no attempt to restore the democratic constitution of 1952. Instead he called on the Greek people to vote \"according to their conscience\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The former king was not allowed by the government to return to Greece to campaign on behalf of the benefits to Greece of the constitutional monarchy. He was only allowed to broadcast to the Greek people from London on television. Analysts claim this was a deliberate act by the government to undermine any chance to restore the monarchy.<ref>[http://www.royalchronicles.gr/1974referendumgreece/ R. Cronicles, The Referendum]</ref>\n\nThe left voted overwhelmingly for the republic because the former king was perceived by them as having engaged in political interference far beyond the scope of the monarchical prerogative. They also objected to the perceived influence exercised by members of the royal family who had no constitutional role in the political life of the country; the former king's mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], being a case in point.\n\nThe republic received overwhelming support by the centrist voters who condemned Constantine for, among other things, swearing in the junta in 1967. They also blamed his reluctance to sever all ties with the junta once in exile, and the dismissal of the legitimately elected George Papandreou administration ([[Apostasia of 1965]]), the event which some believed led to the coup.\n\nConstantine, speaking from London, freely admitted his past mistakes. He claimed to have sound democratic intentions in the future and promised that his mother would stay away from the country.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> Local monarchists campaigned on his behalf. The vote to restore the monarchy was only about 31%, having most of his support from the [[Peloponnese]] region, with almost 69% of the electorate voting against the restoration of the monarchy and for the establishment of a republic.<ref name=\"waiting\"/> The result was met with  celebrations in the streets of Athens and other major cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==In exile==\nConstantine remained in exile for almost forty years after the vote in favour of the republic.<ref name=\"waiting\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Helena|title=Greece's former king goes home after 46-year exile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/greece-former-king-exile-constantine-ii-anne-marie|website=The Guardian|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref> He was strongly discouraged from returning to Greece, and he did not return until February 1981, when the government only allowed him to return for a few hours, to attend the funeral of his mother, [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica]], in the family cemetery of the former Royal Palace at [[Tatoi]].\n\nThere were also legal disputes with the Greek state. In 1992 he concluded an agreement with the conservative government of Prime Minister [[Constantine Mitsotakis]], ceding most of his land in Greece to a non-profit foundation in exchange for the former palace of Tatoi, near Athens, and the right to export a number of movables from Greece. The latter reportedly included privately owned art treasures from the royal palaces. As such, no formal account of what was removed was ever given or needed to be given. In 1993, Constantine visited Greece, but faced with government insecurity, he was asked to leave. In 1994, the second government of [[Andreas Papandreou]] passed new legislation reversing the 1992 agreement and stripping Constantine of his property in Greece and his Greek citizenship.\n\nConstantine sued Greece at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for \u20ac500 million in compensation for the seized property. He won a much smaller amount, receiving a monetary compensation of \u20ac12 million for the lost property, with a far smaller sum awarded to his unmarried younger sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]], and his aunt [[Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark|Princess Katherine]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Helena Smith|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/29/helenasmith |title=Court deals decisive blow to deposed Greek royals|work=The Guardian|date=29 November 2002|accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> The Greek government chose to pay out of the \"extraordinary natural disasters\" fund, but was not obliged by the court's decision to return any lands (the Court of Human Rights awards only monetary compensation).\n\nConstantine, in turn, announced the creation of the [[Anna Maria Foundation]], to allocate the funds in question back to the Greek people for use in \"extraordinary natural disasters\" and charitable causes. The court decision also ruled that Constantine's human rights were not violated by the Greek state's decision not to grant him Greek citizenship and passport unless he adopts a [[surname]].\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Former King Constantine & Queen Anne Marie of Greece in Colour.jpg|thumb|Constantine and his wife with their youngest children, Theodora and Philippos, by [[Allan Warren]] c.1986]]\nFollowing the abolition of the monarchy, Constantine has repeatedly stated that he recognizes the Republic, the laws and the constitution of Greece.

The law stated that Constantine could not be granted a Greek passport unless he adopted a surname. He continues to use the title \"King Constantine\", although he no longer uses \"Constantine, King of the Hellenes\".
