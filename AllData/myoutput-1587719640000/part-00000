This layer \u2013 conventionally called a [[surface layer]] \u2013 constitutes about 10% of the total PBL depth. Above the surface layer the PBL turbulence gradually dissipates, losing its kinetic energy to friction as well as converting the kinetic to potential energy in a density stratified flow. The balance between the rate of the turbulent kinetic energy production and its dissipation determines the planetary boundary layer depth. The PBL depth varies broadly. At a given wind speed, e.g. 8&nbsp;m/s, and so at a given rate of the turbulence production, a PBL in wintertime Arctic could be as shallow as 50&nbsp;m, a nocturnal PBL in mid-latitudes could be typically 300&nbsp;m in thickness, and a tropical PBL in the trade-wind zone could grow to its full theoretical depth of 2000&nbsp;m.\n\nIn addition to the surface layer, the planetary boundary layer also comprises the PBL ''core'' (between 0.1 and 0.7 of the PBL depth) and the PBL top or ''entrainment layer'' or ''capping inversion layer'' (between 0.7 and 1 of the PBL depth). Four main external factors determine the PBL depth and its mean vertical structure: \n# the free atmosphere wind speed;\n# the surface heat (more exactly buoyancy) balance;\n# the free atmosphere density stratification;\n# the free atmosphere vertical wind shear or [[baroclinicity]].\n\n{{further|Ekman layer}}\n\n==Principal types==\n[[File:Atmospheric boundary layer.svg|thumbnail]]\n\n===Convective planetary boundary layer (CBL)===\n{{main|Convective planetary boundary layer}}\nA convective planetary boundary layer  is a type of planetary boundary layer where positive buoyancy flux at the surface creates a thermal instability and thus generates additional or even major turbulence. (This is also known as having CAPE or [[convective available potential energy]]); see [[atmospheric convection]].) A convective boundary layer is typical in tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime. Solar heating assisted by the heat released from the water vapor condensation could create so strong convective turbulence that the [[Free convective layer]] comprises the entire troposphere up to the [[tropopause]] (the boundary in the Earth's atmosphere between the [[troposphere]] and the [[stratosphere]]), which is at 10&nbsp;km to 18&nbsp;km in the [[Intertropical convergence zone]]).\n\n===Stably stratified planetary boundary layer (SBL)===\nThe SBL is a PBL when negative buoyancy flux at the surface damps the turbulence; see [[Convective inhibition]]. An SBL is solely driven by the wind shear turbulence and hence the SBL cannot exist without the free atmosphere wind. An SBL is typical in nighttime at all locations and even in daytime in places where the Earth's surface is colder than the air above. An SBL plays a particularly important role in high latitudes where it is often prolonged (days to months), resulting in very cold air temperatures.\n\nPhysical laws and equations of motions, which govern the planetary boundary layer dynamics and microphysics, are strongly non-linear and considerably influenced by properties of the Earth's surface and evolution of the processes in the free atmosphere. To deal with this complicity, the whole array of [[turbulence models|turbulence modelling]] has been proposed. However, they are often not accurate enough to meet practical requests. Significant improvements are expected from application of a [[large eddy simulation]] technique to problems related to the PBL.\n\nPerhaps the most important processes, which are critically dependent on the correct representation of the PBL in the atmospheric models ([[Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project]]), are turbulent transport of moisture ([[evapotranspiration]]) and pollutants ([[Air pollution|air pollutants]]). [[Cloud]]s in the boundary layer influence [[trade wind]]s, the [[hydrological cycle]], and energy exchange.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alpine planetary boundary layer]]\n*[[Boundary layer]]\n*[[Turbulence]]\n*[[Wind shear]]\n*[[Microburst]]\n*[[Atmospheric physics]]\n*[[Atmospheric sciences]]\n*[[Atmospheric electricity]]\n*[[Astronomical seeing]]\n*[[Mixed layer]]\n*[[Remote sensing atmospheric boundary layer]]\n*[[Representations of the atmospheric boundary layer in global climate models]]\n*[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theweatherprediction.com/basic/pbl/ Description of the planetary boundary layer] at [http://www.theweatherprediction.com/ theweatherprediction.com]\n*[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=atmospheric-boundary-layer1 American Meteorological Society glossary entry]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Planetary Boundary Layer}}\n[[Category:Boundary layer meteorology]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n\n[[fr:Couche limite#M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The lowest part of the atmosphere directly influenced by contact with the planetary surface}}\n{{distinguish|planetary boundaries}}\n[[File:The air over Los Angeles.ogv|thumb|300px|This movie is a combined visualization of the PBL and wind dynamics over the Los Angeles basin for a one-month period.

This layer \u2013 conventionally called a [[surface layer]] \u2013 constitutes about 10% of the total PBL depth. Above the surface layer the PBL turbulence gradually dissipates, losing its kinetic energy to friction as well as converting the kinetic to potential energy in a density stratified flow. The balance between the rate of the turbulent kinetic energy production and its dissipation determines the planetary boundary layer depth. The PBL depth varies broadly. At a given wind speed, e.g. 8&nbsp;m/s, and so at a given rate of the turbulence production, a PBL in wintertime Arctic could be as shallow as 50&nbsp;m, a nocturnal PBL in mid-latitudes could be typically 300&nbsp;m in thickness, and a tropical PBL in the trade-wind zone could grow to its full theoretical depth of 2000&nbsp;m.\n\nIn addition to the surface layer, the planetary boundary layer also comprises the PBL ''core'' (between 0.1 and 0.7 of the PBL depth) and the PBL top or ''entrainment layer'' or ''capping inversion layer'' (between 0.7 and 1 of the PBL depth). Four main external factors determine the PBL depth and its mean vertical structure: \n# the free atmosphere wind speed;\n# the surface heat (more exactly buoyancy) balance;\n# the free atmosphere density stratification;\n# the free atmosphere vertical wind shear or [[baroclinicity]].\n\n{{further|Ekman layer}}\n\n==Principal types==\n[[File:Atmospheric boundary layer.svg|thumbnail]]\n\n===Convective planetary boundary layer (CBL)===\n{{main|Convective planetary boundary layer}}\nA convective planetary boundary layer  is a type of planetary boundary layer where positive buoyancy flux at the surface creates a thermal instability and thus generates additional or even major turbulence. (This is also known as having CAPE or [[convective available potential energy]]); see [[atmospheric convection]].) A convective boundary layer is typical in tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime. Solar heating assisted by the heat released from the water vapor condensation could create so strong convective turbulence that the [[Free convective layer]] comprises the entire troposphere up to the [[tropopause]] (the boundary in the Earth's atmosphere between the [[troposphere]] and the [[stratosphere]]), which is at 10&nbsp;km to 18&nbsp;km in the [[Intertropical convergence zone]]).\n\n===Stably stratified planetary boundary layer (SBL)===\nThe SBL is a PBL when negative buoyancy flux at the surface damps the turbulence; see [[Convective inhibition]]. An SBL is solely driven by the wind shear turbulence and hence the SBL cannot exist without the free atmosphere wind. An SBL is typical in nighttime at all locations and even in daytime in places where the Earth's surface is colder than the air above. An SBL plays a particularly important role in high latitudes where it is often prolonged (days to months), resulting in very cold air temperatures.\n\nPhysical laws and equations of motions, which govern the planetary boundary layer dynamics and microphysics, are strongly non-linear and considerably influenced by properties of the Earth's surface and evolution of the processes in the free atmosphere. To deal with this complicity, the whole array of [[turbulence models|turbulence modelling]] has been proposed. However, they are often not accurate enough to meet practical requests. Significant improvements are expected from application of a [[large eddy simulation]] technique to problems related to the PBL.\n\nPerhaps the most important processes, which are critically dependent on the correct representation of the PBL in the atmospheric models ([[Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project]]), are turbulent transport of moisture ([[evapotranspiration]]) and pollutants ([[Air pollution|air pollutants]]). [[Cloud]]s in the boundary layer influence [[trade wind]]s, the [[hydrological cycle]], and energy exchange.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alpine planetary boundary layer]]\n*[[Boundary layer]]\n*[[Turbulence]]\n*[[Wind shear]]\n*[[Microburst]]\n*[[Atmospheric physics]]\n*[[Atmospheric sciences]]\n*[[Atmospheric electricity]]\n*[[Astronomical seeing]]\n*[[Mixed layer]]\n*[[Remote sensing atmospheric boundary layer]]\n*[[Representations of the atmospheric boundary layer in global climate models]]\n*[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theweatherprediction.com/basic/pbl/ Description of the planetary boundary layer] at [http://www.theweatherprediction.com/ theweatherprediction.com]\n*[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=atmospheric-boundary-layer1 American Meteorological Society glossary entry]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Planetary Boundary Layer}}\n[[Category:Boundary layer meteorology]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n\n[[fr:Couche limite#M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie]]\n", "name_user": "BenBuc", "label": "safe", "comment": "Inserted wikilink to Eddy (fluid dynamics) in \"Atmospheric stability occurring at night with radiative cooling tends to contain turbulent eddies vertically\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer"}
