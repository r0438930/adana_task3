In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a rate can be misleading, insofar as \"rate\" can then be misinterpreted as a number per unit of time. \"Number\" or \"ratio\" is now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nLatent period is the transition time between contagion event and disease manifestation.  In cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction numbers for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis (TB). Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

Calling the quantity a rate can be misleading, insofar as \"rate\" can then be misinterpreted as a number per unit of time. \"Number\" or \"ratio\" is now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nLatent period is the transition time between contagion event and disease manifestation.  In cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction numbers for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis (TB). Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

In order to estimate <math>R_0</math>, assumptions are necessary about the time delay between infection and diagnosis and the time between infection and starting to be infectious.\n\nIn exponential growth, <math>K</math> is related to the [[doubling time]] <math>T_d</math> as\n:<math>K=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_d}</math>.\n\n=== Simple model ===\nIf an individual, after getting infected, infects exactly <math>R_0</math> new individuals after exactly a time <math>\\tau</math> has passed, then the number of exposed (not recovered) individuals over time is\n:<math>n_E(t) = n_E(0)\\, R_0^{t/\\tau}.</math>\nIn this case,\n:<math>R_0 = e^{K \\tau}</math> or <math>K = \\frac{\\ln R_0}{\\tau}</math>.\nFor example, with <math>\\tau=5~\\mathrm{d}</math> and <math>K=0.183~\\mathrm{d}^{-1}</math>, we would find <math>R_0=2.5</math>. \n\n=== Latent infectious period, isolation after diagnosis ===\nIn this model, an individual infection has the following stages:\n\n# Exposed: an individual is infected, but has no symptoms and does not yet infect others. The average duration of the exposed state is <math>\\tau_E</math>.\n# Latent infectious: an individual is infected, has no symptoms, but does infect others. The average duration of the latent infectious state is <math>\\tau_I</math>.

For example, with the same values <math>\\tau=5~\\mathrm{d}</math> and <math>K=0.183~\\mathrm{d}^{-1}</math>, we would find <math>R_0=1.9</math>, rather than <math>2.5</math>. The difference is due to a subtle difference in the underlying growth model; the matrix equation above assumes that newly infected patients may start transmitting the disease directly after getting infected; the time <math>\\tau_E</math> is the average time. This difference illustrates that an estimated value of the reproduction number <math>R_0</math> is dependent on the underlying mathematical model; if the reproduction number is estimated from a particular model, the same model should be used for predictions about the future.\n\n==Limitations of ''R''<sub>0</sub>==\nWhen calculated from [[mathematical models]], particularly [[ordinary differential equation]]s, what is often claimed to be ''R''<sub>0</sub> is, in fact, simply a threshold, not the average number of secondary infections.
