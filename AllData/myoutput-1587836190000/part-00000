Players were challenged both by the comprehensive enemy defenses and the restrictive and complex [[rules of engagement]] of the period.  Realistic features include unreliable missiles and smokey engines for the Phantom (as in real life, the trail would disappear in [[afterburner]]). At lower realism settings, the F-4 has an internal cannon in addition to the missiles - in contrast to real USN F-4's that were armed only with missiles. A wide range of mission types is available, from simple bomb runs or [[combat air patrol]]s to [[SEAD]] missions requiring close cooperation between the callsigns involved. The player can plan each mission into detail. Based on a given number of planes in his or her flight, they are able to choose from various armament options for each plane. A mission editor allows for changes in waypoints and also how friendly [[AI]] is supposed to behave in each phase of the mission. There is the option to use a default loadout and keep the waypoints unchanged, too.\n\nIn flight, the player is allowed to switch between the planes at will, taking control over the respective airplane or leave the AI flying and just spectate. The game also comes with a fast-forward feature, e.g., to shorten the waiting time for the transit leg from the aircraft carrier and back - which is slowed to normal time progression if there is a hostile plane in visual range. The aircraft cockpits, especially the different modes and settings of RADAR and targeting systems, as well as flight controls are complex. The game offers different levels of realism and difficulty and a manual giving background stories quoting real life pilots of the era. Carrier landings can be left to the AI or flown manually, then requiring the player to maintain the aircraft in a very small envelope to safely land, increasing difficulty once more at the end of lengthy missions.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game is loosely based on the novel \"[[Flight of the Intruder (novel)|Flight of the Intruder]]\" by [[Stephen Coonts]]. The player flies several missions off one of the aircraft carriers on [[Yankee Station]]. The game does not have a real story line but instead is set in the historic conflict of the Vietnam war. In campaign mode the player progresses through the different air campaigns of the Vietnam war, with the first mission being the notorious [[Tonkin Gulf incident]], the [[casus belli]] escalating the conflict.\n\n==Reception==\nThe game was received as a successor to the first game of the [[Falcon (video game series)|''Falcon'' series]], yet it never was as successful or prominent as the latter. ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1990 stated that the player controlling wingmen distinguished the game from other flight simulators, and favorably reviewed the flight models and other realistic features. The magazine concluded that the game \"is a ''tour de force'' in simulation programming ... for the moment, at least, ''Flight of the Intruder'' is the king of the flight simulations\".{{r|rigby199011}} A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game three and a half stars out of five,<ref name=\"brooks199206\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | work=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
