The division's creation had been discussed since the beginning of 1939, with the intent to form it by breaking up the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st&nbsp;Armoured Division]]. A lack of tanks resulted in this not happening until December 1939. After its creation, the division was deprived of forces for a short while until elements of the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division were assigned to it.\n\nIn early 1940, priority for equipment was given to the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division and the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was forced to make do with whatever equipment could be provided. After the [[Battle of France]], with the threat of a German invasion ([[Operation Sealion]]) of the United Kingdom, priority for equipment shifted to the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division. While it was brought up to strength, it was planned to use the division to [[counterattack|counter-attack]] the flanks of any invasion force. In August 1940, elements of the division were transported to Egypt to reinforce [[Middle East Command]]. In October, it was decided to transfer the rest of the division. Before leaving it swapped a brigade with 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division, reducing the division to three armoured regiments.\n\nThe division arrived in Egypt in December 1940, and in the following months was stripped to support an expeditionary force that was dispatched to Greece ([[Operation Lustre]]). The rest of the division moved to the conquered province of [[Cyrenaica]] in [[Italian Libya]]. Its tanks were worn-out, mechanically unreliable, and supplemented by captured Italian models that were equally unreliable. In March, a German-Italian counter-attack led to the destruction of the division and the ejection of most British forces from Cyrenaica. The consensus of historians is there was little the division could have done to stop this.\n\nThe division was not reformed until 1976, during the [[Cold War]], after the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division]] was renamed. In case of war, the new 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, of the [[British Army of the Rhine]], was intended to fight a delaying battle against their armoured counterparts in the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]]. In 1982, the division ceased to exist as it reverted to its infantry title.\n\n==Second World War==\n===Background===\nDuring the [[Interwar period]], the [[British Army]] examined the [[Lessons learned|lessons learnt]] from the [[First World War]]. This included experimentation and development of [[Military theory|theories]] of [[Maneuver warfare|manoeuvre]] and [[Armoured warfare|armoured]]-warfare, as well as the creation of the short-lived [[Experimental Mechanized Force]].{{sfn|French|2001|pp=28\u201329}} The long-term impact was for the Army to start to move towards [[mechanisation]] to restore battlefield mobility.{{sfn|French|2001|pp=36\u201337}} By the 1930s, the army had established three types of division: the infantry division, the mobile division (later called the armoured division), and the motor division. The military historian David French wrote: \"The main role of the infantry ... was to break into the enemy's defensive position\". This would then be exploited by the mobile division, followed by the motor divisions that would \"carry out the rapid consolidation of the ground captured by the mobile divisions\" therefore \"transform[ing] the 'break-in' into a '[[Breakthrough (military)|break-through]]{{'}}\".{{sfn|French|2001|pp=37\u201341}}\n\nThe [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|Mobile Division]] was created in October 1937.{{sfn|Perry|1988|p=45}} French wrote that it was \"'tank-heavy' ... with too few infantry and support arms. It had six cavalry [[light tank]] regiments ... three [[Medium tank|medium]] regiments ... two [[motorized infantry]] battalions and two artillery regiments. The mechanized cavalry were designed to [[reconnoitre]], not to fight, and the infantry were intended to protect the tanks when they were resting and replenishing.\"{{sfn|French|2001|p=42}} [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Burnett-Stuart]], responsible for training the Mobile Division, stated the infantry were not \"to be put on to a position by tanks and told to hold it, and they are not meant to fight side by side with your tanks in the forefront\". French wrote this \"stood outside the mainstream of official [[Military doctrine|doctrine]]\", which promoted [[combined-arms]] co-operation to win battles and placed the British armoured formations at odds with their German counterparts in the ''{{lang|de|[[Panzerwaffe]]}}'' (Tank Arm). They had \"concluded that tanks working on their own or merely in conjunction with infantry would never be a decisive weapon\" and that \"the key to success lay in combining tanks and supporting arms in the same divisional organization\". According to French, this thinking predominated within the British armoured forces, until doctrine was reformed in 1942.{{sfn|French|2001|p=42}}\n\nIn the 1930s, [[Causes of World War II|tensions built]] between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the United Kingdom and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=3\u20134}} During late 1937 and 1938, German demands for the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] led to an [[international crisis]]. This was resolved in September by the [[Munich Agreement]], which accepted that the Germans would annexe the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275, 277\u2013278}} Tension did not subside, and the British Government debated how best to prepare the Army for war. In January 1939, the [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] proposed splitting the Mobile Division into two smaller formations but found no support for this move.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=503\u2013504}} The issue was broached a month later and was accepted in principle by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=511}} Shortly after, the French were informed of a preliminary timetable for the arrival of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in the event of war: \"One Regular Armoured Division will become available about the middle of 1940, the second would not be available 'till a later date\". The formation of a second division during this period was complicated by the slow pace of tank production.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=514, 525}}\n\n===Formation and home service===\n[[File:IWM-ARMY-TRAINING-6-6-light-tank-MkVIA-c1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a Vickers light tank with one soldier by the gun turret and another looking through an opening in the front | A Vickers light tank of the 3rd&nbsp;Hussars]]\n\nThe 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was activated on 15&nbsp;December 1939, with [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Frederick Hotblack]] as the first [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC).{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=16}} Hotblack joined the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Corps]] in 1916.

Then only two of them could be used extensively due to the expected strain on the supply line. British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aerial reconnaissance had observed Axis troop movements towards Cyrenaica, and on 25&nbsp;February spotted German ''[[Schwerer Panzersp\u00e4hwagen]]'' (eight-wheeler armoured cars). These armoured cars were superior in both speed and armament to the British who desired to avoid contact to avoid casualties.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|pp=10\u201312}} Continued reconnaissance flights showed further troop movements and preparations closing in on El Agheila.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=36\u201338}}\n\nThe forward area was patrolled by a single platoon from the 1st&nbsp;Tower Hamlet Rifles and elements of the KDG. On 23&nbsp;March, the division had its first action with the enemy. A patrol of two armoured cars from the KDG, supported by a single anti-tank gun attached from the 9th&nbsp;Australian Division, spotted and engaged their German reconnaissance counterparts near El Agheila. The Axis force withdrew after the Australians claimed three vehicles knocked out. The following day, a platoon from the 1st&nbsp;Tower Hamlet Rifles moved forward to ensure that the colonial fort near El Agheila was still unoccupied, before moving to take up an ambush position to the west of the town. Nearing the fort, they found it occupied and came under fire. Shortly afterwards, German armoured cars moved forward. A brief clash occurred that resulted in one German armoured car being knocked out, and an Australian gun crew suffering casualties. After this brief action, the British screening force withdrew to Mersa Brega ceding El Agheila to the Axis. At least one, and maybe two, German tanks were subsequently lost striking mines in this area (potentially left over Italian ones, which had not been cleared by the British).{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=36\u201338}}{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=82}}\n\n{{Location map+|Libya|width=250|float=left|caption={{center|Key locations in Libya during this period. 1 \u2013 Mersa Brega; 2 \u2013 Agedabia; 3 \u2013 Antelat; <br>4 \u2013 Msus; 5 \u2013 Mechili; 6 \u2013 Derna}}|places=\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.902222|long=13.185833|label=Tripoli|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.076111|long=23.961389|label=Tobruk|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.116667|long=20.066667|label=Benghazi|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=30.266667|long=19.2|label=El Agheila|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=30.435|long=19.666944|label=1|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=30.755556|long=20.225278|label=2|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=31.07|long=20.35|label=3|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=31.583333|long=21.016667|label=4|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.166667|long=22.283333|label=5|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.766667|long=22.633333|label=6|position=left}}\n}}\n\nOn 31&nbsp;March, the Axis forces renewed their attack.

During this period, the 2nd&nbsp;Support Group reported having repulsed two attacks and driving off an advance by German armoured cars. The Germans recorded their own success in suppressing the British positions, destroying numerous vehicles that were within range of their guns and at least one tank of the 5th&nbsp;RTR. A request for the 3rd &nbsp;Armoured Brigade to be deployed to assist was denied.

A counter-attack was launched by a [[Reconnaissance|scout platoon]] that restored the position with the loss of eight [[universal carrier]]s. After dark, the Support Group withdrew. By the next morning, they had moved {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off}} to [[Ajdabiya|Agedabia]].

For most of the day, their movements were shadowed by armoured vehicles they were unable to identify. During the afternoon, the withdrawal was further slowed by breakdowns, conflicting orders, as well as the need to rest and refuel allowing the nearby armoured vehicles to gain ground. Two [[troop]]s from the 5th&nbsp;RTR were ordered to conduct a rearguard action and took [[hull-down]] positions.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nThe 5th&nbsp;RTR decided the shadowing tanks were Italian (they were German). The Axis tanks advanced in arrowhead formation straight at the British position. When the range was between {{convert|900|\u2013|1500|yd|m|abbr=off}}, both sides opened fire.

The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade, along with some elements of the Support Group, were ordered to move to Msus to deal with the Axis forces. The division was crippled by a breakdown in communication, the result of late, missed, and conflicting orders. None of the division arrived at Msus during the day, and it was established late in the afternoon that the RAF had mistakenly identified friendly vehicles in the area.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=59\u201363}} By the end of the day, the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade had been reduced to 18 light tanks, 26 Italian tanks, and 12 cruisers.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=96}}\n\nOn 4&nbsp;April, Rommel ordered units to advance in various directions, with objectives as far as Tobruk.

The Brigade formed a perimeter around the fort, with the 11th&nbsp;Cavalry and a battery of anti-tank guns holding the eastern flank, and the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers and a battery of guns holding the western flank. The 18th&nbsp;Cavalry dispatched numerous patrols.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=76}}}}\n\nAround 09:00, two Axis field guns fired on the fort at Mechili.

An attached Australian anti-tank gun fired on both trucks, halting them. The Axis soldiers, one German and twenty Italians, dismounted and were soon captured by a patrol of the 11th&nbsp;PAVO. Another patrol by the brigade captured another Italian prisoner, who had been directing artillery fire on the fort. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO captured more Axis troops during the day while patrolling the perimeter.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=84, 89}} Neame, unaware of the attack, set off into the desert to locate Gambier-Parry to deliver new instructions.

Following the new instructions, the Support Group moved north towards the coastal road to withdraw towards Gazala via Derna. The divisional headquarters, including Gambier-Parry and a battery of artillery, continued towards Mechili. The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade turned north for [[Marawa, Libya|Maraura]] due to a lack of fuel but found little petrol there. The brigade moved towards Derna via [[Al Qubbah|Giovanni Berta]], as the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]] (2nd&nbsp;Lancers) escorted a fuel convoy from Mechili towards where they expected the division to be.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=28}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=86, 89, 102}} The Axis advance through the desert continued.

Towards dusk, a German officer entered the British perimeter to demand the garrison's surrender and was refused.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=89}} German troops briefly managed to block some desert tracks near Derna before moving to take up positions near the main coastal road east of the town. German patrols intercepted and disrupted some Allied convoys, but the route east remained open until the following day.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=90\u201395}}\n\nDuring the early hours of 7&nbsp;April, Brigadier [[Reginald Rimington]], GOC 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade, was mortally wounded and captured following his attempt to drive to Derna via an inland desert track. By dawn, the 2nd&nbsp;Support Group and the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade were stretched out, largely stuck in traffic west of Derna and as far back as [[Slonta]] (north of Mechili). The Tower Hamlet Rifles were positioned guarding the western end of the Giovanni Berta pass, near Derna. Gambier-Perry and the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade had been surrounded at Mechili.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=94\u201395}} Axis armoured cars had penetrated as far as [[Timimi]] (near Gazala) and ambushed some retreating Australian forces. They were repulsed following the fortunate appearance of a 5th&nbsp;RTR cruiser tank that had been separated from the rest of the regiment.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=95\u201396}} At 10:00, after elements of the division had passed through Derna, a squadron of the KDG were detached to guard the Derna airfield ({{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} south of the town) to help keep the inland road open. Elements of the Tower Hamlet Rifles were nearby. By 14:30, the 5th&nbsp;RTR, now down to four tanks due to mechanical breakdowns, was the last of the divisional tank units to arrive near the airfield; they formed a rearguard. During the early afternoon, the KDG were engaged in a prolonged fight with the vanguard of the Axis forces. Around 15:00, the KDG and some infantry were ordered to withdraw and inadvertently isolated other parts of the rearguard, including the 5th&nbsp;RTR.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Henry Dinham Drew|Henry Drew]], commander of the 5th&nbsp;RTR, led the rearguard of his four tanks, elements of the Tower Hamlet Rifles, some anti-tank guns, and elements of the 7th&nbsp;Armoured Division that had been moved up (A&nbsp;Company, 1st&nbsp;Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps; and J&nbsp;Battery, 3rd&nbsp;Royal Horse Artillery).{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=97\u201398}}{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=218}} Around 16:00, German forces at the airfield moved to secure the road and attacked towards Drew's forces.

As the four tanks advanced towards the German positions, fifty other vehicles containing the rearguard (including some Australian forces) moved off. While some vehicles were knocked out, the tanks were able to keep the German forces busy enough to allow the rest to move past the area after which they dispersed; the four tanks were lost.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=99}} Barton Maughan, author of the Australian official history for this period of the fighting, wrote \"by coincidence ... the 5th&nbsp;Royal Tanks ... [were] where they were most needed and could be most effectively employed that day\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=99}} The British official history recorded \"the action cleared the road also for any troops that remained in Derna\" as well as allowing the force to break away.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}\n\n===Surrender===\n\nAt Mechili, on 7&nbsp;April, the Germans continued to build up their forces surrounding the division's position. At dawn, elements of the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade, supported by a battery of guns, launched a minor and unsuccessful road on the Axis positions. It resulted in the loss of two guns, along with one man killed and another wounded. At 11:00, Axis guns opened fire from a nearby ridge. A small detachment of troops in a truck with a [[Vickers machine gun]] moved out of the division's position and attempted to move close to the guns to capture them. They were unable to get close enough to attack. The shelling continued, damaging vehicles but inflicting few casualties. The Germans sent an officer to demand surrender. Gambier-Parry rebuffed this demand, as he believed the German to be bluffing to hide their weakened force and position.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} In the afternoon, Italian forces launched a minor attack on the positions held by the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers and were repulsed. Several Italians were captured along with two anti-tank guns. Axis forces subsequently bombarded the division's positions for thirty minutes. At some point during the day, contemporary sources differ on times, 'A'&nbsp;Squadron, 18th&nbsp;Cavalry entered the Mechili perimeter having skirmished with Axis armoured cars en route.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} In the evening, a second German officer approached the division to demand surrender and was also refused by Gambier-Perry.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} This refusal was followed by an artillery bombardment, machine-gun fire, and some skirmishing between patrols outside the main positions. Previously Gambier-Perry had been out of contact with Cyrenaica Command. Around 22:00, communication was re-established, and Gambier-Perry was informed that the rest of his division would not be joining him nor any other reinforcements. He was ordered to break-out at first light and head for El Adem.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=103}}\n\nThe break-out was to be led by one squadron of the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry along with a single cruiser tank, which belonged to the divisional headquarters. This [[vanguard]] was to attack east towards the Axis defensive positions before dawn, to negate their anti-tank gun defensive capability. This eastward move, towards the strongest Axis positions, would be followed by a column formed from the brigade and divisional headquarters. This, in turn, would be followed by engineers, and then all other remaining personnel. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO would provide flank protection, and the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers would form the rearguard of the column. The anti-tank guns were spread out among the column's various units. It was hoped this attack would break through the position and provide a direct retreat route, avoiding the need to drive deeper into the desert, on a meandering route and through difficult terrain, to bypass Axis forces.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=103\u2013104}} Maughan wrote, \"If the original plan had been adhered to, if it had been boldly executed, a great measure of success might have been achieved. But the operation miscarried badly\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=104}} \n\nThe tank did not arrive on time, and the attack was delayed to allow it to move up to the start line. This resulted in the loss of the cover of dark. Despite this, 24 vehicles of the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry achieved surprised charging the Italian battery of 12&nbsp;guns. The Indians dismounted and attacked at bayonet point, scattering the battery's personnel for the loss of at least two dead and 15 wounded. With their mission achieved, they remounted their vehicles and proceeded with the escape plan. Instead of following up this move, the rest of the escape column awaited the cruiser to advance. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO attacked and a large portion of their force broke through the Axis defensive positions followed by the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade headquarters. The main body followed the cruiser, which moved towards the gun battery previously silenced by the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry. The Italians, having recovered from the shock of the attack, had returned to their guns. They engaged and destroyed the tank, resulting in the death of the entire crew. Now alert to the British attack, Axis guns from around the Mechili perimeter opened fire. The artillery and heavy machine gun fire hindered the ability of the division's non-armoured vehicles to attempt a break-out. This was followed by an attack by Axis infantry and German tanks. Two Australian anti-tank guns, part of the rearguard, opened fire in a fierce battle with the German tanks, but were unable to stop their attack; the majority of the crews were killed or wounded.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=104\u2013107}} \n\nVaughan, who had broken out, returned towards Mechili to aid the extradition of the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers. There was discussion of a break-out to the south or the west, however, Gambier-Perry made the decision to surrender to spare the men in the non-armoured vehicles from suffering unnecessary casualties. His surrender was not immediately known to all forces still in the Mechili perimeter due to a sandstorm. However, by 08:00 all fighting had ceased. Elements of the garrison refused to capitulate, in particular 'M'&nbsp;battery 3rd&nbsp;RHA and portions of the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers who, with non-armoured vehicles, charged the Axis positions and pushed through them without a fight. Eventually, most of these troops were able to make it back to Allied lines at Tobruk, some taking prisoners en route. Those who did not attempt to escape were captured along with Gambier-Perry and Vaughan. In total, around 3,000 prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe remnants of 6th&nbsp;RTR, 'C'&nbsp;Squadron, which had failed to reach Derna before it was taken, moved south into the desert to avoid Axis forces. They continued to move east, before meeting British reconnaissance forces near El Adem on 10&nbsp;April. They had been reduced to a force of four trucks. From there, they were escorted into Tobruk, reaching the port an hour before midnight.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=100}} On 10&nbsp;May 1941, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was officially disbanded.{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=16}}\n\n===Assessment===\n\nMaughan wrote, \"at what great risk and cost had these tanks been shipped across the seas from England to the Middle East! Churchill's courage, energy and determination in sending munitions to Wavell had been frustrated because others failed to ensure that the equipment sent was at least battle-worthy.\"{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=100}} A contemporary [[after action report]], by surviving senior officers from the division, noted \"this division had not, in fact, had an opportunity for adequate training as a team. It was a collection of units, three of which had only joined shortly before the action, rather than a trained formation. The breakdown in control and administration was largely due to this fact\".{{sfn|French|2001|p=227}} Gambier-Parry was described as \"a conventional and slow minded soldier who couldn't cope with the unexpected\". David French describes the critique as harsh; the divisional commander \"was not a cavalryman\" and had transferred from the infantry to the Royal Tank Corps.{{sfn|French|2001|p=231}} French looked at \"the ineptitude of [the division's] undertrained staff\", as well as a lack of logistical support. \"[T]he disaster that overtook [the division] was in part caused by the fact that it had no railhead and could not be provided with sufficient motor transport to enable it to build up a sufficient reserve of supplies some {{convert|350|mi|}} from the nearest base.\"{{sfn|French|2001|p=117, 231}}\n\nThe [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] and historian [[Michael Carver, Baron Carver|Michael Carver]] wrote \"a combination of long delays in communications, resulting in misunderstandings and changes in orders, and a general breakdown of the logistical organization within [the division], led to a collapse of any effective resistance\".{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=21}} In reviewing the defeat, including the loss of the division, Carver noted it, \"must be attributed to failure to face realities at every level. The general state of the force, in terms of training, professional competence, logistical supply and serviceability of equipment, meant that it was no match for its opponent\".{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=22}} The general and historian [[David Fraser (British Army officer)|David Fraser]] wrote, once \"the Germans chose to drive across the chord of the Cyrenaican arc there was little to stop them\", as the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division \"had little fighting capacity left as a coherent formation of all arms\" following the extensive breakdown of equipment. Had it been able to fight, Fraser criticised a chain of command that would have hindered its ability; the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade \"was subjected to the orders of ... Gambier-Parry; ... Neame; ... Wavell\" and O'Connor.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|p=151}}\n\nThe historian Thomas Jentz argues that, considering the mechanical state of their tanks, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division \"didn't have anything to lose in conducting ambush counter-attacks\" against their Axis opponents \"as recommended in their tactical manual. At no time [was the division] a threat or a hindrance to the advancing German-Italian forces\" largely as a result of how they were \"tactically handled\".{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=101}} Jentz lauded the courage of the tank crews, but criticised their inflexible attitude towards combat and especially manoeuvre, which required permission from the next level in the chain of command to move even one tank. Jentz argued that this lack of flexibility, mixed with a lack of alternative firing positions, explained the rapid tank losses that occurred when the division did engage their opponents. Jentz also criticised the Germans, who showed an equal lack of flexibility against their own doctrine. This resulted in the two sides lining up to fire at one another rather than manoeuvring. The lack of understanding on the Germans' part about the intention of the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division resulted in the 5th Light Division being \"decimated by mechanical breakdowns\" due to \"unnecessarily rushing through the desert\", a move that resulted in 83 tanks having to be sent to workshops.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n==Cold War==\n===Background===\nAt the end of the Second World War, the United Kingdom was allocated an [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zone]] in northwest Germany. It formed the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) to administer its occupation forces. Following the creation of [[West Germany]], the BAOR ceased being an occupation force and became part of the UK's [[Northern Army Group|contribution to the defence]] of [[Western Europe]] from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=336}}{{sfn|Speiser|2016|p=1}} This role was reaffirmed at the 1954 [[London and Paris Conferences]], with the promise to commit four divisions to the defence of Europe.{{sfn|Rees|2013|p=57}} While the BAOR fluctuated in size and the number of divisions, it was founded with and maintained the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division]] throughout this period.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=336}} By the 1960s, the BAOR had been reduced to three divisions. The division's brigades had adopted a [[Square division|square organisation]]; each consisted of two armoured battalions and two mechanised infantry battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=331}}\n\n[[File:British 2nd Infantry Division.svg|thumb|left|alt=Illustration of the 2nd&nbsp;Division's divisional insignia\u2014two old keys | The divisional insignia of the 2nd&nbsp;Division, since its adoption during the Second World War, and used throughout the Cold War and during the period as an armoured division.{{sfn|Lord|Watson|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Horseman|Shaw|1983|p=126}}]]\n\nBy the 1970s, the UK was in the position of having to reconcile decreasing resources with its commitments and the increased threat of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} In 1974, following the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election]], [[Roy Mason]] became [[Secretary of State]]. He authored the [[Mason Review]], a Government [[White paper]] outlining the new defence policy. It reaffirmed the Soviet Union as the primary threat to British national security and the need to concentrate its forces in Western Europe.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=6\u20137}} Mason argued for proposed changes that would \"maintain as far as possible the present combat capability of the Army in Europe ... while reducing the overall number of men\".{{sfn|Mason|1975|p=I-22}} This would be achieved by disbanding headquarter units, including the elimination of \"the brigade level of command\" with battalions being \"commanded directly by smaller-sized divisional headquarters\". The overall aim was to have \"fewer formation headquarters overall, and fewer but larger units\".{{sfn|Mason|1975|p=I-23}} These changes were to maintain the BAOR's ability to wage \"a mobile and intense armoured battle\" against invading Soviet forces.{{sfn|Mason|1975|pp=III=8\u20139}}\n\nHistorian David Isby wrote that Mason's reforms were promised \"with an alleged 25 percent increase in combat power\".{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} This increase was to be brought about by more efficient use of manpower, streamlining the logistical elements of the division and improving the ratio of weapons and men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=373}} Historian Marc Donald DeVore argued the politically forced change coincided with BAOR doctrinal changes that had started in the 1960s. They were subsequently pioneered by the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division in the early 1970s: to fight a mobile defensive battle by defending key attack routes that Soviet armoured forces would more than likely take, and then draw them into killing areas where they would suffer disproportionate losses at the hands of anti-tank guided missile equipped infantry and tanks in hull-down defensive positions. The British division would keep on moving, fighting this aggressive delaying battle from the [[East German]] border.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|p=279}} The restructure saw the BAOR increase to four divisions, each with two armoured regiments and three mechanised battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} It was believed that this attritional battle, using four divisions, would allow the BAOR to resist a Soviet advance and buy enough time for one of several contingencies: a diplomatic solution to be achieved; reinforcements to arrive to allow further conventional warfare; or a threat made warning of the use of tactical nuclear weapons.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|p=282}} On 1&nbsp;September 1976, as part of these reforms, the 2nd&nbsp;Division was re-designated as the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=183}}\n\n===History===\n[[File:Manby tank - geograph.org.uk - 466026.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a Chieftain tank | The Chieftain tank, the main battle tank of the division.]]\n\nThe 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was the first of the four BAOR divisions to be reorganised. After the process was completed, it was 8,600 men strong, and equipped with 132 [[Chieftain (tank)|Chieftain]] tanks (with 12 additional tanks in reserve). In a time of war, the division would be reinforced to a wartime strength of 14,000 men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=374}} Divisional headquarters was based in [[L\u00fcbbecke]], and its signal regiment was in [[B\u00fcnde]], Germany.{{sfn|Lord|Watson|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=225}} The division consisted of an [[armoured reconnaissance]] regiment (two squadrons equipped with [[FV101 Scorpion]]s, and a third squadron equipped with [[FV107 Scimitar]]s); two armoured regiments each with 66 tanks spread over four squadrons; three [[mechanised infantry]] battalions, each with four rifle companies that were carried in [[FV432]] [[armoured personnel carrier]]s. The pre-reform organisation included pioneer and reconnaissance forces integrated within each infantry battalion. Now all reconnaissance forces were concentrated in the reconnaissance regiment, and all pioneers were allocated to the divisional engineer regiment. The division's artillery group included a close support regiment equipped with the [[FV433 Abbot SPG|Abbot]] [[self-propelled artillery]] system and [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe]] missiles, a [[man-portable air-defense system|man-portable air-defence system]]; a general support regiment of self-propelled [[M109&nbsp;howitzer]]s; and an anti-tank battery equipped with [[Swingfire]] anti-tank missiles. Other divisional assets included a [[Royal Army Medical Corps|field ambulance unit]], a [[Provost (military police)|provost]] company, a [[Royal Corps of Transport|transport regiment]], an [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|ordnance company]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|field workshop battalions]], and [[2 (Training) Regiment Army Air Corps|an aviation regiment]] of [[Military helicopter|scout helicopters]].{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=374}} The actual units that comprised the division were not fixed. The British Army rotated units through the BAOR. For example, infantry battalions would generally serve a four-year tour with the army before being rotated to another theatre; armoured units could serve up to eight years.{{sfn|Hansen|1970|p=27}} Elements of the division could also be rotated elsewhere from Germany while remaining part of the division. For example, the 2nd Armoured Division Engineer Regiment was deployed to [[Northern Ireland]] in December 1979.<ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons|title=Baor Units (Ulster Service)|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1979-12-19/debates/93da3177-a464-4615-b481-1643110f689d/BaorUnits(UlsterService)|date=19 December 1979|5=|accessdate=29 October 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029221321/https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1979-12-19/debates/93da3177-a464-4615-b481-1643110f689d/BaorUnits(UlsterService)|archivedate=29 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the removal of the brigade level, the division was ideally able to form up to five battlegroups each based around the headquarters of the armoured regiment or infantry battalions. These groups were to be formed for a specific task and allocated the required forces needed. The reforms envisioned that the divisional commander would oversee these battlegroups, but early training found this to be impractical. To compensate, the divisional headquarters was increased to 750 men (war time strength) including two brigadiers, who would each command a flexible task force that would be formed by the GOC.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=375}} The 2nd Armoured Division's task forces were Task Force Charlie and Task Force Delta. The task forces would allow the GOC to tailor their forces to meet unforeseen events and better execute the killing area doctrine.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|pp=281\u2013282}} These task forces were not a reintroduction of a brigade command structure, and they had no logistical responsibilities. Structuring the division in this manner allowed the division to be reduced by 700 men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=375}} The historian [[David Stone (military historian)|David Stone]] commented the system was \"designed to allow the commander maximum flexibility and take precise account of the operational or tactical task to be achieved.\"{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=224}}\n\nIn November 1976, the BAOR held Exercise Spearpoint&nbsp;76. It was designed to test the reorganised 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, and included troops from Denmark and the United States.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=372}} Norman Dodd, a retired British Army officer who attended the exercise and reviewed what took place, wrote: \"Exercise Spearpoint proved that the new structure of the corps is workable and an improvement on the old organization.\" He suggested the new structure may see problems \"after some days in combat when fatigue and strain begin to take their toll\" on the divisional headquarters and those in charge of the battlegroups.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=378}} Following the exercise, further refinements to the organisation took place into 1977, as additional armour and infantry units were transferred and brought the formation up to strength.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=183}} The Task Force concept lasted until the end of the decade. Stone wrote it had \"not prove[d] entirely satisfactory\".{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=224}} Isby wrote brigades were reintroduced after the flaws of the new system became apparent. It was an issue exacerbated by troop deployments to [[Ulster]] that had \"caused some armoured and mechanized battalions to reduce their fourth squadrons or companies to cadre status.\"{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} The division now comprised the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th]] and the [[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th]]&nbsp;Armoured brigades.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=185}}{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=222}}\n\n===End of the division===\nIn 1981, [[John Nott]], the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] for the government [[1979 United Kingdom general election|elected in 1979]], authored the [[1981 Defence White Paper]]. It, like the Mason review, aimed at balancing the British military inline with the nation's financial resources.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=7}} Nott's paper called for the BAOR to be restructured from four armoured divisions of two brigades to three divisions of three brigades, saving manpower and money with the loss one division. Nott also called for a new division to be formed in the United Kingdom, which would be made up primarily of [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] personnel. The new formation would reinforce the BAOR on the outbreak of war.{{sfn|Nott|1981|p=17}}\n\nIn July 1981, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was chosen to be the formation that would be disbanded in Germany. It was to be reformed in the United Kingdom as the 2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division and be assigned to reinforce the BAOR.

The division's creation had been discussed since the beginning of 1939, with the intent to form it by breaking up the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st&nbsp;Armoured Division]]. A lack of tanks resulted in this not happening until December 1939. After its creation, the division was deprived of forces for a short while until elements of the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division were assigned to it.\n\nIn early 1940, priority for equipment was given to the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division and the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was forced to make do with whatever equipment could be provided. After the [[Battle of France]], with the threat of a German invasion ([[Operation Sealion]]) of the United Kingdom, priority for equipment shifted to the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division. While it was brought up to strength, it was planned to use the division to [[counterattack|counter-attack]] the flanks of any invasion force. In August 1940, elements of the division were transported to Egypt to reinforce [[Middle East Command]]. In October, it was decided to transfer the rest of the division. Before leaving it swapped a brigade with 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division, reducing the division to three armoured regiments.\n\nThe division arrived in Egypt in December 1940, and in the following months was stripped to support an expeditionary force that was dispatched to Greece ([[Operation Lustre]]). The rest of the division moved to the conquered province of [[Cyrenaica]] in [[Italian Libya]]. Its tanks were worn-out, mechanically unreliable, and supplemented by captured Italian models that were equally unreliable. In March, a German-Italian counter-attack led to the destruction of the division and the ejection of most British forces from Cyrenaica. The consensus of historians is there was little the division could have done to stop this.\n\nThe division was not reformed until 1976, during the [[Cold War]], after the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division]] was renamed. In case of war, the new 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, of the [[British Army of the Rhine]], was intended to fight a delaying battle against their armoured counterparts in the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]]. In 1982, the division ceased to exist as it reverted to its infantry title.\n\n==Second World War==\n===Background===\nDuring the [[Interwar period]], the [[British Army]] examined the [[Lessons learned|lessons learnt]] from the [[First World War]]. This included experimentation and development of [[Military theory|theories]] of [[Maneuver warfare|manoeuvre]] and [[Armoured warfare|armoured]]-warfare, as well as the creation of the short-lived [[Experimental Mechanized Force]].{{sfn|French|2001|pp=28\u201329}} The long-term impact was for the Army to start to move towards [[mechanisation]] to restore battlefield mobility.{{sfn|French|2001|pp=36\u201337}} By the 1930s, the army had established three types of division: the infantry division, the mobile division (later called the armoured division), and the motor division. The military historian David French wrote: \"The main role of the infantry ... was to break into the enemy's defensive position\". This would then be exploited by the mobile division, followed by the motor divisions that would \"carry out the rapid consolidation of the ground captured by the mobile divisions\" therefore \"transform[ing] the 'break-in' into a '[[Breakthrough (military)|break-through]]{{'}}\".{{sfn|French|2001|pp=37\u201341}}\n\nThe [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|Mobile Division]] was created in October 1937.{{sfn|Perry|1988|p=45}} French wrote that it was \"'tank-heavy' ... with too few infantry and support arms. It had six cavalry [[light tank]] regiments ... three [[Medium tank|medium]] regiments ... two [[motorized infantry]] battalions and two artillery regiments. The mechanized cavalry were designed to [[reconnoitre]], not to fight, and the infantry were intended to protect the tanks when they were resting and replenishing.\"{{sfn|French|2001|p=42}} [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Burnett-Stuart]], responsible for training the Mobile Division, stated the infantry were not \"to be put on to a position by tanks and told to hold it, and they are not meant to fight side by side with your tanks in the forefront\". French wrote this \"stood outside the mainstream of official [[Military doctrine|doctrine]]\", which promoted [[combined-arms]] co-operation to win battles and placed the British armoured formations at odds with their German counterparts in the ''{{lang|de|[[Panzerwaffe]]}}'' (Tank Arm). They had \"concluded that tanks working on their own or merely in conjunction with infantry would never be a decisive weapon\" and that \"the key to success lay in combining tanks and supporting arms in the same divisional organization\". According to French, this thinking predominated within the British armoured forces, until doctrine was reformed in 1942.{{sfn|French|2001|p=42}}\n\nIn the 1930s, [[Causes of World War II|tensions built]] between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the United Kingdom and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=3\u20134}} During late 1937 and 1938, German demands for the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] led to an [[international crisis]]. This was resolved in September by the [[Munich Agreement]], which accepted that the Germans would annexe the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275, 277\u2013278}} Tension did not subside, and the British Government debated how best to prepare the Army for war. In January 1939, the [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] proposed splitting the Mobile Division into two smaller formations but found no support for this move.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=503\u2013504}} The issue was broached a month later and was accepted in principle by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=511}} Shortly after, the French were informed of a preliminary timetable for the arrival of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in the event of war: \"One Regular Armoured Division will become available about the middle of 1940, the second would not be available 'till a later date\". The formation of a second division during this period was complicated by the slow pace of tank production.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=514, 525}}\n\n===Formation and home service===\n[[File:IWM-ARMY-TRAINING-6-6-light-tank-MkVIA-c1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a Vickers light tank with one soldier by the gun turret and another looking through an opening in the front | A Vickers light tank of the 3rd&nbsp;Hussars]]\n\nThe 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was activated on 15&nbsp;December 1939, with [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Frederick Hotblack]] as the first [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC).{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=16}} Hotblack joined the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Corps]] in 1916. By 1918 he had become the Army's expert on German tanks. During the 1930s, he had been posted to Germany where he witnessed and reported on the development of German armoured forces.

The only other major formation available to Neame was the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th&nbsp;Australian Division]].

Neame was ordered to give ground if attacked, as the conservation of his force was more important. The 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division had the conflicting objectives of avoiding tank losses while being ready to operate against the flanks of any Axis armoured force. The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade was based south-east of [[Mersa Brega]], where the Support Group was located.

The Axis force withdrew after the Australians claimed three vehicles knocked out. The following day, a platoon from the 1st&nbsp;Tower Hamlet Rifles moved forward to ensure that the colonial fort near El Agheila was still unoccupied, before moving to take up an ambush position to the west of the town. Nearing the fort, they found it occupied and came under fire. Shortly afterwards, German armoured cars moved forward. A brief clash occurred that resulted in one German armoured car being knocked out, and an Australian gun crew suffering casualties.

The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade, along with some elements of the Support Group, were ordered to move to Msus to deal with the Axis forces. The division was crippled by a breakdown in communication, the result of late, missed, and conflicting orders. None of the division arrived at Msus during the day, and it was established late in the afternoon that the RAF had mistakenly identified friendly vehicles in the area.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=59\u201363}} By the end of the day, the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade had been reduced to 18 light tanks, 26 Italian tanks, and 12 cruisers.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=96}}\n\nOn 4&nbsp;April, Rommel ordered units to advance in various directions, with objectives as far as Tobruk.

An attached Australian anti-tank gun fired on both trucks, halting them. The Axis soldiers, one German and twenty Italians, dismounted and were soon captured by a patrol of the 11th&nbsp;PAVO. Another patrol by the brigade captured another Italian prisoner, who had been directing artillery fire on the fort. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO captured more Axis troops during the day while patrolling the perimeter.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=84, 89}} Neame, unaware of the attack, set off into the desert to locate Gambier-Parry to deliver new instructions.

Following the new instructions, the Support Group moved north towards the coastal road to withdraw towards Gazala via Derna. The divisional headquarters, including Gambier-Parry and a battery of artillery, continued towards Mechili. The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade turned north for [[Marawa, Libya|Maraura]] due to a lack of fuel but found little petrol there. The brigade moved towards Derna via [[Al Qubbah|Giovanni Berta]], as the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]] (2nd&nbsp;Lancers) escorted a fuel convoy from Mechili towards where they expected the division to be.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=28}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=86, 89, 102}} The Axis advance through the desert continued.

By dawn, the 2nd&nbsp;Support Group and the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade were stretched out, largely stuck in traffic west of Derna and as far back as [[Slonta]] (north of Mechili). The Tower Hamlet Rifles were positioned guarding the western end of the Giovanni Berta pass, near Derna. Gambier-Perry and the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade had been surrounded at Mechili.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=94\u201395}} Axis armoured cars had penetrated as far as [[Timimi]] (near Gazala) and ambushed some retreating Australian forces. They were repulsed following the fortunate appearance of a 5th&nbsp;RTR cruiser tank that had been separated from the rest of the regiment.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=95\u201396}} At 10:00, after elements of the division had passed through Derna, a squadron of the KDG were detached to guard the Derna airfield ({{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} south of the town) to help keep the inland road open. Elements of the Tower Hamlet Rifles were nearby. By 14:30, the 5th&nbsp;RTR, now down to four tanks due to mechanical breakdowns, was the last of the divisional tank units to arrive near the airfield; they formed a rearguard. During the early afternoon, the KDG were engaged in a prolonged fight with the vanguard of the Axis forces. Around 15:00, the KDG and some infantry were ordered to withdraw and inadvertently isolated other parts of the rearguard, including the 5th&nbsp;RTR.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Henry Dinham Drew|Henry Drew]], commander of the 5th&nbsp;RTR, led the rearguard of his four tanks, elements of the Tower Hamlet Rifles, some anti-tank guns, and elements of the 7th&nbsp;Armoured Division that had been moved up (A&nbsp;Company, 1st&nbsp;Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps; and J&nbsp;Battery, 3rd&nbsp;Royal Horse Artillery).{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=97\u201398}}{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=218}} Around 16:00, German forces at the airfield moved to secure the road and attacked towards Drew's forces.

As the four tanks advanced towards the German positions, fifty other vehicles containing the rearguard (including some Australian forces) moved off. While some vehicles were knocked out, the tanks were able to keep the German forces busy enough to allow the rest to move past the area after which they dispersed; the four tanks were lost.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=99}} Barton Maughan, author of the Australian official history for this period of the fighting, wrote \"by coincidence ... the 5th&nbsp;Royal Tanks ... [were] where they were most needed and could be most effectively employed that day\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=99}} The British official history recorded \"the action cleared the road also for any troops that remained in Derna\" as well as allowing the force to break away.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}\n\n===Surrender===\n\nAt Mechili, on 7&nbsp;April, the Germans continued to build up their forces surrounding the division's position. At dawn, elements of the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade, supported by a battery of guns, launched a minor and unsuccessful road on the Axis positions. It resulted in the loss of two guns, along with one man killed and another wounded. At 11:00, Axis guns opened fire from a nearby ridge. A small detachment of troops in a truck with a [[Vickers machine gun]] moved out of the division's position and attempted to move close to the guns to capture them. They were unable to get close enough to attack. The shelling continued, damaging vehicles but inflicting few casualties. The Germans sent an officer to demand surrender. Gambier-Parry rebuffed this demand, as he believed the German to be bluffing to hide their weakened force and position.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} In the afternoon, Italian forces launched a minor attack on the positions held by the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers and were repulsed. Several Italians were captured along with two anti-tank guns. Axis forces subsequently bombarded the division's positions for thirty minutes. At some point during the day, contemporary sources differ on times, 'A'&nbsp;Squadron, 18th&nbsp;Cavalry entered the Mechili perimeter having skirmished with Axis armoured cars en route.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} In the evening, a second German officer approached the division to demand surrender and was also refused by Gambier-Perry.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} This refusal was followed by an artillery bombardment, machine-gun fire, and some skirmishing between patrols outside the main positions. Previously Gambier-Perry had been out of contact with Cyrenaica Command. Around 22:00, communication was re-established, and Gambier-Perry was informed that the rest of his division would not be joining him nor any other reinforcements. He was ordered to break-out at first light and head for El Adem.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=103}}\n\nThe break-out was to be led by one squadron of the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry along with a single cruiser tank, which belonged to the divisional headquarters. This [[vanguard]] was to attack east towards the Axis defensive positions before dawn, to negate their anti-tank gun defensive capability. This eastward move, towards the strongest Axis positions, would be followed by a column formed from the brigade and divisional headquarters. This, in turn, would be followed by engineers, and then all other remaining personnel. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO would provide flank protection, and the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers would form the rearguard of the column. The anti-tank guns were spread out among the column's various units. It was hoped this attack would break through the position and provide a direct retreat route, avoiding the need to drive deeper into the desert, on a meandering route and through difficult terrain, to bypass Axis forces.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=103\u2013104}} Maughan wrote, \"If the original plan had been adhered to, if it had been boldly executed, a great measure of success might have been achieved. But the operation miscarried badly\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=104}} \n\nThe tank did not arrive on time, and the attack was delayed to allow it to move up to the start line. This resulted in the loss of the cover of dark. Despite this, 24 vehicles of the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry achieved surprised charging the Italian battery of 12&nbsp;guns. The Indians dismounted and attacked at bayonet point, scattering the battery's personnel for the loss of at least two dead and 15 wounded. With their mission achieved, they remounted their vehicles and proceeded with the escape plan. Instead of following up this move, the rest of the escape column awaited the cruiser to advance. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO attacked and a large portion of their force broke through the Axis defensive positions followed by the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade headquarters. The main body followed the cruiser, which moved towards the gun battery previously silenced by the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry. The Italians, having recovered from the shock of the attack, had returned to their guns. They engaged and destroyed the tank, resulting in the death of the entire crew. Now alert to the British attack, Axis guns from around the Mechili perimeter opened fire. The artillery and heavy machine gun fire hindered the ability of the division's non-armoured vehicles to attempt a break-out. This was followed by an attack by Axis infantry and German tanks. Two Australian anti-tank guns, part of the rearguard, opened fire in a fierce battle with the German tanks, but were unable to stop their attack; the majority of the crews were killed or wounded.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=104\u2013107}} \n\nVaughan, who had broken out, returned towards Mechili to aid the extradition of the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers. There was discussion of a break-out to the south or the west, however, Gambier-Perry made the decision to surrender to spare the men in the non-armoured vehicles from suffering unnecessary casualties. His surrender was not immediately known to all forces still in the Mechili perimeter due to a sandstorm. However, by 08:00 all fighting had ceased. Elements of the garrison refused to capitulate, in particular 'M'&nbsp;battery 3rd&nbsp;RHA and portions of the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers who, with non-armoured vehicles, charged the Axis positions and pushed through them without a fight. Eventually, most of these troops were able to make it back to Allied lines at Tobruk, some taking prisoners en route. Those who did not attempt to escape were captured along with Gambier-Perry and Vaughan. In total, around 3,000 prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=107\u2013108}}<p>\nThe remnants of 6th&nbsp;RTR, 'C'&nbsp;Squadron, which had failed to reach Derna before it was taken, moved south into the desert to avoid Axis forces. They continued to move east, before meeting British reconnaissance forces near El Adem on 10&nbsp;April. They had been reduced to a force of four trucks. From there, they were escorted into Tobruk, reaching the port an hour before midnight.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=100}} On 10&nbsp;May 1941, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was officially disbanded.{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=16}}\n\n===Assessment===\n\nMaughan wrote, \"at what great risk and cost had these tanks been shipped across the seas from England to the Middle East! Churchill's courage, energy and determination in sending munitions to Wavell had been frustrated because others failed to ensure that the equipment sent was at least battle-worthy.\"{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=100}} A contemporary [[after action report]], by surviving senior officers from the division, noted \"this division had not, in fact, had an opportunity for adequate training as a team. It was a collection of units, three of which had only joined shortly before the action, rather than a trained formation. The breakdown in control and administration was largely due to this fact\".{{sfn|French|2001|p=227}} Gambier-Parry was described as \"a conventional and slow minded soldier who couldn't cope with the unexpected\". David French describes the critique as harsh; the divisional commander \"was not a cavalryman\" and had transferred from the infantry to the Royal Tank Corps.{{sfn|French|2001|p=231}} French looked at \"the ineptitude of [the division's] undertrained staff\", as well as a lack of logistical support. \"[T]he disaster that overtook [the division] was in part caused by the fact that it had no railhead and could not be provided with sufficient motor transport to enable it to build up a sufficient reserve of supplies some {{convert|350|mi|}} from the nearest base.\"{{sfn|French|2001|p=117, 231}}\n\nThe [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] and historian [[Michael Carver, Baron Carver|Michael Carver]] wrote \"a combination of long delays in communications, resulting in misunderstandings and changes in orders, and a general breakdown of the logistical organization within [the division], led to a collapse of any effective resistance\".{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=21}} In reviewing the defeat, including the loss of the division, Carver noted it, \"must be attributed to failure to face realities at every level. The general state of the force, in terms of training, professional competence, logistical supply and serviceability of equipment, meant that it was no match for its opponent\".{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=22}} The general and historian [[David Fraser (British Army officer)|David Fraser]] wrote, once \"the Germans chose to drive across the chord of the Cyrenaican arc there was little to stop them\", as the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division \"had little fighting capacity left as a coherent formation of all arms\" following the extensive breakdown of equipment. Had it been able to fight, Fraser criticised a chain of command that would have hindered its ability; the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade \"was subjected to the orders of ... Gambier-Parry; ... Neame; ... Wavell\" and O'Connor.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|p=151}}\n\nThe historian Thomas Jentz argues that, considering the mechanical state of their tanks, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division \"didn't have anything to lose in conducting ambush counter-attacks\" against their Axis opponents \"as recommended in their tactical manual. At no time [was the division] a threat or a hindrance to the advancing German-Italian forces\" largely as a result of how they were \"tactically handled\".{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=101}} Jentz lauded the courage of the tank crews, but criticised their inflexible attitude towards combat and especially manoeuvre, which required permission from the next level in the chain of command to move even one tank. Jentz argued that this lack of flexibility, mixed with a lack of alternative firing positions, explained the rapid tank losses that occurred when the division did engage their opponents. Jentz also criticised the Germans, who showed an equal lack of flexibility against their own doctrine. This resulted in the two sides lining up to fire at one another rather than manoeuvring. The lack of understanding on the Germans' part about the intention of the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division resulted in the 5th Light Division being \"decimated by mechanical breakdowns\" due to \"unnecessarily rushing through the desert\", a move that resulted in 83 tanks having to be sent to workshops.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n==Cold War==\n===Background===\nAt the end of the Second World War, the United Kingdom was allocated an [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zone]] in northwest Germany. It formed the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) to administer its occupation forces. Following the creation of [[West Germany]], the BAOR ceased being an occupation force and became part of the UK's [[Northern Army Group|contribution to the defence]] of [[Western Europe]] from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=336}}{{sfn|Speiser|2016|p=1}} This role was reaffirmed at the 1954 [[London and Paris Conferences]], with the promise to commit four divisions to the defence of Europe.{{sfn|Rees|2013|p=57}} While the BAOR fluctuated in size and the number of divisions, it was founded with and maintained the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division]] throughout this period.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=336}} By the 1960s, the BAOR had been reduced to three divisions. The division's brigades had adopted a [[Square division|square organisation]]; each consisted of two armoured battalions and two mechanised infantry battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=331}}\n\n[[File:British 2nd Infantry Division.svg|thumb|left|alt=Illustration of the 2nd&nbsp;Division's divisional insignia\u2014two old keys | The divisional insignia of the 2nd&nbsp;Division, since its adoption during the Second World War, and used throughout the Cold War and during the period as an armoured division.{{sfn|Lord|Watson|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Horseman|Shaw|1983|p=126}}]]\n\nBy the 1970s, the UK was in the position of having to reconcile decreasing resources with its commitments and the increased threat of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} In 1974, following the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election]], [[Roy Mason]] became [[Secretary of State]]. He authored the [[Mason Review]], a Government [[White paper]] outlining the new defence policy. It reaffirmed the Soviet Union as the primary threat to British national security and the need to concentrate its forces in Western Europe.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=6\u20137}} Mason argued for proposed changes that would \"maintain as far as possible the present combat capability of the Army in Europe ... while reducing the overall number of men\".{{sfn|Mason|1975|p=I-22}} This would be achieved by disbanding headquarter units, including the elimination of \"the brigade level of command\" with battalions being \"commanded directly by smaller-sized divisional headquarters\". The overall aim was to have \"fewer formation headquarters overall, and fewer but larger units\".{{sfn|Mason|1975|p=I-23}} These changes were to maintain the BAOR's ability to wage \"a mobile and intense armoured battle\" against invading Soviet forces.{{sfn|Mason|1975|pp=III=8\u20139}}\n\nHistorian David Isby wrote that Mason's reforms were promised \"with an alleged 25 percent increase in combat power\".{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} This increase was to be brought about by more efficient use of manpower, streamlining the logistical elements of the division and improving the ratio of weapons and men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=373}} Historian Marc Donald DeVore argued the politically forced change coincided with BAOR doctrinal changes that had started in the 1960s. They were subsequently pioneered by the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division in the early 1970s: to fight a mobile defensive battle by defending key attack routes that Soviet armoured forces would more than likely take, and then draw them into killing areas where they would suffer disproportionate losses at the hands of anti-tank guided missile equipped infantry and tanks in hull-down defensive positions. The British division would keep on moving, fighting this aggressive delaying battle from the [[East German]] border.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|p=279}} The restructure saw the BAOR increase to four divisions, each with two armoured regiments and three mechanised battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} It was believed that this attritional battle, using four divisions, would allow the BAOR to resist a Soviet advance and buy enough time for one of several contingencies: a diplomatic solution to be achieved; reinforcements to arrive to allow further conventional warfare; or a threat made warning of the use of tactical nuclear weapons.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|p=282}} On 1&nbsp;September 1976, as part of these reforms, the 2nd&nbsp;Division was re-designated as the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=183}}\n\n===History===\n[[File:Manby tank - geograph.org.uk - 466026.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a Chieftain tank | The Chieftain tank, the main battle tank of the division.]]\n\nThe 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was the first of the four BAOR divisions to be reorganised. After the process was completed, it was 8,600 men strong, and equipped with 132 [[Chieftain (tank)|Chieftain]] tanks (with 12 additional tanks in reserve). In a time of war, the division would be reinforced to a wartime strength of 14,000 men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=374}} Divisional headquarters was based in [[L\u00fcbbecke]], and its signal regiment was in [[B\u00fcnde]], Germany.{{sfn|Lord|Watson|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=225}} The division consisted of an [[armoured reconnaissance]] regiment (two squadrons equipped with [[FV101 Scorpion]]s, and a third squadron equipped with [[FV107 Scimitar]]s); two armoured regiments each with 66 tanks spread over four squadrons; three [[mechanised infantry]] battalions, each with four rifle companies that were carried in [[FV432]] [[armoured personnel carrier]]s. The pre-reform organisation included pioneer and reconnaissance forces integrated within each infantry battalion. Now all reconnaissance forces were concentrated in the reconnaissance regiment, and all pioneers were allocated to the divisional engineer regiment. The division's artillery group included a close support regiment equipped with the [[FV433 Abbot SPG|Abbot]] [[self-propelled artillery]] system and [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe]] missiles, a [[man-portable air-defense system|man-portable air-defence system]]; a general support regiment of self-propelled [[M109&nbsp;howitzer]]s; and an anti-tank battery equipped with [[Swingfire]] anti-tank missiles. Other divisional assets included a [[Royal Army Medical Corps|field ambulance unit]], a [[Provost (military police)|provost]] company, a [[Royal Corps of Transport|transport regiment]], an [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|ordnance company]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|field workshop battalions]], and [[2 (Training) Regiment Army Air Corps|an aviation regiment]] of [[Military helicopter|scout helicopters]].{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=374}} The actual units that comprised the division were not fixed. The British Army rotated units through the BAOR. For example, infantry battalions would generally serve a four-year tour with the army before being rotated to another theatre; armoured units could serve up to eight years.{{sfn|Hansen|1970|p=27}} Elements of the division could also be rotated elsewhere from Germany while remaining part of the division. For example, the 2nd Armoured Division Engineer Regiment was deployed to [[Northern Ireland]] in December 1979.<ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons|title=Baor Units (Ulster Service)|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1979-12-19/debates/93da3177-a464-4615-b481-1643110f689d/BaorUnits(UlsterService)|date=19 December 1979|5=|accessdate=29 October 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029221321/https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1979-12-19/debates/93da3177-a464-4615-b481-1643110f689d/BaorUnits(UlsterService)|archivedate=29 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the removal of the brigade level, the division was ideally able to form up to five battlegroups each based around the headquarters of the armoured regiment or infantry battalions. These groups were to be formed for a specific task and allocated the required forces needed. The reforms envisioned that the divisional commander would oversee these battlegroups, but early training found this to be impractical. To compensate, the divisional headquarters was increased to 750 men (war time strength) including two brigadiers, who would each command a flexible task force that would be formed by the GOC.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=375}} The 2nd Armoured Division's task forces were Task Force Charlie and Task Force Delta. The task forces would allow the GOC to tailor their forces to meet unforeseen events and better execute the killing area doctrine.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|pp=281\u2013282}} These task forces were not a reintroduction of a brigade command structure, and they had no logistical responsibilities. Structuring the division in this manner allowed the division to be reduced by 700 men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=375}} The historian [[David Stone (military historian)|David Stone]] commented the system was \"designed to allow the commander maximum flexibility and take precise account of the operational or tactical task to be achieved.\"{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=224}}\n\nIn November 1976, the BAOR held Exercise Spearpoint&nbsp;76. It was designed to test the reorganised 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, and included troops from Denmark and the United States.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=372}} Norman Dodd, a retired British Army officer who attended the exercise and reviewed what took place, wrote: \"Exercise Spearpoint proved that the new structure of the corps is workable and an improvement on the old organization.\" He suggested the new structure may see problems \"after some days in combat when fatigue and strain begin to take their toll\" on the divisional headquarters and those in charge of the battlegroups.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=378}} Following the exercise, further refinements to the organisation took place into 1977, as additional armour and infantry units were transferred and brought the formation up to strength.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=183}} The Task Force concept lasted until the end of the decade. Stone wrote it had \"not prove[d] entirely satisfactory\".{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=224}} Isby wrote brigades were reintroduced after the flaws of the new system became apparent. It was an issue exacerbated by troop deployments to [[Ulster]] that had \"caused some armoured and mechanized battalions to reduce their fourth squadrons or companies to cadre status.\"{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} The division now comprised the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th]] and the [[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th]]&nbsp;Armoured brigades.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=185}}{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=222}}\n\n===End of the division===\nIn 1981, [[John Nott]], the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] for the government [[1979 United Kingdom general election|elected in 1979]], authored the [[1981 Defence White Paper]]. It, like the Mason review, aimed at balancing the British military inline with the nation's financial resources.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=7}} Nott's paper called for the BAOR to be restructured from four armoured divisions of two brigades to three divisions of three brigades, saving manpower and money with the loss one division. Nott also called for a new division to be formed in the United Kingdom, which would be made up primarily of [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] personnel. The new formation would reinforce the BAOR on the outbreak of war.{{sfn|Nott|1981|p=17}}\n\nIn July 1981, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was chosen to be the formation that would be disbanded in Germany. It was to be reformed in the United Kingdom as the 2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division and be assigned to reinforce the BAOR. The new division headquarters would be based at [[Imphal Barracks]], in [[York]].<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Blaker|first=Peter|year=1981|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1981/jul/20/1br-corps|title=1(BR) Corps, Written Answers (Commons), HC Deb 20 July 1981 vol 9 cc57-8W|website=House of Commons Library: Historic Hansard|accessdate=October 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111062804/https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1981/jul/20/1br-corps|archive-date=11 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Division's assets were dispersed.
