In 1830, the [[Indian Removal Act]] was signed into law, and though that act did not directly address the Potawatomi people of Indiana, it led to several additional treaties that resulted in their removal.  In what came to be known as the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]], about 860 Potawatomi Indians who had refused to leave were forced to move from Indiana to Kansas.  On September 14, 1838, the group camped near Williamsport, and on September 15 they camped in the southwestern part of the county before moving into Illinois.  Before reaching their destination in Kansas, over 40 of them had died, many of them children; two children died and were buried at the second Warren County campsite.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, pp. 31, 156\u2013157.</ref>\n\nWhen the county was established, the [[Wabash River]] was vital to transportation and shipping.  Zachariah Cicott traded up and down the river, and cities like [[Attica, Indiana|Attica]], [[Perrysville, Indiana|Perrysville]], [[Baltimore, Indiana|Baltimore]] and Williamsport were founded near the river's banks and flourished because of it.  In the 1840s, the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] began to operate and provided even broader shipping opportunities, but the canal favored towns which were on the \"right side\" of the river; the canal was on the [[Fountain County, Indiana|Fountain County]] side, and towns like Baltimore dwindled as a result.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, pp. 56\u201357.</ref>  Some towns, such as Williamsport and Perrysville, managed to participate in canal traffic through the use of side-cuts that brought traffic from the canal across the river.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, p. 163.</ref>  When railroads were constructed starting in the 1850s, they in turn began to render the canals obsolete and allowed trade to reach towns that lacked water connections.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, p. 134.</ref>  The canal continued to be used through the early 1870s.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Courthouse in Warren County, Indiana from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|250px|An 1877 drawing of the second purpose-built courthouse]]\nThe first trains to run in Warren County operated on portions of the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (later the [[Wabash Railroad]]) in 1856.  The railroad entered the county near Williamsport and was built westward, reaching the western border at State Line City by 1857.  West Lebanon was the only other settlement near the railroad's path, but the line bypassed it by about a mile; the town subsequently moved northward to be nearer the station.  In 1869 the [[Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway]] was built across Mound Township in the southern part of the county.<ref>Goodspeed 1883, p. 49.</ref>  A few years later, in 1872, a branch of the [[Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad]] (known as the \"[[Pumpkin Vine Railroad]]\") was built from [[Bismarck, Illinois]], southeast through Warren County; it was built specifically to carry coal from the mines south of [[Covington, Indiana|Covington]].  A labor riot at the mines in the late 1870s interrupted the flow of coal, and this combined with the poor financial state of the railroad led to the removal of most of the track by 1880; the remaining portion was removed a few years later.  At about this time, in the early 1880s, the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railroad began operating a north\u2013south line through the county.  It became part of the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad]] but was abandoned in 1920 due to financial difficulties; a new company operated the line as the [[Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad]] starting in 1921, but financial problems affected the new company as well and the rails were removed in 1946.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>  Another line, part of the [[New York Central Railroad]], was built through the area in 1903; locally, it ran northeast from Danville into Warren County, then turned north through the small towns of Sloan and Stewart and continued north into Benton County.  In the 1970s it became part of [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], then [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]]; operations on the line ceased in the 1990s and the tracks were removed, though a portion running north from Stewart remained and became the [[Bee Line Railroad]] which serves the grain processing facility in Stewart.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nThe Wabash Cannonball was a passenger train that ran on the Wabash Railroad between Detroit, Michigan and Saint Louis, Missouri, starting in 1949.  On September 19, 1964, the southbound Cannonball struck a truck loaded with concrete blocks at a crossing in Johnsonville.  The driver of the truck was killed instantly, but although the train derailed, no other lives were lost.  On the train, the driver and fireman were severely injured when the engine caught fire, and about half of the 50&nbsp;passengers were injured.  Over {{convert|1000|ft}} of track was torn out, and the damage was estimated at over $500,000.

The small settlements of [[Hedrick, Indiana|Hedrick]], [[Pence, Indiana|Pence]] and [[Stewart, Indiana|Stewart]] are in Jordan Township; Stewart consists of a grain processing facility and a single residence.  In Steuben Township, [[Johnsonville, Indiana|Johnsonville]] has a church and a handful of residences. [[Marshfield, Indiana|Marshfield]] has an automotive body repair shop, a [[grain elevator]] and a church. [[Independence, Indiana|Independence]], platted in 1832, is located on the site of a trading post set up by Zachariah Cicott. He is buried in a cemetery in Warren Township, just north of town.

Liberty Township has three unincorporated communities: [[Carbondale, Indiana|Carbondale]], [[Judyville, Indiana|Judyville]] and [[Kramer, Indiana|Kramer]] (near the site of the Mudlavia Hotel). Several townships contain only a single settlement. [[Foster, Indiana|Foster]] is the only one in Mound Township and has a motel and several houses.

In 1830, the [[Indian Removal Act]] was signed into law, and though that act did not directly address the Potawatomi people of Indiana, it led to several additional treaties that resulted in their removal.  In what came to be known as the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]], about 860 Potawatomi Indians who had refused to leave were forced to move from Indiana to Kansas.  On September 14, 1838, the group camped near Williamsport, and on September 15 they camped in the southwestern part of the county before moving into Illinois.  Before reaching their destination in Kansas, over 40 of them had died, many of them children; two children died and were buried at the second Warren County campsite.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, pp. 31, 156\u2013157.</ref>\n\nWhen the county was established, the [[Wabash River]] was vital to transportation and shipping.  Zachariah Cicott traded up and down the river, and cities like [[Attica, Indiana|Attica]], [[Perrysville, Indiana|Perrysville]], [[Baltimore, Indiana|Baltimore]] and Williamsport were founded near the river's banks and flourished because of it.  In the 1840s, the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]] began to operate and provided even broader shipping opportunities, but the canal favored towns which were on the \"right side\" of the river; the canal was on the [[Fountain County, Indiana|Fountain County]] side, and towns like Baltimore dwindled as a result.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, pp. 56\u201357.</ref>  Some towns, such as Williamsport and Perrysville, managed to participate in canal traffic through the use of side-cuts that brought traffic from the canal across the river.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, p. 163.</ref>  When railroads were constructed starting in the 1850s, they in turn began to render the canals obsolete and allowed trade to reach towns that lacked water connections.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, p. 134.</ref>  The canal continued to be used through the early 1870s.<ref>Clifton 1913, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Courthouse in Warren County, Indiana from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|250px|An 1877 drawing of the second purpose-built courthouse]]\nThe first trains to run in Warren County operated on portions of the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (later the [[Wabash Railroad]]) in 1856.  The railroad entered the county near Williamsport and was built westward, reaching the western border at State Line City by 1857.  West Lebanon was the only other settlement near the railroad's path, but the line bypassed it by about a mile; the town subsequently moved northward to be nearer the station.  In 1869 the [[Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway]] was built across Mound Township in the southern part of the county.<ref>Goodspeed 1883, p. 49.</ref>  A few years later, in 1872, a branch of the [[Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad]] (known as the \"[[Pumpkin Vine Railroad]]\") was built from [[Bismarck, Illinois]], southeast through Warren County; it was built specifically to carry coal from the mines south of [[Covington, Indiana|Covington]].  A labor riot at the mines in the late 1870s interrupted the flow of coal, and this combined with the poor financial state of the railroad led to the removal of most of the track by 1880; the remaining portion was removed a few years later.  At about this time, in the early 1880s, the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railroad began operating a north\u2013south line through the county.  It became part of the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad]] but was abandoned in 1920 due to financial difficulties; a new company operated the line as the [[Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad]] starting in 1921, but financial problems affected the new company as well and the rails were removed in 1946.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 1966, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>  Another line, part of the [[New York Central Railroad]], was built through the area in 1903; locally, it ran northeast from Danville into Warren County, then turned north through the small towns of Sloan and Stewart and continued north into Benton County.  In the 1970s it became part of [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], then [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]]; operations on the line ceased in the 1990s and the tracks were removed, though a portion running north from Stewart remained and became the [[Bee Line Railroad]] which serves the grain processing facility in Stewart.<ref>Warren County Historical Society 2002, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nThe Wabash Cannonball was a passenger train that ran on the Wabash Railroad between Detroit, Michigan and Saint Louis, Missouri, starting in 1949.  On September 19, 1964, the southbound Cannonball struck a truck loaded with concrete blocks at a crossing in Johnsonville.  The driver of the truck was killed instantly, but although the train derailed, no other lives were lost.  On the train, the driver and fireman were severely injured when the engine caught fire, and about half of the 50&nbsp;passengers were injured.
