They are known for representing Wales in Europe as winners of the [[Cymru Premier]] and [[Welsh Cup]] during the 1990s and early 2000s and have also competed in England's [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and [[FA Cup]]. The team, which has contained more than 50 full internationals, is now run by supporters. They play at their traditional home of [[Jenner Park Stadium|Jenner Park]], Barry, which holds 3,500 spectators.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\n{{football squad on pitch|align = right\n| GK_nat  = WAL|  GK = Steel\n| RB_nat  = WAL|  RB = White\n| RCB_nat = WAL| RCB = Wightman\n| LCB_nat = WAL| LCB = Molyneux\n| LB_nat  = WAL|  LB = Thomas\n| RM_nat  = WAL|  RM = Greenaway\n| RCM_nat = WAL| RCM = Bates\n| LCM_nat = WAL| LCM = Woolridge\n| LM_nat  = WAL|  LM = McNaught\n| SS_nat  = WAL|  SS = Sheldon\n| CF_nat  = WAL|  CF = Isherwood\n| caption = First ever Barry XI at Jenner Park\n}}\nBarry Town United's history dates back to 1892 when an [[association football]] team named '''Barry and Cadoxton District''' was formed in the area. During the early years, this side endured many upheavals, playing on five different grounds under various identities, including '''Barry Unionist Athletic''', '''Barry United Athletic''' and '''Barry District'''. Players who featured during these years included [[Ted Vizard]] and [[Billy Jennings]]; who would each go on to play in the famous [[1923 FA Cup Final|\u2018White Horse\u2019 FA Cup Final]].\n [[File:The inaugural Barry team photo, taken in 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Barry AFC team photograph, featuring players/officials of 1913\u201314]]\nIn November 1912, a meeting at The Windsor [[public house]] in Holton Road saw townsfolk choose to pursue membership of the thriving [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] as '''Barry AFC''' (the 'Town' suffix was added after [[World War II]]). The club would secure land owned by the Jenner family and the people of the town came together to build [[Jenner Park]], ahead of the first match of the [[1912\u201313 in English football|1912\u201313 season]].\n\nOn 6 September 1913, Barry played their first ever fixture; a [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] match against [[Mid Rhondda F.C.|Mid-Rhondda]] at [[Jenner Park]]. The game attracted 4,000 spectators, including 1,000 travelling supporters.\n\nFittingly, the new team would register a surprise, albeit merited, victory, with Barry's Ralph Isherwood scoring the very first goal at [[Jenner Park]] just three minutes in. His second, midway through the second half, sealed a 2\u20131 victory, a fine start for the Barry side on, coincidentally, the same afternoon that [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] played their first ever match at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]].\n\nThe ensuing two seasons would see [[Stoke City]], [[Brentford FC|Brentford]], [[Coventry City]] and others visit the new ground. However, the [[World War I|Great War]] would soon interrupt any competitive proceedings; with Barry captain Major James Wightman one of the many casualties of [[The Battle of the Somme]].\n\n===Southern League success===\nThe [[1920\u201321 in English football|1920\u201321]] season ranks as one of the finest in Barry's history, as they surprised many by becoming champions of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]'s Welsh section. The achievement was all the more impressive when considering the small Barry squad played over 100 matches in all competitions during the course of the season. Competing simultaneously in both the Welsh and [[Western Football League|Western League]], the Barry board gave priority to Southern League fixtures, swayed by aspirations of joining the new [[League 2|English Third Division]].\n\nInspired by [[Stanley Cowie]], the title was clinched in early May, and yet hopes of Barry being able to move up to the [[Football League]] were scuppered just a month later, when their application failed and [[Charlton Athletic]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] (the latter of whom finished second to Barry in their section) were elected instead.\n\nBarry retained membership of the Southern League for more than 60 years \u2013 their highest finish being fourth in the 1930s. Among the notable players of the era were Johnny Gardner (with over 500 appearances), Dai Ward (scorer of more than 300 goals) and [[Fred Whitlow]] (a 100+ goal marksman). Meanwhile, Barry-born sportsman [[Ernie Carless]] combined his footballing exploits with a successful cricketing career with [[Glamorgan CCC|Glamorgan]].\n\n===FA Cup and Welsh Cup glory===\n{{football squad on pitch|align = right\n| GK_nat  = WAL|  GK = Morris\n| RB_nat  = WAL|  RB = Williams\n| RCB_nat = WAL| RCB = Lyske\n| LCB_nat = WAL| LCB = Bright\n| LB_nat  = WAL|  LB = Bellas\n| RM_nat  = WAL|  RM = Dyke\n| RCM_nat = WAL| RCM = Foxton\n| LCM_nat = WAL| LCM = Allen\n| LM_nat  = WAL|  LM = Niblett\n| SS_nat  = WAL|  SS = Goodfellow\n| CF_nat  = WAL|  CF = Cain\n| caption = 1955 Welsh Cup winning XI\n}}\nAt the end of the [[1920s (decade)|1920s]], a crowd of 6,000 at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] saw Barry beat [[Dagenham]] 1\u20130 to progress to the [[FA Cup]] 2nd Round; before losing to [[Brighton & Hove Albion]] ten days later. It proved to be their most successful run in the competition. Barry would reach the 1st Round again in [[1934\u201335 FA Cup|1934\u201335]], losing 1\u20130 to [[Northampton Town]] at Jenner Park, but the build-up to the match was tainted by a fire that ravaged the grandstand.\n\nFootball again took a backseat in 1939, with the eruption of World War II . Barry's Chris Mason would be captured as a [[prisoner of war]] during the conflict, though would return to Jenner Park to resume his career afterwards; entertaining spectators thrilled by the adventures of players such as [[Derek Tapscott]] (who would later sign for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]), celebrated striker [[Stan Richards (footballer)|Stan Richards]] and Gwilym 'Cannonball' Cain.\n\nIn the [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]] season, Jenner Park became one of the first grounds in the country to introduce [[floodlights]], with [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Cardiff City]] all visiting to showcase the facilities. Two seasons later, an all-Welsh showdown in the FA Cup 1st Round saw Barry beaten by Newport, 4\u20130. Nevertheless, the town's most celebrated footballing achievement was right around the corner.\n\nIn May 1955, following a 1\u20131 draw at [[the Racecourse]] in [[Wrexham]], Barry beat [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] 4\u20133 at [[Ninian Park]] to lift the Welsh Cup for the first time. Former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] right-wing Charlie Dyke scored the winner, a dramatic late free-kick to take the cup back to Barry.\n\n===1960s, 1970s and 1980s===\nIn the late [[1950s (decade)|1950s]], a host of [[Scandinavia]]n stars made their way to Jenner Park, and dazzled Barry football enthusiasts with their skill. Among their number were [[Finland]]\u2019s Hannu Kankkonen and [[Bengt Berndtsson|Bengt \u2018Folet\u2019 Berndtsson]]; a member of the [[Sweden football team|Sweden]] squad that reached the final of the [[1958 World Cup]]. The influx of players from continental [[Europe]] came as a result of chairman John Bailey's business interests overseas.\n\nDuring this period, the club embarked on an overseas tour, playing three games in [[Malta]] in 1960 against [[Sliema Wanderers]], [[Hibernians FC|Hibernians]] and [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]] that all ended in draws.\n\n1961 saw another big match as [[QPR]] visited Jenner Park in the FA Cup. A crowd of 7,000 saw [[Laurie Sheffield]]\u2019s opener for Barry cancelled out late on. QPR would win the replay at [[Loftus Road]] comfortably. The [[1960s (decade)|1960s]] and [[1970s (decade)|70s]] are perhaps most fondly remembered for the personalities that pulled on the Barry shirt. Among them, prolific goalscorers Ken Gully and Clive Ayres, brothers John and Dickie Batt, long-serving Bobby Smith and [[Ashley Griffiths]], and tall defender Mike Cosslett; now a member of the club coaching staff.\n\nIn 1982, Barry would leave the Southern League, focusing on Welsh League competition and winning six Welsh League titles before the decade's end; thanks in no small part to the goals of striker Steve Williams. The most significant match of the decade though came on 17 November 1984, as 3,850 crammed into Jenner Park to see Barry vs [[Reading FC|Reading]] in the FA Cup 1st Round. Despite Ian Love's goal, an injury-time winner by [[Trevor Senior]] was enough to send the Royals through.\n\n===Exile and return===\n[[File:Barri in Worcester, 1992-93.jpg|thumb|right|Barri in Worcester, 1992\u201393]]\nAfter insufficient floodlighting had stopped the club being able to compete in the Southern League for most of the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]], the tail end of the decade saw the necessary ground improvements to support a return to England. Barry entered the league's Midland Division and would consistently finish in the top six, yet were denied the opportunity to field a reserve XI in the Welsh League as they had done previously.\n\nThe creation of the [[League of Wales]] (now [[Cymru Premier]]) in 1992 then prompted a decree that Barry would no longer be able to compete in the [[English football pyramid|English pyramid]] at all while based on Welsh soil. As part of a group of rebel clubs known as the [[1992\u201393 League of Wales|Irate Eight]] (alongside [[Newport County AFC|Newport]], [[Merthyr Tydfil FC|Merthyr]], [[Colwyn Bay FC|Colwyn Bay]], [[Bangor City]], [[Caernarfon Town]], [[Newtown AFC|Newtown]] and [[Rhyl FC|Rhyl]]), the Town were forced into exile; with the first team adopting the name of '''Barri AFC''' and playing 'home' matches out of [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]]\u2019s ground, while the reserves (by now, a local league outfit), manned the Jenner Park fort. However, this arrangement would last only one season, as chairman O\u2019 Halloran performed a shock u-turn that saw the Barry first team return home; eventually accepted into [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League Division One]] for the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] campaign.\n\n===Decade of dominance===\n[[File:Barry in Lithuania in the summer of 1994.jpg|thumb|left|Barry (in yellow) in action in [[Lithuania]] in the summer of 1994]]\nBarry's return to Jenner Park would spark the side's most successful period, as they earned immediate promotion to the top flight and a unique quadruple of [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League]] championship, [[Welsh League Cup]], [[FAW Trophy]] and [[Welsh Cup]] (for the first time since 1955).\n\nThe latter was one of the Town's most famous achievements, as they upset [[Football League Second Division]] outfit [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in front of 16,000 spectators at the old [[Cardiff Arms Park|National Stadium]]. Barry's reward for winning the [[Welsh Cup]] was a [[European Cup Winners Cup]] tie against [[FK Zalgiris Vilnius|\u017dalgiris Vilnius]] of [[Lithuania]], but they crashed out 7\u20130 on aggregate. Greater glory was on the horizon.\n\nAfter one season in the [[League of Wales]], Barry opted to become the league's first fully professional club and, thereafter, won their first league championship in [[1995\u201396 League of Wales|1995\u201396]]. The season was though marred by the deaths of chairman Neil O' Halloran and young midfielder Matthew Holtham, the latter in a [[motorway]] accident on the way back from an away match in April.\n\n1996 saw the club create history as the first [[League of Wales]] side to progress beyond the opening round of a European competition.\n\nFollowing victory in [[Latvia]] over [[Dinaburg FC|Dinaburg]], Barry ousted [[Hungary|Hungarian]] side [[BVSC Budapest|Budapest Vasutas]] in one of several epic European nights at [[Jenner Park]]. Despite trailing 3\u20131 from the away leg, Barry stormed to a victory in the return match by the same score-line, and then won a penalty shoot-out 4\u20132.\n\nA memorable all-British tie with [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] was their reward and, after losing 3\u20131 to [[Roy Aitken]]'s side at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]], the Welshmen were held to a pulsating 3\u20133 draw at a rain-swept [[Jenner Park]]; exiting the cup in thrilling fashion before a crowd of over 6,000. [[File:Barry of 1999 with League of Wales Cup, FAW Premier Cup and Welsh Premier trophy.jpg|thumb|The Barry squad of 1999 at Jenner Park, with the League of Wales Cup, FAW Premier Cup and Cymru Premier trophies.]]\n\nOn the domestic scene, Barry were all-conquering, clinching a first treble of [[League of Wales]] championship, [[Welsh League Cup]] and [[Welsh Cup]]. The championship was claimed with a record 105 points and a goal difference of more than +100. In January 1997, the team was part of the first [[League of Wales]] match to be broadcast live on television; a 5\u20132 win over visitors [[Caernarfon Town]] that still holds the league's attendance record. Then, from March, Barry went 51 matches without tasting a single defeat in a league fixture.\n\n1999 saw Barry become the first [[League of Wales]] team to win the [[FAW Premier Cup]], with a 2\u20131 win over [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] at the club's own [[Racecourse Ground]]. Pipped to the title in 2000 by the emerging [[The New Saints F.C.|TNS]], Barry would regain their crown the following campaign, while European battles with the likes of [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] saw players of the highest calibre grace Jenner Park (among them, the likes of [[Andriy Shevchenko]] and [[Sergei Rebrov]].)\n\nThen, in the [[2001\u201302 UEFA Champions League|2001\u201302]] season, Barry notably became the first [[League of Wales]] team to win a European [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] tie, when they defeated the [[Azerbaijan]] champions [[FC Shamkir]] to set up a tie with Portuguese club [[FC Porto]]. Barry lost the first leg in [[Portugal]] by an emphatic 8\u20130 margin, after conceding two early penalties in front of a partisan 55,000 crowd. However, the Town would win the home leg 3\u20131, recording a famous result that has grown in legend with the career success of Porto's [[Ricardo Carvalho]], [[Helder Postiga]] and others.\n\n===Decline and turmoil===\nThe golden era would not last forever, and the continual challenge of securing enough prize money to sustain their high standards set would eventually catch up with those running the club. After chairperson and backer Paula O' Halloran stood aside, former [[Scarborough FC|Scarborough]] and [[Grantham Town FC|Grantham Town]] official Kevin Green came in as the club's new [[Chief Executive]]; yet his varying initiatives failed to stop the rot. In one move that garnered significant press, Green would recruit ex-footballer and celebrity [[John Fashanu]] as the club's high-profile chairman in the winter of 2002. Some saw Fashanu as the missing piece of the puzzle, and the man who would help sustain Barry's success going forward. Promising [[Africa]]n and [[China|Chinese]] TV deals and an influx of [[Nigeria]]n internationals, Fashanu made headlines, yet did little to steady a Barry ship in increasingly rough seas. Then, after success on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] reality show [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Series 2 .282003.29|I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!]] saw him attain new-found popularity, Fashanu left the club; which by now was in a perilous financial state.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the club went into administration and the professional squad would quickly disintegrate. An interim management team was appointed, together with an amateur squad drawn primarily from local side N & M Construction of the [[South Wales Amateur League]] (five levels below the Welsh Premier). Within a month, Barry had gone from winning a match in Europe to losing 8\u20130 at [[Caernarfon Town]]. Though the professional-era bubble had well and truly burst, fans set about raising money to help keep the club alive. Eventually, mystery man Stuart Lovering arrived to purchase of the club on 10 December 2003. Few could have foreseen what was to come.\n\n[[2003\u201304 Welsh Premier League|2003\u201304]] was a difficult season, with champions Barry's first league win not coming until February 2004 when they beat fellow strugglers [[Welshpool Town F.C.|Welshpool Town]] 5\u20134 with a 98th-minute winning penalty from youngster Luke Sherbon. Manager [[Colin Addison]] was brought in resuscitate the team's ailing fortunes, yet the Dragons still ended up bottom of the division, four points off safety, and were relegated to the [[Welsh Football League Division One|Welsh League Division One]]. Controversially, Addison was dismissed by Lovering on the eve of the new campaign, with assistant [[David Hughes (footballer born 1978)|David Hughes]] replacing him; only to leave himself months later on finding his budget slashed. In the meantime, an independent [[Valuation Office Agency|district valuer]] had determined that the club should pay \u00a342,000 in rent and rates each season for the remainder of the lease. Judging the figure to be unfairly based on the club's relinquished professional status, Lovering refused to pay this amount and instead moved the senior side to the White Tips Stadium in [[Treforest]] from January 2005 to May 2006. During the absence, a number of staunch supporters formed breakaway club '''Barry FC'''; the culmination of a series of disputes with chairman Lovering, who had banned them from fundraising at club. With the Town relegated to their lowest-ever league status at the end of the [[2005\u201306 in Welsh football|2005\u201306]] season, the future appeared bleak for this fallen giant of Welsh football.\n\n===Fan-led fightback===\nWhile chaos reigned off the field for much of the decade, the roots of recovery began to grow in 2007, with the appointment of new manager Gavin Chesterfield. Chesterfield led Barry to promotion in 2008, with the hope that a winning run of form in the second tier would see the club's dwindling support return. After stumbling early on, Barry enjoyed a 21-match unbeaten streak and finished the season a credible third. Nevertheless, the team's achievements were continually overshadowed by events behind the scenes.\n\nIn December 2008, a crisis meeting at Jenner Park saw supporters come forward to pledge their commitment to operating the first team (forming a new company for this purpose), to allow Lovering to focus on finding a buyer. In one of a number of close calls, the club appeared on the verge of being sold in 2010, when businessman Clayton Jones appeared to strike a deal. However, this fell through at the eleventh hour, scuppering a plan to bring in [[Wales]] international [[John Hartson]] as [[Director of Football]].\n\nUndeterred, 2010 saw the '''Stand Up For Barry''' campaign launch, utilising new [[social media]] platforms such as [[Twitter]] to spread news of the club's plight with a wider online audience. The resulting support from across the football community proved an invaluable asset as supporters strived to keep the club alive.\n\nShortly after the close of the 2010\u201311 season, Lovering announced his fresh intent of withdrawing the first team from higher league competition. To prevent this, the '''Barry Town Supporters' Committee''' (BTSC) took complete control of all football and its funding; resulting in what became known to some supporters as the 'DIY Football' era. In the months that followed, the rejuvenated, fan-run Barry set-up enjoyed their most successful [[Welsh Cup]] campaign in several seasons; defeating rivals [[Merthyr Town]] at [[Penydarren Park]] and winning at [[Haverfordwest County]] in extra-time, before being edged out 3\u20132 at [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]].\n\n[[File:Barry fans and players celebrate 2013 Welsh Cup success in Flint.jpg|thumb|left|A TV cameraman records Barry fans and players celebrating after their Welsh Cup Quarter Final win at [[Flint Town United]] on 2 March 2013.]]\n\n2012 marked the 100th anniversary of the club's [[wikt:formation|formation]], with a series of events lined up to mark this and the subsequent centenary season. To launch the festivities, the BTSC hosted [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in an August fundraising friendly attended by 2,000 spectators. However, Lovering's threats to withdraw Barry from the [[Welsh Football League]] would intensify in the weeks prior, threatening to cast a cloud over these celebrations. Nevertheless, the BTSC held a successful '100 Years of Barry Town' event at the [[Angel Hotel, Cardiff|Angel Hotel]] (attended by many past and present players), before the current team beat Welsh League champions [[Cambrian & Clydach Vale B. & G.C.|Cambrian and Clydach]] on the 100th anniversary itself.\n\nIn March 2013, following wins against [[Caerleon FC|Caerleon]], [[Penrhyncoch F.C.|Penrhyncoch]], [[Ely Rangers]] and [[Pontardawe Town F.C.|Pontardawe Town]], Barry won 2\u20130 at [[Flint Town United]] to progress to the [[2012\u201313 Welsh Cup|Welsh Cup]] semi-final for the first time in a decade. Eventually, the team narrowly lost 1\u20132 to eventual winners [[Prestatyn Town]], marking the first ever appearance of a fully amateur Barry side at the Welsh Cup semi-final stage.\n\n===Survival and resurgence===\nOn 7 May 2013, Lovering withdrew the senior team from the [[Welsh Football League]], against the will of the BTSC, players and supporters; who were ready, willing and able to fulfill the remaining two league fixtures (both against [[Ton Pentre FC|Ton Pentre]]). Rejecting this perceived act of sabotage, those running the football outlined their intentions to continue as they were, adopting the '''Barry Town United''' suffix to emphasise their continuing unity and endeavour. However, a meeting of the [[Football Association of Wales|FAW]] Council in [[Betws-y-Coed]] in June 2013 announced that the Barry side would have to play \"recreational football\" henceforth; a declaration that prompted significant outcry, both locally and further afield.\n[[File:Maesmawr Hall, Caersws.jpg|thumb|Barry at [[Maesmawr Hall]] before [[Welsh Cup]] Semi-final in [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]].]]\nThere appeared hope for beleaguered Barry as second meeting was arranged for July 2013 at [[Maesmawr Hall]] in [[Caersws]] to hear new evidence as why the team should be able to continue on. At this second gathering, 15 of the FAW Councillors voted against discussing Barry's future, thus concluding the meeting in no more than five minutes and at considerable expense. Notably, it emerged that this decision went against the recommendations of the FAW's own Domestic Committee and legal team.\n\nWith their immediate and long-term future unclear, Barry began their pre-season with wins at [[Moreton-in-Marsh|Moreton]] and [[Elmore, Gloucestershire|Elmore]] that same month, followed by a narrow 3\u20132 loss to [[Premier League]] newcomers [[Cardiff City]], watched by a home crowd of 1,650 supporters on Saturday 27 July. Remarkably, given the bizarre set of circumstances, Barry had led 2\u20131 at half-time.\n\nEventually, a [[High Court]] judge in Cardiff ruled in Barry's favour; stating that the FAW Council had acted unlawfully in denying them their licence to play Welsh League football. As a result, the fan-run Town side was entered back into the structure.\n\nIn the years that have followed, Barry would win two consecutive league titles, reclaiming their place in the second tier, while continuing to develop as a club, on and off the pitch. Today, the club competes at senior, development, youth and junior levels, along with various ladies' teams and pan disability sides in the over and under-16 age groups. In the 2016\u201317 season, the first team reached the final of [[Welsh League Cup]] for the first time since 2001, becoming only the second side from outside the national top flight to achieve this feat since the competition was expanded several years prior. In April 2017, the club secured its return to the [[Cymru Premier|Welsh Premier]] as champions of the [[Welsh Football League]], continuing this remarkable revival.\n\nOn Saturday 6 April 2019, a remarkable 5-2 victory away at Bala Town, coupled with a 6-0 win for The New Saints away against Newtown, ensured Barry Town United would finish at least third in the 2018-19 JD Cymru Premier and qualification for the preliminary round of the UEFA Europa League. This marked a remarkable transformation for the club, qualifying for European competition for the first time since winning the JD Cymru Premier in the 2002-03 season.\n\n==Colours==\nFor many decades, Barry wore green as their primary colour \u2013 thought to be due to officials securing the club's first kit from [[Plymouth Argyle]]. On exile in 1992, Barri adopted a red and white strip, which would remain with them on their return to the Welsh pyramid. It was the following season that the club adopted its yellow change kit (deemed lucky for the success it brought in [[Welsh Cup]] competition) as a home strip \u2013 and it is this colour that has become synonymous with Town football, with variations including uses of blue.\n\nTwo of the club's most memorable home strips are the [[fluorescent]] lime and navy ordered in error in 2006, and the experimental [[claret]] and blue kit worn in the early 1970s \u2013 both of which saw the club simultaneously plummet in footballing fortune. Nowadays, the club tends to wear yellow at home and green on the road.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = _green_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripeonright\n| pattern_ra = _green_stripes\n| leftarm    = \n| body       = 339933\n| rightarm   = \n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 339933\n| alt        = \n| title      = Example of a traditional Linnets green strip, worn with longevity.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = \n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 3399FF\n| body       = 7F1734\n| rightarm   = 3399FF\n| shorts     = \n| pattern_so = \n| socks      = 7F1734\n| alt        = \n| title      = Claret and blue strip, worn for a single disastrous season (1971\u201372).\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _vneckwhite\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 339933\n| body       = 339933\n| rightarm   = 339933\n| shorts     = 3333CC\n| socks      = 339933\n| alt        = \n| title      = Green and blue strip, colour co-ordinated with Jenner Park seating.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FF0033\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FF0033\n| socks      = FF0033\n| alt        = \n| title      = Red and white strip, worn in exile and upon return to the Welsh pyramid.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _bluebuttoncollar\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = FFFF33\n| body       = FFFF33\n| rightarm   = FFFF33\n| shorts     = FFFF33\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_blue\n| socks      = FFFF33\n| alt        = \n| title      = Welsh Cup Final strip of 1994, worn in famous win over [[Cardiff City]].\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = _yellowborder\n| pattern_b  = _collarblue\n| pattern_ra = _yellowborder\n| leftarm    = 3333CC\n| body       = FFFF33\n| rightarm   = 3333CC\n| shorts     = 3333CC\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_yellow\n| socks      = 3333CC\n| alt        = \n| title      = League of Wales strip, adopted from cup kit, associated with 1990s success.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _Safasc_Away\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 99FF00\n| body       = 99FF00\n| rightarm   = 99FF00\n| shorts     = 330033\n| pattern_so = \n| socks      = 330033\n| alt        = \n| title      = Fluorescent lime strip, worn in post-Millennium descent to lowest status.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Jenner Park Stadium}}\n\n[[File:Jenner Park - Barry.jpg|thumb|Jenner Park Stadium, Barry]]\n\n[[Jenner Park Stadium|Jenner Park]] occupies the space of land between Gladstone Road and Barry Road in central [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] and has been the setting for the evolution of Barry's senior football club for more than 100 years.\n\nNamed after the Jenner family who had gifted the land, the ground was built by the Barry football enthusiasts for their representative side to compete at the highest possible level and was completed between the landmark meeting of 1912 and the opening fixture of [[1913\u201314 in English football|1913\u201314]].\n\nAmong the most notable Barry matches played at Jenner Park have been European ties, domestic cup finals, major semi-finals and quarter-finals, [[FA Cup]] fixtures, televised matches, testimonials, high-scoring thrillers and friendlies against high-profile opposition.\n\nComprised initially of two wooden stands, popular bank terracing was added in 1923 and floodlights added in the [[1940s (decade)|1940s]], allowing Jenner Park to host Wales' first ever floodlit football match between Barry and [[Newport County FC|Newport]] in [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]].\n\nDuring the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]], the local council rebuilt [[Jenner Park]], installing a synthetic running track, a new all-seater stand and improved floodlights.\n\nIn order to bring [[Jenner Park]] up to [[UEFA]] standards, a second covered stand was built in the mid [[1990s (decade)|1990s]], boosting the [[seating capacity]] to 2,500. This was temporarily increased to 6,000+ for the visits of [[Aberdeen FC|Aberdeen]] and [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] with the use of temporary [[bleachers]].\n\nRecent years have seen the addition of a special viewing area for wheelchair users in the grandstand (known colloquially as the 'Old Stand'), accessible via the stadium's Devon Avenue entrance. Meanwhile, October 2015 saw work completed on a new, state-of-the-art [[3G pitch]], with its inaugural game, a [[Welsh Cup]] match against [[Aberdare Town F.C.|Aberdare Town]].\n\n==Current squad==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1 |pos=GK|nat=WAL|name=Mike Lewis|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=2 |pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Paul Morgan|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=3|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Chris Hugh|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=4|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Luke Cooper|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=5|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Curtis Watkins|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=6|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Robbie Patten|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=7|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=[[Kayne McLaggon]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=8|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Troy Greening|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=9|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Eli Phipps|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=10|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Jordan Cotterill|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=11|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Drew Fahiya|other=}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=12|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Luke Cummings|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=14|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=[[Jack Compton]]|other=}}\n{{fs_player|no=15|pos=MF|nat=SKN|name=[[Theo Wharton]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=16|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Jonathan Hood|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=17|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Keyon Reffell|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=24|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Callum Sainty|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=25|pos=GK|nat=WAL|name=Joe Baker|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=26|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Lewis Cosslett| (loaned)|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=29|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Clayton Green|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=33|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=[[Evan Press]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=39  |pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=[[David Cotterill]]|other=}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n\n===Technical staff===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are known for representing Wales in Europe as winners of the [[Cymru Premier]] and [[Welsh Cup]] during the 1990s and early 2000s and have also competed in England's [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and [[FA Cup]]. The team, which has contained more than 50 full internationals, is now run by supporters. They play at their traditional home of [[Jenner Park Stadium|Jenner Park]], Barry, which holds 3,500 spectators.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\n{{football squad on pitch|align = right\n| GK_nat  = WAL|  GK = Steel\n| RB_nat  = WAL|  RB = White\n| RCB_nat = WAL| RCB = Wightman\n| LCB_nat = WAL| LCB = Molyneux\n| LB_nat  = WAL|  LB = Thomas\n| RM_nat  = WAL|  RM = Greenaway\n| RCM_nat = WAL| RCM = Bates\n| LCM_nat = WAL| LCM = Woolridge\n| LM_nat  = WAL|  LM = McNaught\n| SS_nat  = WAL|  SS = Sheldon\n| CF_nat  = WAL|  CF = Isherwood\n| caption = First ever Barry XI at Jenner Park\n}}\nBarry Town United's history dates back to 1892 when an [[association football]] team named '''Barry and Cadoxton District''' was formed in the area. During the early years, this side endured many upheavals, playing on five different grounds under various identities, including '''Barry Unionist Athletic''', '''Barry United Athletic''' and '''Barry District'''. Players who featured during these years included [[Ted Vizard]] and [[Billy Jennings]]; who would each go on to play in the famous [[1923 FA Cup Final|\u2018White Horse\u2019 FA Cup Final]].\n [[File:The inaugural Barry team photo, taken in 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Barry AFC team photograph, featuring players/officials of 1913\u201314]]\nIn November 1912, a meeting at The Windsor [[public house]] in Holton Road saw townsfolk choose to pursue membership of the thriving [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] as '''Barry AFC''' (the 'Town' suffix was added after [[World War II]]). The club would secure land owned by the Jenner family and the people of the town came together to build [[Jenner Park]], ahead of the first match of the [[1912\u201313 in English football|1912\u201313 season]].\n\nOn 6 September 1913, Barry played their first ever fixture; a [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] match against [[Mid Rhondda F.C.|Mid-Rhondda]] at [[Jenner Park]]. The game attracted 4,000 spectators, including 1,000 travelling supporters.\n\nFittingly, the new team would register a surprise, albeit merited, victory, with Barry's Ralph Isherwood scoring the very first goal at [[Jenner Park]] just three minutes in. His second, midway through the second half, sealed a 2\u20131 victory, a fine start for the Barry side on, coincidentally, the same afternoon that [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] played their first ever match at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]].\n\nThe ensuing two seasons would see [[Stoke City]], [[Brentford FC|Brentford]], [[Coventry City]] and others visit the new ground. However, the [[World War I|Great War]] would soon interrupt any competitive proceedings; with Barry captain Major James Wightman one of the many casualties of [[The Battle of the Somme]].\n\n===Southern League success===\nThe [[1920\u201321 in English football|1920\u201321]] season ranks as one of the finest in Barry's history, as they surprised many by becoming champions of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]'s Welsh section. The achievement was all the more impressive when considering the small Barry squad played over 100 matches in all competitions during the course of the season. Competing simultaneously in both the Welsh and [[Western Football League|Western League]], the Barry board gave priority to Southern League fixtures, swayed by aspirations of joining the new [[League 2|English Third Division]].\n\nInspired by [[Stanley Cowie]], the title was clinched in early May, and yet hopes of Barry being able to move up to the [[Football League]] were scuppered just a month later, when their application failed and [[Charlton Athletic]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] (the latter of whom finished second to Barry in their section) were elected instead.\n\nBarry retained membership of the Southern League for more than 60 years \u2013 their highest finish being fourth in the 1930s. Among the notable players of the era were Johnny Gardner (with over 500 appearances), Dai Ward (scorer of more than 300 goals) and [[Fred Whitlow]] (a 100+ goal marksman). Meanwhile, Barry-born sportsman [[Ernie Carless]] combined his footballing exploits with a successful cricketing career with [[Glamorgan CCC|Glamorgan]].\n\n===FA Cup and Welsh Cup glory===\n{{football squad on pitch|align = right\n| GK_nat  = WAL|  GK = Morris\n| RB_nat  = WAL|  RB = Williams\n| RCB_nat = WAL| RCB = Lyske\n| LCB_nat = WAL| LCB = Bright\n| LB_nat  = WAL|  LB = Bellas\n| RM_nat  = WAL|  RM = Dyke\n| RCM_nat = WAL| RCM = Foxton\n| LCM_nat = WAL| LCM = Allen\n| LM_nat  = WAL|  LM = Niblett\n| SS_nat  = WAL|  SS = Goodfellow\n| CF_nat  = WAL|  CF = Cain\n| caption = 1955 Welsh Cup winning XI\n}}\nAt the end of the [[1920s (decade)|1920s]], a crowd of 6,000 at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] saw Barry beat [[Dagenham]] 1\u20130 to progress to the [[FA Cup]] 2nd Round; before losing to [[Brighton & Hove Albion]] ten days later. It proved to be their most successful run in the competition. Barry would reach the 1st Round again in [[1934\u201335 FA Cup|1934\u201335]], losing 1\u20130 to [[Northampton Town]] at Jenner Park, but the build-up to the match was tainted by a fire that ravaged the grandstand.\n\nFootball again took a backseat in 1939, with the eruption of World War II . Barry's Chris Mason would be captured as a [[prisoner of war]] during the conflict, though would return to Jenner Park to resume his career afterwards; entertaining spectators thrilled by the adventures of players such as [[Derek Tapscott]] (who would later sign for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]), celebrated striker [[Stan Richards (footballer)|Stan Richards]] and Gwilym 'Cannonball' Cain.\n\nIn the [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]] season, Jenner Park became one of the first grounds in the country to introduce [[floodlights]], with [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Cardiff City]] all visiting to showcase the facilities. Two seasons later, an all-Welsh showdown in the FA Cup 1st Round saw Barry beaten by Newport, 4\u20130. Nevertheless, the town's most celebrated footballing achievement was right around the corner.\n\nIn May 1955, following a 1\u20131 draw at [[the Racecourse]] in [[Wrexham]], Barry beat [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] 4\u20133 at [[Ninian Park]] to lift the Welsh Cup for the first time. Former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] right-wing Charlie Dyke scored the winner, a dramatic late free-kick to take the cup back to Barry.\n\n===1960s, 1970s and 1980s===\nIn the late [[1950s (decade)|1950s]], a host of [[Scandinavia]]n stars made their way to Jenner Park, and dazzled Barry football enthusiasts with their skill. Among their number were [[Finland]]\u2019s Hannu Kankkonen and [[Bengt Berndtsson|Bengt \u2018Folet\u2019 Berndtsson]]; a member of the [[Sweden football team|Sweden]] squad that reached the final of the [[1958 World Cup]]. The influx of players from continental [[Europe]] came as a result of chairman John Bailey's business interests overseas.\n\nDuring this period, the club embarked on an overseas tour, playing three games in [[Malta]] in 1960 against [[Sliema Wanderers]], [[Hibernians FC|Hibernians]] and [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]] that all ended in draws.\n\n1961 saw another big match as [[QPR]] visited Jenner Park in the FA Cup. A crowd of 7,000 saw [[Laurie Sheffield]]\u2019s opener for Barry cancelled out late on. QPR would win the replay at [[Loftus Road]] comfortably. The [[1960s (decade)|1960s]] and [[1970s (decade)|70s]] are perhaps most fondly remembered for the personalities that pulled on the Barry shirt. Among them, prolific goalscorers Ken Gully and Clive Ayres, brothers John and Dickie Batt, long-serving Bobby Smith and [[Ashley Griffiths]], and tall defender Mike Cosslett; now a member of the club coaching staff.\n\nIn 1982, Barry would leave the Southern League, focusing on Welsh League competition and winning six Welsh League titles before the decade's end; thanks in no small part to the goals of striker Steve Williams. The most significant match of the decade though came on 17 November 1984, as 3,850 crammed into Jenner Park to see Barry vs [[Reading FC|Reading]] in the FA Cup 1st Round. Despite Ian Love's goal, an injury-time winner by [[Trevor Senior]] was enough to send the Royals through.\n\n===Exile and return===\n[[File:Barri in Worcester, 1992-93.jpg|thumb|right|Barri in Worcester, 1992\u201393]]\nAfter insufficient floodlighting had stopped the club being able to compete in the Southern League for most of the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]], the tail end of the decade saw the necessary ground improvements to support a return to England. Barry entered the league's Midland Division and would consistently finish in the top six, yet were denied the opportunity to field a reserve XI in the Welsh League as they had done previously.\n\nThe creation of the [[League of Wales]] (now [[Cymru Premier]]) in 1992 then prompted a decree that Barry would no longer be able to compete in the [[English football pyramid|English pyramid]] at all while based on Welsh soil. As part of a group of rebel clubs known as the [[1992\u201393 League of Wales|Irate Eight]] (alongside [[Newport County AFC|Newport]], [[Merthyr Tydfil FC|Merthyr]], [[Colwyn Bay FC|Colwyn Bay]], [[Bangor City]], [[Caernarfon Town]], [[Newtown AFC|Newtown]] and [[Rhyl FC|Rhyl]]), the Town were forced into exile; with the first team adopting the name of '''Barri AFC''' and playing 'home' matches out of [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]]\u2019s ground, while the reserves (by now, a local league outfit), manned the Jenner Park fort. However, this arrangement would last only one season, as chairman O\u2019 Halloran performed a shock u-turn that saw the Barry first team return home; eventually accepted into [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League Division One]] for the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] campaign.\n\n===Decade of dominance===\n[[File:Barry in Lithuania in the summer of 1994.jpg|thumb|left|Barry (in yellow) in action in [[Lithuania]] in the summer of 1994]]\nBarry's return to Jenner Park would spark the side's most successful period, as they earned immediate promotion to the top flight and a unique quadruple of [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League]] championship, [[Welsh League Cup]], [[FAW Trophy]] and [[Welsh Cup]] (for the first time since 1955).\n\nThe latter was one of the Town's most famous achievements, as they upset [[Football League Second Division]] outfit [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in front of 16,000 spectators at the old [[Cardiff Arms Park|National Stadium]]. Barry's reward for winning the [[Welsh Cup]] was a [[European Cup Winners Cup]] tie against [[FK Zalgiris Vilnius|\u017dalgiris Vilnius]] of [[Lithuania]], but they crashed out 7\u20130 on aggregate. Greater glory was on the horizon.\n\nAfter one season in the [[League of Wales]], Barry opted to become the league's first fully professional club and, thereafter, won their first league championship in [[1995\u201396 League of Wales|1995\u201396]]. The season was though marred by the deaths of chairman Neil O' Halloran and young midfielder Matthew Holtham, the latter in a [[motorway]] accident on the way back from an away match in April.\n\n1996 saw the club create history as the first [[League of Wales]] side to progress beyond the opening round of a European competition.\n\nFollowing victory in [[Latvia]] over [[Dinaburg FC|Dinaburg]], Barry ousted [[Hungary|Hungarian]] side [[BVSC Budapest|Budapest Vasutas]] in one of several epic European nights at [[Jenner Park]]. Despite trailing 3\u20131 from the away leg, Barry stormed to a victory in the return match by the same score-line, and then won a penalty shoot-out 4\u20132.\n\nA memorable all-British tie with [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] was their reward and, after losing 3\u20131 to [[Roy Aitken]]'s side at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]], the Welshmen were held to a pulsating 3\u20133 draw at a rain-swept [[Jenner Park]]; exiting the cup in thrilling fashion before a crowd of over 6,000. [[File:Barry of 1999 with League of Wales Cup, FAW Premier Cup and Welsh Premier trophy.jpg|thumb|The Barry squad of 1999 at Jenner Park, with the League of Wales Cup, FAW Premier Cup and Cymru Premier trophies.]]\n\nOn the domestic scene, Barry were all-conquering, clinching a first treble of [[League of Wales]] championship, [[Welsh League Cup]] and [[Welsh Cup]]. The championship was claimed with a record 105 points and a goal difference of more than +100. In January 1997, the team was part of the first [[League of Wales]] match to be broadcast live on television; a 5\u20132 win over visitors [[Caernarfon Town]] that still holds the league's attendance record. Then, from March, Barry went 51 matches without tasting a single defeat in a league fixture.\n\n1999 saw Barry become the first [[League of Wales]] team to win the [[FAW Premier Cup]], with a 2\u20131 win over [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] at the club's own [[Racecourse Ground]]. Pipped to the title in 2000 by the emerging [[The New Saints F.C.|TNS]], Barry would regain their crown the following campaign, while European battles with the likes of [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] saw players of the highest calibre grace Jenner Park (among them, the likes of [[Andriy Shevchenko]] and [[Sergei Rebrov]].)\n\nThen, in the [[2001\u201302 UEFA Champions League|2001\u201302]] season, Barry notably became the first [[League of Wales]] team to win a European [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] tie, when they defeated the [[Azerbaijan]] champions [[FC Shamkir]] to set up a tie with Portuguese club [[FC Porto]]. Barry lost the first leg in [[Portugal]] by an emphatic 8\u20130 margin, after conceding two early penalties in front of a partisan 55,000 crowd. However, the Town would win the home leg 3\u20131, recording a famous result that has grown in legend with the career success of Porto's [[Ricardo Carvalho]], [[Helder Postiga]] and others.\n\n===Decline and turmoil===\nThe golden era would not last forever, and the continual challenge of securing enough prize money to sustain their high standards set would eventually catch up with those running the club. After chairperson and backer Paula O' Halloran stood aside, former [[Scarborough FC|Scarborough]] and [[Grantham Town FC|Grantham Town]] official Kevin Green came in as the club's new [[Chief Executive]]; yet his varying initiatives failed to stop the rot. In one move that garnered significant press, Green would recruit ex-footballer and celebrity [[John Fashanu]] as the club's high-profile chairman in the winter of 2002. Some saw Fashanu as the missing piece of the puzzle, and the man who would help sustain Barry's success going forward. Promising [[Africa]]n and [[China|Chinese]] TV deals and an influx of [[Nigeria]]n internationals, Fashanu made headlines, yet did little to steady a Barry ship in increasingly rough seas. Then, after success on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] reality show [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Series 2 .282003.29|I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!]] saw him attain new-found popularity, Fashanu left the club; which by now was in a perilous financial state.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the club went into administration and the professional squad would quickly disintegrate. An interim management team was appointed, together with an amateur squad drawn primarily from local side N & M Construction of the [[South Wales Amateur League]] (five levels below the Welsh Premier). Within a month, Barry had gone from winning a match in Europe to losing 8\u20130 at [[Caernarfon Town]]. Though the professional-era bubble had well and truly burst, fans set about raising money to help keep the club alive. Eventually, mystery man Stuart Lovering arrived to purchase of the club on 10 December 2003. Few could have foreseen what was to come.\n\n[[2003\u201304 Welsh Premier League|2003\u201304]] was a difficult season, with champions Barry's first league win not coming until February 2004 when they beat fellow strugglers [[Welshpool Town F.C.|Welshpool Town]] 5\u20134 with a 98th-minute winning penalty from youngster Luke Sherbon. Manager [[Colin Addison]] was brought in resuscitate the team's ailing fortunes, yet the Dragons still ended up bottom of the division, four points off safety, and were relegated to the [[Welsh Football League Division One|Welsh League Division One]]. Controversially, Addison was dismissed by Lovering on the eve of the new campaign, with assistant [[David Hughes (footballer born 1978)|David Hughes]] replacing him; only to leave himself months later on finding his budget slashed. In the meantime, an independent [[Valuation Office Agency|district valuer]] had determined that the club should pay \u00a342,000 in rent and rates each season for the remainder of the lease. Judging the figure to be unfairly based on the club's relinquished professional status, Lovering refused to pay this amount and instead moved the senior side to the White Tips Stadium in [[Treforest]] from January 2005 to May 2006. During the absence, a number of staunch supporters formed breakaway club '''Barry FC'''; the culmination of a series of disputes with chairman Lovering, who had banned them from fundraising at club. With the Town relegated to their lowest-ever league status at the end of the [[2005\u201306 in Welsh football|2005\u201306]] season, the future appeared bleak for this fallen giant of Welsh football.\n\n===Fan-led fightback===\nWhile chaos reigned off the field for much of the decade, the roots of recovery began to grow in 2007, with the appointment of new manager Gavin Chesterfield. Chesterfield led Barry to promotion in 2008, with the hope that a winning run of form in the second tier would see the club's dwindling support return. After stumbling early on, Barry enjoyed a 21-match unbeaten streak and finished the season a credible third. Nevertheless, the team's achievements were continually overshadowed by events behind the scenes.\n\nIn December 2008, a crisis meeting at Jenner Park saw supporters come forward to pledge their commitment to operating the first team (forming a new company for this purpose), to allow Lovering to focus on finding a buyer. In one of a number of close calls, the club appeared on the verge of being sold in 2010, when businessman Clayton Jones appeared to strike a deal. However, this fell through at the eleventh hour, scuppering a plan to bring in [[Wales]] international [[John Hartson]] as [[Director of Football]].\n\nUndeterred, 2010 saw the '''Stand Up For Barry''' campaign launch, utilising new [[social media]] platforms such as [[Twitter]] to spread news of the club's plight with a wider online audience. The resulting support from across the football community proved an invaluable asset as supporters strived to keep the club alive.\n\nShortly after the close of the 2010\u201311 season, Lovering announced his fresh intent of withdrawing the first team from higher league competition. To prevent this, the '''Barry Town Supporters' Committee''' (BTSC) took complete control of all football and its funding; resulting in what became known to some supporters as the 'DIY Football' era. In the months that followed, the rejuvenated, fan-run Barry set-up enjoyed their most successful [[Welsh Cup]] campaign in several seasons; defeating rivals [[Merthyr Town]] at [[Penydarren Park]] and winning at [[Haverfordwest County]] in extra-time, before being edged out 3\u20132 at [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]].\n\n[[File:Barry fans and players celebrate 2013 Welsh Cup success in Flint.jpg|thumb|left|A TV cameraman records Barry fans and players celebrating after their Welsh Cup Quarter Final win at [[Flint Town United]] on 2 March 2013.]]\n\n2012 marked the 100th anniversary of the club's [[wikt:formation|formation]], with a series of events lined up to mark this and the subsequent centenary season. To launch the festivities, the BTSC hosted [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in an August fundraising friendly attended by 2,000 spectators. However, Lovering's threats to withdraw Barry from the [[Welsh Football League]] would intensify in the weeks prior, threatening to cast a cloud over these celebrations. Nevertheless, the BTSC held a successful '100 Years of Barry Town' event at the [[Angel Hotel, Cardiff|Angel Hotel]] (attended by many past and present players), before the current team beat Welsh League champions [[Cambrian & Clydach Vale B. & G.C.|Cambrian and Clydach]] on the 100th anniversary itself.\n\nIn March 2013, following wins against [[Caerleon FC|Caerleon]], [[Penrhyncoch F.C.|Penrhyncoch]], [[Ely Rangers]] and [[Pontardawe Town F.C.|Pontardawe Town]], Barry won 2\u20130 at [[Flint Town United]] to progress to the [[2012\u201313 Welsh Cup|Welsh Cup]] semi-final for the first time in a decade. Eventually, the team narrowly lost 1\u20132 to eventual winners [[Prestatyn Town]], marking the first ever appearance of a fully amateur Barry side at the Welsh Cup semi-final stage.\n\n===Survival and resurgence===\nOn 7 May 2013, Lovering withdrew the senior team from the [[Welsh Football League]], against the will of the BTSC, players and supporters; who were ready, willing and able to fulfill the remaining two league fixtures (both against [[Ton Pentre FC|Ton Pentre]]). Rejecting this perceived act of sabotage, those running the football outlined their intentions to continue as they were, adopting the '''Barry Town United''' suffix to emphasise their continuing unity and endeavour. However, a meeting of the [[Football Association of Wales|FAW]] Council in [[Betws-y-Coed]] in June 2013 announced that the Barry side would have to play \"recreational football\" henceforth; a declaration that prompted significant outcry, both locally and further afield.\n[[File:Maesmawr Hall, Caersws.jpg|thumb|Barry at [[Maesmawr Hall]] before [[Welsh Cup]] Semi-final in [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]].]]\nThere appeared hope for beleaguered Barry as second meeting was arranged for July 2013 at [[Maesmawr Hall]] in [[Caersws]] to hear new evidence as why the team should be able to continue on. At this second gathering, 15 of the FAW Councillors voted against discussing Barry's future, thus concluding the meeting in no more than five minutes and at considerable expense. Notably, it emerged that this decision went against the recommendations of the FAW's own Domestic Committee and legal team.\n\nWith their immediate and long-term future unclear, Barry began their pre-season with wins at [[Moreton-in-Marsh|Moreton]] and [[Elmore, Gloucestershire|Elmore]] that same month, followed by a narrow 3\u20132 loss to [[Premier League]] newcomers [[Cardiff City]], watched by a home crowd of 1,650 supporters on Saturday 27 July. Remarkably, given the bizarre set of circumstances, Barry had led 2\u20131 at half-time.\n\nEventually, a [[High Court]] judge in Cardiff ruled in Barry's favour; stating that the FAW Council had acted unlawfully in denying them their licence to play Welsh League football. As a result, the fan-run Town side was entered back into the structure.\n\nIn the years that have followed, Barry would win two consecutive league titles, reclaiming their place in the second tier, while continuing to develop as a club, on and off the pitch. Today, the club competes at senior, development, youth and junior levels, along with various ladies' teams and pan disability sides in the over and under-16 age groups. In the 2016\u201317 season, the first team reached the final of [[Welsh League Cup]] for the first time since 2001, becoming only the second side from outside the national top flight to achieve this feat since the competition was expanded several years prior. In April 2017, the club secured its return to the [[Cymru Premier|Welsh Premier]] as champions of the [[Welsh Football League]], continuing this remarkable revival.\n\nOn Saturday 6 April 2019, a remarkable 5-2 victory away at Bala Town, coupled with a 6-0 win for The New Saints away against Newtown, ensured Barry Town United would finish at least third in the 2018-19 JD Cymru Premier and qualification for the preliminary round of the UEFA Europa League. This marked a remarkable transformation for the club, qualifying for European competition for the first time since winning the JD Cymru Premier in the 2002-03 season.\n\n==Colours==\nFor many decades, Barry wore green as their primary colour \u2013 thought to be due to officials securing the club's first kit from [[Plymouth Argyle]]. On exile in 1992, Barri adopted a red and white strip, which would remain with them on their return to the Welsh pyramid. It was the following season that the club adopted its yellow change kit (deemed lucky for the success it brought in [[Welsh Cup]] competition) as a home strip \u2013 and it is this colour that has become synonymous with Town football, with variations including uses of blue.\n\nTwo of the club's most memorable home strips are the [[fluorescent]] lime and navy ordered in error in 2006, and the experimental [[claret]] and blue kit worn in the early 1970s \u2013 both of which saw the club simultaneously plummet in footballing fortune. Nowadays, the club tends to wear yellow at home and green on the road.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = _green_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripeonright\n| pattern_ra = _green_stripes\n| leftarm    = \n| body       = 339933\n| rightarm   = \n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 339933\n| alt        = \n| title      = Example of a traditional Linnets green strip, worn with longevity.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = \n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 3399FF\n| body       = 7F1734\n| rightarm   = 3399FF\n| shorts     = \n| pattern_so = \n| socks      = 7F1734\n| alt        = \n| title      = Claret and blue strip, worn for a single disastrous season (1971\u201372).\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _vneckwhite\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 339933\n| body       = 339933\n| rightarm   = 339933\n| shorts     = 3333CC\n| socks      = 339933\n| alt        = \n| title      = Green and blue strip, colour co-ordinated with Jenner Park seating.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FF0033\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FF0033\n| socks      = FF0033\n| alt        = \n| title      = Red and white strip, worn in exile and upon return to the Welsh pyramid.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _bluebuttoncollar\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = FFFF33\n| body       = FFFF33\n| rightarm   = FFFF33\n| shorts     = FFFF33\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_blue\n| socks      = FFFF33\n| alt        = \n| title      = Welsh Cup Final strip of 1994, worn in famous win over [[Cardiff City]].\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = _yellowborder\n| pattern_b  = _collarblue\n| pattern_ra = _yellowborder\n| leftarm    = 3333CC\n| body       = FFFF33\n| rightarm   = 3333CC\n| shorts     = 3333CC\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_yellow\n| socks      = 3333CC\n| alt        = \n| title      = League of Wales strip, adopted from cup kit, associated with 1990s success.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _Safasc_Away\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 99FF00\n| body       = 99FF00\n| rightarm   = 99FF00\n| shorts     = 330033\n| pattern_so = \n| socks      = 330033\n| alt        = \n| title      = Fluorescent lime strip, worn in post-Millennium descent to lowest status.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Jenner Park Stadium}}\n\n[[File:Jenner Park - Barry.jpg|thumb|Jenner Park Stadium, Barry]]\n\n[[Jenner Park Stadium|Jenner Park]] occupies the space of land between Gladstone Road and Barry Road in central [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] and has been the setting for the evolution of Barry's senior football club for more than 100 years.\n\nNamed after the Jenner family who had gifted the land, the ground was built by the Barry football enthusiasts for their representative side to compete at the highest possible level and was completed between the landmark meeting of 1912 and the opening fixture of [[1913\u201314 in English football|1913\u201314]].\n\nAmong the most notable Barry matches played at Jenner Park have been European ties, domestic cup finals, major semi-finals and quarter-finals, [[FA Cup]] fixtures, televised matches, testimonials, high-scoring thrillers and friendlies against high-profile opposition.\n\nComprised initially of two wooden stands, popular bank terracing was added in 1923 and floodlights added in the [[1940s (decade)|1940s]], allowing Jenner Park to host Wales' first ever floodlit football match between Barry and [[Newport County FC|Newport]] in [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]].\n\nDuring the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]], the local council rebuilt [[Jenner Park]], installing a synthetic running track, a new all-seater stand and improved floodlights.\n\nIn order to bring [[Jenner Park]] up to [[UEFA]] standards, a second covered stand was built in the mid [[1990s (decade)|1990s]], boosting the [[seating capacity]] to 2,500. This was temporarily increased to 6,000+ for the visits of [[Aberdeen FC|Aberdeen]] and [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] with the use of temporary [[bleachers]].\n\nRecent years have seen the addition of a special viewing area for wheelchair users in the grandstand (known colloquially as the 'Old Stand'), accessible via the stadium's Devon Avenue entrance. Meanwhile, October 2015 saw work completed on a new, state-of-the-art [[3G pitch]], with its inaugural game, a [[Welsh Cup]] match against [[Aberdare Town F.C.|Aberdare Town]].\n\n==Current squad==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1 |pos=GK|nat=WAL|name=Mike Lewis|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=2 |pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Paul Morgan|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=3|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Chris Hugh|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=4|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Luke Cooper|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=5|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Curtis Watkins|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=6|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Robbie Patten|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=7|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=[[Kayne McLaggon]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=8|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Troy Greening|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=9|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Eli Phipps|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=10|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Jordan Cotterill|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=11|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Drew Fahiya|other=}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=12|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Luke Cummings|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=14|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=[[Jack Compton]]|other=}}\n{{fs_player|no=15|pos=MF|nat=SKN|name=[[Theo Wharton]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=16|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Jonathan Hood|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=17|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Keyon Reffell|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=24|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Callum Sainty|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=25|pos=GK|nat=WAL|name=Joe Baker|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=26|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Lewis Cosslett| (loaned)|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=29|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Clayton Green|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=33|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=[[Evan Press]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=39  |pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=[[David Cotterill]]|other=}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n\n===Technical staff===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
