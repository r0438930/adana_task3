The stories partly focus on his pride in his ship, \"the smertest boat in the tred\" which he considers to be of a class with the [[Clyde steamer]]s<!--diesels came rather later than the stories, surely? and his outrage at the suggestion [[diesel]]-engined vessels are in any way superior-->, but mainly tell of the \u201chigh jinks\u201d the crew get up to on their travels. He had at least one [[fictional crossovers|crossover]] with Munro's other popular character, Erchie MacPherson of ''Erchie, My Droll Friend''. The name is an anglicisation of \"Para Shandaidh\", which means \"Peter (Paraig) son of Sandy\", and he is content to describe himself as \"Chust wan of Brutain's hardy sons\".\n\nThe other principal characters who form the crew of the ''Vital Spark'' are:\n* the subtly effete engineer Dan Macphail,  \n* the superstitious ship\u2019s mate Dougie (one inconsistency in the stories is that Dougie the mate has the choice of two surnames, Cameron or Campbell), \n* the lazy deckhand known as The Tar (real name Colin Turner) and \n* the young squeezebox-playing deck hand Sunny Jim (real name Davie Green), who is cousin to The Tar and replaces him. \n\nAlso featured is Hurricane Jack (real name John Maclachlan), Para Handy\u2019s rather more outrageous adventurer friend. \n\nKey points of friction among the crew are transporting ministers of the church (bad luck), transporting gravestones (bad luck), the small boats carrying passengers across the Clyde in Glasgow called the [[Clutha ferry|Cluthas]] (in Para Handy\u2019s view, the lowest of the low in Clyde shipping), and Macphail\u2019s taste for bodice-ripping women\u2019s fiction.\n\n==Stories==\n\nThe stories are set in the Firth of Clyde, Loch Fyne and occasionally the Western Isles of Scotland.  The stories are known for their humour and also for their evocation of a lost era in the life of these coastal communities when they depended completely on the water and not, as now, on road transport and the ferry service. This was a time when [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] was still spoken by some as their native language and everyone in the community was known to all, for good or ill. The church (the [[kirk]]) was much more significant in community life and a lot of humour in the stories is derived from scriptural misquotations, which contemporary readers, with their thorough knowledge of the Bible, would have understood. Reference is also made to schisms in the kirk, with the same humour, which could sting those who were over-serious in defence of their splinter denomination.\n\nThe stories give an insight into the life and attitudes of the Firth of Clyde, its sea lochs and the city of Glasgow. They were written as occasional pieces in the \"Looker On\" column in the \"Glasgow Evening News\" and were designed to be recognisable to Glaswegians with Highland backgrounds and also those who were city-bred but regularly escaped the smoke to go \"doon the watter\" to the Clyde resorts of Rothesay, Millport, Dunoon and Tighnabruaich. The ''Vital Spark'' also makes it to [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] and [[Loch Fyne]], which were more adventurous destinations but also accessible to city dwellers by the railway steamers that Para Handy often envies. Some of the stories were written during the [[First World War]] and give insight into the home front of the time, casting it always in a humorous light. \n\n==Published collections==\nThe stories remain perennially popular and have been regularly reprinted since their first appearance. There are various miscellaneous collections, but the main ones are the three overseen by Munro himself and several more latterday ones.\n* ''The Collected Stories from The Vital Spark'' (1906)\n* ''In Highland Harbours with Para Handy'' (1911)\n* ''Hurricane Jack of The Vital Spark'' (1923)\n\nAll three of these collections have been gathered together and reissued in single volumes:\n* ''Neil Munro's Para Handy'' (Seanachaidh, 1986)\n* ''The World of Para Handy'' (Seanachaidh, 1990)\n\nThe ''Para Handy Complete Edition'' ([[Birlinn (publisher)|Berlinn]], 1992), introduced and annotated by Brian D. Osborne and Ronald Armstrong, contains 18 previously uncollected stories in addition to those above. In 2001 another story was rediscovered and has been included in all subsequent reprints.\n\n==Film==\nThe Para Handy stories were the inspiration for the 1954 [[Ealing comedies|Ealing comedy]], ''[[The Maggie]]'' (retitled ''High and Dry'' in the US), directed by [[Alexander Mackendrick]].\n\n==Television==\nThere have been three television adaptations of the Para Handy tales, all for the BBC:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"220\" | Character !! width=\"195\" | [[Para Handy - Master Mariner]]<br />(1959, in black & white) !! width=\"215\" | [[The Vital Spark]]<br />(1965-6 in b&w/1973-74 in colour) !! width=\"195\" | [[The Tales of Para Handy]]<br />(1994\u201395) \n|-\n| [[Peter 'Para Handy' Macfarlane]] || [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan MacRae]] || [[Roddy McMillan]] || [[Gregor Fisher]]\n|-\n| [[Dan MacPhail]] || [[John Grieve (actor)|John Grieve]] || John Grieve || [[Rikki Fulton]]\n|-\n| [[Dougie the Mate]] || Roddy McMillan || [[Walter Carr (actor)|Walter Carr]] || [[Sean Scanlan]]\n|-\n| [[Davie 'Sunny Jim' Green]] || [[Angus Lennie]] || [[Alex McAvoy]] || [[Andrew Fairlie (actor)|Andrew Fairlie]]\n|}\n\nThe earlier series updated the stories by giving them contemporary settings.
