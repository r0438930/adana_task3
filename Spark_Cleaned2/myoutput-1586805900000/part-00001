There exist 34&nbsp;naturally occurring nuclei that are believed to undergo double electron capture, but the process has been confirmed by observation in the decay of only three isotopes: [[krypton-78]], [[barium-130]], and [[xenon-124]].{{NUBASE2016|ref}}\n\nOne reason is that the probability of double electron capture is stupendously small; the theoretical predictions of [[half-life|half-lives]] for this mode lie well above 10{{sup|20}}&nbsp;years. A second reason is that the only detectable particles created in this process are [[X-ray]]s and [[Auger electron]]s that are emitted by the excited atomic shell. In the range of their energies (~1\u201310&nbsp;[[keV]]), the background is usually high. Thus, the experimental detection of double electron capture is more difficult than that for [[double beta decay]].\n\nDouble electron capture can be accompanied by the excitation of the daughter nucleus. Its de-excitation, in turn, is accompanied by an emission of photons with energies of hundreds of keV.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Modes with positron emission ==\nIf the mass difference between the mother and daughter atoms is more than two masses of an electron (1.022&nbsp;[[MeV]]), the energy released in the process is enough to allow another mode of decay, called '''electron capture with positron emission'''. It occurs along with double electron capture, their [[branching ratio]] depending on nuclear properties.\n\nWhen the mass difference is more than four electron masses (2.044&nbsp;MeV), the third mode, called '''[[double positron decay]]''', is allowed. Only six naturally occurring nuclides{{which|date=May 2018}} can decay via these three modes simultaneously.\n\n== Neutrinoless double electron capture ==\nThe above-described process with the capture of two electrons and emission of two neutrinos (two-neutrino double electron capture) is allowed by the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]: No conservation laws (including [[lepton number]] conservation) are violated. However, if the lepton number is not conserved, or the [[neutrino]] is [[Majorana fermion|its own antiparticle]], another kind of process can occur: the so-called neutrinoless double electron capture. In this case, two electrons are captured by nucleus, but neutrinos are not emitted.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=223 |issue=1 |date=1985-08-15 |df=dmy-all |pages=15\u201328 |title=Neutrinoless double electron capture as a tool to measure the electron neutrino mass |author1=Bernabeu, J. |author2=de&nbsp;Rujula, A. |author3=Jarlskog, C. |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(83)90089-5 |bibcode=1983NuPhB.223...15B|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/143368/files/198303194.pdf }}</ref> The energy released in this process is carried away by an internal [[bremsstrahlung]] [[gamma rays|gamma quantum]].\n\nExample:\n:{| border=\"0\"\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|{{nuclide|link=yes|barium|130}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||2&nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Electron}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|xenon|130}}\n|}\n\nThis mode of decay has never been observed experimentally, and would contradict the [[Standard Model]] if it were observed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Double beta decay]]\n*[[Beta decay]]\n*[[Neutrino]]\n*[[Particle radiation]]\n*[[Radioactive isotope]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite journal |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/dark-matter-detector-identifies-extraordinarily-rare-radioactive-decay/ |title=Radioactivity detected from a half-life of once every trillion universes |date=April 2019 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |department=Science |doi=10.1038/s41586-019-1124-4|arxiv=1904.11002 }}\n\n{{Nuclear_processes}}\n\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Radioactivity]]\n", "text_old": "{{Nuclear physics|cTopic=Capturing processes}}\n'''Double electron capture''' is a [[decay mode]] of an [[atomic nucleus]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik A |year=1994 |volume=347 |issue=3 |pages=151\u2013160 |author1=Hirsch, M. |display-authors=etal |title=Nuclear structure calculation of \u03b2<sup>+</sup>\u03b2<sup>+</sup>, \u03b2<sup>+</sup>/EC and EC/EC decay matrix elements |doi=10.1007/BF01292371|bibcode=1994ZPhyA.347..151H }}</ref> For a nuclide (''A'', ''Z'') with number of [[nucleon]]s ''A'' and [[atomic number]] ''Z'', double electron capture is only possible if the mass of the nuclide of (''A'', ''Z''\u22122) is lower.\n\nIn this mode of decay, two of the orbital [[electron]]s are captured via the [[weak interaction]] by two [[proton]]s in the nucleus, forming two [[neutron]]s.
