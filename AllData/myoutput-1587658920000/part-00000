The most recent renovations were completed just before the 2008\u20132009 term, and included the addition of 2 science classrooms. The school currently has Missouri A+ designation, and is MSIP Accredited.\n\n==History==\n\"In 1903, Raytown's first high school, located on the corner of 63rd street and Raytown Road, was housed in a wood frame store, where parents paid four dollars a month for 25 children to attend the one-teacher school. In 1907 the first school graduated 12 students.\nIn 1906 Consolidated District #2 (first created in 1903) was reorganized under the Buford Act, consolidating 8 independent rural schools districts: Bennington, Central, Chapel, Lane, Parkview, Raytown, Spring Valley, and Stormy Point. By 1948 these 8 schools were consolidated into 3: Blue Ridge, Chapel, and Raytown.\nIn 1914 a combination high school and grade school was built at 63rd and Raytown Road, and in 1927 the construction of the original section of the present Raytown High School was completed. In 1939 the W.P.A. helped add the south wing, which was followed by the north wing addition in 1950. In November 1944 floodlights were added to the athletic field, and it was then dedicated as a Memorial field to honor the 21 graduated who died in World War II. Construction on the north wing and the band room followed in 1967. The last renovation took place in 1992\u20131994. In the fall of 2004 the Physical Education locker room renovations were completed.\nRaytown High School's outstanding reputation for excellence in academics and extra-curricular activities earned it admission to the North Central Association of Secondary Schools and colleges in 1946, and in 1951 the state awarded Raytown High School its AAA classification.\" This is taken from the Raytown High School Handbook located at the Raytown Quality Schools Online Site. <ref>http://www.raytown.k12.mo.us/</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|date=February 2019}}\n*[[Bobbi Johnson|Bobbi Johnson Kauffman]], 1963 graduate; Miss USA 1964.\n*[[Jason Belser]], 1988 graduate; Selected by the [[Indianapolis Colts]] as the 197th overall pick of the 1992 NFL draft (first pick, 8th round).
