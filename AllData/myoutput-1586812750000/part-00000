Although the platform of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] was used to underpin the new Scirocco, almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a new styling (penned by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]) which was sleeker and sportier than that of the Golf. The Scirocco debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1973|1973 Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/10-revolutionary-geneva-motor-show-debuts-of-the-last-50-years|title=10 revolutionary Geneva Motor Show debuts in the last 50 years|last=Prince|first=Max|date=2014-02-28|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nLaunched six months before the Golf, in order to resolve any teething troubles before production of the high volume hatchback started,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sciroccoregisterforum.co.uk/index.php?p=1_5_Scirocco-Timeline |title=Scirocco Timeline |publisher=Sciroccoregisterforum.co.uk |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> the Scirocco went on sale in Europe in 1974 and in North America in 1975. Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.\n\nThe design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo \u2013 Das Auto, das es nie gab \u2013 Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]\nThe '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coup\u00e9 icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> \nIts high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs.

In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.\n \nThe car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage f\u00fcr VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  \n\nThere were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.\n\n===North America===\nThe 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years. The 1975 models are 1.5&nbsp;L (1471&nbsp;cc), followed by a larger 1.6 with {{convert|76|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1976 and 1977.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Four Sports Coupes | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January\u2013February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 31 }}</ref> For 1978 Volkswagen reverted to a short-stroke 1.5 (now of 1457&nbsp;cc), stating that this made meeting emissions requirements easier.

One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined \"<small>SCIROCCO</small>\" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.\n[[File:VW Scirocco II rear 20070518.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, late Scirocco GTX (Germany)]]\n\nHalfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second \"transfer\" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986.

Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.\n\nScirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.\n\nThe Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.\n\n===North America===\nSpecifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models.

Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.\n\nThe design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo \u2013 Das Auto, das es nie gab \u2013 Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]\nThe '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coup\u00e9 icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> \nIts high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs.

In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.\n \nThe car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage f\u00fcr VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  \n\nThere were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.\n\n===North America===\nThe 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years.

Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986. Displacements ranged from 1.3 liters up to 1.8 liters. Power ranged from 44&nbsp;kW (60&nbsp;PS) to 82&nbsp;kW (112&nbsp;PS) for the 8-valve engines and either 95&nbsp;kW (129&nbsp;PS) or 102&nbsp;kW (139&nbsp;PS) for the 16-valve engines.<ref>{{citation | last = B\u00f6hler | first = Claudia | title = Scirocco: Aufregend vern\u00fcnftig.

Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.\n\nScirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.\n\nThe Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.\n\n===North America===\nSpecifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|Mk3|13}}Third generation (2008\u20132017)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = VW Scirocco III 2.0 TSI DSG Collectors Edition 54 von 100 Oryxwei\u00df.JPG\n| production = 2008\u20132017\n| assembly = Portugal: [[Palmela]] ([[AutoEuropa]])\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]]\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|Volkswagen Group A5 platform]]\n| engine = 1.4 L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] ([[Petrol engine|petrol]])<br />2.0 L I4 (petrol)<br />2.0 L I4 ([[Diesel engine|diesel]])\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] ([[Direct-Shift Gearbox|DSG]])<br />7-speed automatic (DSG)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2578|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4256|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1810|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1404|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|2862|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}-{{convert|1450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]]<br />[[Volkswagen Eos]]<br />[[SEAT Le\u00f3n]] Mk2\n| predecessor = [[Volkswagen Corrado]]\n| designer = [[Walter de Silva]]<br />Marc Lichte\n}}\n\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco 2008 67 (8451971989).jpg|thumbnail|left|Pre-facelift Scirocco (Europe)]]\nVolkswagen officially announced in June 2006 production of a new Scirocco model at the [[AutoEuropa]] assembly plant in [[Palmela]], Portugal.<ref name=\"announcement\">{{\ncite news\n|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/Unternehmen/Industrie/pshb/fn/relhbi/sfn/buildhbi/cn/GoArt!200012,200038,1095675/SH/0/depot/0/neuer-vw-scirocco-kommt-aus-portugal.html\n|publisher=Handelsblatt\n|title=Neuer VW Scirocco kommt aus Portugal\n|trans-title=New VW Scirocco to come from Portugal\n|date=June 20, 2006\n|language=german\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n{{anchor|Iroc}}\n\nThe new model, identified by the internal type numbers 137 or 1K8, is based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|PQ35 platform]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf V]] and was unveiled at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2008|2008 Geneva Motor Show]].
