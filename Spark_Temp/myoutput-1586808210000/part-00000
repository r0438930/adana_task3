In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-90 extends {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} from the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line at [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]], and is the second-longest highway in the state after [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]]. Although most of the route is part of the tolled [[New York State Thruway]], two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], is not part of the Thruway system and links [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] through [[Interstate 990|I-990]] in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former [[Erie Canal]] route, [[New York State Route&nbsp;5]] (NY&nbsp;5), [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) and the [[CSX]] railroad mainline that traverses the state.\n\nI-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the [[Berkshire Connector]] to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany\u2013Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.\n\n== Route description ==\n\n=== New York State Thruway ===\n{{Main|New York State Thruway#Mainline|l1=New York State Thruway (mainline)}}\nWest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the [[New York State Thruway]]. The Thruway begins at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], following the shore of [[Lake Erie]] northeast and passes through the town of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], a large [[suburb]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] (leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and connecting into Canada as [[Ontario Highway 405]]) and [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]]. East of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in [[Upstate New York]], generally following the path of the [[Erie Canal]]. It passes south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and north of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], which are served by three auxiliary Interstate Highways: [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] and [[Interstate 390|I-390]] connect to Rochester, while [[Interstate 690|I-690]] leads to Syracuse.<ref name=\"2009map\">{{cite map |title=New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |year=2009 |cartography=[[Map Works]]}}</ref>  The speed limit, enforced by the [[New York State Police]], is 65 miles per hour along most of this stretch.<ref name=\"speedlimit\">{{cite web|title=History of NY Thruway 1991\u20132000|url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|accessdate=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815074637/http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|archive-date=August 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:I-90 west in West Seneca NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;54 on I-90 westbound in West Seneca]]\nEast of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the [[Mohawk River]] into the [[Mohawk Valley]] toward [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets [[Interstate 790|I-790]], a short route leading into the city's center. Farther east, the freeway indirectly serves the canal and riverside cities of [[Little Falls (city), New York|Little Falls]] (via [[New York State Route 169|NY&nbsp;169]]) and [[Amsterdam (city), New York|Amsterdam]] ([[New York State Route 30|NY&nbsp;30]]) on its way to [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], where [[Interstate 890|I-890]] splits from the Thruway and serves as the connection to the city center. It rejoins I-90 in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], where I-90 leaves the mainline of the Thruway at exit&nbsp;24 in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], which is signed for I-87 north and I-90 east. Here, the route designation of the Thruway changes from I-90 east to I-87 south. Traffic intending to continue on I-90 or reach I-87 north must exit the Thruway here.

In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-90 extends {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} from the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line at [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]], and is the second-longest highway in the state after [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]]. Although most of the route is part of the tolled [[New York State Thruway]], two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], is not part of the Thruway system and links [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] through [[Interstate 990|I-990]] in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former [[Erie Canal]] route, [[New York State Route&nbsp;5]] (NY&nbsp;5), [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) and the [[CSX]] railroad mainline that traverses the state.\n\nI-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the [[Berkshire Connector]] to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany\u2013Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.\n\n== Route description ==\n\n=== New York State Thruway ===\n{{Main|New York State Thruway#Mainline|l1=New York State Thruway (mainline)}}\nWest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the [[New York State Thruway]]. The Thruway begins at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], following the shore of [[Lake Erie]] northeast and passes through the town of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], a large [[suburb]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] (leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and connecting into Canada as [[Ontario Highway 405]]) and [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]]. East of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in [[Upstate New York]], generally following the path of the [[Erie Canal]]. It passes south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and north of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], which are served by three auxiliary Interstate Highways: [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] and [[Interstate 390|I-390]] connect to Rochester, while [[Interstate 690|I-690]] leads to Syracuse.<ref name=\"2009map\">{{cite map |title=New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |year=2009 |cartography=[[Map Works]]}}</ref>  The speed limit, enforced by the [[New York State Police]], is 65 miles per hour along most of this stretch.<ref name=\"speedlimit\">{{cite web|title=History of NY Thruway 1991\u20132000|url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|accessdate=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815074637/http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|archive-date=August 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:I-90 west in West Seneca NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;54 on I-90 westbound in West Seneca]]\nEast of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the [[Mohawk River]] into the [[Mohawk Valley]] toward [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets [[Interstate 790|I-790]], a short route leading into the city's center.
