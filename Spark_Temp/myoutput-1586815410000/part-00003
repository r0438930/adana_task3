True Hollywood Stories''''' is the third studio album by the [[rapper]] [[Canibus]], released through Archives Music on October 30, 2001. The album is Canibus' first release on an [[independent record label]] (his first two albums, ''[[Can-I-Bus]]'' and ''[[2000 B.C. (album)|2000 B.C.]]'', were released on [[Universal Records]]). The album was named after the television show ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''. This album sets itself apart from his first two albums by seemingly being a concept album, some songs rapped from the perspective of Stan, the fan from the [[Eminem]] song \"[[Stan (song)|Stan]]\". It can also be noted Canibus' rhyme style and flow resemble more that of Eminem than the style presented on his first two albums, which led to mixed reviews from the public.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/c-true-hollywood-stories-mw0000015632 |title=C True Hollywood Stories - Canibus |last=Mills |first=Brad |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=May 19, 2008}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[HipHopDX]]''\n|rev2score = {{rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"HHDX\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.114/title.canibus-c-true-hollywood-stories |title=Canibus - \"C\" True Hollywood Stories |author=Wise Q |magazine=[[HipHopDX]] |publisher=Cheri Media Group |date=November 19, 2001 |accessdate=May 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022406/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.114/title.canibus-c-true-hollywood-stories |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''RapReviews''\n|rev3score = 4.5/10<ref name=\"RR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2002_01F_stories.html |title=Feature for January 22, 2002: Canibus' \"'C' True Hollywood Stories\" |last=Juon |first=Steve 'Flash' |website=RapReviews |date=January 22, 2002 |accessdate=May 19, 2008}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Stylus Magazine]]''\n|rev4score = F<ref name=\"Stylus\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/canibus/c-true-hollywood-stories.htm |title=Canibus - C: True Hollywood Stories |last=Berliner |first=Brett |magazine=[[Stylus Magazine]] |date=January 9, 2003 |accessdate=May 19, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707173819/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/canibus/c-true-hollywood-stories.htm |archivedate=July 7, 2007}}</ref>\n}}\n''C!
