It initiated as a series of [[phreatic eruption|phreatic blasts]] from the summit then escalated on May 18, 1980, as a major explosive eruption. The eruption, which had a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] of 5, was the most significant to occur in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous]] 48 U.S. states since the much smaller 1915 eruption of [[Lassen Peak]] in California.{{sfn|Fisher|Heiken|Hullen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzZeWQ8vTPoC&pg=PA294 294]}} It has often been declared the most disastrous volcanic eruption in U.S. history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and [[steam]]-venting episodes, caused by an injection of [[magma]] at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.\n\nAn earthquake at 8:32:17&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Daylight Time|PDT]] ([[UTC]]\u22127) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and [[steam]]-rich [[rock (geology)|rock]] in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward [[Spirit Lake (Washington)|Spirit Lake]] in a hot mix of [[lava]] and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.\n\nAn [[eruption column]] rose {{convert|80,000|ft|km mi|0}} into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states<ref name=\"WashPost2005\"/> and significant ash in two Canadian provinces.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-researchers-looking-for-albertans-who-experienced-volcano |title = U of A researchers looking for Albertans who experienced volcano |last = Short |first = Dylan |date=19 March 2019 <!-- as updated; no original date found --> |website=edmontonjournal.com |publisher=[[Edmonton Journal]] |access-date=1 May 2019 |quote = dust was found most heavily in the foothills area in southern Alberta, but may have drifted as far north as Red Deer.}}</ref> At the same time, snow, ice and several entire [[glacier]]s on the volcano melted, forming a series of large [[lahar]]s (volcanic [[mudslide]]s) that reached as far as the [[Columbia River]], nearly {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} to the southwest.

The blast released energy equal to 24 [[TNT equivalent|megatons of TNT]].\n# ''Channelized blast zone'', an intermediate zone, extended out to distances as far as {{convert|19|mi|km}} from the volcano, an area in which the flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> In this zone, the force and direction of the blast are strikingly demonstrated by the parallel alignment of toppled large trees, broken off at the base of the trunk as if they were blades of grass mown by a [[scythe]]. This zone was also known as the \"tree-down zone\". Channeling and deflection of the blast caused strikingly varied local effects that still remained conspicuous after some decades. Where the blast struck open land directly, it scoured it, breaking trees off short and stripping vegetation and even topsoil, thereby delaying revegetation for many years. Where the blast was deflected so as to pass overhead by several metres, it left the topsoil and the seeds it contained, permitting faster revegetation with [[Scrubland|scrub]] and [[herbaceous plant]]s, and later with saplings. Trees in the path of such higher-level blasts were broken off wholesale at various heights, whereas nearby stands in more sheltered positions recovered comparatively rapidly without conspicuous long-term harm. \n# ''Seared zone'', also called the \"standing dead\" zone, the outermost fringe of the impacted area, a zone in which trees remained standing but were singed brown by the hot gases of the blast.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\"/>\n\n[[File:Dave Johnston with gas-detection instrument at Mount St. Helens, 4 April 1980 (USGS) 1.jpg|thumb|left|Volcanologist [[David A.

During this time, parts of the [[Mushroom cloud|mushroom]]-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud, and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash.

However, they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so.

According to Melanson's brother, in October 1983, Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson \"is believed [...] a victim of the May 18, 1980, eruption\" and that after years of searching, the family eventually decided \"he's buried in the ash\".<ref name=\"MissingPersons\" />\n\nTaking these two points of dispute into consideration, the direct death toll could be as low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When combined with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier, those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.\n\n=== Ash damage and removal ===\n[[File:1980 Mount st helens ash distribution.svg|thumb|alt=Large yellow area on map|Map of ash distribution over the United States]]\nThe ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation, [[sewage]] disposal, and [[water treatment]] systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. [[Interstate 90]] from [[Seattle]] to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] was closed for a week and a half.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\"/> Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for [[internal-combustion engine]]s and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused [[short circuit]]s in electrical transformers, which in turn caused [[power blackout]]s.\n\nRemoving and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over {{convert|2400000|cuyd|m3}} of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary [[landfill]]s; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, Oregon, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.<ref>Painter, John Jr. The 1980s.

Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[emotion]]al problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\"/>\n\nInitial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens\u2013[[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]] area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring [[Oregon]] not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The [[United States Forest Service]] and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\"/>\n\n== Later eruptions ==\nSt. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990, at least twenty-one periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.\n\n===1980\u20131991===\n[[File:MSH80 st helens eruption plume 07-22-80.jpg|alt=Ash plume|thumb|Eruption on July 22, 1980]]\n\nAn eruption occurred on May 25, 1980, at 2:30&nbsp;a.m. that sent an ash column {{convert|9|mi|ft km|spell=in}} into the atmosphere.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=211}} The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rainstorm.

The first hit at 5:14&nbsp;p.m. as an ash column shot {{convert|10|mi|ft km}} and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25&nbsp;p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5&nbsp;minutes.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=212}} The final explosion started at 7:01&nbsp;p.m. and continued for over two hours.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=212}} When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=213}}\n\n[[File:St Helens dome on October 24, 1980.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Large mound of rock|The growing third dome on October 24, 1980]]\n\nSeismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26&nbsp;p.m., an ash cloud slowly expanded {{convert|8|mi|ft km}} into the sky.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=213}} Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater.

This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash {{convert|10|mi|ft km}} in the air and created small, red-hot [[pyroclastic]] flows.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=213}} A third dome began to form within 30&nbsp;minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about {{convert|900|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|130|ft|m}} high.

It initiated as a series of [[phreatic eruption|phreatic blasts]] from the summit then escalated on May 18, 1980, as a major explosive eruption. The eruption, which had a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] of 5, was the most significant to occur in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous]] 48 U.S. states since the much smaller 1915 eruption of [[Lassen Peak]] in California.{{sfn|Fisher|Heiken|Hullen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzZeWQ8vTPoC&pg=PA294 294]}} It has often been declared the most disastrous volcanic eruption in U.S. history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and [[steam]]-venting episodes, caused by an injection of [[magma]] at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.\n\nAn earthquake at 8:32:17&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Daylight Time|PDT]] ([[UTC]]\u22127) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and [[steam]]-rich [[rock (geology)|rock]] in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward [[Spirit Lake (Washington)|Spirit Lake]] in a hot mix of [[lava]] and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.\n\nAn [[eruption column]] rose {{convert|80,000|ft|km mi|0}} into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states<ref name=\"WashPost2005\"/> and significant ash in two Canadian provinces.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/u-of-a-researchers-looking-for-albertans-who-experienced-volcano |title = U of A researchers looking for Albertans who experienced volcano |last = Short |first = Dylan |date=19 March 2019 <!-- as updated; no original date found --> |website=edmontonjournal.com |publisher=[[Edmonton Journal]] |access-date=1 May 2019 |quote = dust was found most heavily in the foothills area in southern Alberta, but may have drifted as far north as Red Deer.}}</ref> At the same time, snow, ice and several entire [[glacier]]s on the volcano melted, forming a series of large [[lahar]]s (volcanic [[mudslide]]s) that reached as far as the [[Columbia River]], nearly {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} to the southwest.

Yet many areas closer to the eruption ([[Portland, Oregon]], for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called \"quiet zone\" extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption's sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers and, to a lesser extent, local [[topography]].<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" />\n\nLater studies indicated that one-third of the {{convert|0.045|cumi}} of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=206}}\n\n=== Lateral blast result ===\n[[File:Reid Blackburn's car after May 18, 1980 St. Helens eruption.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Heavily damaged car embedded in gray soil|Photographer Reid Blackburn's Volvo after the eruption]]\n[[File:Mount St. Helens fractured tree.png|thumb|Many trees in the ''Direct blast zone'' were snapped off at their bases and the earth was stripped and scorched.]]\n\nThe huge ensuing ash cloud sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot was visible throughout the quiet zone. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as {{convert|19|mi|km}} from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones:<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" />\n# ''Direct blast zone'', the innermost zone, averaged about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} in radius, an area in which virtually everything, natural or artificial, was obliterated or carried away.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> For this reason, this zone also has been called the \"tree-removal zone\". The flow of the material carried by the blast was not deflected by topographic features in this zone. The blast released energy equal to 24 [[TNT equivalent|megatons of TNT]].\n# ''Channelized blast zone'', an intermediate zone, extended out to distances as far as {{convert|19|mi|km}} from the volcano, an area in which the flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> In this zone, the force and direction of the blast are strikingly demonstrated by the parallel alignment of toppled large trees, broken off at the base of the trunk as if they were blades of grass mown by a [[scythe]]. This zone was also known as the \"tree-down zone\". Channeling and deflection of the blast caused strikingly varied local effects that still remained conspicuous after some decades. Where the blast struck open land directly, it scoured it, breaking trees off short and stripping vegetation and even topsoil, thereby delaying revegetation for many years. Where the blast was deflected so as to pass overhead by several metres, it left the topsoil and the seeds it contained, permitting faster revegetation with [[Scrubland|scrub]] and [[herbaceous plant]]s, and later with saplings. Trees in the path of such higher-level blasts were broken off wholesale at various heights, whereas nearby stands in more sheltered positions recovered comparatively rapidly without conspicuous long-term harm. \n# ''Seared zone'', also called the \"standing dead\" zone, the outermost fringe of the impacted area, a zone in which trees remained standing but were singed brown by the hot gases of the blast.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\"/>\n\n[[File:Dave Johnston with gas-detection instrument at Mount St. Helens, 4 April 1980 (USGS) 1.jpg|thumb|left|Volcanologist [[David A.

The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption, and their aggregate volume was about {{convert|0.05|mi3|km3}}.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" />\n\nThe flow deposits were still at about {{convert|300|to|420|C|F|-1|order=flip}} two weeks after they erupted.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River.

During this time, parts of the [[Mushroom cloud|mushroom]]-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud, and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks.

They were reported missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators were able to locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so.

[[Cowlitz County, Washington|Cowlitz County]] Emergency Services Management lists them as \"Possibly Missing \u2014 Not on [the official] List\". According to Melanson's brother, in October 1983, Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson \"is believed [...] a victim of the May 18, 1980, eruption\" and that after years of searching, the family eventually decided \"he's buried in the ash\".<ref name=\"MissingPersons\" />\n\nTaking these two points of dispute into consideration, the direct death toll could be as low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When combined with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier, those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.\n\n=== Ash damage and removal ===\n[[File:1980 Mount st helens ash distribution.svg|thumb|alt=Large yellow area on map|Map of ash distribution over the United States]]\nThe ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation, [[sewage]] disposal, and [[water treatment]] systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. [[Interstate 90]] from [[Seattle]] to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] was closed for a week and a half.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\"/> Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for [[internal-combustion engine]]s and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused [[short circuit]]s in electrical transformers, which in turn caused [[power blackout]]s.\n\nRemoving and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over {{convert|2400000|cuyd|m3}} of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary [[landfill]]s; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, Oregon, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.<ref>Painter, John Jr. The 1980s.

Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\" /> Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[emotion]]al problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\"/>\n\nInitial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens\u2013[[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]] area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring [[Oregon]] not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The [[United States Forest Service]] and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.<ref name=\"TillingPastClimactic\"/>\n\n== Later eruptions ==\nSt. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990, at least twenty-one periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.\n\n===1980\u20131991===\n[[File:MSH80 st helens eruption plume 07-22-80.jpg|alt=Ash plume|thumb|Eruption on July 22, 1980]]\n\nAn eruption occurred on May 25, 1980, at 2:30&nbsp;a.m. that sent an ash column {{convert|9|mi|ft km|spell=in}} into the atmosphere.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=211}} The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rainstorm.

Fisheries:\n| The Washington Department of Fisheries estimated that 12 million Chinook and Coho salmon fingerlings were killed when hatcheries were destroyed. Another estimated 40,000 young salmon were lost when forced to swim through turbine blades of hydroelectric generators as reservoir levels along the Lewis River were kept low to accommodate possible mudflows and flooding.\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Brantley and Myers, 1997, [http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/FS070-97/framework.html Mount St. Helens \u2013 From the 1980 Eruption to 1996]: USGS Fact Sheet 070\u201397, accessed 2007-06-05; and Tilling, Topinka, and Swanson, 1990, [https://web.archive.org/web/20111026174423/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/MSHPPF/MSH_past_present_future.html Eruption of Mount St. Helens \u2013 Past, Present, and Future]: USGS General Interest Publication, accessed 2007-06-05.\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Table compiled by Lyn Topinka, USGS/CVO, 1997\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Volcanoes|1980s}}\n* [[Cascade Volcanoes]] \u2013 ''High Cascades''.\n* [[List of Cascade volcanoes]]\n* [[Geology of the Pacific Northwest]]\n* [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]\n* [[The Eruption of Mount St. Helens!|''The Eruption of Mount St. Helens!''
