A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served as a [[United States Senator]] and the [[List of Governors of California|36th Governor of California]].\n\nBorn in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]], Wilson graduated from the [[UC Berkeley School of Law]] after serving in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He established a legal practice in [[San Diego]] and campaigned for Republicans such as [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Barry Goldwater]]. Wilson won election to the [[California State Assembly]] in 1966 and became the [[Mayor of San Diego]] in 1971. He held that office until 1983, when he became a member of the United States Senate.\n\nIn the Senate, Wilson supported the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] and the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]], while he opposed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]]. He resigned from the Senate after winning the [[California gubernatorial election, 1990|1990 California gubernatorial election]].\n\nAs governor, he signed a [[three-strikes law]] and supported energy [[deregulation]] and [[Term limits in the United States|term limits]]. He was also an advocate for [[California Proposition 187]], which established a state-run citizenship screening system with the intention of  preventing [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] from using social services. He sought the presidential nomination in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1996|1996 Republican primaries]] but quickly dropped out of the race.\n\nWilson retired from public office after serving two terms as governor. Since leaving office, he has worked for several businesses and has been affiliated with several other organizations. He is a distinguished visiting fellow at the [[American conservatism|conservative]] [[Hoover Institution]]. Wilson also co-chaired [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s successful 2003 gubernatorial campaign.\n\n==Early life==\nPeter Barton Wilson was born on August 23, 1933, in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]], a suburb north of [[Chicago]]. His parents were James Boone Wilson and Margaret (Callaghan) Wilson.<ref>[http://www.sdgenealogy.org/petewilson.html San Diego Genealogy Project: Pete Wilson]</ref> His father sold college fraternity jewelry to work his way through University of Illinois, and later became a successful advertising executive. The Wilson family settled in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] when Pete was in elementary school. He then attended the private, non-sectarian [[University-preparatory school|preparatory middle school]] [[John Burroughs School|John Burroughs]] (grades 7\u20139) in [[Ladue, Missouri|Ladue]], and then [[St. Louis Country Day School]], an exclusive private high school, where he won an award in his senior year for combined scholarship, athletics, and citizenship. In the fall of 1951, Pete Wilson enrolled at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], where he received a [[United States Navy]] Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship, majored in English, and earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. In his junior year he elected to join the Marine Corps upon his graduation.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Wilson served for three years in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as an infantry officer, eventually becoming a platoon leader. Upon completion of his Marine Corps service, Wilson earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[UC Berkeley School of Law|University of California, Berkeley School of Law]] in June 1962.\n\nIn 1962, while working as an Advance Man for the Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Richard M. Nixon]], Wilson got to know [[Herb Klein (journalist)|Herb Klein]], one of Nixon's top aides. Klein suggested that Wilson might do well in Southern California politics, so in 1963, Wilson moved to [[San Diego]].\n\nAfter passing the bar exam on his fourth attempt, Wilson began his practice as a criminal defense attorney in [[San Diego]], but he found such work to be low-paying and personally repugnant. He later commented to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', \"I realized I couldn't be a criminal defense lawyer \u2013 because most of the people who do come to you are guilty.\" Wilson switched to a more conventional law practice and continued his activity in local politics, working for [[Barry Goldwater]]'s unsuccessful [[1964 United States presidential election|presidential campaign in 1964]]. Wilson's liking for politics and managing the day-to-day details of the political process was growing. He put in long hours for the Goldwater campaign, earning the friendship of local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] boosters so necessary for a political career, and in 1966, at the age of thirty-three, he ran for, and won a seat in the [[California State Assembly]], succeeding [[Clair Burgener]].\n\nWilson was re-elected to the Assembly in 1968 and 1970, and in 1971 was elected mayor of San Diego.\n\n==Mayor of San Diego==\n[[File:Nixon Golden Gate GOGA.jpg|thumb|Mayor Wilson (second from right) with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], and others including Interior Secretary [[Rogers C.B. Morton]] and Counselor to the President [[Donald Rumsfeld]] in front of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], September 1972]]\n\nWilson served three terms as [[Mayor of San Diego]], from 1971 to 1983, winning election by a 2:1 margin each time.<ref name = \"Kaye\">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-kaye-rogues-gallery-of-san-diego-mayors-20130816,0,1326777.story|title=Bob Filner, just the latest rotten San Diego mayor|last=Kaye|first=Peter|date=August 16, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> During his three terms he restructured [[San Diego City Council]], reorganized the planning and civil service commissions, instituted campaign finance reform, and promoted the redevelopment of [[Downtown San Diego]].<ref name = \"Kaye\" /> He also helped to keep [[Major League Baseball]]'s Padres in San Diego, helping to persuade local millionaire [[Ray Kroc]] to buy the team.\n\nThe [[1972 Republican National Convention]] had been scheduled to take place in San Diego in August 1972. However, in May 1972 the Republican National Committee voted to move the convention to [[Miami]] because of a scandal involving a donation to the event by [[ITT Corporation]], as well as concerns about the proposed venue (the [[San Diego Sports Arena]]) and the adequacy of hotel space. Wilson proclaimed the week of the convention to be America's Finest City Week, which became an annual event and gave rise to San Diego's unofficial nickname.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ancona|first=Vincent S.|date=Fall 1992|title=When the elephants marched out of San Diego: The 1972 Republican Convention Fiasco|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=38|issue=4|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/92fall/elephants.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Wilson recruited [[Clarence M. Pendleton Jr.]] to head the [[Model Cities Program]] in San Diego. In 1981, US President [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed Pendleton to chair the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], a position that he held from 1981 until his death in San Diego in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aapra.org/Bios/Pendleton.htm|title=Clarence M.

Hayakawa]]. Wilson's Democratic opponent was the outgoing two-term Governor [[Jerry Brown]]. Wilson was known as a fiscal conservative who supported [[Proposition 13]], although Wilson had opposed the measure while mayor of San Diego. However, Brown ran on his gubernatorial record of building the largest state budget surpluses in California history. Both Wilson and Brown were moderate-to-liberal on social issues, including support for abortion rights. The election was expected to be close, with Brown holding a slim lead in most of the polls leading up to Election Day. Wilson hammered away at Brown's appointment of California Chief Justice [[Rose Bird]], using this to portray himself as tougher on crime than Brown was. Brown's late entry into the 1980 Democratic presidential primary, after promising not to run, was also an issue. President [[Ronald Reagan]] made a number of visits to California late in the race to campaign for Wilson. Reagan quipped that the last thing he wanted to see was both of his home state's [[U.S. Senate]] seats falling into Democrats' hands, especially to be occupied by the man who succeeded him as Governor. Despite exit polls indicating a narrow Brown victory, Wilson edged him out to win the election. A major contributing factor may also have been a late influx of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] vote in the California Governor's race between [[George Deukmejian]] and [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Many of these votes came from heavily Republican areas. The Deukmejian voters likely also voted for Wilson for United States Senator.\n[[File:Ronald Reagan signing Japanese reparations bill.jpg|thumb|right|President Reagan signing the Civil Liberties Act with Wilson looking on]]\n\nOn October 19, 1983, Wilson voted in favor of a bill establishing [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/20/us/senate-s-roll-call-vote-on-king-holiday.html|title=SENATE'S ROLL-CALL VOTE ON KING HOLIDAY|date=October 20, 1983|publisher=New York Times}}</ref> The legislation was signed into law by President Reagan the following month.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1983/110283a.htm|title=Remarks on Signing the Bill Making the Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., a National Holiday|date=November 2, 1983|publisher=Reagan Library|first=Ronald|last=Reagan|authorlink=Ronald Reagan}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1984, Wilson voted in favor of legislation restricting federal highway funds for states that did not raise the minimum age for drinking to 21.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/27/The-81-16-vote-by-which-the-Senate-approved-legislation/9253457156800/|title=The 81-16 vote by which the Senate approved legislation ...|date=June 27, 1984|publisher=UPI}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/27/us/senate-votes-bill-aimed-at-forcing-drinking-age-of-21.html|title=SENATE VOTES BILL AIMED AT FORCING DRINKING AGE OF 21|first=Martin|last=Tolchin|publisher=New York Times|date=June 27, 1984}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1985, Wilson underwent surgery for a ruptured appendix at Bethesda Naval Hospital, concurrently as fellow Republican Senator [[Bob Dole]] hoped to gather enough votes for the Reagan administration's 1986 budget.

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served as a [[United States Senator]] and the [[List of Governors of California|36th Governor of California]].\n\nBorn in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]], Wilson graduated from the [[UC Berkeley School of Law]] after serving in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He established a legal practice in [[San Diego]] and campaigned for Republicans such as [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Barry Goldwater]]. Wilson won election to the [[California State Assembly]] in 1966 and became the [[Mayor of San Diego]] in 1971. He held that office until 1983, when he became a member of the United States Senate.\n\nIn the Senate, Wilson supported the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] and the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]], while he opposed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]]. He resigned from the Senate after winning the [[California gubernatorial election, 1990|1990 California gubernatorial election]]. \n\nAs governor, he signed a [[three-strikes law]] and supported energy [[deregulation]] and [[Term limits in the United States|term limits]]. He was also an advocate for [[California Proposition 187]], which established a state-run citizenship screening system with the intention of  preventing [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrant]]s from using social services. He sought the presidential nomination in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1996|1996 Republican primaries]] but quickly dropped out of the race.\n\nWilson retired from public office after serving two terms as governor. Since leaving office, he has worked for several businesses and has been affiliated with several other organizations. He is a distinguished visiting fellow at the [[American conservatism|conservative]] [[Hoover Institution]]. Wilson also co-chaired [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s successful 2003 gubernatorial campaign.\n\n==Early life==\nPeter Barton Wilson was born on August 23, 1933, in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]], a suburb north of [[Chicago]]. His parents were James Boone Wilson and Margaret (Callaghan) Wilson.<ref>[http://www.sdgenealogy.org/petewilson.html San Diego Genealogy Project: Pete Wilson]</ref> His father sold college fraternity jewelry to work his way through University of Illinois, and later became a successful advertising executive. The Wilson family settled in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] when Pete was in elementary school. He then attended the private, non-sectarian [[University-preparatory school|preparatory middle school]] [[John Burroughs School|John Burroughs]] (grades 7\u20139) in [[Ladue, Missouri|Ladue]], and then [[St. Louis Country Day School]], an exclusive private high school, where he won an award in his senior year for combined scholarship, athletics, and citizenship. In the fall of 1951, Pete Wilson enrolled at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], where he received a [[United States Navy]] Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship, majored in English, and earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. In his junior year he elected to join the Marine Corps upon his graduation.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Wilson served for three years in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as an infantry officer, eventually becoming a platoon leader. Upon completion of his Marine Corps service, Wilson earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[UC Berkeley School of Law|University of California, Berkeley School of Law]] in June, 1962.\n\nIn 1962, while working as an Advance Man for the Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Richard M. Nixon]], Wilson got to know [[Herb Klein (journalist)|Herb Klein]], one of Nixon's top aides. Klein suggested that Wilson might do well in Southern California politics, so in 1963, Wilson moved to [[San Diego]].\n\nAfter passing the bar exam on his fourth attempt, Wilson began his practice as a criminal defense attorney in [[San Diego]], but he found such work to be low-paying and personally repugnant. He later commented to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', \"I realized I couldn't be a criminal defense lawyer \u2013 because most of the people who do come to you are guilty.\" Wilson switched to a more conventional law practice and continued his activity in local politics, working for [[Barry Goldwater]]'s unsuccessful [[1964 United States presidential election|presidential campaign in 1964]]. Wilson's liking for politics and managing the day-to-day details of the political process was growing. He put in long hours for the Goldwater campaign, earning the friendship of local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] boosters so necessary for a political career, and in 1966, at the age of thirty-three, he ran for, and won a seat in the [[California State Assembly]], succeeding [[Clair Burgener]].\n\nWilson was re-elected to the Assembly in 1968 and 1970, and in 1971 was elected mayor of San Diego.\n\n==Mayor of San Diego==\n[[File:Nixon Golden Gate GOGA.jpg|thumb|Mayor Wilson (second from right) with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], and others including Interior Secretary [[Rogers C.B. Morton]] and Counselor to the President [[Donald Rumsfeld]] in front of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], September 1972]]\n\nWilson served three terms as [[Mayor of San Diego]], from 1971 to 1983, winning election by a 2:1 margin each time.<ref name = \"Kaye\">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-kaye-rogues-gallery-of-san-diego-mayors-20130816,0,1326777.story|title=Bob Filner, just the latest rotten San Diego mayor|last=Kaye|first=Peter|date=August 16, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> During his three terms he restructured [[San Diego City Council]], reorganized the planning and civil service commissions, instituted campaign finance reform, and promoted the redevelopment of [[Downtown San Diego]].<ref name = \"Kaye\" /> He also helped to keep [[Major League Baseball]]'s Padres in San Diego, helping to persuade local millionaire [[Ray Kroc]] to buy the team.\n\nThe [[1972 Republican National Convention]] had been scheduled to take place in San Diego in August 1972. However, in May 1972 the Republican National Committee voted to move the convention to [[Miami]] because of a scandal involving a donation to the event by [[ITT Corporation]], as well as concerns about the proposed venue (the [[San Diego Sports Arena]]) and the adequacy of hotel space. Wilson proclaimed the week of the convention to be America's Finest City Week, which became an annual event and gave rise to San Diego's unofficial nickname.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ancona|first=Vincent S.|date=Fall 1992|title=When the elephants marched out of San Diego: The 1972 Republican Convention Fiasco|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=38|issue=4|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/92fall/elephants.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Wilson recruited [[Clarence M. Pendleton Jr.]] to head the [[Model Cities Program]] in San Diego. In 1981, US President [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed Pendleton to chair the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], a position that he held from 1981 until his death in San Diego in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aapra.org/Bios/Pendleton.htm|title=Clarence M.

Hayakawa]]. Wilson's Democratic opponent was the outgoing two-term Governor [[Jerry Brown]]. Wilson was known as a fiscal conservative who supported [[Proposition 13]], although Wilson had opposed the measure while mayor of San Diego. However, Brown ran on his gubernatorial record of building the largest state budget surpluses in California history. Both Wilson and Brown were moderate-to-liberal on social issues, including support for abortion rights. The election was expected to be close, with Brown holding a slim lead in most of the polls leading up to Election Day. Wilson hammered away at Brown's appointment of California Chief Justice [[Rose Bird]], using this to portray himself as tougher on crime than Brown was. Brown's late entry into the 1980 Democratic presidential primary, after promising not to run, was also an issue. President [[Ronald Reagan]] made a number of visits to California late in the race to campaign for Wilson. Reagan quipped that the last thing he wanted to see was both of his home state's [[U.S. Senate]] seats falling into Democrats' hands, especially to be occupied by the man who succeeded him as Governor. Despite exit polls indicating a narrow Brown victory, Wilson edged him out to win the election. A major contributing factor may also have been a late influx of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] vote in the California Governor's race between [[George Deukmejian]] and [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Many of these votes came from heavily Republican areas.
