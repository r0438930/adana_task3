There are 8 officers on the Board. For details on the Board's clubs, see [[:Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan|Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan]] and [[List of Gaelic games clubs in Ireland#Cavan]].\nThe Board is subject to the [[Ulster GAA]] Provincial Council.\n{{Cavan GAA clubs|state=collapsed}}\nThe teams of Cavan GAA play home games at [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]]. The current football manager is Mickey Graham, who took over following the resignation of Mattie McGleenan in 2018.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe following is a list of sponsors of the Cavan Senior Football team\n* 1992: Holybrook Construction\n* 1993: Atlanta Conservatories\n* 1994: Cavan Co-op Mart \n* 1995 \u2013 present: [[Kingspan Group]]\nCavan have had only 4 sponsorship deals since sponsors on jerseys were permitted by the GAA in 1991. There was no sponsorship on GAA jerseys until the 2nd game of the Meath V Dublin 4 in a row in 1991 so only a handful of teams had sponsorship in 1991. In 1992 Holybrook Construction sponsored the jerseys although it was only for 1 game. For the 1993-94 seasons Cavan Co-op Mart took over sponsorship. Kingspan has continuously sponsored Cavan since 1995.\n\n===Crest and symbols===\n[[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|left|thumb|100px|Coat of Arms of County Cavan]]\nThe first crest that adorned the Cavan jerseys was the Coat of Arms for [[County Cavan]]. The crest was split into four quadrants and included\n* the red hand of Ulster encased in an outline of the Franciscan Abbey which is situated in Cavan town and where the O'Reilly chieftains are buried. Here also lies the remains of an Ulster leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill. \n*The Rampant Lion from the coat of arms of the O\u2019Reilly clans, who were the local lords.\nIn 2004 Cavan released a new crest for the Breifne County. The crest was designed by the [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|38th President]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] Aog\u00e1n Farrell and Cavan Central Council rep. George Cartwright. The crest draws on cultural, physical and historical influences. The primary colours are blue and white with Ulster's red hand and G.A.A. yellow also prominent. The designers wanted to reflect the following elements\n*Breifne: The ancient Gaelic territory. Modern Cavan was once \"O Reilly country\" and the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Breifne is preserved in the name of the home pitch in Cavan and now on its crest\n*Franciscan Abbey: The mediaeval tower from the Abbey in Cavan Town fills the lower quadrant. Here the O' Reilly\u2019s invited the Franciscans to establish a monastery. The O'Reilly chieftains are buried here. Here also lie the remains of Ulster's great leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill\n*GAA Logo: The GAA modern logo fills the right quadrant. The logo is representative of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].\n*Red Hand 1886:  The first GAA club founded in the province of Ulster was formed in Cavan. [[Ballyconnell First Ulsters GFC|Ballyconnell First Ulsters]] formed in 1885 and affiliated in 1886. The date is preserved in the crest. A red hand has always appeared on Cavan crests. \n*Lakes and Hills: Our landscape is dominated by \"wee lakes and hills\". The environment shapes us and this is reflected on the new crest.\n\n==Gaelic football==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Cavan vs Queens - 2009.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cavan (blue) in action against [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the 2009 [[Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\nThe first GAA club in Cavan and in Ulster was founded in [[Ballyconnell]] in late 1885 called Ballyconnell Joe Biggars in honour of west Cavan Nationalist MP Joe Biggar. The name of the club was later changed to Ballyconnell First Ulsters.\n\nThe very first Cavan County Final, under GAA rules was played in a field outside Cavan Town on 30 April 1887. The final was contested by Ballyconnell First Ulster\u2019s and Maghera MacFinns. MacFinns recorded a famous victory on a score line of 1-4 to First Ulster\u2019s 0-1, thus entering the history books as Cavan\u2019s first Champions.\n\nCavan are the most successful football county in Ulster, having won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] 5 times, the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] 39 times, and the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once.\nCavan's first All-Ireland victory came in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]]. They foiled [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s five-in-a-row bid with a last minute goal from Vincent McGovern in the All-Ireland Semi-Final at Breffni Park 1933, and went on to beat [[Galway GAA|Galway]] by a point in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the final]], to become the first Ulster county to win the Sam Maguire Cup. Two years later, Cavan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1935 final]] to bring home their second title in three years.\n\nCavan's third, and most famous All-Ireland title came in [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], defeating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the famous [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], the only time the final was held outside of Ireland. They followed this up with a one-point win over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], to win back-to-back titles for the first time. They reached their third successive [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1949]], but they were denied a three-in-a-row by [[Meath GAA|Meath]], losing by four points.\nCavan later gained revenge for this defeat, beating Meath after a replay in [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1952]] to bring home their fifth, and so far last, All-Ireland title. Cavan have not appeared in another All-Ireland final since.\n\nHistorically, Cavan have dominated the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], winning a record 39 titles. Despite this, Cavan have won only one Ulster Championship since 1969, this success coming in the [[1997 Ulster Senior Football Championship Final|1997 final]], after beating [[Derry GAA|Derry]] by a point. Cavan's most recent Ulster Final appearance was in [[2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2019]], losing to [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]].\n\nThe current Cavan manager is Mickey Graham.\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan have won the [[All-Ireland Football Championship|All-Ireland Football]] final on 5 occasions \u2013 All 5 victories came between 1933 and 1952.\nMeanwhile, they have won the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championship]] on 39 occasions. Their last came in 1997 when they beat [[Derry GAA|Derry]] 1-14 to 0-16. It was their first Ulster title in 28 years.\nCavan have won the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once, in [[1947\u201348 National Football League (Ireland)|1947/48]].\n*'''[[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]s:''' 5\n**[[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]], [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1935]], [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1952]]\n*'''[[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship]]s:''' 2\n**1937, 1938\n*'''[[All-Ireland Junior Football Championship]]s:''' 2\n**1927, 2014\n*'''[[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]]:''' 1\n**1947/48\n*'''[[Ulster Senior Football Championship]]s:''' 39\n**1891, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1915, 1918, 1919, 1920, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1962, 1964, 1967, 1969, 1997\n*'''[[Ulster Under-21 Football Championship]]s:''' 6\n**1988, 1996, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n*'''[[Ulster Minor Football Championship]]s:''' 6\n**1937, 1938, 1952, 1959, 1974, 2011\n*'''[[Ulster Junior Football Championship]]s:''' 14\n**1914, 1915, 1916, 1924, 1927, 1932, 1936, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1944, 1957, 1962, 1984\n*'''[[Leinster Junior Football Championship]]s:''' 2\n**2012, 2014\n*'''[[Dr. McKenna Cup]]s:''' 11\n**1936, 1940, 1943, 1951, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1962, 1968, 1988, 2000\n===Famous players===\n* [[Simon Deignan]]\n* [[P.

Templeport are the most successful junior team, having won six times.\n\n==Hurling==\n\n===History===\nTraditionally the County board has actively discouraged hurling through their policies football but Hurling has been present in the county. The championship has never been held consistently and at times wasn\u2019t finished. Belturbet won the first [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1908. Hurling was revived in Cavan in 1917. Cavan Slashers were the standout Hurling team of the early period winning the championship in 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1928.  They also won 4-in-a-row between 1933 and 1936.\n\nAgain hurling died away in the county with only eight championships been finished between 1937 and 1981. Ballyhaise won successive championships in 1948 and 1949. Granard won their first championship in 1950 and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] and Cavan Gaels dominated the 1970s and the early 1980s. Bailieborough were victorious in 1966. Cavan Gaels won in 1973 and 1974. Bailieborough won their second championship ten years after the first in 1976 and won again in 1977.\n\n1982 saw the start of Cavan\u2019s most successful period in their Hurling history due to the influence of soldiers from hurling counties such as Kilkenny, Clare and Cork who were stationed at the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the troubles. From 1982 to 1985 Cavan Gaels and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] won 2 Championships each. Bailieborough won in 1982 and 1984 and Cavan Gaels in 1983 and 1985. The County team also had success winning the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985. In-between both Championships they won the [[National Hurling League]] Division 4 in 1984.\n\nWoodford Gaels broke the Cavan Gaels/Bailieborough dominance and won the next 3 championships 1986-1988. No championship was held in 1989 but the 1990s saw the start of the Mullahoran dominance. Mulllahoran won an amazing 21 [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] between 1990 and 2010. Mullahoran\u2019s dominance was finally broken by Ballymachugh who were runners up to Mullahoran 2005, 2008 and 2009. They beat Mullahoran in 2011 on a score of 4-08 to 1-06. No championship took place in 2012 and Mullahoran won their 22nd championship in 2013 beating Cootehill Celtic 0-13 to 0-04. \n\nIn 2011 after a disastrous Division 4 league campaign where they ended with a -157 scoring difference the decision was made to discontinue the senior hurling team resulting in Cavan being the only county in Ireland without a senior hurling representative team for nearly 6 years. \n\nCavan turned out a team for the first time in six years in 2017, and played in the [[Lory Meagher Cup]] in [[2017 Lory Meagher Cup|2017]], and re-entered the [[National Hurling League]] in [[2018 National Hurling League|2018]].\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan won the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985.

They lost to Galway by 4-4 to 0-3 in the 1940 All Ireland semi-final, but drew with Dublin in the 1941 semi-final 4-0 to 3-3, thanks to a last-minute goal from Rita Sullivan, losing the replay 3-4 to 1-1.

There are 8 officers on the Board. For details on the Board's clubs, see [[:Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan|Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan]] and [[List of Gaelic games clubs in Ireland#Cavan]].\nThe Board is subject to the [[Ulster GAA]] Provincial Council.\n{{Cavan GAA clubs|state=collapsed}}\nThe teams of Cavan GAA play home games at [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]]. The current football manager is Mickey Graham, who took over following the resignation of Mattie McGleenan in 2018.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe following is a list of sponsors of the Cavan Senior Football team\n* 1992: Holybrook Construction\n* 1993: Atlanta Conservatories\n* 1994: Cavan Co-op Mart \n* 1995 \u2013 present: [[Kingspan Group]]\nCavan have had only 4 sponsorship deals since sponsors on jerseys were permitted by the GAA in 1991. There was no sponsorship on GAA jerseys until the 2nd game of the Meath V Dublin 4 in a row in 1991 so only a handful of teams had sponsorship in 1991. In 1992 Holybrook Construction sponsored the jerseys although it was only for 1 game. For the 1993-94 seasons Cavan Co-op Mart took over sponsorship. Kingspan has continuously sponsored Cavan since 1995.\n\n===Crest and symbols===\n[[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|left|thumb|100px|Coat of Arms of County Cavan]]\nThe first crest that adorned the Cavan jerseys was the Coat of Arms for [[County Cavan]]. The crest was split into four quadrants and included\n* the red hand of Ulster encased in an outline of the Franciscan Abbey which is situated in Cavan town and where the O'Reilly chieftains are buried. Here also lies the remains of an Ulster leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill. \n*The Rampant Lion from the coat of arms of the O\u2019Reilly clans, who were the local lords.\nIn 2004 Cavan released a new crest for the Breifne County. The crest was designed by the [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|38th President]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] Aog\u00e1n Farrell and Cavan Central Council rep. George Cartwright. The crest draws on cultural, physical and historical influences. The primary colours are blue and white with Ulster's red hand and G.A.A. yellow also prominent. The designers wanted to reflect the following elements\n*Breifne: The ancient Gaelic territory. Modern Cavan was once \"O Reilly country\" and the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Breifne is preserved in the name of the home pitch in Cavan and now on its crest\n*Franciscan Abbey: The mediaeval tower from the Abbey in Cavan Town fills the lower quadrant. Here the O' Reilly\u2019s invited the Franciscans to establish a monastery. The O'Reilly chieftains are buried here. Here also lie the remains of Ulster's great leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill\n*GAA Logo: The GAA modern logo fills the right quadrant. The logo is representative of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].\n*Red Hand 1886:  The first GAA club founded in the province of Ulster was formed in Cavan. [[Ballyconnell First Ulsters GFC|Ballyconnell First Ulsters]] formed in 1885 and affiliated in 1886. The date is preserved in the crest. A red hand has always appeared on Cavan crests. \n*Lakes and Hills: Our landscape is dominated by \"wee lakes and hills\". The environment shapes us and this is reflected on the new crest.\n\n==Gaelic football==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Cavan vs Queens - 2009.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cavan (blue) in action against [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the 2009 [[Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\nThe first GAA club in Cavan and in Ulster was founded in [[Ballyconnell]] in late 1885 called Ballyconnell Joe Biggars in honour of west Cavan Nationalist MP Joe Biggar. The name of the club was later changed to Ballyconnell First Ulsters.\n\nThe very first Cavan County Final, under GAA rules was played in a field outside Cavan Town on 30 April 1887. The final was contested by Ballyconnell First Ulster\u2019s and Maghera MacFinns. MacFinns recorded a famous victory on a score line of 1-4 to First Ulster\u2019s 0-1, thus entering the history books as Cavan\u2019s first Champions.\n\nCavan are the most successful football county in Ulster, having won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] 5 times, the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] 39 times, and the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once.\nCavan's first All-Ireland victory came in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]]. They foiled [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s five-in-a-row bid with a last minute goal from Vincent McGovern in the All-Ireland Semi-Final at Breffni Park 1933, and went on to beat [[Galway GAA|Galway]] by a point in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the final]], to become the first Ulster county to win the Sam Maguire Cup. Two years later, Cavan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1935 final]] to bring home their second title in three years.\n\nCavan's third, and most famous All-Ireland title came in [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], defeating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the famous [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], the only time the final was held outside of Ireland. They followed this up with a one-point win over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], to win back-to-back titles for the first time. They reached their third successive [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1949]], but they were denied a three-in-a-row by [[Meath GAA|Meath]], losing by four points.\nCavan later gained revenge for this defeat, beating Meath after a replay in [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1952]] to bring home their fifth, and so far last, All-Ireland title. Cavan have not appeared in another All-Ireland final since.\n\nHistorically, Cavan have dominated the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], winning a record 39 titles. Despite this, Cavan have won only one Ulster Championship since 1969, this success coming in [[1997_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship#Ulster_Senior_Football_Championship|1997]], after upsetting [[Derry GAA|Derry]] in the final by a point. Cavan's most recent Ulster Final appearance was in [[2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2019]], losing to [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]].\n\nThe current Cavan manager is Mickey Graham.\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan have won the [[All-Ireland Football Championship|All-Ireland Football]] final on 5 occasions \u2013 All 5 victories came between 1933 and 1952.\nMeanwhile, they have won the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championship]] on 39 occasions.

Templeport are the most successful junior team, having won six times.\n\n==Hurling==\n\n===History===\nTraditionally the County board has actively discouraged hurling through their policies football but Hurling has been present in the county. The championship has never been held consistently and at times wasn\u2019t finished. Belturbet won the first [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1908. Hurling was revived in Cavan in 1917. Cavan Slashers were the standout Hurling team of the early period winning the championship in 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1928.  They also won 4-in-a-row between 1933 and 1936.\n\nAgain hurling died away in the county with only eight championships been finished between 1937 and 1981. Ballyhaise won successive championships in 1948 and 1949. Granard won their first championship in 1950 and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] and Cavan Gaels dominated the 1970s and the early 1980s. Bailieborough were victorious in 1966. Cavan Gaels won in 1973 and 1974. Bailieborough won their second championship ten years after the first in 1976 and won again in 1977.\n\n1982 saw the start of Cavan\u2019s most successful period in their Hurling history due to the influence of soldiers from hurling counties such as Kilkenny, Clare and Cork who were stationed at the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the troubles. From 1982 to 1985 Cavan Gaels and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] won 2 Championships each. Bailieborough won in 1982 and 1984 and Cavan Gaels in 1983 and 1985. The County team also had success winning the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985. In-between both Championships they won the [[National Hurling League]] Division 4 in 1984.\n\nWoodford Gaels broke the Cavan Gaels/Bailieborough dominance and won the next 3 championships 1986-1988. No championship was held in 1989 but the 1990s saw the start of the Mullahoran dominance. Mulllahoran won an amazing 21 [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] between 1990 and 2010. Mullahoran\u2019s dominance was finally broken by Ballymachugh who were runners up to Mullahoran 2005, 2008 and 2009. They beat Mullahoran in 2011 on a score of 4-08 to 1-06. No championship took place in 2012 and Mullahoran won their 22nd championship in 2013 beating Cootehill Celtic 0-13 to 0-04. \n\nIn 2011 after a disastrous Division 4 league campaign where they ended with a -157 scoring difference the decision was made to discontinue the senior hurling team resulting in Cavan being the only county in Ireland without a senior hurling representative team for nearly 6 years. \n\nCavan turned out a team for the first time in six years in 2017, and played in the [[Lory Meagher Cup]] in [[2017 Lory Meagher Cup|2017]], and re-entered the [[National Hurling League]] in [[2018 National Hurling League|2018]].\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan won the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985.
