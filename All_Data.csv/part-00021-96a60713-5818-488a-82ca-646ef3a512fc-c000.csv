The '''2003 FIFA Women's World Cup Final''' was an [[association football]] match which determined the winner of the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]], contested by the women's national teams of the member associations of [[FIFA]]. It was played on 12 October 2003 and won by [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]], who defeated [[Sweden women's national football team|Sweden]] 2–1 in [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]].

The tournament was hosted on short notice by the United States, following the withdrawal of China due to an outbreak of [[SARS]], and the final was hosted at the [[Home Depot Center]], a small [[soccer-specific stadium]] in [[Carson, California]], near [[Los Angeles]]. Both finalists had finished at the top of their groups in [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|European qualification]] and met at the final of the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2001|2001 UEFA Women's Championship]], which Germany won.

Sweden went into half-time with a 1–0 lead, but conceded an equalizing goal to Germany early in the second half. The match went to extra time and was decided by a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Nia Künzer]] in the 98th minute.<ref>{{cite news |last=Longman |first=Jere |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/13/sports/soccer-golden-goal-proves-magical-as-germany-captures-women-s-world-cup.html |title=SOCCER; Golden Goal Proves Magical as Germany Captures Women's World Cup|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 October 2003 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/edition=6929/matches/match=69290032/report.html |title=FIFA Women's World Cup USA 2003: Germany - Sweden |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Grahame L. |date=13 October 2003 |title=Germany Hoists Cup With Last Call |page=D1 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/13/sports/sp-wwc13 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=18 May 2019}}</ref>

The '''2003 FIFA Women's World Cup Final''' was an [[association football]] match which determined the winner of the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]], contested by the women's national teams of the member associations of [[FIFA]]. It was played on 12 October 2003 and won by [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]], who defeated [[Sweden women's national football team|Sweden]] 2–1 in [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]].

The tournament was hosted on short notice by the United States, following the withdrawal of China due to an outbreak of [[SARS]], and the final was hosted at the [[Home Depot Center]], a small [[soccer-specific stadium]] in [[Carson, California]], near [[Los Angeles]]. Both finalists had finished at the top of their groups in [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|European qualification]] and met at the final of the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2001|2001 UEFA Women's Championship]], which Germany won.

Sweden went into half-time with a 1–0 lead, but conceded an equalizing goal to Germany early in the second half. The match went to extra time and was decided by a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Nia Künzer]] in the 98th minute.<ref>{{cite news |last=Longman |first=Jere |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/13/sports/soccer-golden-goal-proves-magical-as-germany-captures-women-s-world-cup.html |title=SOCCER; Golden Goal Proves Magical as Germany Captures Women's World Cup|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 October 2003 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/edition=6929/matches/match=69290032/report.html |title=FIFA Women's World Cup USA 2003: Germany - Sweden |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Grahame L. |date=13 October 2003 |title=Germany Hoists Cup With Last Call |page=D1 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/13/sports/sp-wwc13 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=18 May 2019}}</ref>

==Match==

===Summary===

Both teams played with 4–4–2 formations to begin the match, but Germany deployed one of its attackers in a deeper position instead of in tandem up top. Sweden held the majority of possession in the first half, winning more duels in the midfield and delivering several passes and crosses near the German goal, but were unable to score.<ref name=\"FIFA-Analysis\">{{cite report |author=FIFA Technical Study Group |year=2003 |title=FIFA Women's World Cup USA 2003 Report and Statistics |chapter=Technical and Tactical Analysis |page=78 |url=https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/usa-2003-500802.pdf?cloudid=zb4xdbbsb9igeycudpmo |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=21 May 2019 |oclc=85347862 |ref=harv}}</ref> [[Hanna Ljungberg]] scored the opening goal for the Swedes in the 41st minute, but the Germans equalized early in the second half through a volley by [[Maren Meinert]].<ref name=\"FIFA-Analysis\"/><ref>{{cite news |date=12 October 2003 |title=Golden goal gives final to Germany |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/03/en/031012/1/doy.html |work=FIFAworldcup.com |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107025919/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/03/en/031012/1/doy.html |archivedate=7 January 2006 |accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref>

The '''1997 Bank of Ireland [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]''' was the 111th staging of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]]'s premier inter-county [[Gaelic football]] tournament. The championship began on 11 May 1997 and ended on 28 September 1997.

[[Meath GAA|Meath]] entered the championship as the defending champions; however, they were defeated by [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] in the Leinster final.

On 28 September 1997 [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]], the most successful county in Gaelic football history, claimed their 31st All-Ireland title - and their first since 1986 - with a 0-13 to 1-7 victory over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]].

This year also saw Ulster's most successful county, [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]], win their first [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|provincial title]] since 1969.

==Munster Championship format change==
A new 2 year system was introduced in Munster meaning that [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]], [[Cork GAA|Cork]] & [[Clare GAA|Clare]] would have straight access to the Munster semi-finals  for [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]], [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] & [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] would play in a Preliminary Round and the bye team in a lone Quarter final involved.

The '''1997 Bank of Ireland [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]''' was the 111th staging of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]]'s premier inter-county [[Gaelic football]] tournament. The championship began on 11 May 1997 and ended on 28 September 1997.

[[Meath GAA|Meath]] entered the championship as the defending champions; however, they were defeated by [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] in the Leinster final.

On 28 September 1997 [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]], the most successful county in Gaelic football history, claimed their 31st All-Ireland title - and their first since 1986 - with a 0-13 to 1-7 victory over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]].

This year also saw Ulster's most successful county, [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]], win their first [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|provincial title]] since 1969.

==Munster Championship format change==
A new 2 year system was introduced in Munster meaning that [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]], [[Cork GAA|Cork]] & [[Clare GAA|Clare]] would have straight access to the Munster semi-finals  for [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]], [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] & [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] would play in a Preliminary Round and the bye team in a lone Quarter final involved.

{{pizza}}
The '''history of [[pizza]]''' begins in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.

A precursor of pizza was probably the [[focaccia]], a flat bread known to the Romans as {{lang-la|label=none|panis focacius}}, to which toppings were then added.<ref name=Treasures>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Burtan|title=Treasures of the Italian Table|url=https://archive.org/details/treasuresofitali00ande|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow and Company|isbn=978-0688115579|page=[https://archive.org/details/treasuresofitali00ande/page/318 318]}}</ref> Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in [[Naples]], Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.<ref name=Helstosky21>{{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-391-8|pages=21–22}}</ref>

The word ''pizza'' was first documented in A.D. 997&nbsp;in [[Gaeta]]<ref name=autogenerated1>Salvatore Riciniello (1987) ''Codice Diplomatico Gaetano'', Vol. I, La Poligrafica</ref> and successively in different parts of [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.

==Origins==
In [[Sardinia]], French and Italian archaeologists have found bread baked over 7,000 years ago. According to Professor Philippe Marinval, the [[Sardinians|local islanders]] leavened this bread.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/documenti/1_39_20060829130058.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722051846/http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/documenti/1_39_20060829130058.pdf |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Foods similar to pizza have been made since antiquity. Records of people adding other ingredients to [[bread]] to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history.

* An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the [[Aeneid]] (ca. 19 BC), when Celaeno, the [[Harpy]] queen, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, [[Aeneas]] and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dcc.dickinson.edu/eimmart-aeneas-and-trojans-fulfill-anchises-prophecy |title=Aeneas and Trojans fulfill Anchises' prophecy. |access-date=May 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051513/http://dcc.dickinson.edu/eimmart-aeneas-and-trojans-fulfill-anchises-prophecy |archive-date=March 29, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to ''pizzarelle'', which were [[Kashrut|kosher]] for [[Passover]] cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the [[synagogue]] on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nissan |first1=Ephraim |last2=Alinei |first2=Mario |date=2013 |title=Onomastics in Contemporary Public Space |chapter=The Pizza and the Pitta: The Thing and Its Names, Antecedents and Relatives, Ushering Into Globalization |editor1-last=Felecan |editor1-first=Oliviu |editor2-last=Bughesiu |editor2-first=Alina |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pvcwBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA328 |location= |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1443852173}}</ref> [[Abba Eban]] has suggested that modern pizza \"was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to [[Matzo|matzah]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bamberger |first1=David |last2=Eban |first2=Abba Solomon |date=1979 |title=My People: Abba Eban's History of the Jews, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCBtWDabYwkC&pg=PA228 |location= |publisher=Behrman House |page=228 |isbn=0874412803}}</ref>

Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are [[focaccia]] (which may date back as far as the ancient [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]); [[Manakish]] in Lebanon, [[Coca (pastry)|coca]] (which has sweet and savory varieties) from [[Catalonia]], [[Province of Valencia|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]; the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Pita]]; [[Lepinja]] in the [[Balkans]]; or [[Piadina]] in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitit.co.uk/foodrink/pide.html |title=Food and Drink – Pide – HiTiT Turkey guide |publisher=Hitit.co.uk |date= |accessdate=June 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823073849/http://www.hitit.co.uk/foodrink/pide.html |archive-date=August 23, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese [[Bing (bread)|bing]] (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape); the Indian [[paratha]] (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian [[naan]] (leavened) and [[roti]] (unleavened); the Sardinian [[Pane carasau|carasau]], [[spianata]], [[guttiau]], [[pistoccu]]; and Finnish [[Finnish bread#Rieska|rieska]]. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian [[flammkuchen]], German [[zwiebelkuchen]], and French [[quiche]].

In 16th-century [[Naples]], a [[galette]] flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known as the dish for poor people, it was sold in the street and was not considered a kitchen recipe for a long time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobetravelagent.com/history-of-pizza-margherita-recipe/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219074528/http://www.tobetravelagent.com/history-of-pizza-margherita-recipe/|title=History of Pizza Margherita|publisher=tobetravelagent.com |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 9, 2012 |archive-date=2012-12-19}}</ref> This was later replaced by oil, tomatoes (after Europeans came into contact with the Americas) or fish.

Pizza evolved into a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese. However, until the late 19th or early 20th century, the dish was sweet, not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more resembled the flat breads now known as [[schiacciata]].<ref>Alexandra Grigorieva,  \"Naming Authenticity and Regional Italian Cuisine [https://books.google.com/books?lr=lang_en&id=HflTVd898PAC&dq=Pellegrino+Artusi&q=pizza#v=snippet&q=pizza&f=false],\" in Richard Hosking, ed., ''Authenticity in the Kitchen: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2005'' (Prospect Books, 2006): 211–216.</ref> [[Pellegrino Artusi]]'s classic early-twentieth-century cookbook, ''La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene'' gives three recipes for pizza, all of which are sweet.<ref>Pellegrino Artusi, ''La scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene'' (1911; rpr. Torino: Einaudi, 2001)</ref> After the feedback of some readers, Artusi added a typed sheet in the 1911 edition (discovered by food historian Alberto Capatti), bound with the volume, with the recipe of \"pizza alla napoletana\": mozzarella, tomatoes, anchovies and mushrooms.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio e Donatella (2016)  \"Pizze, pizzerie e pizzaiuoli a Napoli tra Sette e Ottocento\" p.35, in ''Pizza. Una grande tradizione italiana''. Bra: Slow Food Publisher</ref>

However, by 1927, Ada Boni's collection of regional cooking includes a recipe using tomatoes and mozzarella.<ref>Grigorieva, Naming Authenticity,\" p. 211-212.</ref>

==Innovation==
The innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of [[tomato]] as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to [[Europe]] from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous, as some other fruits of the ''[[Solanaceae]]'' (nightshade) family are. However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around [[Naples]] to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.

[[Image:Pizzeria Port Alba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba]] in Naples, which is widely believed to be the world's first pizzeria]]
According to documents discovered by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio (2015) ''Inventing the Pizzeria: a History of Pizza Making in Naples'', Bloomsbury Academic, pp.16–17</ref> In the second half of the nineteenth century they increased to 120.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio  ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', Distribution Maps, p.xxxiv</ref>

In Naples, two others figures connected to the trade existed&nbsp;— the pizza hawker (''pizzaiuolo ambulante''), who sold pizza, but did not make it, and the seller of pizza \"a oggi a otto\", who made pizzas, but sold them in return for a payment for seven days.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', p.28</ref>

The [[pizza marinara]] method has a topping of tomato, [[oregano]], [[garlic]], and [[Olive oil#Commercial grades|extra virgin olive oil]]. It is named \"marinara\" because it was traditionally the food prepared by \"la marinara\", the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the [[Gulf of Naples|Bay of Naples]].

The margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker [[Raffaele Esposito]], who worked at restaurant \"Pietro... e basta così\" (\"Pietro... and that's enough\"), established in 1880 and still in business as \"Pizzeria Brandi\". Though recent research casts doubt on this legend,<ref>{{cite web

\"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\"<ref name=\"pizzanapoletana1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/index_eng.php |title=Avpn – Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana |publisher=Pizzanapoletana.org |accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref> (\"True Neapolitan Pizza Association\"), which was founded in 1984, has set the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (''i pizzaioli''&nbsp;— the pizza makers&nbsp;— make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.

There are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto. Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias follow even stricter standards than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.

The pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is \"[[pizza al taglio]]\", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.

In 1962, the \"Hawaiian\" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nosowitz |title=Meet the 81-Year-Old Greek-Canadian Inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-inventor-of-hawaiian-pizza |work=[[Atlas Obscura]] |location=Unknown |date=November 4, 2015 |access-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>

Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small [[List of pizza chains|pizzerias]]. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzone]]s. [[Pizza Pops]] are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.

The most distinct pizza in Canada is the \"Canadian\" pizza. A \"Canadian\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \"[[Canadian bacon]]\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.

In Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer's choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.

In the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy.

With pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as [[Pizza Hut]], [[Domino's Pizza]] and [[Little Caesars]] have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada.

Pizza was brought to the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] area of [[New Jersey]] with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by [[Papa's Tomato Pies]] in 1912. In 1936, [[De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies]] was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20–25 years) and is famous for its New Haven–style Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, [[Sally's Apizza]], on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939.

Before the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants.

The '''history of [[pizza]]''' begins in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.

A precursor of pizza was probably the [[focaccia]], a flat bread known to the Romans as {{lang-la|label=none|panis focacius}}, to which toppings were then added.<ref name=Treasures>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Burtan|title=Treasures of the Italian Table|url=https://archive.org/details/treasuresofitali00ande|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow and Company|isbn=978-0688115579|page=[https://archive.org/details/treasuresofitali00ande/page/318 318]}}</ref> Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in [[Naples]], Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.<ref name=Helstosky21>{{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-391-8|pages=21–22}}</ref>

The word ''pizza'' was first documented in A.D. 997&nbsp;in [[Gaeta]]<ref name=autogenerated1>Salvatore Riciniello (1987) ''Codice Diplomatico Gaetano'', Vol. I, La Poligrafica</ref> and successively in different parts of [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.

==Origins==
In [[Sardinia]], French and Italian archaeologists have found bread baked over 7,000 years ago. According to Professor Philippe Marinval, the [[Sardinians|local islanders]] leavened this bread.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/documenti/1_39_20060829130058.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722051846/http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/documenti/1_39_20060829130058.pdf |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Foods similar to pizza have been made since antiquity. Records of people adding other ingredients to [[bread]] to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history.

* An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the [[Aeneid]] (ca. 19 BC), when Celaeno, the [[Harpy]] queen, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, [[Aeneas]] and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dcc.dickinson.edu/eimmart-aeneas-and-trojans-fulfill-anchises-prophecy |title=Aeneas and Trojans fulfill Anchises' prophecy. |access-date=May 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051513/http://dcc.dickinson.edu/eimmart-aeneas-and-trojans-fulfill-anchises-prophecy |archive-date=March 29, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to ''pizzarelle'', which were [[Kashrut|kosher]] for [[Passover]] cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the [[synagogue]] on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nissan |first1=Ephraim |last2=Alinei |first2=Mario |date=2013 |title=Onomastics in Contemporary Public Space |chapter=The Pizza and the Pitta: The Thing and Its Names, Antecedents and Relatives, Ushering Into Globalization |editor1-last=Felecan |editor1-first=Oliviu |editor2-last=Bughesiu |editor2-first=Alina |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pvcwBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA328 |location= |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1443852173}}</ref> [[Abba Eban]] has suggested that modern pizza \"was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to [[Matzo|matzah]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bamberger |first1=David |last2=Eban |first2=Abba Solomon |date=1979 |title=My People: Abba Eban's History of the Jews, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCBtWDabYwkC&pg=PA228 |location= |publisher=Behrman House |page=228 |isbn=0874412803}}</ref>

Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are [[focaccia]] (which may date back as far as the ancient [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]); [[Manakish]] in Lebanon, [[Coca (pastry)|coca]] (which has sweet and savory varieties) from [[Catalonia]], [[Province of Valencia|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]; the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Pita]]; [[Lepinja]] in the [[Balkans]]; or [[Piadina]] in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitit.co.uk/foodrink/pide.html |title=Food and Drink – Pide – HiTiT Turkey guide |publisher=Hitit.co.uk |date= |accessdate=June 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823073849/http://www.hitit.co.uk/foodrink/pide.html |archive-date=August 23, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese [[Bing (bread)|bing]] (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape); the Indian [[paratha]] (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian [[naan]] (leavened) and [[roti]] (unleavened); the Sardinian [[Pane carasau|carasau]], [[spianata]], [[guttiau]], [[pistoccu]]; and Finnish [[Finnish bread#Rieska|rieska]]. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian [[flammkuchen]], German [[zwiebelkuchen]], and French [[quiche]].

In 16th-century [[Naples]], a [[galette]] flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known as the dish for poor people, it was sold in the street and was not considered a kitchen recipe for a long time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobetravelagent.com/history-of-pizza-margherita-recipe/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219074528/http://www.tobetravelagent.com/history-of-pizza-margherita-recipe/|title=History of Pizza Margherita|publisher=tobetravelagent.com |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 9, 2012 |archive-date=2012-12-19}}</ref> This was later replaced by oil, tomatoes (after Europeans came into contact with the Americas) or fish.

Pizza evolved into a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese. However, until the late 19th or early 20th century, the dish was sweet, not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more resembled the flat breads now known as [[schiacciata]].<ref>Alexandra Grigorieva,  \"Naming Authenticity and Regional Italian Cuisine [https://books.google.com/books?lr=lang_en&id=HflTVd898PAC&dq=Pellegrino+Artusi&q=pizza#v=snippet&q=pizza&f=false],\" in Richard Hosking, ed., ''Authenticity in the Kitchen: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2005'' (Prospect Books, 2006): 211–216.</ref> [[Pellegrino Artusi]]'s classic early-twentieth-century cookbook, ''La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene'' gives three recipes for pizza, all of which are sweet.<ref>Pellegrino Artusi, ''La scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene'' (1911; rpr. Torino: Einaudi, 2001)</ref> After the feedback of some readers, Artusi added a typed sheet in the 1911 edition (discovered by food historian Alberto Capatti), bound with the volume, with the recipe of \"pizza alla napoletana\": mozzarella, tomatoes, anchovies and mushrooms.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio e Donatella (2016)  \"Pizze, pizzerie e pizzaiuoli a Napoli tra Sette e Ottocento\" p.35, in ''Pizza. Una grande tradizione italiana''. Bra: Slow Food Publisher</ref>

However, by 1927, Ada Boni's collection of regional cooking includes a recipe using tomatoes and mozzarella.<ref>Grigorieva, Naming Authenticity,\" p. 211-212.</ref>

==Innovation==
The innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of [[tomato]] as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to [[Europe]] from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous, as some other fruits of the ''[[Solanaceae]]'' (nightshade) family are. However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around [[Naples]] to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.

[[Image:Pizzeria Port Alba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba]] in Naples, which is widely believed to be the world's first pizzeria]]
According to documents discovered by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio (2015) ''Inventing the'' ''Pizzeria: a History of Pizza Making in Naples'', Bloomsbury Academic, pp.16–17</ref> In the second half of the nineteenth century they increased to 120.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio  ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', Distribution Maps, p.xxxiv</ref>

In Naples, two others figures connected to the trade existed&nbsp;— the pizza hawker (''pizzaiuolo ambulante''), who sold pizza, but did not make it, and the seller of pizza \"a oggi a otto\", who made pizzas, but sold them in return for a payment for seven days.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', p.28</ref>

The [[pizza marinara]] method has a topping of tomato, [[oregano]], [[garlic]], and [[Olive oil#Commercial grades|extra virgin olive oil]]. It is named \"marinara\" because it was traditionally the food prepared by \"la marinara\", the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the [[Gulf of Naples|Bay of Naples]].

The margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker [[Raffaele Esposito]], who worked at restaurant \"Pietro... e basta così\" (\"Pietro... and that's enough\"), established in 1880 and still in business as \"Pizzeria Brandi\". Though recent research casts doubt on this legend,<ref>{{cite web

These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (''i pizzaioli''&nbsp;— the pizza makers&nbsp;— make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.

There are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto. Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias follow even stricter standards than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.

The pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is \"[[pizza al taglio]]\", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.

In 1962, the \"Hawaiian\" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nosowitz |title=Meet the 81-Year-Old Greek-Canadian Inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-inventor-of-hawaiian-pizza |work=[[Atlas Obscura]] |location=Unknown |date=November 4, 2015 |access-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>

==Pizza in Canada==
[[Canada]]'s first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/From+archives+Montreal+pizzerias+labour+doughy+love/5974279/story.html|date=April 22, 2014|title=From the archives: Montreal pizzerias, the labour of doughy love|publisher=montrealgazzette.com}}</ref> Starting in the late 1950s, the first pizza ovens started entering the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1 |title=Bringing the first pizza ovens to Canada in the 1950s|publisher=Canada.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318171146/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1|archivedate=March 18, 2016}}</ref> It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small [[List of pizza chains|pizzerias]]. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzone]]s. [[Pizza Pops]] are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.

The most distinct pizza in Canada is the \"Canadian\" pizza. A \"Canadian\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \"[[Canadian bacon]]\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.

In Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer's choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.

In the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese

Some of Canada's successful pizza brands include: [[Boston Pizza]], [[Pizza Pizza]], and Vanelli's. Boston Pizza, also known as BP's in Canada, and \"Boston's—the Gourmet Pizza\" in the United States and Mexico, is one of Canada's largest franchising restaurants.<ref name=\"Boston Pizza Company History\">{{cite web|url=https://bostonpizza.com/assets/mediacentre/documents/pdf/Boston_Pizza_-_Company_History.pdf |title=Boston Pizza Company History |publisher=bostonpizza.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204163437/https://bostonpizza.com/assets/mediacentre/documents/pdf/Boston_Pizza_-_Company_History.pdf | archivedate=February 4, 2016}}</ref> The brand has opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the US.<ref name=\"Boston Pizza Company History\"/> The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1964, and operated under the name \"Boston Pizza & Spaghetti House\", with locations still opening across the nation.

With pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as [[Pizza Hut]], [[Domino's Pizza]] and [[Little Caesars]] have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada.

Conflicting stories have the first pizzeria opening in 1905 when [[Gennaro Lombardi]] applied for a license in New York to make and sell pizza.  One of the generally accepted first US business to sell pizza, [[Lombardi's]], opened in 1897 as a grocery store at 53½ [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]], with [[Trenton tomato pie|tomato pie]]s wrapped in paper and tied with a string at lunchtime to workers from the area's factories. In 1905, putative founder Gennaro Lombardi received a business license to operate a pizzeria restaurant, and soon had a clientele that included Italian tenor [[Enrico Caruso]].

Pizza was brought to the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] area of [[New Jersey]] with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by [[Papa's Tomato Pies]] in 1912. In 1936, [[De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies]] was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20–25 years) and is famous for its New Haven–style Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, [[Sally's Apizza]], on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939.

Before the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants.

'''12''' ('''twelve''') is the [[natural number]] following [[11 (number)|11]] and preceding [[13 (number)|13]]. The [[superfactorial|product of the first 3 factorials]], twelve is a [[superior highly composite number]], divisible by [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], and [[6 (number)|6]].

It is approximately the number of full [[new moon|lunations of the moon]] in a year, and the number of years for a [[Jupiter#Pre-telescopic_research|full cycle of Jupiter]], which was historically considered the brightest \"wandering star\". It is central to many systems of timekeeping, including the [[Gregorian calendar|Western calendar]] and [[time|units of time of day]], and frequently appears in the world’s major religions.

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
Twelve is the largest number with a [[monosyllable|single-syllable]] name in [[English language|English]]. Early [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] numbers have been theorized to have been non-[[decimal]]: evidence includes the unusual phrasing of [[11 (number)|eleven]] and twelve, the [[long hundred|former use of \"hundred\"]] to refer to groups of [[120 (number)|120]], and the presence of glosses such as \"tentywise\" or \"ten-count\" in medieval texts showing that writers could not presume their readers would normally understand them that way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gordon |first = E.

It derives from the [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|twelf}}'' and ''{{lang|ang|tuelf}}'', first attested in the 10th-century [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]' [[Book of John]].{{NoteTag|Specially, a passage referring to [[Judas Iscariot]] as \"one of the [[Twelve Apostles|twelve]]\" (''{{lang|ang|an of ðæm tuelfum}}'').<ref>{{bibleref|John|6:71|KJV}}.</ref>}}<ref name=\"oed\"/> It has cognates in every [[Germanic language]] (e.g. German ''zwölf''), whose [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ancestor has been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|twaliƀi...}}'', from ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|twa}}'' (\"[[2 (number)|two]]\") and suffix ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-lif-}}'' or ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-liƀ-}}'' of uncertain meaning.<ref name=\"oed\" /> It is sometimes compared with the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''{{lang|lt|dvýlika}}'', although ''{{lang|lt|-lika}}'' is used as the suffix for all numbers from 11 to 19 (analogous to \"-teen\").<ref name=\"oed\" /> Every other [[Indo-European language]] instead uses a form of \"[[2 (number)|two]]\"+\"[[10 (number)|ten]]\", such as the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|duōdecim}}''.<ref name=\"oed\" /> The usual [[ordinal number|ordinal form]] is \"twelfth\" but \"dozenth\" or \"duodecimal\" (from the Latin word) is also used in some contexts, particularly [[base-12]] numeration. Similarly, a group of twelve things is usually a \"[[dozen]]\" but may also be referred to as a \"dodecad\" or \"duodecad\". The adjective referring to a group of twelve is \"duodecuple\".

As with [[11 (number)|eleven]],<ref name=\"oedgoesto\">''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. \"eleven, ''adj.'' and ''n.''\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1891.</ref> the earliest forms of twelve are often considered to be connected with Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|liƀan}}'' or ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|liƀan}}'' (\"to leave\"), with the implicit meaning that \"two is left\" after having already counted to ten.<ref name=\"oed\">''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. \"twelve, ''adj.'' and ''n.''\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1916.</ref> The Lithuanian suffix is also considered to share a similar development.<ref name=\"oed\" /> The suffix ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-lif-}}'' has also been connected with reconstructions of the Proto-Germanic for ten.<ref name=\"oedgoesto\"/><ref>{{citation |last=Dantzig |first=Tobias |year = 1930 |title = Number: The Language of Science }}.</ref>

While, as mentioned above, 12 has its own name in Germanic languages such as English, German, and Swedish. It is a compound number in many other languages, e.g. Italian ''dodici'' (but in Spanish and Portuguese, 16, 
and in French, 17 is the first compound number),{{dubious|date=May 2018}} Japanese 十二 ''jūni''.{{clarify|date=May 2018}}


This is not a binding rule, and in English language tradition, it is sometimes recommended to spell out numbers up to and including either ''nine'', ''ten'' or ''twelve'', or even  ''ninety-nine'' or ''one hundred''. Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (''sixteen'', ''twenty-seven'', ''fifteen thousand'', but ''372'' or ''15,001'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/writing_numbers.html|title=Numbers: Writing Numbers // Purdue Writing Lab|first=|date=|website=Purdue Writing Lab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2020}}</ref>
In [[German orthography]], there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve  (''zwölf''). The [[Duden]]{{year needed|date=May 2018}} (the German standard dictionary) mentions this rule as outdated.

==Mathematical properties==
Twelve is a [[composite number]], the smallest number with exactly six [[divisor]]s, its divisors being [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[6 (number)|6]] and 12. Twelve is also a [[highly composite number]], the next one being [[24 (number)|twenty-four]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002182|title=Sloane's A002182 : Highly composite numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>

Twelve is the smallest [[abundant number]], since it is the smallest integer for which the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16) is greater than itself. Twelve is a [[sublime number]], a number that has a [[perfect number]] of divisors, and the sum of its divisors is also a perfect number.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://oeis.org/A081357|title=Sloane's A081357 : Sublime numbers |website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |publisher=OEIS Foundation |access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref> Since there is a subset of 12's proper divisors that add up to 12 (all of them but with 4 excluded), 12 is a [[semiperfect number]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://oeis.org/A005835 |title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers |website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>

If an odd [[perfect number]] is of the form 12''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, it has at least twelve distinct prime factors.

A twelve-sided [[polygon]] is a [[dodecagon]]. A twelve-[[face (geometry)|faced]] [[polyhedron]] is a [[dodecahedron]]. Regular [[cube]]s and [[octahedron]]s both have 12 edges, while regular [[icosahedron]]s have 12 vertices. Twelve is a [[pentagonal number]]. The densest three-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] [[sphere packing]] has each sphere touching 12 others, and this is almost certainly true for ''any'' arrangement of spheres  (the [[Kepler conjecture]]). Twelve is also the [[kissing number]] in three dimensions.

Twelve is the smallest weight for which a [[cusp form]] exists. This cusp form is the discriminant Δ(''q'') whose Fourier coefficients are given by the [[Ramanujan]] {{mvar|&tau;}}-function and which is (up to a constant multiplier) the 24th power of the [[Dedekind eta function]]. This fact is related to a constellation of interesting appearances of the number twelve in mathematics ranging from the value of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at −1 i.e. ζ(−1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;−{{sfrac|12}}, the fact that the abelianization of [[SL(2,Z)]] has twelve elements, and even the properties of lattice polygons.

There are twelve [[Jacobian elliptic function]]s and twelve cubic [[distance-transitive graph]]s.

There are 12 [[Latin square]]s of size 3 × 3.

The [[duodecimal]] system (12<sub>10</sub> [twelve] =&nbsp;10<sub>12</sub>), which is the use of 12 as a division factor for many [[ancient weights and measures|ancient]] and [[medieval weights and measures]], including [[hour]]s, probably originates from [[Mesopotamia]].

In [[base thirteen]] and higher bases (such as [[hexadecimal]]), twelve is represented as C. In [[base 10]], the number 12 is a [[Harshad number]].

==In nature==
Notably, twelve is the number of full [[lunation]]s in a [[solar year]], and the number of [[Jupiter#Pre-telescopic_research|years for a full cycle of Jupiter]] (the brightest of the ancient \"wandering stars\"), hence the number of months in a [[solar calendar]], as well as the number of signs in the [[Western astrology|Western]] and the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]] [[zodiac]].

==Religion==
The number twelve carries religious, mythological and magical  [[symbol]]ism, generally representing perfection, entirety, or cosmic order in traditions since antiquity.{{sfnp|Drews|1972|loc=p. 43, n. 10}}

=== Ancient Greek religion ===
*The [[Twelve Olympians]] are the principal gods of the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], they were preceded by twelve Titans, and [[Hercules]] carries out [[labours of Hercules|twelve labours]].<ref>{{citation |last=Weinreich |first=Th. |contribution=Zwölfgötter |editor-last=Roscher |editor-first=W.H. |display-editors=0 |title=Ausführliches Lexikon der Griechischen und Römischen Mythologie |volume=Vol. VI |at=col. 764-848 }}.</ref> 
*Several sets of twelve cities are identified in history as a [[dodecapolis (disambiguation)|dodecapolis]], the most familiar being the [[Etruscan League]]. In ancient Rome, the twelve [[lictor]]s carried [[fasces]] of twelve rods.

=== Christianity ===
* The significance is especially pronounced in the [[Hebrew Bible]].
[[Ishmael]] - the first-born son of [[Abraham]] - has 12 sons/princes ([[Genesis 25]]:16), and [[Jacob]] also has 12 sons, who are the progenitors of the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]].<ref>\"And it is thought that there is a special significance in the number twelve. It was typified, we know, by many things in the Old Testament ; by the twelve sons of Jacob, by the twelve princes of the children of Israel, by the twelve fountains in Elim, by the twelve stones in Aaron's breast-plate, by the twelve loaves of the shew-bread, by the twelve spies sent by Moses, by the twelve stones of which the altar was made, by the twelve stones taken out of Jordan, by the twelve oxen which bare\"
P. Young, ''Daily readings for a year'' (1863), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fZgEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA150  p. 150].
</ref> This is reflected in Christian tradition, notably  in the [[twelve Apostles]]. When [[Judas Iscariot]] is disgraced, a meeting is held ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]) to add [[Saint Matthias]] to complete the number twelve once more.
The [[Book of Revelation]] contains much numerical symbolism, and many of the numbers mentioned have 12 as a divisor. {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|12:1|31}} mentions a woman&mdash;interpreted as the [[Israelites|people of Israel]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]&mdash;wearing a crown of twelve stars (representing each of the twelve tribes of Israel). Furthermore, there are 12,000 people sealed from each of the twelve tribes of Israel, making a total of [[144000 (number)|144,000]] (which is the square of 12 multiplied by a thousand).
* The \"[[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelve Days of Christmas]]\" count the interval between [[Christmas]] and  [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]]. Eastern Orthodoxy observes twelve [[Great Feasts]].
* The number of twelve jurors in [[jury trial]]s is depicted by [[Aeschylus]] in the ''[[Oresteia#The Eumenides|Eumenides]]''. In the play, the innovation is brought about by the goddess [[Athena]], who summons twelve citizens to sit as jury.
In English Common Law, the tradition of twelve jurors harks back to the 10th-century law code introduced by [[Aethelred the Unready]].

=== Hinduism ===
* There are twelve [[Jyotirlinga]](''Self-formed Lingas'') of Lord [[Shiva]] in Hindu temples across [[India]] according to the Shaiva tradition.
* The Sun god [[Surya]] has 12 names.
* There are 12 Petals in [[Anahata]] or \"heart chakra\".
* There are frequently said to be 12 [[Âdityas]].

=== Others ===
* The chief [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god, [[Odin]], has twelve sons.  
In the King Arthur Legend, Arthur is said to subdue 12 rebel princes and to win 12 great battles against Saxon invaders.<ref>Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia, 3d ed.</ref>

In [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Islam]], there are twelve [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imams]], legitimate successors of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. These twelve early leaders of Islam are&mdash;[[Ali Ben Abu Talib|Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], and nine of Husayn's descendants.
[[Sura 12]] in the [[Quran]] is sura [[Yusuf]], narrating the story of the [[sons of Jacob]].

==Timekeeping==
* The [[lunar year]] is 12 [[lunar months]]. Adding 11 or 12 days completes the [[solar year]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lunar versus solar calendar|url=http://www.ghazali.net/calander/Linar_v_Solar/linar_v_solar.html}}</ref> 
* Most [[Calendar|calendar systems]] - solar or lunar - have twelve months in a [[year]].
* The Chinese use a 12-year cycle for time-reckoning called [[Earthly Branches]].
* There are twelve [[hour]]s in a half day, numbered one to twelve for both the ''ante meridiem'' (a.m.) and the ''post meridiem'' (p.m.). 12:00 p.m. is midday or [[noon]], and 12:00 a.m. is [[midnight]]. 
* The basic units of time (60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 hours) are evenly divisible by twelve into smaller units.

'''12''' ('''twelve''') is the [[natural number]] following [[11 (number)|11]] and preceding [[13 (number)|13]]. The [[superfactorial|product of the first 3 factorials]], twelve is a [[superior highly composite number]], divisible by [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], and [[6 (number)|6]].

It is approximately the number of full [[new moon|lunations of the moon]] in a year, and the number of years for a [[Jupiter#Pre-telescopic_research|full cycle of Jupiter]], which was historically considered the brightest \"wandering star\". It is central to many systems of timekeeping, including the [[Gregorian calendar|Western calendar]] and [[time|units of time of day]], and frequently appears in the world’s major religions.

==Name==
Twelve is the largest number with a [[monosyllable|single-syllable]] name in [[English language|English]]. Early [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] numbers have been theorized to have been non-[[decimal]]: evidence includes the unusual phrasing of [[11 (number)|eleven]] and twelve, the [[long hundred|former use of \"hundred\"]] to refer to groups of [[120 (number)|120]], and the presence of glosses such as \"tentywise\" or \"ten-count\" in medieval texts showing that writers could not presume their readers would normally understand them that way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gordon |first = E.

It derives from the [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|twelf}}'' and ''{{lang|ang|tuelf}}'', first attested in the 10th-century [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]' [[Book of John]].{{NoteTag|Specially, a passage referring to [[Judas Iscariot]] as \"one of the [[Twelve Apostles|twelve]]\" (''{{lang|ang|an of ðæm tuelfum}}'').<ref>{{bibleref|John|6:71|KJV}}.</ref>}}<ref name=\"oed\"/> It has cognates in every [[Germanic language]] (e.g. German ''zwölf''), whose [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ancestor has been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|twaliƀi...}}'', from ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|twa}}'' (\"[[2 (number)|two]]\") and suffix ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-lif-}}'' or ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-liƀ-}}'' of uncertain meaning.<ref name=\"oed\" /> It is sometimes compared with the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''{{lang|lt|dvýlika}}'', although ''{{lang|lt|-lika}}'' is used as the suffix for all numbers from 11 to 19 (analogous to \"-teen\").<ref name=\"oed\" /> Every other [[Indo-European language]] instead uses a form of \"[[2 (number)|two]]\"+\"[[10 (number)|ten]]\", such as the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|duōdecim}}''.<ref name=\"oed\" /> The usual [[ordinal number|ordinal form]] is \"twelfth\" but \"dozenth\" or \"duodecimal\" (from the Latin word) is also used in some contexts, particularly [[base-12]] numeration. Similarly, a group of twelve things is usually a \"[[dozen]]\" but may also be referred to as a \"dodecad\" or \"duodecad\". The adjective referring to a group of twelve is \"duodecuple\".

As with [[11 (number)|eleven]],<ref name=\"oedgoesto\">''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. \"eleven, ''adj.'' and ''n.''\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1891.</ref> the earliest forms of twelve are often considered to be connected with Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|liƀan}}'' or ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|liƀan}}'' (\"to leave\"), with the implicit meaning that \"two is left\" after having already counted to ten.<ref name=\"oed\">''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. \"twelve, ''adj.'' and ''n.''\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1916.</ref> The Lithuanian suffix is also considered to share a similar development.<ref name=\"oed\" /> The suffix ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-lif-}}'' has also been connected with reconstructions of the Proto-Germanic for ten.<ref name=\"oedgoesto\"/><ref>{{citation |last=Dantzig |first=Tobias |year = 1930 |title = Number: The Language of Science }}.</ref>

While, as mentioned above, 12 has its own name in Germanic languages such as English, German, and Swedish. It is a compound number in many other languages, e.g. Italian ''dodici'' (but in Spanish and Portuguese, 16, 
and in French, 17 is the first compound number),{{dubious|date=May 2018}} Japanese 十二 ''jūni''.{{clarify|date=May 2018}}

===Written representation===
In prose writing, ''twelve'', being the last single-syllable numeral, is sometimes taken as the last number to be written as a word, and [[13 (number)|13]] the first to be written using digits.
This is not a binding rule, and in English language tradition, it is sometimes recommended to spell out numbers up to and including either ''nine'', ''ten'' or ''twelve'', or even  ''ninety-nine'' or ''one hundred''. Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (''sixteen'', ''twenty-seven'', ''fifteen thousand'', but ''372'' or ''15,001'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/writing_numbers.html|title=Numbers: Writing Numbers // Purdue Writing Lab|first=|date=|website=Purdue Writing Lab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2020}}</ref>
In [[German orthography]], there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve  (''zwölf''). The [[Duden]]{{year needed|date=May 2018}} (the German standard dictionary) mentions this rule as outdated.

==Mathematical properties==
Twelve is a [[composite number]], the smallest number with exactly six [[divisor]]s, its divisors being [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[6 (number)|6]] and 12. Twelve is also a [[highly composite number]], the next one being [[24 (number)|twenty-four]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002182|title=Sloane's A002182 : Highly composite numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>

Twelve is the smallest [[abundant number]], since it is the smallest integer for which the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16) is greater than itself. Twelve is a [[sublime number]], a number that has a [[perfect number]] of divisors, and the sum of its divisors is also a perfect number.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://oeis.org/A081357|title=Sloane's A081357 : Sublime numbers |website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |publisher=OEIS Foundation |access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref> Since there is a subset of 12's proper divisors that add up to 12 (all of them but with 4 excluded), 12 is a [[semiperfect number]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://oeis.org/A005835 |title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers |website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>

If an odd [[perfect number]] is of the form 12''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, it has at least twelve distinct prime factors.

A twelve-sided [[polygon]] is a [[dodecagon]]. A twelve-[[face (geometry)|faced]] [[polyhedron]] is a [[dodecahedron]]. Regular [[cube]]s and [[octahedron]]s both have 12 edges, while regular [[icosahedron]]s have 12 vertices. Twelve is a [[pentagonal number]]. The densest three-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] [[sphere packing]] has each sphere touching 12 others, and this is almost certainly true for ''any'' arrangement of spheres  (the [[Kepler conjecture]]). Twelve is also the [[kissing number]] in three dimensions.

Twelve is the smallest weight for which a [[cusp form]] exists. This cusp form is the discriminant Δ(''q'') whose Fourier coefficients are given by the [[Ramanujan]] {{mvar|&tau;}}-function and which is (up to a constant multiplier) the 24th power of the [[Dedekind eta function]]. This fact is related to a constellation of interesting appearances of the number twelve in mathematics ranging from the value of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at −1 i.e. ζ(−1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;−{{sfrac|12}}, the fact that the abelianization of [[SL(2,Z)]] has twelve elements, and even the properties of lattice polygons.

There are twelve [[Jacobian elliptic function]]s and twelve cubic [[distance-transitive graph]]s.

There are 12 [[Latin square]]s of size 3 × 3.

The [[duodecimal]] system (12<sub>10</sub> [twelve] =&nbsp;10<sub>12</sub>), which is the use of 12 as a division factor for many [[ancient weights and measures|ancient]] and [[medieval weights and measures]], including [[hour]]s, probably originates from [[Mesopotamia]].

In [[base thirteen]] and higher bases (such as [[hexadecimal]]), twelve is represented as C. In [[base 10]], the number 12 is a [[Harshad number]].

==In nature==
Notably, twelve is the number of full [[lunation]]s in a [[solar year]], and the number of [[Jupiter#Pre-telescopic_research|years for a full cycle of Jupiter]] (the brightest of the ancient \"wandering stars\"), hence the number of months in a [[solar calendar]], as well as the number of signs in the [[Western astrology|Western]] and the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]] [[zodiac]].

==Religion==
The number twelve carries religious, mythological and magical  [[symbol]]ism, generally representing perfection, entirety, or cosmic order in traditions since antiquity.{{sfnp|Drews|1972|loc=p. 43, n. 10}}

=== Ancient Greek religion ===
*The [[Twelve Olympians]] are the principal gods of the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], they were preceded by twelve Titans, and [[Hercules]] carries out [[labours of Hercules|twelve labours]].<ref>{{citation |last=Weinreich |first=Th. |contribution=Zwölfgötter |editor-last=Roscher |editor-first=W.H. |display-editors=0 |title=Ausführliches Lexikon der Griechischen und Römischen Mythologie |volume=Vol. VI |at=col. 764-848 }}.</ref> 
*Several sets of twelve cities are identified in history as a [[dodecapolis (disambiguation)|dodecapolis]], the most familiar being the [[Etruscan League]]. In ancient Rome, the twelve [[lictor]]s carried [[fasces]] of twelve rods.

=== Christianity ===
* The significance is especially pronounced in the [[Hebrew Bible]].
[[Ishmael]] - the first-born son of [[Abraham]] - has 12 sons/princes ([[Genesis 25]]:16), and [[Jacob]] also has 12 sons, who are the progenitors of the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]].<ref>\"And it is thought that there is a special significance in the number twelve. It was typified, we know, by many things in the Old Testament ; by the twelve sons of Jacob, by the twelve princes of the children of Israel, by the twelve fountains in Elim, by the twelve stones in Aaron's breast-plate, by the twelve loaves of the shew-bread, by the twelve spies sent by Moses, by the twelve stones of which the altar was made, by the twelve stones taken out of Jordan, by the twelve oxen which bare\"
P. Young, ''Daily readings for a year'' (1863), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fZgEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA150  p. 150].
</ref> This is reflected in Christian tradition, notably  in the [[twelve Apostles]]. When [[Judas Iscariot]] is disgraced, a meeting is held ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]) to add [[Saint Matthias]] to complete the number twelve once more.
The [[Book of Revelation]] contains much numerical symbolism, and many of the numbers mentioned have 12 as a divisor. {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|12:1|31}} mentions a woman&mdash;interpreted as the [[Israelites|people of Israel]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]&mdash;wearing a crown of twelve stars (representing each of the twelve tribes of Israel). Furthermore, there are 12,000 people sealed from each of the twelve tribes of Israel, making a total of [[144000 (number)|144,000]] (which is the square of 12 multiplied by a thousand).
* The \"[[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelve Days of Christmas]]\" count the interval between [[Christmas]] and  [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]]. Eastern Orthodoxy observes twelve [[Great Feasts]].
* The number of twelve jurors in [[jury trial]]s is depicted by [[Aeschylus]] in the ''[[Oresteia#The Eumenides|Eumenides]]''. In the play, the innovation is brought about by the goddess [[Athena]], who summons twelve citizens to sit as jury.
In English Common Law, the tradition of twelve jurors harks back to the 10th-century law code introduced by [[Aethelred the Unready]].

=== Hinduism ===
* There are twelve [[Jyotirlinga]](''Self-formed Lingas'') of Lord [[Shiva]] in Hindu temples across [[India]] according to the Shaiva tradition.
* The Sun god [[Surya]] has 12 names.
* There are 12 Petals in [[Anahata]] or \"heart chakra\".
* There are frequently said to be 12 [[Âdityas]].

=== Others ===
* The chief [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god, [[Odin]], has twelve sons.  
In the King Arthur Legend, Arthur is said to subdue 12 rebel princes and to win 12 great battles against Saxon invaders.<ref>Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia, 3d ed.</ref>

In [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Islam]], there are twelve [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imams]], legitimate successors of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. These twelve early leaders of Islam are&mdash;[[Ali Ben Abu Talib|Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], and nine of Husayn's descendants.
[[Sura 12]] in the [[Quran]] is sura [[Yusuf]], narrating the story of the [[sons of Jacob]].

==Timekeeping==
* The [[lunar year]] is 12 [[lunar months]]. Adding 11 or 12 days completes the [[solar year]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lunar versus solar calendar|url=http://www.ghazali.net/calander/Linar_v_Solar/linar_v_solar.html}}</ref> 
* Most [[Calendar|calendar systems]] - solar or lunar - have twelve months in a [[year]].
* The Chinese use a 12-year cycle for time-reckoning called [[Earthly Branches]].
* There are twelve [[hour]]s in a half day, numbered one to twelve for both the ''ante meridiem'' (a.m.) and the ''post meridiem'' (p.m.). 12:00 p.m. is midday or [[noon]], and 12:00 a.m. is [[midnight]]. 
* The basic units of time (60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 hours) are evenly divisible by twelve into smaller units.

*The [[Standard Model]] identifies twelve types of elementary [[fermion]]s.
*The human body has twelve [[cranial nerves]].
*The [[duodenum]] (from Latin ''duodecim,'' \"twelve\") is the first part of the [[small intestine]], that is about twelve inches (30&nbsp;cm) long. More precisely, this section of the intestine was measured not in inches but in [[finger]]widths. In fact, in [[German language|German]] the name of the duodenum is ''Zwölffingerdarm'' and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] the name is ''twaalfvingerige darm'', both meaning \"twelve-finger bowel\".
*Force 12 on the [[beaufort scale|Beaufort wind force scale]] corresponds to the maximum wind speed of a hurricane.

==In sports==

* In both [[soccer]] and [[American football]], the number 12 can be a symbolic reference to the [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]]s because of the support they give to the 11 players on the field. [[Texas A&M University]] reserves the number 12 [[number (sports)|jersey]] for a walk-on player who represents the original [[12th Man (football)|\"12th Man\"]], a fan who was asked to play when the team's reserves were low in a college [[American football]] game in 1922. Similarly, [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby]], [[Feyenoord]], [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]], [[Clube de Regatas Flamengo|Flamengo]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Cork City FC|Cork City]] do not allow field players to wear the number 12 on their jersey because it is reserved for their supporters.
* In [[Canadian football]], 12 is the maximum number of players that can be on the field of play for each team at any time.
* In [[cricket]], another sport with eleven players per team, teams may select a \"12th man\", who may replace an injured player for the purpose of fielding (but not batting or bowling).
* In [[women's lacrosse]], each team has 12 players on the field at any given time, except in penalty situations.
* In [[rugby league]], one of the starting second-row forwards wears the number 12 jersey in most competitions. An exception is in the [[Super League]], which uses static squad numbering.
* In [[rugby union]], one of the starting centres, most often but not always the inside centre, wears the 12 shirt.
* In an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game, a quarter lasts 12 minutes.

===Music===
====Music theory====
*Twelve is the number of [[pitch class]]es in an [[octave]], not counting the duplicated (octave) pitch. Also, the total number of [[major key]]s, (not counting [[enharmonic]] equivalents) and the total number of [[minor key]]s (also not counting equivalents). This applies only to twelve tone [[equal temperament]], the most common tuning used today in western influenced music.
*The twelfth is the [[Interval (music)|interval]] of an octave and a fifth. Instruments such as the [[clarinet]] which behave as a stopped cylindrical pipe [[overblowing|overblow]] at the twelfth.
*The [[twelve-tone technique]] (also dodecaphony) is a method of [[musical composition]] devised by [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Music using the technique is called twelve-tone music.
*The [[Twelve-bar blues]] is one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music.
*12-inch record, see [[Phonograph record#78 rpm disc sizes]].

'''''The Munsters''''' is an American [[sitcom]] depicting the home life of a family of benign [[monster]]s starring [[Fred Gwynne]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]]-type head-of-the-household [[Herman Munster]]; [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as his [[vampire]] wife, [[Lily Munster]]; [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa]], the over-the-hill vampire who relishes talking about the \"good old days\"; [[Beverley Owen]] (later replaced by [[Pat Priest (actress)|Pat Priest]]) as their teenage niece [[Marilyn Munster]], whose all-American beauty made her the family outcast; and [[Butch Patrick]] as their half-vampire, half-[[werewolf]] son [[Eddie Munster]]. The series was a [[satire]] of both traditional [[monster movie]]s and the wholesome family fare of the era, and was produced by the creators of ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Munsters: The Complete First Season|publisher= [[DVD Talk]] |date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/11996/munsters-the-complete-first-season-the/ |accessdate= December 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= The Munsters: The Complete Series|publisher= [[DVD Talk]]|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34944/munsters-the-complete-series-the/ |accessdate= December 7, 2010}}</ref> It ran concurrently with the similarly macabre themed ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' (which aired on [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]) and achieved higher figures in the [[Nielsen ratings]].

==Plot==

The Munsters live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane in the city of Mockingbird Heights, a fictional suburb in California. The running gag of the series is that the family, while decidedly odd, consider themselves fairly typical working-class people of the era. Herman, like many husbands of the 1960s, is the sole wage-earner in the family, though Lily and Grandpa make (short-lived) attempts to earn money from time to time. While Herman is the head of the household, Lily makes many decisions, too. According to the episode in which Lily and Herman Munster were trying to surprise one another for their anniversary, they were married in 1865. Despite the novel approach of the family being (mostly) supernatural creatures (except for niece Marilyn, who is \"normal\"), the show followed the typical family sitcom formula of the era: the well-meaning father, the nurturing mother, the eccentric live-in relative, the naïve teenager, and the precocious child.

The costumes and appearances of the family members other than Marilyn were based on the [[Universal Classic Monsters|classic monsters of Universal Studios]] films from the 1930s and 1940s. Universal produced ''The Munsters'' as well and was thus able to use these copyrighted designs, including their iconic version of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Herman.<ref name=first>{{cite video|year=2003 |title=The Munsters: America's First Family of Fright|medium=Television production }}</ref> Other studios were free to make films with the Frankenstein creature, for example, but could not use the costume and style of make-up originally created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] for the 1931 [[Universal Studios]] film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. The make-up for the show was created and applied to the actors by [[Bud Westmore]], who pioneered many make-up effects and designs for many of the Universal monster movies.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea of a family of comical [[monsters]] was first suggested to [[Universal Studios]] by animator [[Bob Clampett]], who developed the idea from 1943 to 1945 as a series of [[cartoons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96y-V5chpgkC&pg=PA106&dq=bob+clampett+%22monster+family%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=johoVd-VI8rkoASKuIDgCg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=bob%20clampett%20%22monster%20family%22&f=false|title=The Frankenstein Archive|publisher=}}</ref> The project did not take off until the early 1960s, when a proposal for a similar idea was submitted to [[Universal Studios]] by ''[[Rocky & Bullwinkle]]'' writers [[Allan Burns]] and [[Chris Hayward]]. The proposal was later handed to writers Norm Liebman and Ed Haas, who wrote a pilot script, ''Love Thy Monster''. For some time, there were executives who believed the series should be made as a [[cartoon]] and others who wanted to see it made using live-action. Finally, a presentation was filmed by [[MCA Television]] for [[CBS]], using live-action.<ref name=first/>

The show was produced by [[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]], who were already known for creating the ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' television series. Prior to that, they wrote over 1,500 episodes of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', a presence on network radio for nearly its entire history.

===Filming===
Originally conceived as a color show, ''The Munsters'' was ultimately filmed in [[black-and-white]] to save money and to resemble the old B&W monster films Universal and other studios used to make. Over the course of season one (completed by Season 1, Episode 7 \"Tin Can Man\"), makeup for Herman, Lily, and Grandpa was changed. Some of the changes included Lily's hair becoming all black instead of having a gray/white streak on the right side of her head, a change of jewelry to a bat instead of a star, and angled eyebrows. Grandpa was given more exaggerated makeup and heavier eyebrows, and Herman's face was widened to give him a dopier and less human appearance. He also added a stutter to bolster his character whenever he was angry or wanted to make a point, and he frequently left his mouth open, adding to the effect of a more goofy, less frightening, figure.

===Sets===
{{Main|Munster Mansion}}
While its humor was usually broad, the series was visually sophisticated. The Munsters' home was a crumbling [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] [[Victorian Architecture#Styles conceived in the Victorian era|Victorian]] mansion, riddled with smoke, filthy with dust and cobwebs. A running joke was that when Lily \"dusted\" the house, her Electrolux emitted clouds of dust, which she applied to surfaces most people would clean. As a running gag, parts of the house would often be damaged (mostly by Herman's tantrums or clumsiness), but the damage would not exist later. Although many episodes featured scenes outside the house, much of the action took place within the walls of the home.

[[File:Fred Gwynne Yvonne DeCarlo The Munsters 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|Herman and Lily in the kitchen]]
The Munster family's multi-level Victorian home had the fictional address of 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Mockingbird Heights. (The town's location is not specified in the series, but in later incarnations, it is described as a small town outside Los Angeles. [[Leo Durocher]], who was then coaching with the Los Angeles Dodgers, guest-starred as himself in one episode, further hinting that the show was set in, or near, Los Angeles.) The exterior shots were filmed on the Universal Studios backlot. In the 1950s, it was assembled with other homes on the backlot. Until production of ''The Munsters'' in 1964, the house could be seen as a backdrop on many shows, including ''[[Leave It to Beaver]].''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=Billy |title=Tvparty!: Television's Untold Tales|year=2002|publisher=Bonus Books, Inc.|isbn=1-566-25184-2|page=228}}</ref> It was also the home of the family in ''[[Shirley (TV series)|Shirley]]'' (NBC, 1979–80) and has appeared in other TV shows such as ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and (after a remodel) ''[[Desperate Housewives]].'' The interiors for the Munsters' mansion were filmed entirely on an enclosed [[sound stage]].
[[File:Munsterkoach.JPG|thumb|right|The Munster Koach]]

===Props===
In the fourth episode (\"Rock-A-Bye Munster\"), Lily buys a hot-rod and a hearse from a used car dealership and has them customized into one car (Munster Koach) for Herman's birthday present. The Munster Koach and DRAG-U-LA were designed by Tom Daniel and built by auto customizer [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the show. The \"[[Munster Koach]]\" was a [[hot rod]] built on a lengthened 1926 [[Ford Model T]] chassis with a custom hearse body. It was 18 feet long and cost almost $20,000 to build. Barris also built the \"[[DRAG-U-LA]],\" a dragster built from a coffin (according to Barris, a real coffin was, in fact, purchased for the car), which Grandpa used to win back \"The Munster Koach\" after Herman lost it in a race.

===Theme song===
The instrumental theme song, titled \"The Munsters's Theme\", was composed by composer/arranger [[Jack Marshall (composer)|Jack Marshall]].<ref name=\"cox2\">{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Cox (writer) |last2=De Carlo |first2=Yvonne |authorlink2=Yvonne De Carlo |first3=Butch |last3=Patrick |authorlink3=Butch Patrick |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-8230-7894-9 |oclc=68192546 |chapter=Munster Maestro: About Jack Marshall}}</ref> The theme song's lyrics, which the sitcom's co-producer Bob Mosher wrote, were never aired on CBS. Described by writer [[Jon Burlingame]] as a \"[[Bernard Herrmann|Bernard-Herrmann]]-meets-[[Duane Eddy|Duane-Eddy]] sound\",<ref name=\"cox\"/> the theme was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1965. A sample of the theme was used in the song \"[[Uma Thurman (song)|Uma Thurman]]\" by [[Fall Out Boy]].

Butch Patrick later recorded a song called \"Whatever Happened To Eddie?,\" which is set to The Munsters theme.

==Episodes==
===Pitch episode===
[[File:Munsters cast 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|1964 cast photo with Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily and Butch Patrick as Eddie]]
The first [[television pilot#Presentation|presentation]] was 16 minutes and in color (later cut to just over 13 minutes) and was used to pitch the series to CBS and its affiliates. It never aired, and the script was reused as the basis for episode 2, \"My Fair Munster\". The cast in order of appearance in the title sequence was: [[Joan Marshall]] as Phoebe (instead of Lily), Beverley Owen as Marilyn, Nate \"Happy\" Derman as Eddie, [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as Grandpa, and [[Fred Gwynne]] as Herman. Although the same house exterior was later used in the actual aired series, it was changed at that point to make it look more gothic and \"spooky\". Changes included adding the tower deck and Marilyn's deck, a new coat of paint, and enlarging the [[living room]]. Although Grandpa had the same [[dungeon]], Herman did not have padding in the pitch episode, had a more protruding forehead, and was broad but thin. The most noticeable difference was his somber expression, compared to his comical silliness during the series.<ref name=\"cox\">{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=35–36}}</ref> All characters, except Marilyn, had a blue-green [[tint]] to their skin. The biggest character difference was that Eddie was portrayed by Derman as a nasty brat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=36, 38}}</ref>

The title sequence had light, happy music (picked up from the [[Doris Day]] movie ''[[The Thrill of It All (film)|The Thrill of It All]]'')<ref name=\"Biography\"/> instead of the more hip [[surf music|surf]] theme that was to come. The episode is available on the complete first season of ''The Munsters'' DVDs. It was also decided that Joan Marshall looked too much like [[Morticia Addams]]<ref name=\"Biography\"/> and that Happy Derman was too nasty as Eddie, so both were replaced.<ref name=\"Biography\">[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]], \"The Munsters,\" 1998</ref> On the basis of the first presentation, the new series, still not completely cast, was announced by CBS on February 18, 1964. A second [[black-and-white]] presentation was made with the new actors. In this version, [[Butch Patrick]]'s Eddie appeared with a more \"normal\" look, although his [[hairstyle]] was later altered to include a [[widow's peak]].

===1965 Easter special===
During season one, the Munster family appeared in an Easter special, when they visited [[Marineland of the Pacific]] in Palos Verdes, California, to get a new pet for Eddie. Shot on videotape, it aired just once on CBS on April 18, and was long thought [[lost television broadcast|lost]] until a copy was donated to the Paley Center in New York in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title= Munsterland|url= http://www.munsterland.net/marineland.html|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Pop Colorture|url=http://pop-colorture.com/2016/10/30/trick-or-treat-the-munsters-scare-up-some-fun-in-this-newly-discovered-holiday-special/|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref>

{{Main|The Munsters Today}}
A sequel television series titled, ''The Munsters Today'', ran from 1988 to 1991 and lasted for 72 episodes. The unaired pilot episode, written by [[Lloyd J. Schwartz]], explained the 22-year gap through an accident in Grandpa's lab that put the family to sleep. They awake in the late 1980s and have to adapt to their new surroundings. It featured [[John Schuck]] (Herman), [[Lee Meriwether]] (Lily), [[Howard Morton]] (Grandpa), and [[Jason Marsden]] (Eddie). Marilyn was portrayed by Mary-Ellen Dunbar in the unaired pilot, and by [[Hilary Van Dyke]] thereafter.

A remake from ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'' creator [[Bryan Fuller]], was developed for NBC.

==Merchandise==
[[Gold Key Comics]] produced a ''Munsters'' [[comic book]] which ran 16 issues from 1965 to 1968 and had photo covers from the TV series. When it first appeared, the [[Comics Code Authority]] still forbade the appearance of [[vampire]]s in comic books. However, this was not a problem at Gold Key, because Gold Key was not a member of the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]] and therefore did not have to conform to the Comics Code. Lily and Grandpa appeared in the comics without controversy.

Other merchandise included a set of rubber [[squeaky toy]]s, [[Colorforms]], and an [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] model kit of the living room and family. AMT produced model kits of the Munster Koach as well as Drag-u-La. The Aurora model of the living room featured Herman in his electric chair, Eddie squatting in front of the fire, Lily was knitting and Grandpa was hanging, bat like, from the rafters. Marilyn was not included. ERTL later produced a very detailed 1:18 scale diecast of the Munster Koach. Mattel issued two Herman Munster Dolls, one was a talking doll and the other was a hand puppet (both having chatty rings that you could pull to make them talk utilizing Gwynne's actual voice) that were issued from 1964 until around 1968.

A video game based on ''The Munsters'' was published by \"Again, Again\" (a division of [[Alternative Software]]) in 1989. It was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]], and [[DOS]], but was heavily criticized by gaming press at the time because of its short length and lackluster game play.<ref>{{WoS game|id=0003329|name=The Munsters}}</ref>

In 1990, [[Atari Corporation]] released ''[[Midnight Mutants]]'' for the [[Atari 7800]], featuring Al Lewis' likeness in his Grampa Munster character on the box art and label art. However, since Atari did not sign an agreement with Universal, they could not call him \"Grampa Munster\"; he was simply called \"Grampa\".

The first episode guide for the series was written by Richard H. Campbell for Media Sight #3, 1981.

[[Sawyer's]] [[View-Master]] Stereo Pictures issued a 3-D reel set of The Munsters depicting the episode \"The Most Beautiful Ghoul in the World\" in 1966, Packet No. B 481. The set contains three reels, each with seven 3-D views, as well as a small booklet containing drawings and additional text. The View-Master set is notable because the photographs provide rare color views of the characters and sets, including house interiors and Grandpa's dungeon laboratory. The photos are an accurate depiction of the characters' makeup as designed for black and white filming. Herman, Eddie, and Grandpa all wear heavy greenish-white facial makeup, which contrasts noticeably with their un-made-up hands and wrists. Lily, besides heavy facial makeup, has light greenish-white makeup on her hands and wrists. Marilyn, identified on the packet as \"Daughter Marilyn,\" is of course in non-character \"normal\" makeup.

'''''The Munsters''''' is an American [[sitcom]] depicting the home life of a family of benign [[monster]]s starring [[Fred Gwynne]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]]-type head-of-the-household [[Herman Munster]]; [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as his [[vampire]] wife, [[Lily Munster]]; [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa]], the over-the-hill vampire who relishes talking about the \"good old days\"; [[Beverley Owen]] (later replaced by [[Pat Priest (actress)|Pat Priest]]) as their teenage niece [[Marilyn Munster]], whose all-American beauty made her the family outcast; and [[Butch Patrick]] as their half-vampire, half-[[werewolf]] son [[Eddie Munster]].

==Plot==

The Munsters live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane in the city of Mockingbird Heights, a fictional suburb in California. The running gag of the series is that the family, while decidedly odd, consider themselves fairly typical working-class people of the era. Herman, like many husbands of the 1960s, is the sole wage-earner in the family, though Lily and Grandpa make (short-lived) attempts to earn money from time to time. While Herman is the head of the household, Lily makes many decisions, too. According to the episode in which Lily and Herman Munster were trying to surprise one another for their anniversary, they were married in 1865. Despite the novel approach of the family being (mostly) supernatural creatures (except for niece Marilyn, who is \"normal\"), the show followed the typical family sitcom formula of the era: the well-meaning father, the nurturing mother, the eccentric live-in relative, the naïve teenager, and the precocious child.

The costumes and appearances of the family members other than Marilyn were based on the [[Universal Classic Monsters|classic monsters of Universal Studios]] films from the 1930s and 1940s. Universal produced ''The Munsters'' as well and was thus able to use these copyrighted designs, including their iconic version of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Herman.<ref name=first>{{cite video|year=2003 |title=The Munsters: America's First Family of Fright|medium=Television production }}</ref> Other studios were free to make films with the Frankenstein creature, for example, but could not use the costume and style of make-up originally created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] for the 1931 [[Universal Studios]] film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. The make-up for the show was created and applied to the actors by [[Bud Westmore]], who pioneered many make-up effects and designs for many of the Universal monster movies.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea of a family of comical [[monsters]] was first suggested to [[Universal Studios]] by animator [[Bob Clampett]], who developed the idea from 1943 to 1945 as a series of [[cartoons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96y-V5chpgkC&pg=PA106&dq=bob+clampett+%22monster+family%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=johoVd-VI8rkoASKuIDgCg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=bob%20clampett%20%22monster%20family%22&f=false|title=The Frankenstein Archive|publisher=}}</ref> The project did not take off until the early 1960s, when a proposal for a similar idea was submitted to [[Universal Studios]] by ''[[Rocky & Bullwinkle]]'' writers [[Allan Burns]] and [[Chris Hayward]]. The proposal was later handed to writers Norm Liebman and Ed Haas, who wrote a pilot script, ''Love Thy Monster''. For some time, there were executives who believed the series should be made as a [[cartoon]] and others who wanted to see it made using live-action. Finally, a presentation was filmed by [[MCA Television]] for [[CBS]], using live-action.<ref name=first/>

The show was produced by [[Joe Connelly (producer)|Joe Connelly]] and [[Bob Mosher]], who were already known for creating the ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' television series. Prior to that, they wrote over 1,500 episodes of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', a presence on network radio for nearly its entire history.

===Filming===
Originally conceived as a color show, ''The Munsters'' was ultimately filmed in [[black-and-white]] to save money and to resemble the old B&W monster films Universal and other studios used to make. Over the course of season one (completed by Season 1, Episode 7 \"Tin Can Man\"), makeup for Herman, Lily, and Grandpa was changed. Some of the changes included Lily's hair becoming all black instead of having a gray/white streak on the right side of her head, a change of jewelry to a bat instead of a star, and angled eyebrows. Grandpa was given more exaggerated makeup and heavier eyebrows, and Herman's face was widened to give him a dopier and less human appearance. He also added a stutter to bolster his character whenever he was angry or wanted to make a point, and he frequently left his mouth open, adding to the effect of a more goofy, less frightening, figure.

===Sets===
{{Main|Munster Mansion}}
While its humor was usually broad, the series was visually sophisticated. The Munsters' home was a crumbling [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] [[Victorian Architecture#Styles conceived in the Victorian era|Victorian]] mansion, riddled with smoke, filthy with dust and cobwebs. A running joke was that when Lily \"dusted\" the house, her Electrolux emitted clouds of dust, which she applied to surfaces most people would clean. As a running gag, parts of the house would often be damaged (mostly by Herman's tantrums or clumsiness), but the damage would not exist later. Although many episodes featured scenes outside the house, much of the action took place within the walls of the home.

[[File:Fred Gwynne Yvonne DeCarlo The Munsters 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|Herman and Lily in the kitchen]]
The Munster family's multi-level Victorian home had the fictional address of 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Mockingbird Heights. (The town's location is not specified in the series, but in later incarnations, it is described as a small town outside Los Angeles. [[Leo Durocher]], who was then coaching with the Los Angeles Dodgers, guest-starred as himself in one episode, further hinting that the show was set in, or near, Los Angeles.) The exterior shots were filmed on the Universal Studios backlot. In the 1950s, it was assembled with other homes on the backlot. Until production of ''The Munsters'' in 1964, the house could be seen as a backdrop on many shows, including ''[[Leave It to Beaver]].''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=Billy |title=Tvparty!: Television's Untold Tales|year=2002|publisher=Bonus Books, Inc.|isbn=1-566-25184-2|page=228}}</ref> It was also the home of the family in ''[[Shirley (TV series)|Shirley]]'' (NBC, 1979–80) and has appeared in other TV shows such as ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and (after a remodel) ''[[Desperate Housewives]].'' The interiors for the Munsters' mansion were filmed entirely on an enclosed [[sound stage]].

===Props===
In the fourth episode (\"Rock-A-Bye Munster\"), Lily buys a hot-rod and a hearse from a used car dealership and has them customized into one car (Munster Koach) for Herman's birthday present. The Munster Koach and DRAG-U-LA were designed by Tom Daniel and built by auto customizer [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the show. The \"[[Munster Koach]]\" was a [[hot rod]] built on a lengthened 1926 [[Ford Model T]] chassis with a custom hearse body. It was 18 feet long and cost almost $20,000 to build. Barris also built the \"[[DRAG-U-LA]],\" a dragster built from a coffin (according to Barris, a real coffin was, in fact, purchased for the car), which Grandpa used to win back \"The Munster Koach\" after Herman lost it in a race.

===Theme song===
The instrumental theme song, titled \"The Munsters's Theme\", was composed by composer/arranger [[Jack Marshall (composer)|Jack Marshall]].<ref name=\"cox2\">{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Cox (writer) |last2=De Carlo |first2=Yvonne |authorlink2=Yvonne De Carlo |first3=Butch |last3=Patrick |authorlink3=Butch Patrick |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-8230-7894-9 |oclc=68192546 |chapter=Munster Maestro: About Jack Marshall}}</ref> The theme song's lyrics, which the sitcom's co-producer Bob Mosher wrote, were never aired on CBS. Described by writer [[Jon Burlingame]] as a \"[[Bernard Herrmann|Bernard-Herrmann]]-meets-[[Duane Eddy|Duane-Eddy]] sound\",<ref name=\"cox\"/> the theme was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1965. A sample of the theme was used in the song \"[[Uma Thurman (song)|Uma Thurman]]\" by [[Fall Out Boy]].

Butch Patrick later recorded a song called \"Whatever Happened To Eddie?,\" which is set to The Munsters theme.

==Episodes==
===Pitch episode===
[[File:Munsters cast 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|1964 cast photo with Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily and Butch Patrick as Eddie]]
The first [[television pilot#Presentation|presentation]] was 16 minutes and in color (later cut to just over 13 minutes) and was used to pitch the series to CBS and its affiliates. It never aired, and the script was reused as the basis for episode 2, \"My Fair Munster\". The cast in order of appearance in the title sequence was: [[Joan Marshall]] as Phoebe (instead of Lily), Beverley Owen as Marilyn, Nate \"Happy\" Derman as Eddie, [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] as Grandpa, and [[Fred Gwynne]] as Herman. Although the same house exterior was later used in the actual aired series, it was changed at that point to make it look more gothic and \"spooky\". Changes included adding the tower deck and Marilyn's deck, a new coat of paint, and enlarging the [[living room]]. Although Grandpa had the same [[dungeon]], Herman did not have padding in the pitch episode, had a more protruding forehead, and was broad but thin. The most noticeable difference was his somber expression, compared to his comical silliness during the series.<ref name=\"cox\">{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=35–36}}</ref> All characters, except Marilyn, had a blue-green [[tint]] to their skin. The biggest character difference was that Eddie was portrayed by Derman as a nasty brat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Stephen |title=The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-823-07894-9|pages=36, 38}}</ref>

The title sequence had light, happy music (picked up from the [[Doris Day]] movie ''[[The Thrill of It All (film)|The Thrill of It All]]'')<ref name=\"Biography\"/> instead of the more hip [[surf music|surf]] theme that was to come. The episode is available on the complete first season of ''The Munsters'' DVDs. It was also decided that Joan Marshall looked too much like [[Morticia Addams]]<ref name=\"Biography\"/> and that Happy Derman was too nasty as Eddie, so both were replaced.<ref name=\"Biography\">[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]], \"The Munsters,\" 1998</ref> On the basis of the first presentation, the new series, still not completely cast, was announced by CBS on February 18, 1964. A second [[black-and-white]] presentation was made with the new actors. In this version, [[Butch Patrick]]'s Eddie appeared with a more \"normal\" look, although his [[hairstyle]] was later altered to include a [[widow's peak]].

===1965 Easter special===
During season one, the Munster family appeared in an Easter special, when they visited [[Marineland of the Pacific]] in Palos Verdes, California, to get a new pet for Eddie. Shot on videotape, it aired just once on CBS on April 18, and was long thought [[lost television broadcast|lost]] until a copy was donated to the Paley Center in New York in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title= Munsterland|url= http://www.munsterland.net/marineland.html|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Pop Colorture|url=http://pop-colorture.com/2016/10/30/trick-or-treat-the-munsters-scare-up-some-fun-in-this-newly-discovered-holiday-special/|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref>

==Merchandise==
[[Gold Key Comics]] produced a ''Munsters'' [[comic book]] which ran 16 issues from 1965 to 1968 and had photo covers from the TV series. When it first appeared, the [[Comics Code Authority]] still forbade the appearance of [[vampire]]s in comic books. However, this was not a problem at Gold Key, because Gold Key was not a member of the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]] and therefore did not have to conform to the Comics Code. Lily and Grandpa appeared in the comics without controversy.

Other merchandise included a set of rubber [[squeaky toy]]s, [[Colorforms]], and an [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] model kit of the living room and family. AMT produced model kits of the Munster Koach as well as Drag-u-La. The Aurora model of the living room featured Herman in his electric chair, Eddie squatting in front of the fire, Lily was knitting and Grandpa was hanging, bat like, from the rafters. Marilyn was not included. ERTL later produced a very detailed 1:18 scale diecast of the Munster Koach. Mattel issued two Herman Munster Dolls, one was a talking doll and the other was a hand puppet (both having chatty rings that you could pull to make them talk utilizing Gwynne's actual voice) that were issued from 1964 until around 1968.

A video game based on ''The Munsters'' was published by \"Again, Again\" (a division of [[Alternative Software]]) in 1989. It was available for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]], and [[DOS]], but was heavily criticized by gaming press at the time because of its short length and lackluster game play.<ref>{{WoS game|id=0003329|name=The Munsters}}</ref>

In 1990, [[Atari Corporation]] released ''[[Midnight Mutants]]'' for the [[Atari 7800]], featuring Al Lewis' likeness in his Grampa Munster character on the box art and label art. However, since Atari did not sign an agreement with Universal, they could not call him \"Grampa Munster\"; he was simply called \"Grampa\".

The first episode guide for the series was written by Richard H. Campbell for Media Sight #3, 1981.

[[Sawyer's]] [[View-Master]] Stereo Pictures issued a 3-D reel set of The Munsters depicting the episode \"The Most Beautiful Ghoul in the World\" in 1966, Packet No. B 481. The set contains three reels, each with seven 3-D views, as well as a small booklet containing drawings and additional text. The View-Master set is notable because the photographs provide rare color views of the characters and sets, including house interiors and Grandpa's dungeon laboratory. The photos are an accurate depiction of the characters' makeup as designed for black and white filming. Herman, Eddie, and Grandpa all wear heavy greenish-white facial makeup, which contrasts noticeably with their un-made-up hands and wrists. Lily, besides heavy facial makeup, has light greenish-white makeup on her hands and wrists. Marilyn, identified on the packet as \"Daughter Marilyn,\" is of course in non-character \"normal\" makeup.

'''Schumacher Racing Products''' (or just '''Schumacher''') is a British manufacturer of [[radio-controlled car]]s and accessories with a primary focus on high-end racing products.
[[Image:Schumacher GTR stock body off.jpg|thumb|right|Stock Schumacher Menace GTR with body off.]]

== History ==

===Foundation===
The founder, Cecil Schumacher, was a [[Cosworth]] transmission engineer who was recruited from [[Borg Warner]] to lead the design team to adapt the Hobbs transmission (which he had worked on) to handle the [[Cosworth DFV]]'s power. Cecil spotted his workmates driving radio-controlled cars on the company's helipad and decided it needed a [[ball differential]] after noticing the cars skittered.   He soon started noticing large areas that these early primitive cars could be improved. Having noticed high tyre wear he introduced the [[ball differential]] to radio-controlled cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Cecil|publisher=RC Racing TV|year=2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsIX5J9mbhs|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Burr|2015|p=156 }}

These ball differentials were used by his son Robin then his friends then local model shop requested to stock it and soon international orders followed. It came to the point that Cecil Schumacher was making more money from this side business than through his employer. So in 1981 Schumacher Racing Products was formed in [[Northampton]], England.

The company has always operated out of Northampton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioracecar.com/article.aspx?a=4875 |title=The Hobby Hub |publisher=Radioracecar.com |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> but sourced some components from China like most other successful RC companies; however, the majority of manufacturing remains in England and Schumacher remains very much an English company. Cecil Schumacher's son Robin Schumacher took over the business in 2001.

===1980s===
The first car to be produced by Schumacher was the XL Lexan chassis pan car in 1981 which had intentionally highly flexible chassis suitable for indoor racing. This was followed in 1983 by the \"C\" car which was made out of fibreglass reinforced epoxy resin sheet and designed specifically for racing on carpet. It included many features that are still around on every modern 1/12-scale car; race wins include the euros in 1985 and 1988.

In the latter half of the 1980s, [[off-road]] RC cars increased in popularity. In 1986 the first [[4WD]] [[1:10 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1/10-scale off-road buggy]] was launched, called the SWB CAT. This launched the CAT (Competition All Terrain) brand for Schumacher. This first variant SWB (Short Wheel Base) 4WD car was an instant success with serious RC fans with its popularity cemented into history when [[Masami Hirosaka]] won the 1987 [[IFMAR]] off-road RC World Championships<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUSO_QwBrhU |title=Past IFMAR WC´s – 1987 IFMAR Worlds Championship |via=YouTube |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> having been lent a works car after Schumacher scouts noted his driving form during practice sessions.

===1990s===
Following the success of the first generation of off-road CATs, Schumacher continued to produce many successful off and on-road electric cars. The popularity of the touring car class seriously affected the off-road world during the 1990s. Schumacher stepped down the development of this class through the 1990s. Schumacher was then starting to dominate a niche in the \"fun\" car sector, with high-power/speed [[Nitromethane|nitro]]-powered models capable of real speeds in excess of 80&nbsp;mph.

===2000s===
Over the turn of this century the Schumacher product line-up became quite familiar with the \"fun\" cars with increasing number of nitro products; however it remained in the 1/10 competition touring cars market. 

===2010s===
The flood of cheap high-volume low-margin ready to run cars produced in Asia meant the company no longer produce a nitro car or fun car. Schumacher now concentrate on the high level 1/10-scale electrical competitive market. Alongside their Mi touring car range the company re-entered the off-road scene with the CAT SX (4WD) and Cougar SV (2WD). Vintage racing of older designed cars became popular with Schumacher re-releasing the CAT XLS in 2017 and then the Top Cat. In the mid 2010s a move was made to help the sport grow with the introduction of a number of lower priced competition cars. The Mi1 touring car was introduced alongside the ever evolving top spec version. And then a move was made to re-establish 1/12th electric carpet racing with the launch of the Supastock and Eclipse range. It also increased its distrution business of other none competing RC products.

===2020s===
In January 2020 Schumacher won IFMAR 1/12 World Championships held in [[Milton Keynes]]

'''Schumacher Racing Products''' (or just '''Schumacher''') is a British manufacturer of [[radio-controlled car]]s and accessories with a primary focus on high-end racing products.
[[Image:Schumacher GTR stock body off.jpg|thumb|right|Stock Schumacher Menace GTR with body off.]]

== History ==

===Foundation===
The founder, Cecil Schumacher, was a [[Cosworth]] transmission engineer who was recruited from [[Borg Warner]] to lead the design team to adapt the Hobbs transmission (which he had worked on) to handle the [[Cosworth DFV]]'s power. Cecil spotted his workmates driving radio-controlled cars on the company's helipad and decided it needed a [[ball differential]] after noticing the cars skittered.   He soon started noticing large areas that these early primitive cars could be improved. Having noticed high tyre wear he introduced the [[ball differential]] to radio-controlled cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Cecil|publisher=RC Racing TV|year=2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsIX5J9mbhs|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Burr|2015|p=156 }}

These ball differentials were used by his son Robin then his friends then local model shop requested to stock it and soon international orders followed. It came to the point that Cecil Schumacher was making more money from this side business than through his employer. So in 1981 Schumacher Racing Products was formed in [[Northampton]], England.

The company has always operated out of Northampton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioracecar.com/article.aspx?a=4875 |title=The Hobby Hub |publisher=Radioracecar.com |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> but sourced some components from China like most other successful RC companies; however, the majority of manufacturing remains in England and Schumacher remains very much an English company. Cecil Schumacher's son Robin Schumacher took over the business in 2001.

===1980s===
The first car to be produced by Schumacher was the XL Lexan chassis pan car in 1981 which had intentionally highly flexible chassis suitable for indoor racing. This was followed in 1983 by the \"C\" car which was made out of fibreglass reinforced epoxy resin sheet and designed specifically for racing on carpet. It included many features that are still around on every modern 1/12-scale car; race wins include the euros in 1985 and 1988.

In the latter half of the 1980s, [[off-road]] RC cars increased in popularity. In 1986 the first [[4WD]] [[1:10 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1/10-scale off-road buggy]] was launched, called the SWB CAT. This launched the CAT (Competition All Terrain) brand for Schumacher. This first variant SWB (Short Wheel Base) 4WD car was an instant success with serious RC fans with its popularity cemented into history when [[Masami Hirosaka]] won the 1987 [[IFMAR]] off-road RC World Championships<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUSO_QwBrhU |title=Past IFMAR WC´s – 1987 IFMAR Worlds Championship |via=YouTube |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> having been lent a works car after Schumacher scouts noted his driving form during practice sessions.

===1990s===
Following the success of the first generation of off-road CATs, Schumacher continued to produce many successful off and on-road electric cars. The popularity of the touring car class seriously affected the off-road world during the 1990s. Schumacher stepped down the development of this class through the 1990s. Schumacher was then starting to dominate a niche in the \"fun\" car sector, with high-power/speed [[Nitromethane|nitro]]-powered models capable of real speeds in excess of 80&nbsp;mph.

===2000s===
Over the turn of this century the Schumacher product line-up became quite familiar with the \"fun\" cars with increasing number of nitro products; however it remained in the 1/10 competition touring cars market. 

===2010s===
The flood of cheap high-volume low-margin ready to run cars produced in Asia meant the company no longer produce a nitro car or fun car. Schumacher now concentrate on the high level 1/10-scale electrical competitive market. Alongside their Mi touring car range the company re-entered the off-road scene with the CAT SX (4WD) and Cougar SV (2WD). Vintage racing of older designed cars became popular with Schumacher re-releasing the CAT XLS in 2017 and then the Top Cat. In the mid 2010s a move was made to help the sport grow with the introduction of a number of lower priced competition cars. The Mi1 touring car was introduced alongside the ever evolving top spec version. And then a move was made to re-establish 1/12th electric carpet racing with the launch of the Supastock and Eclipse range. It also increased its distrution business of other none competing RC products.

===2020s===
In January 2020 Schumacher won IFMAR 1/12 World Championships held in [[Milton Keynes]]

The '''Way of the Celestial Masters''' is a Chinese [[Daoist]] movement that was founded by [[Zhang Daoling]] in 142 CE.<ref name=\"Woolf2007\">{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Zhang+Daoling|year=2007|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=218}}</ref> They rebelled against the Han Dynasty and won their independence in 194.

===Way of the Five Pecks of Rice===
{{Main|Way of the Five Pecks of Rice}}
{{Taoism}}
In 142 CE Zhang Daoling announced that [[Laozi]] had appeared to him and commanded him to rid the world of decadence and establish a new state consisting only of the ‘chosen people.’ Zhang became the first Celestial Master, and began to spread his newly founded movement throughout the province of Sichuan. The movement was initially called the \"Way of the Five Pecks of Rice\", because each person wishing to join was required to donate five [[peck]]s of rice.<ref>Hendrischke (2000), p. 139.</ref> The movement spread rapidly, particularly under his son {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Heng (Taoist)|zh|3=张衡 (道教)|lt=Zhang Heng}} and grandson [[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]].<ref name=Hend140>Hendrischke (2000), p. 140.</ref> Their rebellion against the [[Han dynasty]] is known as the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion. After the success of the rebellion in 194, they founded the theocratic state of Zhang Han in the Hanzhong Valley of Sichuan, enjoying full independence.<ref name=\"Hend140\"/>

In 215, Zhang Lu submitted to [[Cao Cao]], the ruler of the Wei Kingdom, surrendering his state in exchange for gaining state religion status for Tianshi Daoism. Zhang was given a title and land, as were several other family members and generals.  His daughter was married to Cao Cao’s son, [[Cao Yu (playwright)|Cao Yu]].  His followers were forced to resettle in other parts of China, with one group being sent to the [[Chang'an]] area, and another being sent to [[Luoyang]]. Zhang relocated to the Han court until the Han Dynasty changed to the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. He then used his own popularity as a religious leader to lend legitimacy to the Wei, proclaiming that the Wei court had inherited divine authority from the Tao church, as well as from Confucian laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===The Southern Celestial Masters===
After the fall of [[Luoyang]] to non-Chinese invaders in 311, the remnants of the court fled to Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]]) and established a new state known as the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Eastern Jin]] dynasty. Among the court members who fled were members of the Celestial Masters. There is also evidence that after Zhang Lu’s submission to Cao Cao, numerous adherents fled south from Sichuan. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Celestial Master Daoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters. The Southern Celestial Masters lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.

===The Northern Celestial Masters===
{{Main|The Northern Celestial Masters}}
[[Kou Qianzhi]], who was raised in a Celestial Master family, received two visions of Laozi in 415 and in 423. In 424, he brought the work that resulted from these visions to the court of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty. The rulers put his works into practice, and Kou became the Celestial Master of the Daoist theocracy of the Northern Wei. After Kou died in 448, the prime minister, [[Cui Hao]], became power hungry and began to insult the Wei rulers. Unhappy with his insubordination, the rulers had Cui executed in 450, and ended the Daoist theocracy.

===The Celestial Masters today===
{{Main|Zhengyi Dao}}
During the Yuan Dynasty, the [[Zhengyi Dao]] School of Daoism claimed lineage to the Celestial Masters.  They became one of the two leading schools of Daoism in China, along with [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Dao]].  Zhengyi Daoists became common in the [[Jiangxi]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Fujian]] provinces of China, as well as in [[Taiwan]].

The Celestial Masters have survived into the 20th century. In 1949, after the communists gained power in the mainland, the 64th Celestial Master, [[Zhang Enpu]], fled to [[Taiwan]].<ref>\"[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts---leisure/2008/12/15/187654/Who%E2%80%99s-going.htm Who’s going to be the 65th Taoist pope?],\" ''The China Post'', December 15, 2008.</ref> After his death, a succession dispute arose between different branches of the family in Taiwan and mainland China.

In fact, the Way of the Celestial Masters have flourished during the reign of Communism.  They regularly ordain priests at the Zhengyi Monastery at the Celestial Master’s Mansion in Mainland China.

==Beliefs and practices==
[[Image:Zhang Daoling.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master]]
Each of the three different eras of the Celestial Masters had distinct beliefs. However, because the Southern and Northern Celestial Masters both descended directly from the initial movement founded by Zhang Daoling, there are many beliefs that are shared. A number of texts exist that give insight into early Celestial Master practice, in particular the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' and the ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the Laozi.

The foundation of Daoist belief is that there is an energy source known as [[qi]] that pervades all things. The human body also contains qi, but it only has a limited amount of qi. Qi could be lost from the body through things such as sweating and ejaculation. The Celestial Masters shared these foundational Daoist beliefs, but modified them slightly.

One such change was that illness was caused by [[sin]]. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring that the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and [[kowtow]]ing to heaven. Illness could also be cured in other ways as well, among them using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.

Sexual practices (known as [[heqi]], or 'The Union of the Breaths') were not part of Celestial Master Daoism. While the School of the Naturalists (and offshoot schools) advocate not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain,' the Celestial Masters frowned upon this, and simply advocated celibacy as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the macrobiotic method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 83.</ref>

==Significance==

The Celestial Masters were the first group of organized Daoists. Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] movements.

===Way of the Five Pecks of Rice===
{{Main|Way of the Five Pecks of Rice}}
{{Taoism}}
In 142 CE Zhang Daoling announced that [[Laozi]] had appeared to him and commanded him to rid the world of decadence and establish a new state consisting only of the ‘chosen people.’ Zhang became the first Celestial Master, and began to spread his newly founded movement throughout the province of Sichuan. The movement was initially called the \"Way of the Five Pecks of Rice\", because each person wishing to join was required to donate five [[peck]]s of rice.<ref>Hendrischke (2000), p. 139.</ref> The movement spread rapidly, particularly under his son {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Heng (Taoist)|zh|3=张衡 (道教)|lt=Zhang Heng}} and grandson [[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]].<ref name=Hend140>Hendrischke (2000), p. 140.</ref> Their rebellion against the [[Han dynasty]] is known as the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion. After the success of the rebellion in 184, they founded the theocratic state of Zhang Han in the Hanzhong Valley of Sichuan, enjoying full independence.<ref name=\"Hend140\"/>

In 215, Zhang Lu submitted to [[Cao Cao]], the ruler of the Wei Kingdom, surrendering his state in exchange for gaining state religion status for Tianshi Daoism. Zhang was given a title and land, as were several other family members and generals.  His daughter was married to Cao Cao’s son, [[Cao Yu (playwright)|Cao Yu]].  His followers were forced to resettle in other parts of China, with one group being sent to the [[Chang'an]] area, and another being sent to [[Luoyang]]. Zhang relocated to the Han court until the Han Dynasty changed to the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. He then used his own popularity as a religious leader to lend legitimacy to the Wei, proclaiming that the Wei court had inherited divine authority from the Tao church, as well as from Confucian laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===The Southern Celestial Masters===
After the fall of [[Luoyang]] to non-Chinese invaders in 311, the remnants of the court fled to Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]]) and established a new state known as the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Eastern Jin]] dynasty. Among the court members who fled were members of the Celestial Masters. There is also evidence that after Zhang Lu’s submission to Cao Cao, numerous adherents fled south from Sichuan. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Celestial Master Daoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters. The Southern Celestial Masters lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.

===The Northern Celestial Masters===
{{Main|The Northern Celestial Masters}}
[[Kou Qianzhi]], who was raised in a Celestial Master family, received two visions of Laozi in 415 and in 423. In 424, he brought the work that resulted from these visions to the court of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty. The rulers put his works into practice, and Kou became the Celestial Master of the Daoist theocracy of the Northern Wei. After Kou died in 448, the prime minister, [[Cui Hao]], became power hungry and began to insult the Wei rulers. Unhappy with his insubordination, the rulers had Cui executed in 450, and ended the Daoist theocracy.

===The Celestial Masters today===
{{Main|Zhengyi Dao}}
During the Yuan Dynasty, the [[Zhengyi Dao]] School of Daoism claimed lineage to the Celestial Masters.  They became one of the two leading schools of Daoism in China, along with [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Dao]].  Zhengyi Daoists became common in the [[Jiangxi]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Fujian]] provinces of China, as well as in [[Taiwan]].

The Celestial Masters have survived into the 20th century. In 1949, after the communists gained power in the mainland, the 64th Celestial Master, [[Zhang Enpu]], fled to [[Taiwan]].<ref>\"[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts---leisure/2008/12/15/187654/Who%E2%80%99s-going.htm Who’s going to be the 65th Taoist pope?],\" ''The China Post'', December 15, 2008.</ref> After his death, a succession dispute arose between different branches of the family in Taiwan and mainland China.

In fact, the Way of the Celestial Masters have flourished during the reign of Communism.  They regularly ordain priests at the Zhengyi Monastery at the Celestial Master’s Mansion in Mainland China.

==Beliefs and practices==
[[Image:Zhang Daoling.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master]]
Each of the three different eras of the Celestial Masters had distinct beliefs. However, because the Southern and Northern Celestial Masters both descended directly from the initial movement founded by Zhang Daoling, there are many beliefs that are shared. A number of texts exist that give insight into early Celestial Master practice, in particular the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' and the ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the Laozi.

The foundation of Daoist belief is that there is an energy source known as [[qi]] that pervades all things. The human body also contains qi, but it only has a limited amount of qi. Qi could be lost from the body through things such as sweating and ejaculation. The Celestial Masters shared these foundational Daoist beliefs, but modified them slightly.

One such change was that illness was caused by [[sin]]. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring that the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and [[kowtow]]ing to heaven. Illness could also be cured in other ways as well, among them using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.

Sexual practices (known as [[heqi]], or 'The Union of the Breaths') were not part of Celestial Master Daoism. While the School of the Naturalists (and offshoot schools) advocate not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain,' the Celestial Masters frowned upon this, and simply advocated celibacy as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the macrobiotic method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 83.</ref>

==Significance==

The Celestial Masters were the first group of organized Daoists. Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] movements.

'''Beckenham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|k|ən|ə|m}}) is a town in [[Greater London]], England, within the [[London Borough of Bromley]]. It borders Beckenham Place Park and [[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]] in the [[London Borough of Lewisham]] (to the north) and is centred {{convert|8.4|miles|km}} south-east of [[Charing Cross]]. Its population at the 2011 census counted 46,844 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202755/http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Beckenham is in the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Kent]].

Beckenham was, until the coming of the railway in 1857, a small village, with most of its land being rural and private parkland. [[John Barwell Cator]] and his family began the leasing and selling of land for the building of villas which led to a rapid increase in population, between 1850 and 1900, from 2,000 to 26,000. Housing and population growth has continued at a lesser pace since 1900.

The town, directly west of [[Bromley]], has areas of commerce and industry, principally around the curved network of streets featuring its high street and is served in transport by three main railway stations &mdash; nine within the post town &mdash; plus towards its western periphery two [[Tramlink]] stations. In common with the rest of Bromley, the largest borough of London by area, Beckenham has several pockets of recreational land which are a mixture of sports grounds, fishing ponds and parks.

==Etymology==
The place-name 'Beckenham' is first attested in a Saxon charter of 862 as ''Biohhahema mearc''.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.33.</ref>
The settlement is referred to as ''Bacheham'' in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and in the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'' as ''Becceham''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> The name is thought to derive from ''Beohha'''s homestead (Beohha + ham in [[Old English]]).<ref name=Brewer>Brewer's Britain and Ireland, compiled by John Ayto and Ian Crofton, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-304-35385-X}}.</ref> The name of the small stream here – the River Beck – is most likely to have been named after the village. Other variants of the  name Beckingham (can be confused with a place in Lincolnshire) or Beghenham. (sources: British History Online, The National Archive).

==History==
[[File:Beckenham2.jpg|thumb|left|Central Beckenham, flooded in 1878.]]

Although early written history tells little of the area, archaeological evidence at Holwood Park, where [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] artifacts have been found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] camp was sited here, and a [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]], the [[London to Lewes Way (Roman road)|London to Lewes Way]] passed through the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenhamhistory.co.uk/beckenhamearlyhistory.html|title=Search|work=beckenhamhistory.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://www.beckenhamplaceparkfriends.org.uk/index.html</ref>

With the arrival of the [[Normans]], the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham. St George's Church was built in the 12th century. In the Middle Ages, the manor lands were divided: The other estates of Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley form the bulk of Beckenham. Beckenham still remained a small village until well into the 19th century. The beginning of its growth began after 1825 When the estates of John Cator and Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydir began to be developed. In 1760, (source: Peter Collinson, Cator's father in law, in his <ref>Hortus Collinsonianus</ref>) [[John Cator]] built Beckenham Place and became Lord of the Manor in 1773 after purchasing the Manor of Beckenham from Frederick St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke. After he died in 1806, his heirs (Joseph Cator's sons) soon became aware that the area in such close proximity to London was ripe for development, especially once the railway had arrived in 1857; and large villas began to be built around the new station. Wide roads and large gardens epitomised these properties often built by developers who acquired land from the Cators.(sources: Bromley Historic Collections catalogue; Cator)
Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydir died in 1820 and his estates were purchased by the Hoare banking family and the Goodharts who purchased Langley. These estates were subsequently split up and developed. 
Between then and the early 20th century, further growth of Beckenham took place: the [[Shortlands]] area in 1863; Clock House in the 1890s; [[Elmers End]] in 1911 (where smaller suburban houses were built); Park Langley in 1908; and Eden Park in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |title=Ideal Homes: Suburbia in Focus |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921071901/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |archive-date=21 September 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Manor of Foxgrove was also broken up at some point: its name is commemorated in a local road.

Beckenham is a [[suburb]] and a town in its own right with a non-bypassed non-pedestrianised [[high street]] on a route between the rest of the borough and [[South London]] and has spread about its centre on 15 pre-1850 houses which are [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|title=About Beckenham Town Centre & Historical Information  - Beckenham TownTalk|work=towntalk.co.uk|access-date=4 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023142937/http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|archive-date=23 October 2009|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261534|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 1-3 Kelsey Square</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261549|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 4-7 Kelsey Square</ref>

{{See also|Municipal Borough of Beckenham}}

==Governance==
The [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]] came into being in 1935. It took over from what had been, since 1894, Beckenham [[Urban District Council]] and included parts of [[Hayes, Kent|Hayes]] and [[West Wickham]], previously part of Bromley [[Rural District Council]]. The new Borough status reflected the growth of Beckenham in less than fifty years.<ref>In 1861 its population was 2,100; by 1921 this had increased to 33,300, and to 77,300 by 1961. ''Kent History Illustrated''
Frank W Jessup, 1966 Kent County Council</ref>

In 1965, as part of the creation of the [[Greater London Council]], the Borough council was disbanded and Beckenham came under control of the newly constituted [[London Borough of Bromley]]. Councillors represent various parts of the Borough of Beckenham. Beckenham Town Centre Management coordinates business interests in the town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bromley.gov.uk/business/towncentres/beckenham_town_centre.htm |title=Beckenham Town Centre Management |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119234908/http://www.bromley.gov.uk/business/towncentres/beckenham_town_centre.htm |archive-date=19 November 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Copers Cope Road looking North West - geograph.org.uk - 299347.jpg|thumb|left|Copers Cope Road, near New Beckenham station, looking northwest]]
Beckenham lies {{convert|1.7|mi|km}} west of [[Bromley]] and {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} north-east of [[Croydon]].

The original village of Beckenham was a [[nucleated village|cluster of development in its own fields]] at what is now the north. Around it were the great manorial estates: Beckenham, Foxgrove, Kelsey and Langley [[manor|Halls and Parks]].

The [[River Ravensbourne]] flows northwards at the eastern side of the town, towards its confluence with the [[River Thames]]. A small stream, the River Beck (sometimes referred to as the Hawkesbrook), passes through the town before joining the Ravensbourne via the Pool River further north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788&strquery=Beckenham|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>

The area is part of an outcrop of [[London Clay]] and consists of many small hills.<ref>''The Rural Landscape of Kent'' S.G.McRae & C.P.Burnham, published by Wye College, 1973</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Shops, Beckenham Road, Beckenham - geograph.org.uk - 1581947.jpg|thumb|left|Victorian commercial buildings along Beckenham Road]]
Despite its leafy image, its close proximity to Central London and nine railway stations within the post town (Beckenham Junction, Clock House, Birkbeck, New Beckenham, Ravensbourne, Kent House, Elmers End, Eden Park and Beckenham Hill), make Beckenham a good business location. The town's busy high street contains many restaurants and upmarket chains, as well as family-run independents, and the area has a good selection of well performing schools. Beckenham is the headquarters to [[Capita]] Registrars Limited who provide share registration services for more than half of the UK's quoted companies, [[Proper Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10089363.stm|title=How to sell music the Proper way|work=BBC News}}</ref> the UK's biggest independent music distributor and [[Vizual]], a leading HR software developer.

==Landmarks==
One of the interesting landmarks in Beckenham is the [[Chinese Garage]], now a listed building. It is built in an unusual Japanese pagoda style and formerly operated as a car dealership selling [[Peugeot]] and [[Kia Motors|Kia]] cars. Its future is currently being decided. There is also [[St George's Church, Beckenham|St George's Church]], dating back to 1100 but mostly rebuilt at the end of the 19th century. The [[lych gate]] dates from the 13th century, and is one of the oldest in England; the almshouses date back to 1694. There are two old pubs, Ye Olde George Inn (1662), and the Three Tuns (now a branch of [[Zizzi]] restaurants).

[[Kelsey Park]] is another landmark. It was part of the Kelsey Estate, but the mansion no longer remains. The only surviving buildings are the two [[Listed building|Grade II]] listed lodge cottages at the entrance, which are over 200 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-358444-two-lodges-to-beckenham-place-bromley|title=Two Lodges to Beckenham Place - Bromley - Greater London - England - British Listed Buildings|author=Good Stuff|work=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk}}</ref>

'''Beckenham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|k|ən|ə|m}}) is a town in [[Greater London]], England, within the [[London Borough of Bromley]]. It borders Beckenham Place Park and [[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]] in the [[London Borough of Lewisham]] (to the north) and is centred {{convert|8.4|miles|km}} south-east of [[Charing Cross]]. Its population at the 2011 census counted 46,844 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202755/http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Beckenham is in the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Kent]].

Beckenham was, until the coming of the railway in 1857, a small village, with most of its land being rural and private parkland. [[John Barwell Cator]] and his family began the leasing and selling of land for the building of villas which led to a rapid increase in population, between 1850 and 1900, from 2,000 to 26,000. Housing and population growth has continued at a lesser pace since 1900.

The town, directly west of [[Bromley]], has areas of commerce and industry, principally around the curved network of streets featuring its high street and is served in transport by three main railway stations &mdash; nine within the post town &mdash; plus towards its western periphery two [[Tramlink]] stations. In common with the rest of Bromley, the largest borough of London by area, Beckenham has several pockets of recreational land which are a mixture of sports grounds, fishing ponds and parks.

==Etymology==
The place-name 'Beckenham' is first attested in a Saxon charter of 862 as ''Biohhahema mearc''.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.33.</ref>
The settlement is referred to as ''Bacheham'' in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and in the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'' as ''Becceham''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> The name is thought to derive from ''Beohha'''s homestead (Beohha + ham in [[Old English]]).<ref name=Brewer>Brewer's Britain and Ireland, compiled by John Ayto and Ian Crofton, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-304-35385-X}}.</ref> The name of the small stream here – the River Beck – is most likely to have been named after the village. Other variants of the  name Beckingham (can be confused with a place in Lincolnshire) or Beghenham. (sources: British History Online, The National Archive). 

==History==
[[File:Beckenham2.jpg|thumb|left|Central Beckenham, flooded in 1878.]]

Although early written history tells little of the area, archaeological evidence at Holwood Park, where [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] artifacts have been found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] camp was sited here, and a [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]], the [[London to Lewes Way (Roman road)|London to Lewes Way]] passed through the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenhamhistory.co.uk/beckenhamearlyhistory.html|title=Search|work=beckenhamhistory.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://www.beckenhamplaceparkfriends.org.uk/index.html</ref>

With the arrival of the [[Normans]], the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham. St George's Church was built in the 12th century. In the Middle Ages, the manor lands were divided: The other estates of Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley form the bulk of Beckenham. Beckenham still remained a small village until well into the 19th century. The beginning of its growth began after 1825 When the estates of John Cator and Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydir began to be developed. In 1760,(source: Peter Collinson, Cator's father in law, in his <ref>Hortus Collinsonianus</ref>) [[John Cator]] built Beckenham Place and became Lord of the Manor in 1773 after purchasing the Manor of Beckenham from Frederick St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke. After he died in 1806, his heirs (Joseph Cator's sons) soon became aware that the area in such close proximity to London was ripe for development, especially once the railway had arrived in 1857; and large villas began to be built around the new station. Wide roads and large gardens epitomised these properties often built by developers who acquired land from the Cators.(sources: Bromley Historic Collections catalogue; Cator)
Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydir died in 1820 and his estates were purchased by the Hoare banking family and the Goodharts who purchased Langley. These estates were subsequently split up and developed. 
Between then and the early 20th century, further growth of Beckenham took place: the [[Shortlands]] area in 1863; Clock House in the 1890s; [[Elmers End]] in 1911 (where smaller suburban houses were built); Park Langley in 1908; and Eden Park in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |title=Ideal Homes: Suburbia in Focus |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921071901/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |archive-date=21 September 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Manor of Foxgrove was also broken up at some point: its name is commemorated in a local road.

Beckenham is a [[suburb]] and a town in its own right with a non-bypassed non-pedestrianised [[high street]] on a route between the rest of the borough and [[South London]] and has spread about its centre on 15 pre-1850 houses which are [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|title=About Beckenham Town Centre & Historical Information  - Beckenham TownTalk|work=towntalk.co.uk|access-date=4 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023142937/http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|archive-date=23 October 2009|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261534|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 1-3 Kelsey Square</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261549|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 4-7 Kelsey Square</ref>

{{See also|Municipal Borough of Beckenham}}

==Governance==
The [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]] came into being in 1935. It took over from what had been, since 1894, Beckenham [[Urban District Council]] and included parts of [[Hayes, Kent|Hayes]] and [[West Wickham]], previously part of Bromley [[Rural District Council]]. The new Borough status reflected the growth of Beckenham in less than fifty years.<ref>In 1861 its population was 2,100; by 1921 this had increased to 33,300, and to 77,300 by 1961. ''Kent History Illustrated''
Frank W Jessup, 1966 Kent County Council</ref>

In 1965, as part of the creation of the [[Greater London Council]], the Borough council was disbanded and Beckenham came under control of the newly constituted [[London Borough of Bromley]]. Councillors represent various parts of the Borough of Beckenham. Beckenham Town Centre Management coordinates business interests in the town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bromley.gov.uk/business/towncentres/beckenham_town_centre.htm |title=Beckenham Town Centre Management |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119234908/http://www.bromley.gov.uk/business/towncentres/beckenham_town_centre.htm |archive-date=19 November 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Copers Cope Road looking North West - geograph.org.uk - 299347.jpg|thumb|left|Copers Cope Road, near New Beckenham station, looking northwest]]
Beckenham lies {{convert|1.7|mi|km}} west of [[Bromley]] and {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} north-east of [[Croydon]].

The original village of Beckenham was a [[nucleated village|cluster of development in its own fields]] at what is now the north. Around it were the great manorial estates: Beckenham, Foxgrove, Kelsey and Langley [[manor|Halls and Parks]].

The [[River Ravensbourne]] flows northwards at the eastern side of the town, towards its confluence with the [[River Thames]]. A small stream, the River Beck (sometimes referred to as the Hawkesbrook), passes through the town before joining the Ravensbourne via the Pool River further north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788&strquery=Beckenham|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>

The area is part of an outcrop of [[London Clay]] and consists of many small hills.<ref>''The Rural Landscape of Kent'' S.G.McRae & C.P.Burnham, published by Wye College, 1973</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Shops, Beckenham Road, Beckenham - geograph.org.uk - 1581947.jpg|thumb|left|Victorian commercial buildings along Beckenham Road]]
Despite its leafy image, its close proximity to Central London and nine railway stations within the post town (Beckenham Junction, Clock House, Birkbeck, New Beckenham, Ravensbourne, Kent House, Elmers End, Eden Park and Beckenham Hill), make Beckenham a good business location. The town's busy high street contains many restaurants and upmarket chains, as well as family-run independents, and the area has a good selection of well performing schools. Beckenham is the headquarters to [[Capita]] Registrars Limited who provide share registration services for more than half of the UK's quoted companies, [[Proper Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10089363.stm|title=How to sell music the Proper way|work=BBC News}}</ref> the UK's biggest independent music distributor and [[Vizual]], a leading HR software developer.

==Landmarks==
One of the interesting landmarks in Beckenham is the [[Chinese Garage]], now a listed building. It is built in an unusual Japanese pagoda style and formerly operated as a car dealership selling [[Peugeot]] and [[Kia Motors|Kia]] cars. Its future is currently being decided. There is also [[St George's Church, Beckenham|St George's Church]], dating back to 1100 but mostly rebuilt at the end of the 19th century. The [[lych gate]] dates from the 13th century, and is one of the oldest in England; the almshouses date back to 1694. There are two old pubs, Ye Olde George Inn (1662), and the Three Tuns (now a branch of [[Zizzi]] restaurants).

[[Kelsey Park]] is another landmark. It was part of the Kelsey Estate, but the mansion no longer remains. The only surviving buildings are the two [[Listed building|Grade II]] listed lodge cottages at the entrance, which are over 200 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-358444-two-lodges-to-beckenham-place-bromley|title=Two Lodges to Beckenham Place - Bromley - Greater London - England - British Listed Buildings|author=Good Stuff|work=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk}}</ref>

{{short description|Set of norms or trends dominant in a society at a given time}}
'''Popular culture''' (also called '''mass culture''' and '''pop culture''') is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of the [[cultural practice|practices]], [[opinion|beliefs]], and [[cultural objects|objects]] that are dominant or prevalent  in a [[society]] at a given point in time. Popular culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result of interaction with these dominant objects. Heavily influenced in [[Contemporary history|modern times]] by [[mass media]], this collection of ideas permeates the [[everyday life|everyday lives]] of people in a given society. Therefore, popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards certain topics.<ref>McGaha, Julie. \"Popular Culture & Globalization\". ''Multicultural Education'' 23.1 (2015): 32–37. ''SocINDEX with Full Text''. Web. 5 Aug. 2016.</ref> However, there are various ways to define pop culture.<ref>Strinati, D. (2004). ''An introduction to theories of popular culture''. Routledge.</ref> Because of this, popular culture is something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts.<ref>Storey, J. (2018). ''Cultural theory and popular culture: An introduction''. Routledge.</ref> It is generally viewed in contrast to other forms of [[culture]] such as [[folk culture]], [[working-class culture]], or [[high culture]], and also through different theoretical perspectives such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[structuralism]], [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]], and more. The most common pop-culture categories are: [[entertainment]] (such as [[film]], [[music]], [[television]] and [[video games]]), [[sport]]s, [[news]] (as in [[cultural icon|people]]/[[cultural heritage tourism|places]] in the news), [[politics]], [[fashion]], [[technology]], and [[slang]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mrpopculture.com/what-is-pop-culture |title= What Is Pop Culture? By Gary West}}</ref>

Popular culture has been critiqued for its being a system of commercialism that privileges products produced by the upper class capitalists; this is most notable in many Marxist theorists such as [[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]], [[Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Gramsci]], [[Frederic Jameson|Jameson]], [[Terry Eagleton|Eagleton]], as well as certain postmodern philosophers such as [[Lyotard]], who has written about the commercialisation of information under capitalism<ref>Lyotard, Jean-François (1979). La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir. Paris: Minuit.</ref>, and [[Baudrillard]], as well as others.<ref>Frederic Jameson: Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. 1991.</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Cultural history}}
The term \"popular culture\" was coined in the 19th century or earlier.<ref>Although the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' lists the first use as 1854, it appears in an address by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] in 1818: {{cite book|title= The Address of Pestalozzi to the British Public|year= 1818|url= https://books.google.com/?id=i6BDAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PT10&pg=PT10#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote= I see that it is impossible to attain this end without founding the means of popular culture and instruction upon a basis which cannot be got at otherwise than in a profound examination of Man himself; without such an investigation and such a basis all is darkness.|last1= Pestalozzi|first1= Johann Heinrich}}</ref> Traditionally, popular culture was associated{{by whom|date=September 2019}} with poor [[education]] and with the [[lower classes]],<ref>{{ill|Per Adam Siljeström|sv}}, ''The educational institutions of the United States, their character and organization'', J. Chapman, 1853, p. 243: \"Influence of European emigration on the state of civilization in the United States: Statistics of popular culture in America\". [[John Morley]] presented an address ''On Popular Culture'' at the [[Birmingham Town Hall]] in 1876, dealing with the education of the lower classes.</ref> as opposed to the \"official culture\" and higher education of the upper classes.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOoe_MqMQe4C&pg=PA13 ''Rabelais and Bakhtin: Popular Culture in \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\"''] p.13</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=d6jtq0LglIAC&pg=PA9 ''Rabelais's Radical Farce''] p. 9</ref> 
[[Victorian-era]] With the rise of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased [[literacy]] rates, and with the rise of capitalism and [[industrialisation]], people began to spend more money on entertainment, like the commercial idea of pubs and sports. Reading also gained traction. Labelling [[penny dreadful]]s the Victorian equivalent of video games, ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2016 described penny fiction as \"Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young\".<ref>{{cite news |title= Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate= 23 November 2018 |work= The Guardian}}</ref> A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the newly-invented [[railway]] (the first public railway, [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], opened in north-east England in 1825) created both a market for cheap popular literature, and the ability for its distribution on a large scale. The first penny serials were published{{by whom|date=September 2019}} in the 1830s to meet this demand.<ref>

The stress in the distinction from \"official culture\" became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century,<ref>\"Learning is dishonored when she stoops to attract,\" cited in a section \"Popular Culture and True Education\" in University extension, Issue 4, The American society for the extension of university teaching, 1894.</ref>{{qn|date =August 2012}} a usage that became established by the [[interbellum]] period.<ref>

From the end of [[World War II]], following major cultural and social changes brought by [[mass media]] innovations, the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of [[mass culture]], [[media culture]], [[image culture]], [[consumer culture]], and culture for [[mass consumption]].<ref>\"one look at the sheer mass and volume of what we euphemistically call our popular culture suffices\", from [[Winthrop Sargeant]], 'In Defense of the High-Brow', an article from ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'' magazine, 11 April 1949, p. 102.</ref> Social and cultural changes in the United States were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The abbreviated form \"pop\" for popular, as in [[pop music]], dates from the late 1950s.<ref name=\"NewGrovev15p85\">''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', volume 15, p. 85 entry ''Pop music''</ref> Although terms \"pop\" and \"popular\" are in some cases used interchangeably, and their meaning partially overlap, the term \"pop\" is narrower.

The ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', the [[musicologist]]'s ultimate reference resource, identifies popular music as the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class. This would include an extremely wide range of music from vaudeville and minstrel shows to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Pop music, on the other hand, has primarily come into usage to describe music that evolved out of the [[rock 'n roll]] revolution of the mid-1950s and continues in a definable path to today.}}</ref>

==Definition==
According to author John Storey, there are various definitions of popular culture.<ref>John Storey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4–8</ref> The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much \"[[high culture]]\" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also \"popular.\" \"Pop culture\" is also defined as the culture that is \"leftover\" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]],[[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Orwell]].

A third definition equates pop culture with \"[[mass culture]]\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].<ref>Sérgio Campos Gonçalves, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190127163020/https://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ea000713.pdf Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]\", InRevista – Núcleo de Produção Científica em Comunicação – UNAERP (Ribeirão Preto), v. 3, pp. 18–28, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.</ref> From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\"{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"

Storey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}

Popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].

===Levels===
Within the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>

===Folklore===
Adaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A. W. Smith ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'', Vol. 104, No. 1/2 (1993), pp. 144–150</ref>
This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today, in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of [[joke]]s or [[urban legend]]s. With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.

Although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves. 

== Criticism ==
Many people say that popular culture is a tool that higher-ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>

The Postmodernist Baudrillard argued that the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion, since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful. Baudrillard stated in an interview: 
\"The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction. Basically, its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself. On this point it is worth recalling Marshall McLuhan: the medium is the message. The message of The Matrix is its own diffusion by an uncontrollable and proliferating contamination.\"<ref>https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/</ref>

===Print culture===
With the invention of the printing press in the sixteenth century, mass produced, cheap books became widely available to the public. With this, the transmission of common knowledge and ideas was possible. <ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=112 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref> 

===Radio culture===
In the 1890s, Nikola Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi created the radiotelegraph, allowing for the modern radio to be born. This lead to the radio being able to influence a more \"listened-to\" culture, with individuals being able to feel like they have a more direct impact. <ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=157 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref> This radio culture is vital, because it was imperative to advertising, and it introduced the [[Radio advertisement|commercial]].

They may be topical (as in the case of a [[local programming|local]] [[newscast]] and some [[made-for-television]] movies), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series). They can be primarily [[instructional television|instructional]] or [[educational television|educational]], or entertaining as is the case in [[situation comedy]] and [[game shows]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

{{short description|Set of norms or trends dominant in a society at a given time}}
'''Popular culture''' (also called '''mass culture''' and '''pop culture''') is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of the [[cultural practice|practices]], [[opinion|beliefs]], and [[cultural objects|objects]] that are dominant or prevalent  in a [[society]] at a given point in time. Popular culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result of interaction with these dominant objects. Heavily influenced in [[Contemporary history|modern times]] by [[mass media]], this collection of ideas permeates the [[everyday life|everyday lives]] of people in a given society. Therefore, popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards certain topics.<ref>McGaha, Julie. \"Popular Culture & Globalization\". ''Multicultural Education'' 23.1 (2015): 32–37. ''SocINDEX with Full Text''. Web. 5 Aug. 2016.</ref> However, there are various ways to define pop culture.<ref>Strinati, D. (2004). ''An introduction to theories of popular culture''. Routledge.</ref> Because of this, popular culture is something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts.<ref>Storey, J. (2018). ''Cultural theory and popular culture: An introduction''. Routledge.</ref> It is generally viewed in contrast to other forms of [[culture]] such as [[folk culture]], [[working-class culture]], or [[high culture]], and also through different theoretical perspectives such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[structuralism]], [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]], and more. The most common pop-culture categories are: [[entertainment]] (such as [[film]], [[music]], [[television]] and [[video games]]), [[sport]]s, [[news]] (as in [[cultural icon|people]]/[[cultural heritage tourism|places]] in the news), [[politics]], [[fashion]], [[technology]], and [[slang]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mrpopculture.com/what-is-pop-culture |title= What Is Pop Culture?

Popular culture has been critiqued for its being a system of commercialism that privileges products produced by the upper class capitalists; this is most notable in many Marxist theorists such as [[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]], [[Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Gramsci]], [[Frederic Jameson|Jameson]], [[Terry Eagleton|Eagleton]], as well as certain postmodern philosophers such as [[Lyotard]], who has written about the commercialisation of information under capitalism<ref>Lyotard, Jean-François (1979). La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir. Paris: Minuit.</ref>, and [[Baudrillard]], as well as others.<ref>Frederic Jameson: Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism.

==History==
{{see also|Cultural history}}
The term \"popular culture\" was coined in the 19th century or earlier.<ref>Although the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' lists the first use as 1854, it appears in an address by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] in 1818: {{cite book|title= The Address of Pestalozzi to the British Public|year= 1818|url= https://books.google.com/?id=i6BDAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PT10&pg=PT10#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote= I see that it is impossible to attain this end without founding the means of popular culture and instruction upon a basis which cannot be got at otherwise than in a profound examination of Man himself; without such an investigation and such a basis all is darkness.|last1= Pestalozzi|first1= Johann Heinrich}}</ref> Traditionally, popular culture was associated{{by whom|date=September 2019}} with poor [[education]] and with the [[lower classes]],<ref>{{ill|Per Adam Siljeström|sv}}, ''The educational institutions of the United States, their character and organization'', J. Chapman, 1853, p. 243: \"Influence of European emigration on the state of civilization in the United States: Statistics of popular culture in America\". [[John Morley]] presented an address ''On Popular Culture'' at the [[Birmingham Town Hall]] in 1876, dealing with the education of the lower classes.</ref> as opposed to the \"official culture\" and higher education of the upper classes.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOoe_MqMQe4C&pg=PA13 ''Rabelais and Bakhtin: Popular Culture in \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\"''] p.13</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=d6jtq0LglIAC&pg=PA9 ''Rabelais's Radical Farce''] p. 9</ref> 
[[Victorian-era]] With the rise of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased [[literacy]] rates, and with the rise of capitalism and [[industrialisation]], people began to spend more money on entertainment, like the commercial idea of pubs and sports. Reading also gained traction. Labelling [[penny dreadful]]s the Victorian equivalent of video games, ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2016 described penny fiction as \"Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young\".<ref>{{cite news |title= Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate= 23 November 2018 |work= The Guardian}}</ref> A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the newly-invented [[railway]] (the first public railway, [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], opened in north-east England in 1825) created both a market for cheap popular literature, and the ability for its distribution on a large scale. The first penny serials were published{{by whom|date=September 2019}} in the 1830s to meet this demand.<ref>

The stress in the distinction from \"official culture\" became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century,<ref>\"Learning is dishonored when she stoops to attract,\" cited in a section \"Popular Culture and True Education\" in University extension, Issue 4, The American society for the extension of university teaching, 1894.</ref>{{qn|date =August 2012}} a usage that became established by the [[interbellum]] period.<ref>

From the end of [[World War II]], following major cultural and social changes brought by [[mass media]] innovations, the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of [[mass culture]], [[media culture]], [[image culture]], [[consumer culture]], and culture for [[mass consumption]].<ref>\"one look at the sheer mass and volume of what we euphemistically call our popular culture suffices\", from [[Winthrop Sargeant]], 'In Defense of the High-Brow', an article from ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'' magazine, 11 April 1949, p. 102.</ref> Social and cultural changes in the United States were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The abbreviated form \"pop\" for popular, as in [[pop music]], dates from the late 1950s.<ref name=\"NewGrovev15p85\">''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', volume 15, p. 85 entry ''Pop music''</ref> Although terms \"pop\" and \"popular\" are in some cases used interchangeably, and their meaning partially overlap, the term \"pop\" is narrower.

The ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', the [[musicologist]]'s ultimate reference resource, identifies popular music as the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class. This would include an extremely wide range of music from vaudeville and minstrel shows to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Pop music, on the other hand, has primarily come into usage to describe music that evolved out of the [[rock 'n roll]] revolution of the mid-1950s and continues in a definable path to today.}}</ref>

==Definition==
According to author John Storey, there are various definitions of popular culture.<ref>John Storey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4–8</ref> The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much \"[[high culture]]\" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also \"popular.\" \"Pop culture\" is also defined as the culture that is \"leftover\" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]],[[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Orwell]].

A third definition equates pop culture with \"[[mass culture]]\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].<ref>Sérgio Campos Gonçalves, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190127163020/https://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ea000713.pdf Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]\", InRevista – Núcleo de Produção Científica em Comunicação – UNAERP (Ribeirão Preto), v. 3, pp. 18–28, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.</ref> From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\"{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"

Storey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}

Popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].

===Levels===
Within the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>

===Folklore===
Adaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A. W. Smith ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'', Vol. 104, No. 1/2 (1993), pp. 144–150</ref>
This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today, in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of [[joke]]s or [[urban legend]]s. With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.

Although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves. 

== Criticism ==
Many people say that popular culture is a tool that higher-ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>

The Postmodernist Baudrillard argued that the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion, since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful. Baudrillard stated in an interview: 
\"The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction. Basically, its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself. On this point it is worth recalling Marshall McLuhan: the medium is the message. The message of The Matrix is its own diffusion by an uncontrollable and proliferating contamination.\"<ref>https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/</ref>

===Print Culture===
With the invention of the printing press in the sixteenth century, mass produced, cheap books became widely available to the public. With this, the transmission of common knowledge and ideas was possible. <ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=112 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref> 

===Radio Culture===
In the 1890s, Nikola Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi created the radiotelegraph, allowing for the modern radio to be born. This lead to the radio being able to influence a more \"listened-to\" culture, with individuals being able to feel like they have a more direct impact. <ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=157 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref> This radio culture is vital, because it was imperative to advertising, and it introduced the [[Radio advertisement|commercial]].

===Films===
Films and cinema are highly influential to popular culture, as films as an art form are what people seem to respond to the most.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=195 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref> With moving pictures being first captured by Eadweard Muybridge in 1877, films have evolved into elements that can be cast into different digital formats, spreading to different cultures.

===Television programs===
{{Main|Television program}}
A television program is a segment of audiovisual content intended for broadcast (other than a commercial, trailer, or other content not serving as attraction for viewership).

Television programs may be [[fictional]] (as in [[television comedy|comedies]] and [[dramatic programming|dramas]]), or [[non-fictional]] (as in [[documentary television|documentary]], [[television news|news]] and [[reality television]]). They may be topical (as in the case of a [[local programming|local]] [[newscast]] and some [[made-for-television]] movies), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series). They can be primarily [[instructional television|instructional]] or [[educational television|educational]], or entertaining as is the case in [[situation comedy]] and [[game shows]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The '''domino theory''' was a theory prominent from the 1950s to the 1980s that posited that if one country in a region came under the influence of  [[communism]], then the surrounding countries would follow in a '''[[domino effect]]'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leeson|first1=Peter T.|last2=Dean|first2=Andrea|title=The Democratic Domino Theory|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=2009|volume=53|issue=3|pages=533–551|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00385.x}}</ref> The domino theory was used by successive United States administrations during the [[Cold War]] to justify the need for [[Overseas interventions of the United States|American intervention]] around the world.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] described the theory during an April 7, 1954, news conference, when referring to communism in [[Indochina]]:

Apart from President Eisenhower’s description, American academic [[Victor Cha]] also explained the domino theory in his book, titled ''Powerplay: The Origins of the American Alliance System in Asia.''

[[Korea]] had also partially fallen under Soviet domination at the end of World War II, split from the south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] where U.S. forces subsequently moved into. By 1948, as a result of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepting the border as permanent. In 1950 fighting broke out between Communists and Republicans that soon involved troops from China (on the Communists' side), and the United States and 15 allied countries (on the Republicans' side). Though the [[Korean War|war]] never officially ended, the fighting ended in 1953 with an [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] that left Korea divided into two nations, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]].
Mao Zedong's decision to take on the U.S. in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War.

The first figure to propose the domino theory was President Harry S. Truman in the 1940s, where he introduced the theory in order to “justify sending military aid to Greece and Turkey.”<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/domino-theory|title=Domino theory|last=Nolen|first=Jeannette L.|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref> However, the domino theory was popularized by President Dwight D.

This would give them a geographical and economic strategic advantage, and it would make Japan, [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], Australia, and New Zealand the front-line defensive states. The loss of regions traditionally within the vital regional trading area of countries like Japan would encourage the front-line countries to compromise politically with communism.

==Arguments in favor of the domino theory==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}
The primary evidence for the domino theory is the spread of communist rule in three Southeast Asian countries in 1975, following the [[Vietnam War|communist takeover of Vietnam]]: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the [[Khmer Rouge]]). It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.

[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 467,573] |isbn=0-06-019776-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 }}</ref> Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that \"there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia.\"<ref>[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7</ref>

[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e., Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.

Some supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.

Linguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called \"people's movements\" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. \"The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'\" Chomsky refers to this as the \"threat of a good example\".<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm \"The Threat of a Good Example\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]</ref>

== Significance of the domino theory ==
The domino theory is significant because it underlines the importance of alliances, which may vary from rogue alliances to bilateral alliances. This implies that the domino theory is useful in evaluating a country’s intent and purpose of forging an alliance with others, including a cluster of other countries within a particular region. While the intent and purpose may differ for every country, [[Victor Cha]] portrays the asymmetrical bilateral alliance between the United States and countries in East Asia as a strategic approach, where the United States is in control and power to either mobilize or stabilize its allies. This is supported by how the United States created asymmetrical bilateral alliances with the Republic of Korea, Republic of China and Japan “not just to contain but also constrain potential ‘rogue alliances’ from engaging in adventurist behavior that might it into larger military contingencies in the region or that could trigger a domino effect, with Asian countries falling to communism.”<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the United States struggled with the challenge of “rogue alliances and the threat of falling dominoes combined to produce a dreaded entrapment scenario for the United States,”<ref name=\":0\" /> the domino theory further underscores the importance of bilateral alliances in international relations. This is evident in how the domino theory provided the United States with a coalition approach, where it “fashioned a series of deep, tight bilateral alliances”<ref name=\":0\" /> with Asian countries including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to “control their ability to use force and to foster material and political dependency on the United States.”<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, this indicates that the domino theory assists in observing the effect of forged alliances as a stepping stone or stumbling block within international relations. This underscores the correlation between domino theory and path dependency, where a retrospective collapse of one country falling to communism may not only have adverse effects to other countries but more importantly, on one’s decision-making scope and competence in overcoming present and future challenges. Therefore, the domino theory is indubitably a significant theory which deals with the close relationship between micro-cause and macro-consequence, where it suggests such macro-consequences may result in long-term repercussions. 

==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==
[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the \"prestige\" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.

In this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the \"Message to the Tricontinental\", in 1967, calling for \"two, three ... many Vietnams\" across the world.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm \"Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005</ref> Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, \"In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua. American hostages were seized aboard the SS ''Mayaguez'' (off Cambodia) and in Tehran. The [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan]]. There is no obvious connection with the Vietnam War, but there is little doubt that the defeat of a superpower encouraged our enemies to undertake acts of aggression that they might otherwise have shied away from.\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567 \"Another Vietnam?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709153053/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567# |date=2017-07-09 }}, Max Boot, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', August 24, 2007</ref>

In addition, this theory can be further bolstered by the rise in terrorist incidents by left-wing terrorist groups in Western Europe, funded in part by Communist governments, between the 1960s and 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |title=KGB Active Measures |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629193045/https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |title=Red Army Faction |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629203451/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |title=Brigate Rosse |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629232055/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |url-status=live }}</ref> In Italy, this includes the kidnapping and assassination of former Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]], and the kidnapping of former US Brigadier General [[James L.

In West Germany, this includes the terrorist actions of the [[Red Army Faction]]. In the far east the [[Japanese Red Army]] carried out similar acts. All four, as well as others,  worked with various Arab and Palestinian terrorists, which like the red brigades were backed by the Soviet Bloc.

In the 1977 [[The Nixon Interviews|Frost/Nixon interviews]], [[Richard Nixon]] defended America's destabilization of the [[Salvador Allende]] regime in Chile on domino theory grounds.  Borrowing a metaphor he had heard, he stated that a Communist Chile and [[Cuba]] would create a \"red sandwich\" that could entrap Latin America between them.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5mUrNoWa7J0C&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=Chile%2Bcuba%2Bred+sandwich&source=web&ots=495XIVdXHA&sig=-Cxk0QCxL6Ab82RqdR_fJINZ2mg&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result The Last Years of the Monroe Doctrine, 1945-1993, p. 133] Gaddis Smith</ref>  In the 1980s, the domino theory was used again to justify the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]'s interventions in Central America and the [[Invasion of Grenada|Caribbean region]].

In 1949, a Communist-backed government, led by [[Mao Zedong]], was instated in China (officially becoming the [[China|People's Republic of China]]).<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mao-zedong-outlines-the-new-chinese-government | title =Mao Zedong outlines the new Chinese government | publisher =[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] | date =December 5, 2013 | access-date =2013-12-05 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131102093822/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mao-zedong-outlines-the-new-chinese-government# | archive-date =2013-11-02 | url-status =live }}</ref> The installation of the new government was established after the [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated the [[Nationalist government|Nationalist Republican Government of China]] in the aftermath of the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1949).<ref name=\"ChineseRev\">{{cite web | url =https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev | title =The Chinese Revolution of 1949 | publisher =[[United States Department of State]] [[Office of the Historian]], [[Bureau of Public Affairs]] | access-date =2017-06-14 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170519004017/https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev# | archive-date =2017-05-19 | url-status =live }}</ref> Two Chinas were formed - mainland 'Communist China' (People's Republic of China) and 'Nationalist China' Taiwan ([[Taiwan|Republic of China]]).

[[Korea]] had also partially fallen under Soviet domination at the end of World War II, split from the south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] where U.S. forces subsequently moved into. By 1948, as a result of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepting the border as permanent. In 1950 fighting broke out between Communists and Republicans that soon involved troops from China (on the Communists' side), and the United States and 15 allied countries (on the Republicans' side). Though the [[Korean War|war]] never officially ended, the fighting ended in 1953 with an [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] that left Korea divided into two nations, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]].
Mao Zedong's decision to take on the U.S. in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War.

The first figure to propose the domino theory was President Harry S. Truman in the 1940s, where he introduced the theory in order to “justify sending military aid to Greece and Turkey.”<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/domino-theory|title=Domino theory|last=Nolen|first=Jeannette L.|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref> However, the domino theory was popularized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he applied it to Southeast Asia, especially South Vietnam. Moreover, the domino theory was utilized as one of the key arguments in the “Kennedy and Johnson administrations during the 1960s to justify increasing American military involvement in the Vietnam War.”<ref name=\":1\" /> 

In May 1954, the [[Viet Minh]], a Communist and nationalist army, defeated French troops in the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] and took control of what became [[North Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/asiapacific-region/french-indochinavietnam-1941-1954/ | title =11.

This would give them a geographical and economic strategic advantage, and it would make Japan, [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], Australia, and New Zealand the front-line defensive states. The loss of regions traditionally within the vital regional trading area of countries like Japan would encourage the front-line countries to compromise politically with communism.

Eisenhower's domino theory of 1954 was a specific description of the situation and conditions within [[Southeast Asia]] at the time, and he did not suggest a generalized domino theory as others did afterward.

During the summer of 1963,  Buddhists protested about the harsh treatment they were receiving under the Diem government of South Vietnam. Such actions of the South Vietnamese government made it difficult for the [[Kennedy administration]]'s strong support for President Diem. President Kennedy was in a tenuous position, trying to contain Communism in Southeast Asia, but on the other hand, supporting an anti-Communist government that was not popular with its domestic citizens and was guilty of acts objectionable to the American public.<ref>{{cite web |title=JFK and Vietnam: The September 1963 TV Interviews |publisher= JFK Library |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/education/teachers/curricular-resources/high-school-curricular-resources/jfk-and-vietnam-the-september-1963-tv-interviews |website=www.jfklibrary.org |accessdate=26 September 2019}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> The Kennedy administration intervened in Vietnam in the early 1960s to, among other reasons, keep the South Vietnamese \"domino\" from falling.

==Arguments in favor of the domino theory==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}
The primary evidence for the domino theory is the spread of communist rule in three Southeast Asian countries in 1975, following the [[Vietnam War|communist takeover of Vietnam]]: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the [[Khmer Rouge]]). It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.

[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 467,573] |isbn=0-06-019776-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 }}</ref> Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that \"there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia.\"<ref>[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7</ref>

[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e., Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.

Some supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.

Linguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called \"people's movements\" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. \"The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'\" Chomsky refers to this as the \"threat of a good example\".<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm \"The Threat of a Good Example\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]</ref>

== Significance of the domino theory ==
The domino theory is significant because it underlines the importance of alliances, which may vary from rogue alliances to bilateral alliances. This implies that the domino theory is useful in evaluating a country’s intent and purpose of forging an alliance with others, including a cluster of other countries within a particular region. While the intent and purpose may differ for every country, [[Victor Cha]] portrays the asymmetrical bilateral alliance between the United States and countries in East Asia as a strategic approach, where the United States is in control and power to either mobilize or stabilize its allies. This is supported by how the United States created asymmetrical bilateral alliances with the Republic of Korea, Republic of China and Japan “not just to contain but also constrain potential ‘rogue alliances’ from engaging in adventurist behavior that might it into larger military contingencies in the region or that could trigger a domino effect, with Asian countries falling to communism.”<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the United States struggled with the challenge of “rogue alliances and the threat of falling dominoes combined to produce a dreaded entrapment scenario for the United States,”<ref name=\":0\" /> the domino theory further underscores the importance of bilateral alliances in international relations. This is evident in how the domino theory provided the United States with a coalition approach, where it “fashioned a series of deep, tight bilateral alliances”<ref name=\":0\" /> with Asian countries including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to “control their ability to use force and to foster material and political dependency on the United States.”<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, this indicates that the domino theory assists in observing the effect of forged alliances as a stepping stone or stumbling block within international relations. This underscores the correlation between domino theory and path dependency, where a retrospective collapse of one country falling to communism may not only have adverse effects to other countries but more importantly, on one’s decision-making scope and competence in overcoming present and future challenges. Therefore, the domino theory is indubitably a significant theory which deals with the close relationship between micro-cause and macro-consequence, where it suggests such macro-consequences may result in long-term repercussions. 

==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==
[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the \"prestige\" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.

In this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the \"Message to the Tricontinental\", in 1967, calling for \"two, three ... many Vietnams\" across the world.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm \"Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005</ref> Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, \"In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua. American hostages were seized aboard the SS ''Mayaguez'' (off Cambodia) and in Tehran. The [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan]]. There is no obvious connection with the Vietnam War, but there is little doubt that the defeat of a superpower encouraged our enemies to undertake acts of aggression that they might otherwise have shied away from.\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567 \"Another Vietnam?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709153053/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118792232818807567# |date=2017-07-09 }}, Max Boot, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', August 24, 2007</ref>

In addition, this theory can be further bolstered by the rise in terrorist incidents by left-wing terrorist groups in Western Europe, funded in part by Communist governments, between the 1960s and 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |title=KGB Active Measures |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629193045/https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/kgb/su0523.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |title=Red Army Faction |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629203451/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/raf.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |title=Brigate Rosse |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629232055/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/br.htm# |archive-date=2015-06-29 |url-status=live }}</ref> In Italy, this includes the kidnapping and assassination of former Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]], and the kidnapping of former US Brigadier General [[James L.

In West Germany, this includes the terrorist actions of the [[Red Army Faction]]. In the far east the [[Japanese Red Army]] carried out similar acts. All four, as well as others,  worked with various Arab and Palestinian terrorists, which like the red brigades were backed by the Soviet Bloc.

In the 1977 [[The Nixon Interviews|Frost/Nixon interviews]], [[Richard Nixon]] defended America's destabilization of the [[Salvador Allende]] regime in Chile on domino theory grounds.  Borrowing a metaphor he had heard, he stated that a Communist Chile and [[Cuba]] would create a \"red sandwich\" that could entrap Latin America between them.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5mUrNoWa7J0C&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=Chile%2Bcuba%2Bred+sandwich&source=web&ots=495XIVdXHA&sig=-Cxk0QCxL6Ab82RqdR_fJINZ2mg&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result The Last Years of the Monroe Doctrine, 1945-1993, p. 133] Gaddis Smith</ref>  In the 1980s, the domino theory was used again to justify the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]'s interventions in Central America and the [[Invasion of Grenada|Caribbean region]].

In his memoirs, former [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Rhodesian Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]] described the successive rise of authoritarian left-wing governments in Sub-Saharan Africa during [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonization]] as \"the communists' domino tactic\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Bitter Harvest: Zimbabwe and the Aftermath of Its Independence |last=Smith |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Smith |year=2008 |publisher=[[John Blake Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84358-548-0 |page=280 |title-link=The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith }}</ref> The establishment of pro-communist governments in [[Tanzania]] (1961–64) and [[Zambia]] (1964) and explicitly Marxist–Leninist governments in Angola (1975), Mozambique (1975), and eventually [[Rhodesia]] itself (in 1980)<ref>Smith 2008: 147</ref> are cited by Smith as evidence of \"the insidious encroachment of Soviet imperialism down the continent\".<ref>Smith 2008: 183</ref>

Some foreign policy analysts in the United States have referred to the potential spread of both Islamic theocracy and liberal democracy in the Middle East as two different possibilities for a domino theory.

== Appearances ==
=== ''The Great Gatsby'' ===
Daisy Fay was born into a wealthy [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] family. By 1917, Daisy had several suitors of her same class, but fell in love with [[Jay Gatsby]], a poor soldier. Before Gatsby left for war, Daisy promised to wait for him. After Gatsby started attending [[Trinity College, Oxford]], Daisy sent him a letter revealing that she had married Tom Buchanan. During the marriage, Daisy gave birth to a daughter, Pammy, who Daisy had hoped would be \"a beautiful little fool.\" Daisy and her family settled in East Egg, a wealthy old money enclave on [[Long Island]].

After her cousin [[Nick Carraway]] arrives in West Egg, the neighboring island, he meets Gatsby, who by now has become extremely wealthy. Gatsby throws several large, extravagant parties in hopes that Daisy will attend.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald – review |date=December 23, 2015 |publisher=The Guardian |url= https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/dec/23/the-great-gatsby-f-scott-fitzgerald-review}}</ref> Nick successfully sets up a meeting between Daisy and Jay at his neighboring cottage in West Egg where the two meet for the first time in five years, which leads to an affair.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.thewrap.com/great-gatsby-admits-daisy-buchanan-interested-money-deleted-scene-video/|title=Leonardo DiCaprio to Tobey Maguire in ‘Gatsby’ Deleted Scene: Daisy Buchanan’s a Gold Digger (Video)|first=Tony|last=Maglio|date=November 2, 2013|publisher=TheWrap}}</ref>

At the Buchanan home, Daisy, Tom, Gatsby, Nick and his girlfriend Jordan Baker decide to visit New York City, Tom taking Gatsby's yellow Rolls Royce with Jordan and Nick while Daisy and Gatsby drive alone. Once the group reach the city, they throw a party that turns into a confrontation between Daisy, Tom and Gatsby. Though Gatsby insisted that Daisy never loved Tom, Daisy admits that she loves both Tom and Gatsby. The party ends with Daisy driving Gatsby out of New York City in Gatsby's car, while Tom leaves with Nick and Jordan. Tom's mistress Myrtle Wilson, who earlier had a falling out with Tom, runs in front of Gatsby's car in hopes of reconciling with Tom. Daisy does not see her until it is too late, and runs her over. Daisy, panicked, drives away from the scene of the accident. In her home in East Egg, Gatsby assures her that he will take the blame. Tom tells George, Myrtle's husband, that it was Gatsby that killed Myrtle. George goes to Gatsby's home in West Egg and shoots Gatsby dead before turning the gun on himself. After Gatsby's murder, Daisy, Tom, and their daughter leave East Egg, having no forwarding address.

The curator of Fitzgerald manuscripts and letters at Princeton, Don Skemer, has written that Ginerva \"remained for Fitzgerald an archetype for the alluring, independent and upper class woman, ultimately unattainable by someone of a modest social background like himself\", and that she \"was a model for Daisy\", as well as being \"recognizable in many other [Fitzgerald] characters.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/03/0907/1c.shtml|title=Before Zelda, there was Ginevra|date=September 7, 2003|publisher=Princeton|first=Ruth|last=Stevens}}</ref>

== Characterization ==
When first introduced, Daisy is shown to speak in a manner that is childlike and without any knowledge of what is correct. She fakes ignorance when speaking in Tom's presence but then reveals her actual feelings to Nick, including the fact that she had hoped her daughter would be unintelligent. From this, it is implied that her mannerisms are not some mere attempt at fooling those around her but actually contribute to an ongoing effort to serve as a role model toward her daughter and be directly responsible for her not learning much and becoming the \"beautiful little fool\" that she had aspired to have for a child. Daisy's motivations in wanting this are revealed by her to be that of hoping that her daughter is spared the unpleasant events that can occur in one's life and rooted in her view that she will not be affected by the emotional pain of her life as in being moronic, she cannot understand the events transpiring around her.

Though she is faithful to her husband in the years of their marriage leading up to Gatsby's return, she jumps nearly instantly at the chance of being able to have an affair with Gatsby. While it appears at first that this is a mere relationship of lust between two former lovers that are seeking to reignite an old flame, it is later revealed by Daisy's words to Tom after he learns of the relationship that she went along with it due to her feeling of neglect by her husband. Not only did her neglect drive her to the point of breaking a vow, but so did her ambitions to have an actual fulfilling relationship for the first time since shortly after she married, as Daisy reveals the lack of intimacy between her and Tom, further evidenced by his continued decline to show her any type of consideration in their shared appearances. Daisy's reluctance to accept Tom's claims of remorse demonstrate that her trust is not earned easily and the fact that she continues seeing Gatsby following this proves that she was not as concerned with the consequences of her cheating than that of her happiness.

Looking at Daisy's character, one can see she did care for Gatsby, though maybe not as much as she ended up caring for Tom. Daisy was important to Gatsby because Daisy made Gatsby feel loved. Though no matter what Gatsby did to win Daisy's affection, she married Tom and remained married to him despite Gatsby's pursuit of her. “[Gatsby’s] efforts to attain Daisy…are no more successful, as she abandons him and he realizes too late that he has set his sights on the wrong goal.” <ref>Comeau, Patrice, \"Boats Against the Current: The American Dream as Death Denial in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman\" (2012). Honors Theses. Paper 39. Page 18. Web. 10 April 2016. <http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&context=honors></ref> Daisy is “a woman who gives birth to a child, cheats on her husband, kills another person, and allows Gatsby to take the blame for her mistake.”<ref>Comeau, Patrice, \"Boats Against the Current: The American Dream as Death Denial in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman\" (2012). Honors Theses. Paper 39. Page 19. Web. 10 April 2016. <http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&context=honors></ref> This says much about Daisy's character, because Daisy seems to think that she can do what she wants without needing to worry about the consequences of her actions, nor how they affect other people. Beginning when Gatsby left the first time for the army, for she could never seem to find someone to fill the hole that which Gatsby had left: “Wild rumors were circulating about her…After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, short sighted young men in town who couldn’t get into the army at all.” <ref>Fitzgerald, F. Scott, ''The Great Gatsby''. New York: Scribner, 1995. Print. Page 81.</ref> Then there came the time for Daisy to marry Tom, but she wanted to “change’ her mind!” for she knew that she loved Gatsby still, but decided not to do anything about her conflicted heart.<ref>Fitzgerald, F. Scott, ''The Great Gatsby''. New York: Scribner, 1995. Print. Page 82.</ref>

Daisy has been vilified for the consequences of her actions, such as directly and indirectly causing the deaths of several characters, and has even been considered the true [[antagonist]] of the novel. She ranked No. 1 on ''10 On Screen Villains that Will Make Your Blood Boil, Part 2'' on [[Moviepilot]], a list consisting entirely of female film characters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3798226|title=10 On Screen Villains that Will Make Your Blood Boil, Part 2|date=February 28, 2016|first=Andriel|last=Wilson|publisher=moviepilot.com}}</ref> Bloom wrote that, although Daisy was not technically the villain of the story, \"she still sucks, and if it weren’t for her a couple key players in the book would be alive at the end of it.\" Bloom then dedicated the subsequent list of her top ten detestable literary characters to Daisy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehairpin.com/2013/05/daisy-youre-a-drip-dear-detestable-literary-characters-who-are-not-technically-villains/|title=Daisy, You’re a Drip, Dear: Detestable Literary Characters Who Are Not Technically Villains|date=May 17, 2013|publisher=thehairpin.com}}</ref> Despite the criticism, some commentators have sympathized with the character.

== Appearances ==
=== ''The Great Gatsby'' ===
Daisy Fay was born into a wealthy [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] family. By 1917, Daisy had several suitors of her same class, but fell in love with [[Jay Gatsby]], a poor soldier. Before Gatsby left for war, Daisy promised to wait for him. After Gatsby started attending [[Trinity College, Oxford]], Daisy sent him a letter revealing that she had married Tom Buchanan. During the marriage, Daisy gave birth to a daughter, Pammy, who Daisy had hoped would be \"a beautiful little fool.\" Daisy and her family settled in East Egg, a wealthy old money enclave on [[Long Island]].

After her cousin [[Nick Carraway]] arrives in West Egg, the neighboring island, he meets Gatsby, who by now has become extremely wealthy. Gatsby throws several large, extravagant parties in hopes that Daisy will attend.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Gatsby by F.

At the Buchanan home, Daisy, Tom, Gatsby, Nick and his girlfriend Jordan Baker decide to visit New York City, Tom taking Gatsby's yellow Rolls Royce with Jordan and Nick while Daisy and Gatsby drive alone. Once the group reach the city, they throw a party that turns into a confrontation between Daisy, Tom and Gatsby. Though Gatsby insisted that Daisy never loved Tom, Daisy admits that she loves both Tom and Gatsby. The party ends with Daisy driving Gatsby out of New York City in Gatsby's car, while Tom leaves with Nick and Jordan. Tom's mistress Myrtle Wilson, who earlier had a falling out with Tom, runs in front of Gatsby's car in hopes of reconciling with Tom. Daisy does not see her until it is too late, and runs her over. Daisy, panicked, drives away from the scene of the accident. In her home in East Egg, Gatsby assures her that he will take the blame. Tom tells George, Myrtle's husband, that it was Gatsby that killed Myrtle. George goes to Gatsby's home in West Egg and shoots Gatsby dead before turning the gun on himself. After Gatsby's murder, Daisy, Tom, and their daughter leave East Egg, having no forwarding address.

The curator of Fitzgerald manuscripts and letters at Princeton, Don Skemer, has written that Ginerva \"remained for Fitzgerald an archetype for the alluring, independent and upper class woman, ultimately unattainable by someone of a modest social background like himself\", and that she \"was a model for Daisy\", as well as being \"recognizable in many other [Fitzgerald] characters.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/03/0907/1c.shtml|title=Before Zelda, there was Ginevra|date=September 7, 2003|publisher=Princeton|first=Ruth|last=Stevens}}</ref>

== Characterization ==
When first introduced, Daisy is shown to speak in a manner that is childlike and without any knowledge of what is correct. She fakes ignorance when speaking in Tom's presence but then reveals her actual feelings to Nick, including the fact that she had hoped her daughter would be unintelligent. From this, it is implied that her mannerisms are not some mere attempt at fooling those around her but actually contribute to an ongoing effort to serve as a role model toward her daughter and be directly responsible for her not learning much and becoming the \"beautiful little fool\" that she had aspired to have for a child. Daisy's motivations in wanting this are revealed by her to be that of hoping that her daughter is spared the unpleasant events that can occur in one's life and rooted in her view that she will not be affected by the emotional pain of her life as in being moronic, she cannot understand the events transpiring around her.

Though she is faithful to her husband in the years of their marriage leading up to Gatsby's return, she jumps nearly instantly at the chance of being able to have an affair with Gatsby. While it appears at first that this is a mere relationship of lust between two former lovers that are seeking to reignite an old flame, it is later revealed by Daisy's words to Tom after he learns of the relationship that she went along with it due to her feeling of neglect by her husband. Not only did her neglect drive her to the point of breaking a vow, but so did her ambitions to have an actual fulfilling relationship for the first time since shortly after she married, as Daisy reveals the lack of intimacy between her and Tom, further evidenced by his continued decline to show her any type of consideration in their shared appearances. Daisy's reluctance to accept Tom's claims of remorse demonstrate that her trust is not earned easily and the fact that she continues seeing Gatsby following this proves that she was not as concerned with the consequences of her cheating than that of her happiness.

Looking at Daisy's character, one can see she did care for Gatsby, though maybe not as much as she ended up caring for Tom. Daisy was important to Gatsby because Daisy made Gatsby feel loved. Though no matter what Gatsby did to win Daisy's affection, she married Tom and remained married to him despite Gatsby's pursuit of her. “[Gatsby’s] efforts to attain Daisy…are no more successful, as she abandons him and he realizes too late that he has set his sights on the wrong goal.” <ref>Comeau, Patrice, \"Boats Against the Current: The American Dream as Death Denial in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman\" (2012). Honors Theses. Paper 39. Page 18. Web. 10 April 2016. <http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&context=honors></ref> Daisy is “a woman who gives birth to a child, cheats on her husband, kills another person, and allows Gatsby to take the blame for her mistake.”<ref>Comeau, Patrice, \"Boats Against the Current: The American Dream as Death Denial in F.

Web. 10 April 2016. <http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&context=honors></ref> This says much about Daisy's character, because Daisy seems to think that she can do what she wants without needing to worry about the consequences of her actions, nor how they affect other people. Beginning when Gatsby left the first time for the army, for she could never seem to find someone to fill the hole that which Gatsby had left: “Wild rumors were circulating about her…After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, short sighted young men in town who couldn’t get into the army at all.” <ref>Fitzgerald, F. Scott, ''The Great Gatsby''. New York: Scribner, 1995. Print. Page 81.</ref> Then there came the time for Daisy to marry Tom, but she wanted to “change’ her mind!” for she knew that she loved Gatsby still, but decided not to do anything about her conflicted heart.<ref>Fitzgerald, F. Scott, ''The Great Gatsby''. New York: Scribner, 1995. Print. Page 82.</ref>

She ranked No. 1 on ''10 On Screen Villains that Will Make Your Blood Boil, Part 2'' on [[Moviepilot]], a list consisting entirely of female film characters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3798226|title=10 On Screen Villains that Will Make Your Blood Boil, Part 2|date=February 28, 2016|first=Andriel|last=Wilson|publisher=moviepilot.com}}</ref> Bloom wrote that, although Daisy was not technically the villain of the story, \"she still sucks, and if it weren’t for her a couple key players in the book would be alive at the end of it.\" Bloom then dedicated the subsequent list of her top ten detestable literary characters to Daisy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehairpin.com/2013/05/daisy-youre-a-drip-dear-detestable-literary-characters-who-are-not-technically-villains/|title=Daisy, You’re a Drip, Dear: Detestable Literary Characters Who Are Not Technically Villains|date=May 17, 2013|publisher=thehairpin.com}}</ref> Despite the criticism, some commentators have sympathized with the character.

'''Darci Lynne Farmer''' (born October 12, 2004<ref name=\"NewsOK\">{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Richard|title=10 things about 'America's Got Talent' winner Darci Lynne Farmer you didn't know|url=https://oklahoman.com/article/5564973|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=4 September 2017}}</ref>) is an American [[ventriloquist]] and singer. She was the winner of [[America's Got Talent (season 12)|season twelve]] of the [[NBC]] competition show ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' and the runner-up of the first season of ''[[America's Got Talent: The Champions]]''.

Lynne became both the third female and third child to win ''America's Got Talent'', following [[Bianca Ryan]] in [[America's Got Talent (season 1)|season one]] and [[Grace VanderWaal]] in [[America's Got Talent (season 11)|season eleven]]. She was also the third ventriloquist to win, following [[Terry Fator]] in [[America's Got Talent (season 2)|season two]] and [[Paul Zerdin]] in [[America's Got Talent (season 10)|season ten]].Her interest in ventriloquism began when her mother bought her a puppet when she was 5. Darci used her hand as a puppet at first. She made her first appearance on [[Oklahoma’s got Talent]] when she was 7 years old. Later, she appeared on [[AGT]] and won the entire season 12.

==Early life==
Lynne lives in [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. She was born on October 12, 2004. Growing up, Lynne loved to sing, but she was shy and was afraid to perform in front of an audience.<ref name=\"NewsOK\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=About {{!}} Darci Lynne|url=https://darcilynne.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033721/https://www.darcilynne.com/about/|archive-date=7 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Her parents encouraged her to overcome her shyness by participating in the 2014 [http://cinderellapageant.com/ International Cinderella Scholarship Program] where she was crowned International Mini Miss. At that pageant she also met International Teen titleholder, Laryssa Bonacquisti, a young ventriloquist who inspired her to try ventriloquism herself.<ref name=ok>{{cite news|last1=McDonnell|first1=Brandy|title=Interview, photos and video: 12-year-old Oklahoma City ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer prepares to go back on 'America's Got Talent' |url=http://oklahoman.com/article/5558909|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=4 August 2017}}</ref> She then asked her parents, Clarke and Misty Farmer, for a puppet, insisting that it would overcome her shyness. On her tenth birthday, her parents presented her with a puppet. Lynne's idol is past ''America's Got Talent'' winner [[Terry Fator]].

In 2014, she entered ''Edmond's Got Talent'' where she won first prize after a month's preparation on Bonacquisti's tips. She was soon brought to the attention of ventriloquy coach Gary Owen, who was so impressed by Lynne's skill that he agreed to be her coach and business manager.<ref name=tds>{{cite web|last=Hurst|first=Steve|title=A New Star is Born|work=The Dummy Shoppe|url=http://thedummyshoppe.com/blog/a-new-star-is-born/|date=4 November 2016}}</ref> Since then she has worked with Owen and vocal teacher Tiana Plemons.<ref name=ok/> In 2015, she won first place in both the junior division at ''Oklahoma's Got Talent'' and ''Oklahoma Kids'', and won Broadway, Specialty Acts, and overall Entertainer of the Year at ''American Kids'' in [[Branson, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Franklin|first1=Dallas|title=Young Oklahoma girl shows off her ventriloquism skills for KFOR ahead of national debut|url=http://kfor.com/2016/03/25/young-oklahoma-girl-shows-off-her-ventriloquism-skills-for-kfor-ahead-of-national-debut/|work=[[KFOR-TV|KFOR]]|date=25 March 2016}}</ref> In March 2016, Lynne made an appearance on ''[[Little Big Shots]]'', performing \"[[I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart]]\" with Katie,<ref name=lbs>{{cite news|last1=Stubblebine|first1=Allison|title=Watch All of Darci Lynne Farmer's 'Little Big Shots' Appearances Before She Won 'AGT'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/7973555/darci-lynne-farmer-little-big-shots-performances-videos-agt-winner|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=21 September 2017}}</ref> and in July 2016, she became the first child ventriloquist to perform at an evening show in the 40-year history of the ''[[Vent Haven Museum|Vent Haven]] International Ventriloquists' ConVENTion'', where she fronted for celebrity ventriloquists [[Kevin Johnson (ventriloquist)|Kevin Johnson]] and Todd Oliver.<ref name=tds/> Then, in March 2017, she appeared on the British version of ''[[Little Big Shots (UK TV series)|Little Big Shots]]'', again performing \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\" with Katie.<ref name=lbs/>

==Career==

===2017: ''America's Got Talent''===
Lynne competed on the twelfth season of ''America's Got Talent'' in 2017. During the first episode broadcast on May 30, Lynne and her puppet, a sweet, girly bunny named Petunia, performed \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.<ref name=\"agt\">{{cite news|last1=McDonnell|first1=Brandy|title=Oklahoma ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer breaks 'America's Got Talent' records, earns 306 million views on social media|url=https://oklahoman.com/article/5565102/oklahoma-ventriloquist-darci-lynne-farmer-breaks-americas-got-talent-records-earns-306-million-views-on-social-media|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=21 September 2017}}</ref> The comedy–singing act featured Petunia cutting off Lynne so Petunia could continue singing instead. Judge [[Mel B]] praised the act and pressed her Golden Buzzer, allowing Lynne to bypass the [[America's Got Talent#Judge Cuts|judge cuts]] and go straight to the quarterfinals. The video of this performance became the most viewed video in the show's history within 30 hours of broadcast,<ref name=\"agt\" /> and later placed fourth on [[YouTube]]'s list of the top 10 trending videos of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allocca|first=Kevin|url=https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/12/its-time-for-youtuberewind-celebrating.html|title=It's time for #YouTubeRewind: Celebrating what you watched, shared, and created in 2017|work=Official YouTube Blog|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>

For Lynne's first live presentation after her Golden Buzzer performance, she serenaded [[Mel B]] with her shy, stuttering [[Motown]] mouse puppet, Oscar, performing \"[[Who's Lovin' You]]\".<ref name=\"agt\" /> Judges [[Howie Mandel]], Mel B, [[Heidi Klum]], and [[Simon Cowell]] gave Lynne standing ovations. For this performance, Lynne received enough viewer votes to move on to the semifinals, where she brought her puppet Edna Doorknocker to sing \"[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]\",<ref name=\"agt\" /> and stood next to the judges' table so Edna could flirt with Simon Cowell. Again, all four judges gave Lynne a standing ovation. Viewers voted Lynne through to the finals.

For her final competition appearance, Lynne performed \"[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]\",<ref name=\"agt\" /> with Petunia and Oscar interacting for comedic effect. Again, she earned standing ovations and judges' praise; Cowell predicted, \"I think you're going to win.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Seemayer|first=Zach|url=http://www.etonline.com/exclusive-darci-lynne-farmer-overcome-joy-after-americas-got-talent-win-talks-prize-money-plans|title=EXCLUSIVE: Darci Lynne Farmer 'Overcome With Joy' After 'America's Got Talent' Win, Talks Prize Money Plans|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|date=20 September 2017}}</ref> For the finale in episode 22, Lynne fulfilled her dream by performing \"[[Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)|Anything You Can Do]]\" with her idol and mentor [[Terry Fator]], with Lynne singing as Petunia and Fator singing as Winston the Impersonating Turtle. After tripping over the first line of the song, she recovered and the act continued.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maglio|first=Tony|url=https://www.thewrap.com/darci-lynne-farmer-petunia-terry-fator-video/|title=Watch 'America's Got Talent' Puppet Duel With Darci Lynne, Season 2 Winner Terry Fator (Video)|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=21 September 2017}}</ref> The field was cut to the top five, and then to the top two finalists, Lynne and [[Angelica Hale]].

'''Darci Lynne Farmer''' (born October 12, 2004<ref name=\"NewsOK\">{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Richard|title=10 things about 'America's Got Talent' winner Darci Lynne Farmer you didn't know|url=https://oklahoman.com/article/5564973|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=4 September 2017}}</ref>) is an American [[ventriloquist]] and singer. She was the winner of [[America's Got Talent (season 12)|season twelve]] of the [[NBC]] competition show ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' and the runner-up of the first season of ''[[America's Got Talent: The Champions]]''.

Lynne became both the third female and third child to win ''America's Got Talent'', following [[Bianca Ryan]] in [[America's Got Talent (season 1)|season one]] and [[Grace VanderWaal]] in [[America's Got Talent (season 11)|season eleven]]. She was also the third ventriloquist to win, following [[Terry Fator]] in [[America's Got Talent (season 2)|season two]] and [[Paul Zerdin]] in [[America's Got Talent (season 10)|season ten]].

==Early life==
Lynne lives in [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. She was born on October 12, 2004. Growing up, Lynne loved to sing, but she was shy and was afraid to perform in front of an audience.<ref name=\"NewsOK\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=About {{!}} Darci Lynne|url=https://darcilynne.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033721/https://www.darcilynne.com/about/|archive-date=7 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Her parents encouraged her to overcome her shyness by participating in the 2014 [http://cinderellapageant.com/ International Cinderella Scholarship Program] where she was crowned International Mini Miss. At that pageant she also met International Teen titleholder, Laryssa Bonacquisti, a young ventriloquist who inspired her to try ventriloquism herself.<ref name=ok>{{cite news|last1=McDonnell|first1=Brandy|title=Interview, photos and video: 12-year-old Oklahoma City ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer prepares to go back on 'America's Got Talent' |url=http://oklahoman.com/article/5558909|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=4 August 2017}}</ref> She then asked her parents, Clarke and Misty Farmer, for a puppet, insisting that it would overcome her shyness. On her tenth birthday, her parents presented her with a puppet. Lynne's idol is past ''America's Got Talent'' winner [[Terry Fator]].

In 2014, she entered ''Edmond's Got Talent'' where she won first prize after a month's preparation on Bonacquisti's tips. She was soon brought to the attention of ventriloquy coach Gary Owen, who was so impressed by Lynne's skill that he agreed to be her coach and business manager.<ref name=tds>{{cite web|last=Hurst|first=Steve|title=A New Star is Born|work=The Dummy Shoppe|url=http://thedummyshoppe.com/blog/a-new-star-is-born/|date=4 November 2016}}</ref> Since then she has worked with Owen and vocal teacher Tiana Plemons.<ref name=ok/> In 2015, she won first place in both the junior division at ''Oklahoma's Got Talent'' and ''Oklahoma Kids'', and won Broadway, Specialty Acts, and overall Entertainer of the Year at ''American Kids'' in [[Branson, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Franklin|first1=Dallas|title=Young Oklahoma girl shows off her ventriloquism skills for KFOR ahead of national debut|url=http://kfor.com/2016/03/25/young-oklahoma-girl-shows-off-her-ventriloquism-skills-for-kfor-ahead-of-national-debut/|work=[[KFOR-TV|KFOR]]|date=25 March 2016}}</ref> In March 2016, Lynne made an appearance on ''[[Little Big Shots]]'', performing \"[[I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart]]\" with Katie,<ref name=lbs>{{cite news|last1=Stubblebine|first1=Allison|title=Watch All of Darci Lynne Farmer's 'Little Big Shots' Appearances Before She Won 'AGT'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/7973555/darci-lynne-farmer-little-big-shots-performances-videos-agt-winner|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=21 September 2017}}</ref> and in July 2016, she became the first child ventriloquist to perform at an evening show in the 40-year history of the ''[[Vent Haven Museum|Vent Haven]] International Ventriloquists' ConVENTion'', where she fronted for celebrity ventriloquists [[Kevin Johnson (ventriloquist)|Kevin Johnson]] and Todd Oliver.<ref name=tds/> Then, in March 2017, she appeared on the British version of ''[[Little Big Shots (UK TV series)|Little Big Shots]]'', again performing \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\" with Katie.<ref name=lbs/>

==Career==

===2017: ''America's Got Talent''===
Lynne competed on the twelfth season of ''America's Got Talent'' in 2017. During the first episode broadcast on May 30, Lynne and her puppet, a sweet, girly bunny named Petunia, performed \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.<ref name=\"agt\">{{cite news|last1=McDonnell|first1=Brandy|title=Oklahoma ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer breaks 'America's Got Talent' records, earns 306 million views on social media|url=https://oklahoman.com/article/5565102/oklahoma-ventriloquist-darci-lynne-farmer-breaks-americas-got-talent-records-earns-306-million-views-on-social-media|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=21 September 2017}}</ref> The comedy–singing act featured Petunia cutting off Lynne so Petunia could continue singing instead. Judge [[Mel B]] praised the act and pressed her Golden Buzzer, allowing Lynne to bypass the [[America's Got Talent#Judge Cuts|judge cuts]] and go straight to the quarterfinals. The video of this performance became the most viewed video in the show's history within 30 hours of broadcast,<ref name=\"agt\" /> and later placed fourth on [[YouTube]]'s list of the top 10 trending videos of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allocca|first=Kevin|url=https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/12/its-time-for-youtuberewind-celebrating.html|title=It's time for #YouTubeRewind: Celebrating what you watched, shared, and created in 2017|work=Official YouTube Blog|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>

For Lynne's first live presentation after her Golden Buzzer performance, she serenaded [[Mel B]] with her shy, stuttering [[Motown]] mouse puppet, Oscar, performing \"[[Who's Lovin' You]]\".<ref name=\"agt\" /> Judges [[Howie Mandel]], Mel B, [[Heidi Klum]], and [[Simon Cowell]] gave Lynne standing ovations. For this performance, Lynne received enough viewer votes to move on to the semifinals, where she brought her puppet Edna Doorknocker to sing \"[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]\",<ref name=\"agt\" /> and stood next to the judges' table so Edna could flirt with Simon Cowell. Again, all four judges gave Lynne a standing ovation. Viewers voted Lynne through to the finals.

For her final competition appearance, Lynne performed \"[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]\",<ref name=\"agt\" /> with Petunia and Oscar interacting for comedic effect. Again, she earned standing ovations and judges' praise; Cowell predicted, \"I think you're going to win.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Seemayer|first=Zach|url=http://www.etonline.com/exclusive-darci-lynne-farmer-overcome-joy-after-americas-got-talent-win-talks-prize-money-plans|title=EXCLUSIVE: Darci Lynne Farmer 'Overcome With Joy' After 'America's Got Talent' Win, Talks Prize Money Plans|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|date=20 September 2017}}</ref> For the finale in episode 22, Lynne fulfilled her dream by performing \"[[Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)|Anything You Can Do]]\" with her idol and mentor [[Terry Fator]], with Lynne singing as Petunia and Fator singing as Winston the Impersonating Turtle.

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The county also maintains a Circuit and Superior Court. The judge on each court is elected to a term of six years and must be a member of the Indiana bar.

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

== Asia ==
The 1510 flu is suspected of originating in East Asia,<ref name=\":02\" /> possibly [[China]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Gregor Horst asserts in ''Operum Medicorum tombs primus'' (1661) that the disease came from Asia and spread along trade routes<ref name=\":02\" /> before attacking the Middle East and North Africa. German medical writer [[Justus Hecker]] suggested the 1510 influenza most likely came from Asia because of the historical nature of other influenza viruses to originate there in more recent pandemics.<ref name=\":14\" />
[[File:Eastern Mediterranean and Aegean Sea. Battista Agnese, PORTOLAN ATLAS (Italy ca. 1550).jpg|thumb|353x353px|Influenza had spread in North Africa before arriving in Europe.]]

=== Middle East ===
The flu spread along trade routes towards North Africa,<ref name=\":02\" /> traveling southwest through the Middle East. Frequently visited cities like [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mecca]] would have almost certainly been reached by the flu, with large volumes of people destined to travel to [[Egypt]], North Africa, and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

== Africa ==
It is generally understood that the 1510 influenza had spread in Africa before Europe.<ref name=\"catarrhal\" /><ref name=\":16\" /> Influenza was likely widespread in North Africa before crossing continents through the Mediterranean, arriving in [[Malta]]<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Stedman|first=Thomas Lathrop|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DqEwAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA11|title=Twentieth Century Practice: Infectious diseases|date=1898|publisher=W.

[[File:General map of Malta.svg|thumb|146x146px|The disease came to Malta on crews infected in Africa.|left]]
== Europe ==
Europe's internationally-traveled cities and flu's highly contagious nature enabled its spread through European populations. The 1510 flu disrupted royal courts, church services, and social life across Europe. Contemporary chroniclers and those who've read their accounts observed how entire populations were attacked at once,<ref name=\"catarrhal\" /><ref name=\":02\" /> which is how the disease first received the name ''influenza'' (from the belief that such outbreaks were caused by influences like stars or cold).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=A.

The flu spread along trade routes towards North Africa,<ref name=\":02\" /> traveling southwest through the Middle East.

'''Freeport''' is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Stephenson County, Illinois|Stephenson County]], [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.il.us/court/CircuitCourt/CircuitMap/15th.asp#Stephenson|accessdate=2014-01-20|title=Fifteenth Judicial Circuit|publisher=State of Illinois|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519202346/http://www.state.il.us/court/CircuitCourt/CircuitMap/15th.asp#Stephenson|archivedate=2014-05-19}}</ref> The population was 25,638 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], and the mayor of Freeport is Jodi Miller, elected in 2017. Freeport is known for hosting the second [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate of 1858]], and as \"Pretzel City, USA\", due to a popular local German bakery known for its pretzels in the 1850s. [[Freeport High School (Illinois)|Freeport High School]]'s mascot is the Pretzel to honor this unique heritage.

==History==
The community was originally called '''Winneshiek'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74|year=1908|page=74}}</ref> When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of [[Tutty Baker]], who was credited with running a \"free port\" on the [[Pecatonica River]]. The name \"Winneshiek\" was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.

In 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with [[Chicago]], the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.

On August 27, 1858, the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|second debate]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his [[U.S. Senate]] seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the \"[[Freeport Doctrine|Freeport Heresy]]\", and split the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Guelzom A. (2008). ''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America'', page 162. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-7320-6}}</ref> This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.

A monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, ''Lincoln the Debator'' by [[Leonard Crunelle]], is a focal point in the city's Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, [[The Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|which has been shown]] on [[C-SPAN]].

Freeport is known as the \"Pretzel City\", and its public high school's team is named the Pretzels.  The nickname is a reminder of Freeport's ethnic heritage; in the late 1850s, many [[German-American|Germans]], both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks.<ref>http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930074752/http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884 |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref> In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-eilders-is-samengesteld-door-b.-eilders/I96781.php|title=John Billerbeck (1835-1899) » Stamboom familie Eilders » Genealogie Online|author=B. Eilders|work=Genealogie Online|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref> established the Billerbeck Bakery, which distributed so many pretzels to residents that the local newspaper later dubbed Freeport the \"Pretzel City\".

Freeport is home to the oldest [[Carnegie Library]] in Illinois<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freeportpubliclibrary.org/fpl.htm|title=About Us - Freeport Public Library|publisher=}}</ref> and one of the first Carnegie Libraries designed by the [[Chicago]] architectural firm of Patton and Miller.  It was renovated into Freeport's City Hall <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalstandard.com/news/20160824/freeport-carnegie-library-city-hall-renovations-on-schedule|title=Freeport Carnegie Library-City Hall renovations on schedule|first=Derrick Mason Staff|last=Writer|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315092543/http://www.journalstandard.com/news/20160824/freeport-carnegie-library-city-hall-renovations-on-schedule|archivedate=2017-03-15}}</ref> and City offices were moved to Carnegie City Hall in February 2017.

The City of Freeport transitioned to the City Manager Form of Government in May 2017. The first City Manager is Lowell Crow.

Before February 1893, a large square of land was purchased from the former Keller-Wittbecker farm in East Freeport.  Some of this land had recently{{When|date=September 2015}} been subdivided and platted as the \"Arcade Addition\".<ref>Reference to the ebook History of Stephenson County Illinois, Arcade Manufacturing Company, [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/addison-l-fulwider/history-of-stephenson-county-illinois--a-record-of-its-settlement-organizatio-wlu/page-64-history-of-stephenson-county-illinois--a-record-of-its-settlement-organizatio-wlu.shtml page 510] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813043304/http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/addison-l-fulwider/history-of-stephenson-county-illinois--a-record-of-its-settlement-organizatio-wlu/page-64-history-of-stephenson-county-illinois--a-record-of-its-settlement-organizatio-wlu.shtml |date=2014-08-13 }}.</ref> The Arcade Manufacturing Company had been in operation since 1885 when the previous [[Novelty Iron Works]] had gone out of business at the corner of Chicago and Jackson streets.  That earlier company began as early as 1868.  After the 1892 fire, the Arcade Manufacturing Company built an entirely new factory in the Arcade Addition of East Freeport, where they produced coffee mills and other metal products.

The historic Germania Club on Stephenson St. collapsed in 2007.

===Climate and flooding===
The [[Pecatonica River]] has flooded Freeport seven times since May 2017. The necessary flood cleanup has cost the city more than $1.5 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bettergov.org/news/neighborhoods-face-extinction-as-floods-increase/|title=Neighborhoods Face Extinction As Floods Increase|last=Chase|first=Brett|date=2019-11-11|website=Better Government Association|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

The frequency of severe weather events appears to be increasing. According to the State Climatologist, \"the number of days Freeport has experienced heavy rainfall has steadily increased every decade since 1949.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The city is seeking funding to buy out homes in flood-prone neighborhoods. One study estimates that for \"every $1 communities like Freeport spend to relocate their residents they will save $6 in future clean ups.\"<ref name=\":0\" />

'''Freeport''' is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Stephenson County, Illinois|Stephenson County]], [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.il.us/court/CircuitCourt/CircuitMap/15th.asp#Stephenson|accessdate=2014-01-20|title=Fifteenth Judicial Circuit|publisher=State of Illinois|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519202346/http://www.state.il.us/court/CircuitCourt/CircuitMap/15th.asp#Stephenson|archivedate=2014-05-19}}</ref> The population was 25,638 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], and the mayor of Freeport is Jodi Miller, elected in 2017. Freeport is known for hosting the second [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate of 1858]], and as \"Pretzel City, USA\", due to a popular local German bakery known for its pretzels in the 1850s. [[Freeport High School (Illinois)|Freeport High School]]'s mascot is the Pretzel to honor this unique heritage.

==History==
The community was originally called '''Winneshiek'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74|year=1908|page=74}}</ref> When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of [[Tutty Baker]], who was credited with running a \"free port\" on the [[Pecatonica River]]. The name \"Winneshiek\" was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.

In 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with [[Chicago]], the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.

On August 27, 1858, the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|second debate]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his [[U.S. Senate]] seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the \"[[Freeport Doctrine|Freeport Heresy]]\", and split the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Guelzom A. (2008). ''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America'', page 162. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-7320-6}}</ref> This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.

A monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, ''Lincoln the Debator'' by [[Leonard Crunelle]], is a focal point in the city's Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, [[The Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|which has been shown]] on [[C-SPAN]].

Freeport is known as the \"Pretzel City\", and its public high school's team is named the Pretzels.  The nickname is a reminder of Freeport's ethnic heritage; in the late 1850s, many [[German-American|Germans]], both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks.<ref>http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930074752/http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884 |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref> In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-eilders-is-samengesteld-door-b.-eilders/I96781.php|title=John Billerbeck (1835-1899) » Stamboom familie Eilders » Genealogie Online|author=B. Eilders|work=Genealogie Online|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref> established the Billerbeck Bakery, which distributed so many pretzels to residents that the local newspaper later dubbed Freeport the \"Pretzel City\". The city later capitalized on this nickname in 2003 by starting Freeport's first Pretzel Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-06-29/features/0706280746_1_local-ceiling-tasty|title=Let's twist again|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate=September 27, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150927104841/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-06-29/features/0706280746_1_local-ceiling-tasty|archivedate=September 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ilfbpartners.com/family/pretzel-city-festival-in-freeport/|title=Pretzel City Festival in Freeport|author=Blair Thomas|work=Illinois Farm Bureau Partners|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>

Freeport is home to the oldest [[Carnegie Library]] in Illinois<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freeportpubliclibrary.org/fpl.htm|title=About Us - Freeport Public Library|publisher=}}</ref> and one of the first Carnegie Libraries designed by the [[Chicago]] architectural firm of Patton and Miller.  It was renovated into Freeport's City Hall <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalstandard.com/news/20160824/freeport-carnegie-library-city-hall-renovations-on-schedule|title=Freeport Carnegie Library-City Hall renovations on schedule|first=Derrick Mason Staff|last=Writer|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315092543/http://www.journalstandard.com/news/20160824/freeport-carnegie-library-city-hall-renovations-on-schedule|archivedate=2017-03-15}}</ref> and City offices were moved to Carnegie City Hall in February 2017.

The City of Freeport transitioned to the City Manager Form of Government in May 2017. The first City Manager is Lowell Crow.

Before February 1893, a large square of land was purchased from the former Keller-Wittbecker farm in East Freeport.  Some of this land had recently{{When|date=September 2015}} been subdivided and platted as the \"Arcade Addition\".<ref>Reference to the ebook History of Stephenson County Illinois, Arcade Manufacturing Company, [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/addison-l-fulwider/history-of-stephenson-county-illinois--a-record-of-its-settlement-organizatio-wlu/page-64-history-of-stephenson-county-illinois--a-record-of-its-settlement-organizatio-wlu.shtml page 510] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813043304/http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/addison-l-fulwider/history-of-stephenson-county-illinois--a-record-of-its-settlement-organizatio-wlu/page-64-history-of-stephenson-county-illinois--a-record-of-its-settlement-organizatio-wlu.shtml |date=2014-08-13 }}.</ref> The Arcade Manufacturing Company had been in operation since 1885 when the previous [[Novelty Iron Works]] had gone out of business at the corner of Chicago and Jackson streets.  That earlier company began as early as 1868.  After the 1892 fire, the Arcade Manufacturing Company built an entirely new factory in the Arcade Addition of East Freeport, where they produced coffee mills and other metal products.

The historic Germania Club on Stephenson St. collapsed in 2007.

===Climate and flooding===
The [[Pecatonica River]] has flooded Freeport seven times since May 2017. The necessary flood cleanup has cost the city more than $1.5 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bettergov.org/news/neighborhoods-face-extinction-as-floods-increase/|title=Neighborhoods Face Extinction As Floods Increase|last=Chase|first=Brett|date=2019-11-11|website=Better Government Association|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

The frequency of severe weather events appears to be increasing. According to the State Climatologist, \"the number of days Freeport has experienced heavy rainfall has steadily increased every decade since 1949.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The city is seeking funding to buy out homes in flood-prone neighborhoods. One study estimates that for \"every $1 communities like Freeport spend to relocate their residents they will save $6 in future clean ups.\"<ref name=\":0\" />

Volkswagen began work on the car during the early 1970s as the replacement for the aging [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]] coupe, and designated it the ''Typ 53'' internally. Although the platform of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] was used to underpin the new Scirocco, almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a new styling (penned by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]) which was sleeker and sportier than that of the Golf. The Scirocco debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1973|1973 Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/10-revolutionary-geneva-motor-show-debuts-of-the-last-50-years|title=10 revolutionary Geneva Motor Show debuts in the last 50 years|last=Prince|first=Max|date=2014-02-28|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>

Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.

The design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo – Das Auto, das es nie gab – Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]
The '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coupé icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> 
Its high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs. Anti-roll bars were also fitted front and rear.

The Scirocco was sold in Japan at [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase]] dealerships that specialize in North American and European vehicles with right hand drive starting in 1976, initially offering the TS trim package with the 1.4L engine and a 4-speed manual transmission. In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.
 
The car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage für VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

During the production of the \"Type 53\", there were subtle changes to the body and trim. On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  

There were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.

===North America===
The 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years. The 1975 models are 1.5&nbsp;L (1471&nbsp;cc), followed by a larger 1.6 with {{convert|76|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1976 and 1977.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Four Sports Coupes | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January–February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 31 }}</ref> For 1978 Volkswagen reverted to a short-stroke 1.5 (now of 1457&nbsp;cc), stating that this made meeting emissions requirements easier.

A heavily redesigned \"Type 2\" variant (internally designated ''Typ 53B'') went on sale in 1981, although it remained on the A1 platform. The second generation Scirocco, still assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by [[Karmann]] of [[Osnabrück]] (in the same factory as the first generation Scirocco), was first shown at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1981|1981 Geneva Motor Show]] in March that year.<ref name=\"salon81\">{{Cite journal | ref = AJ81 | editor = Costa, André & Georges-Michel Fraichard |date=September 1981 | title = | last = | first = | issue = 14 & 15 | department = Salon 1981: Toutes les Voitures du Monde | page = 141 | journal = L'Auto Journal | publisher = Homme N°1 | location = Paris | language = french }}</ref> Designed by Volkswagen's own internal design team, the new car featured increased front and rear headroom, increased luggage space and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined \"<small>SCIROCCO</small>\" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.
[[File:VW Scirocco II rear 20070518.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, late Scirocco GTX (Germany)]]

Halfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second \"transfer\" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. 

Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986.

Power ranged from 44&nbsp;kW (60&nbsp;PS) to 82&nbsp;kW (112&nbsp;PS) for the 8-valve engines and either 95&nbsp;kW (129&nbsp;PS) or 102&nbsp;kW (139&nbsp;PS) for the 16-valve engines.<ref>{{citation | last = Böhler | first = Claudia | title = Scirocco: Aufregend vernünftig.

Numerous trim levels existed, depending on the model year and market, and included the L, CL, GL, LS, GLS, GLI, GT, GTI, GTL, GTS, GTX, GT II, Scala, GT 16V and GTX 16V. Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.

Scirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.

The Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.

===North America===
Specifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.

The new model, identified by the internal type numbers 137 or 1K8, is based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|PQ35 platform]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf V]] and was unveiled at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2008|2008 Geneva Motor Show]]. It went on sale in summer 2008 in Europe, with sales in other countries beginning early 2009. The Type 3 Scirocco won \"Car of the Year 2008\" from ''[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear Magazine]]''.

The 2008 model of the Scirocco received a five star safety rating from EuroNCAP even after the driver test dummy's head hit the steering wheel when the airbag bottomed out.
The model tested was a left-hand-drive three-door hatchback and scored in four areas:
* Adult Occupant {{percent|87|100}}, 31 points.
* Child Occupant {{percent|73|100}}, 36 points.
* Pedestrian {{percent|53|100}}, 19 points.

At the back there were restyled LED taillights, along with a reworked bumper and boot lid. The changes carried over onto the range-topping Scirocco R as well.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2014 Volkswagen Scirocco facelift unveiled with a series of cosmetic and engine updates|url = http://www.motor1.com/news/44607/2014-volkswagen-scirocco-facelift-unveiled-with-a-series/|website = Motor1.com|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}</ref>

The direct competitors, two [[Opel Astra]] H GTC driven by drivers selected from 18,000 hopefuls in a year-long TV covered process, were beaten decisively. In the 2012 edition of the [[Scandinavian Touring Car Championship]] [[Johan Kristoffersson]] won the championship for Volkswagen Team Biogas in a Scirocco.

===Absence of a North American version===
In April 2007, Volkswagen America vice president Adrian Hallmark claimed that Volkswagen preferred not to bring the Scirocco to North America since it could negatively affect [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf GTI]] sales.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://blogs.motortrend.com/6207263/car-news/volkswagen-wont-bring-scirocco-to-the-us/index.html|title=Volkswagen won't bring Scirocco to the U.S.|magazine=[[Motor Trend]]|date=April 2007}}</ref>  It was later stated that the final decision would be made in 2008 by [[Martin Winterkorn]] (Volkswagen's CEO), not Volkswagen of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/report-scirocco-may-still-come-to-america.html|title=Report: Scirocco may still come to America|publisher=leftlanenews|date=May 2007}}</ref>

In early March 2008, MotorAuthority reported that, due to the increasing gap between the United States dollar and the Euro, the Scirocco would not be made available for American consumers. \"This car would fit the U.S. market but at the current exchange rate we wouldn't make any money,\" Volkswagen sales and marketing chief Detlef Wittig told Bloomberg reporters.

Volkswagen began work on the car during the early 1970s as the replacement for the aging [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]] coupe, and designated it the ''Typ 53'' internally. Although the platform of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] was used to underpin the new Scirocco, almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a new styling (penned by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]) which was sleeker and sportier than that of the Golf. The Scirocco debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1973|1973 Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/10-revolutionary-geneva-motor-show-debuts-of-the-last-50-years|title=10 revolutionary Geneva Motor Show debuts in the last 50 years|last=Prince|first=Max|date=2014-02-28|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>

Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.

The design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo – Das Auto, das es nie gab – Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Its high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs.

The Scirocco was sold in Japan at [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase]] dealerships that specialize in North American and European vehicles with right hand drive starting in 1976, initially offering the TS trim package with the 1.4L engine and a 4-speed manual transmission. In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.
 
The car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage für VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

During the production of the \"Type 53\", there were subtle changes to the body and trim. On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  

There were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.

===North America===
The 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years. The 1975 models are 1.5&nbsp;L (1471&nbsp;cc), followed by a larger 1.6 with {{convert|76|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1976 and 1977.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Four Sports Coupes | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January–February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 31 }}</ref> For 1978 Volkswagen reverted to a short-stroke 1.5 (now of 1457&nbsp;cc), stating that this made meeting emissions requirements easier.

A heavily redesigned \"Type 2\" variant (internally designated ''Typ 53B'') went on sale in 1981, although it remained on the A1 platform. The second generation Scirocco, still assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by [[Karmann]] of [[Osnabrück]] (in the same factory as the first generation Scirocco), was first shown at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1981|1981 Geneva Motor Show]] in March that year.<ref name=\"salon81\">{{Cite journal | ref = AJ81 | editor = Costa, André & Georges-Michel Fraichard |date=September 1981 | title = | last = | first = | issue = 14 & 15 | department = Salon 1981: Toutes les Voitures du Monde | page = 141 | journal = L'Auto Journal | publisher = Homme N°1 | location = Paris | language = french }}</ref> Designed by Volkswagen's own internal design team, the new car featured increased front and rear headroom, increased luggage space and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined \"<small>SCIROCCO</small>\" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.
[[File:VW Scirocco II rear 20070518.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, late Scirocco GTX (Germany)]]

Halfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second \"transfer\" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986. Displacements ranged from 1.3 liters up to 1.8 liters. Power ranged from 44&nbsp;kW (60&nbsp;PS) to 82&nbsp;kW (112&nbsp;PS) for the 8-valve engines and either 95&nbsp;kW (129&nbsp;PS) or 102&nbsp;kW (139&nbsp;PS) for the 16-valve engines.<ref>{{citation | last = Böhler | first = Claudia | title = Scirocco: Aufregend vernünftig.

Numerous trim levels existed, depending on the model year and market, and included the L, CL, GL, LS, GLS, GLI, GT, GTI, GTL, GTS, GTX, GT II, Scala, GT 16V and GTX 16V. Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.

Scirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.

The Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.

===North America===
Specifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.

At the back there were restyled LED taillights, along with a reworked bumper and boot lid. The changes carried over onto the range-topping Scirocco R as well.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2014 Volkswagen Scirocco facelift unveiled with a series of cosmetic and engine updates|url = http://www.motor1.com/news/44607/2014-volkswagen-scirocco-facelift-unveiled-with-a-series/|website = Motor1.com|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}</ref>

===Motorsports===
In the [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] in May 2008, three new Volkswagen Scirocco<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://adac.24h-rennen.de/fileadmin/24h/Teams/2008_new/116.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014238/http://adac.24h-rennen.de/fileadmin/24h/Teams/2008_new/116.jpg |archive-date=2011-06-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> did very well in the field of over 200, among them many high powered cars, finishing 11th and 15th, with veteran [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] driving both cars (and [[Carlos Sainz]] the slower one). The direct competitors, two [[Opel Astra]] H GTC driven by drivers selected from 18,000 hopefuls in a year-long TV covered process, were beaten decisively. In the 2012 edition of the [[Scandinavian Touring Car Championship]] [[Johan Kristoffersson]] won the championship for Volkswagen Team Biogas in a Scirocco.

===Absence of a North American version===
In April 2007, Volkswagen America vice president Adrian Hallmark claimed that Volkswagen preferred not to bring the Scirocco to North America since it could negatively affect [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf GTI]] sales.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://blogs.motortrend.com/6207263/car-news/volkswagen-wont-bring-scirocco-to-the-us/index.html|title=Volkswagen won't bring Scirocco to the U.S.|magazine=[[Motor Trend]]|date=April 2007}}</ref>  It was later stated that the final decision would be made in 2008 by [[Martin Winterkorn]] (Volkswagen's CEO), not Volkswagen of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/report-scirocco-may-still-come-to-america.html|title=Report: Scirocco may still come to America|publisher=leftlanenews|date=May 2007}}</ref>

In early March 2008, MotorAuthority reported that, due to the increasing gap between the United States dollar and the Euro, the Scirocco would not be made available for American consumers. \"This car would fit the U.S. market but at the current exchange rate we wouldn't make any money,\" Volkswagen sales and marketing chief Detlef Wittig told Bloomberg reporters.

The '''Volkswagen Scirocco''' is a three-door, four passenger (2+2), front-engine, front wheel drive [[sports car|sports]] [[coupé]] manufactured and marketed by [[Volkswagen]] in two generations from 1974 to 1992 and a third generation from 2008 until 2017. Production ended without a successor. 

The Scirocco derives its name from [[Sirocco|the Mediterranean wind]].

Volkswagen began work on the car during the early 1970s as the replacement for the aging [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]] coupe, and designated it the ''Typ 53'' internally. Although the platform of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] was used to underpin the new Scirocco, almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a new styling (penned by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]) which was sleeker and sportier than that of the Golf. The Scirocco debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1973|1973 Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/10-revolutionary-geneva-motor-show-debuts-of-the-last-50-years|title=10 revolutionary Geneva Motor Show debuts in the last 50 years|last=Prince|first=Max|date=2014-02-28|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>

Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.

The design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo – Das Auto, das es nie gab – Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coupé icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> 
Its high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs. Anti-roll bars were also fitted front and rear.

The Scirocco was sold in Japan at [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase]] dealerships that specialize in North American and European vehicles with right hand drive starting in 1976, initially offering the TS trim package with the 1.4L engine and a 4-speed manual transmission. In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.
 
The car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage für VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

During the production of the \"Type 53\", there were subtle changes to the body and trim. On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  

There were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.

===North America===
The 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years. The 1975 models are 1.5&nbsp;L (1471&nbsp;cc), followed by a larger 1.6 with {{convert|76|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1976 and 1977.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Four Sports Coupes | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January–February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 31 }}</ref> For 1978 Volkswagen reverted to a short-stroke 1.5 (now of 1457&nbsp;cc), stating that this made meeting emissions requirements easier.

A heavily redesigned \"Type 2\" variant (internally designated ''Typ 53B'') went on sale in 1981, although it remained on the A1 platform. The second generation Scirocco, still assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by [[Karmann]] of [[Osnabrück]] (in the same factory as the first generation Scirocco), was first shown at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1981|1981 Geneva Motor Show]] in March that year.<ref name=\"salon81\">{{Cite journal | ref = AJ81 | editor = Costa, André & Georges-Michel Fraichard |date=September 1981 | title = | last = | first = | issue = 14 & 15 | department = Salon 1981: Toutes les Voitures du Monde | page = 141 | journal = L'Auto Journal | publisher = Homme N°1 | location = Paris | language = french }}</ref> Designed by Volkswagen's own internal design team, the new car featured increased front and rear headroom, increased luggage space and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined \"<small>SCIROCCO</small>\" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.
[[File:VW Scirocco II rear 20070518.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, late Scirocco GTX (Germany)]]

Halfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second \"transfer\" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986. Displacements ranged from 1.3 liters up to 1.8 liters. Power ranged from 44&nbsp;kW (60&nbsp;PS) to 82&nbsp;kW (112&nbsp;PS) for the 8-valve engines and either 95&nbsp;kW (129&nbsp;PS) or 102&nbsp;kW (139&nbsp;PS) for the 16-valve engines.<ref>{{citation | last = Böhler | first = Claudia | title = Scirocco: Aufregend vernünftig.

Numerous trim levels existed, depending on the model year and market, and included the L, CL, GL, LS, GLS, GLI, GT, GTI, GTL, GTS, GTX, GT II, Scala, GT 16V and GTX 16V. Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.

Scirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.

The Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.

===North America===
Specifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.

At the back there were restyled LED taillights, along with a reworked bumper and boot lid. The changes carried over onto the range-topping Scirocco R as well.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2014 Volkswagen Scirocco facelift unveiled with a series of cosmetic and engine updates|url = http://www.motor1.com/news/44607/2014-volkswagen-scirocco-facelift-unveiled-with-a-series/|website = Motor1.com|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}</ref>

===Motorsports===
In the [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] in May 2008, three new Volkswagen Scirocco<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://adac.24h-rennen.de/fileadmin/24h/Teams/2008_new/116.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014238/http://adac.24h-rennen.de/fileadmin/24h/Teams/2008_new/116.jpg |archive-date=2011-06-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> did very well in the field of over 200, among them many high powered cars, finishing 11th and 15th, with veteran [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] driving both cars (and [[Carlos Sainz]] the slower one). The direct competitors, two [[Opel Astra]] H GTC driven by drivers selected from 18,000 hopefuls in a year-long TV covered process, were beaten decisively. In the 2012 edition of the [[Scandinavian Touring Car Championship]] [[Johan Kristoffersson]] won the championship for Volkswagen Team Biogas in a Scirocco.

===Absence of a North American version===
In April 2007, Volkswagen America vice president Adrian Hallmark claimed that Volkswagen preferred not to bring the Scirocco to North America since it could negatively affect [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf GTI]] sales.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://blogs.motortrend.com/6207263/car-news/volkswagen-wont-bring-scirocco-to-the-us/index.html|title=Volkswagen won't bring Scirocco to the U.S.|magazine=[[Motor Trend]]|date=April 2007}}</ref>  It was later stated that the final decision would be made in 2008 by [[Martin Winterkorn]] (Volkswagen's CEO), not Volkswagen of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/report-scirocco-may-still-come-to-america.html|title=Report: Scirocco may still come to America|publisher=leftlanenews|date=May 2007}}</ref>

In early March 2008, MotorAuthority reported that, due to the increasing gap between the United States dollar and the Euro, the Scirocco would not be made available for American consumers. \"This car would fit the U.S. market but at the current exchange rate we wouldn't make any money,\" Volkswagen sales and marketing chief Detlef Wittig told Bloomberg reporters.

The '''Volkswagen Scirocco''' is a three-door, four passenger (2+2), front-engine, front wheel drive [[sports car|sports]] [[coupé]] manufactured and marketed by [[Volkswagen]] in two generations from 1974 to 1992 and a third generation from 2008 until 2017. Production ended without a successor. 

The Scirocco derives its name from [[Sirocco|the Mediterranean wind]].

Volkswagen began work on the car during the early 1970s as the replacement for the aging [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]] coupe, and designated it the ''Typ 53'' internally. Although the platform of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] was used to underpin the new Scirocco, almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a new styling (penned by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]) which was sleeker and sportier than that of the Golf. The Scirocco debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1973|1973 Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/10-revolutionary-geneva-motor-show-debuts-of-the-last-50-years|title=10 revolutionary Geneva Motor Show debuts in the last 50 years|last=Prince|first=Max|date=2014-02-28|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>

Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.

The design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo – Das Auto, das es nie gab – Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]
The '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coupé icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> 
Its high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs. Anti-roll bars were also fitted front and rear.

The Scirocco was sold in Japan at [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase]] dealerships that specialize in North American and European vehicles with right hand drive starting in 1976, initially offering the TS trim package with the 1.4L engine and a 4-speed manual transmission. In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.
 
The car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage für VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

During the production of the \"Type 53\", there were subtle changes to the body and trim. On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  

There were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.

===North America===
The 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years. The 1975 models are 1.5&nbsp;L (1471&nbsp;cc), followed by a larger 1.6 with {{convert|76|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1976 and 1977.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Four Sports Coupes | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January–February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 31 }}</ref> For 1978 Volkswagen reverted to a short-stroke 1.5 (now of 1457&nbsp;cc), stating that this made meeting emissions requirements easier.

A heavily redesigned \"Type 2\" variant (internally designated ''Typ 53B'') went on sale in 1981, although it remained on the A1 platform. The second generation Scirocco, still assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by [[Karmann]] of [[Osnabrück]] (in the same factory as the first generation Scirocco), was first shown at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1981|1981 Geneva Motor Show]] in March that year.<ref name=\"salon81\">{{Cite journal | ref = AJ81 | editor = Costa, André & Georges-Michel Fraichard |date=September 1981 | title = | last = | first = | issue = 14 & 15 | department = Salon 1981: Toutes les Voitures du Monde | page = 141 | journal = L'Auto Journal | publisher = Homme N°1 | location = Paris | language = french }}</ref> Designed by Volkswagen's own internal design team, the new car featured increased front and rear headroom, increased luggage space and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined \"<small>SCIROCCO</small>\" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.
[[File:VW Scirocco II rear 20070518.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, late Scirocco GTX (Germany)]]

Halfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second \"transfer\" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986. Displacements ranged from 1.3 liters up to 1.8 liters. Power ranged from 44&nbsp;kW (60&nbsp;PS) to 82&nbsp;kW (112&nbsp;PS) for the 8-valve engines and either 95&nbsp;kW (129&nbsp;PS) or 102&nbsp;kW (139&nbsp;PS) for the 16-valve engines.<ref>{{citation | last = Böhler | first = Claudia | title = Scirocco: Aufregend vernünftig.

Numerous trim levels existed, depending on the model year and market, and included the L, CL, GL, LS, GLS, GLI, GT, GTI, GTL, GTS, GTX, GT II, Scala, GT 16V and GTX 16V. Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.

Scirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.

The Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.

===North America===
Specifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.

The new model, identified by the internal type numbers 137 or 1K8, is based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|PQ35 platform]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf V]] and was unveiled at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2008|2008 Geneva Motor Show]]. It went on sale in summer 2008 in Europe, with sales in other countries beginning early 2009. The Type 3 Scirocco won \"Car of the Year 2008\" from ''[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear Magazine]]''.

The 2008 model of the Scirocco received a five star safety rating from EuroNCAP even after the driver test dummy's head hit the steering wheel when the airbag bottomed out.
The model tested was a left-hand-drive three-door hatchback and scored in four areas:
* Adult Occupant {{percent|87|100}}, 31 points.
* Child Occupant {{percent|73|100}}, 36 points.
* Pedestrian {{percent|53|100}}, 19 points.

===Motorsports===
In the [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] in May 2008, three new Volkswagen Scirocco<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://adac.24h-rennen.de/fileadmin/24h/Teams/2008_new/116.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014238/http://adac.24h-rennen.de/fileadmin/24h/Teams/2008_new/116.jpg |archive-date=2011-06-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> did very well in the field of over 200, among them many high powered cars, finishing 11th and 15th, with veteran [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] driving both cars (and [[Carlos Sainz]] the slower one). The direct competitors, two [[Opel Astra]] H GTC driven by drivers selected from 18,000 hopefuls in a year-long TV covered process, were beaten decisively. In the 2012 edition of the [[Scandinavian Touring Car Championship]] [[Johan Kristoffersson]] won the championship for Volkswagen Team Biogas in a Scirocco.

===Absence of a North American version===
In April 2007, Volkswagen America vice president Adrian Hallmark claimed that Volkswagen preferred not to bring the Scirocco to North America since it could negatively affect [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf GTI]] sales.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://blogs.motortrend.com/6207263/car-news/volkswagen-wont-bring-scirocco-to-the-us/index.html|title=Volkswagen won't bring Scirocco to the U.S.|magazine=[[Motor Trend]]|date=April 2007}}</ref>  It was later stated that the final decision would be made in 2008 by [[Martin Winterkorn]] (Volkswagen's CEO), not Volkswagen of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/report-scirocco-may-still-come-to-america.html|title=Report: Scirocco may still come to America|publisher=leftlanenews|date=May 2007}}</ref>

In early March 2008, MotorAuthority reported that, due to the increasing gap between the United States dollar and the Euro, the Scirocco would not be made available for American consumers. \"This car would fit the U.S. market but at the current exchange rate we wouldn't make any money,\" Volkswagen sales and marketing chief Detlef Wittig told Bloomberg reporters.

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the word 'Baloch' is unclear. Rawlinson (1873) believed that it is derived from the name of the Babylonian king and god [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]]. Dames (1904) believed that it is derived from the Persian term for [[cockscomb]], said to have been used as a crest on the helmets of Baloch troops in 6th century BCE. Herzfeld (1968) proposed that it is derived from the [[Median language|Median]] term ''brza-vaciya'', which describes a loud or aggressive way of speaking. Naseer Dashti (2012) presents another possibility, that of being derived from the name of the ethnic group 'Balaschik' living in Balashagan, between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Lake Van]] in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] times.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=8,&nbsp;33–34,&nbsp;44}} The remnants of the original name such as 'Balochuk' and 'Balochiki' are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33–34}}

Some writers suggest a derivation from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''bal'', meaning strength, and ''och'' meaning high or magnificent.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33–34}} An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler [[Mihira Bhoja]] (r. 836–885), which says that the dynasty's founder [[Nagabhata I]] repelled a powerful army of ''Valacha Mlecchas'', translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by [[D. R. Bhandarkar]]. The army in question is that of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] after the conquest of [[Sindh]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bhandarkar |first=D. R. |authorlink=D. R.

==History==
According to Baloch lore, their ancestors hail from [[Aleppo]] in what is now [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Olson|title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313274978|page=101|display-authors=etal}}</ref> They claim to be descendants of [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Ameer Hamza]], uncle of the prophet Muhammad, who settled in Halab (present-day [[Aleppo]]). They fled to the [[Sistan]] region,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kreyenbroek|first1=Philip G.|title=Oral Literature of Iranian Languages: Kurdish, Pashto, Balochi, Ossetic, Persian and Tajik: Companion Volume II: History of Persian Literature A, Volume 18|date=2010|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-0857732651|quote=The Baloch tribes rise up from their original home in Aleppo, all sons of Mir Hamza (generally taken to be the uncle of the prophet Muhammad) to fight against the second Ummayad Caliph Yazid I at Karbala in 680.

However, this origin story is not borne out by historical evidence. Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the [[Western Iranian languages]], the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late [[Sasanian]] period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area. The migrations occurred over several centuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baluchistan-iii |title=BALUCHISTAN iii. Baluchi Language and Literature |author=J. Elfenbein |date=1988 |work=Encyclopedia Iranica |accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref>

By the 9th century, [[Arab people|Arab]] writers refer to the Baloch as living in the area between [[Kerman]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Sistan]], and [[Makran]] in what is now eastern Iran.<ref name= Spooner/> Although they kept flocks of sheep, the Baloches also engaged in plundering travellers on the desert routes. This brought them into conflict with the [[Buyids]], and later the [[Ghaznavids]] and the [[Seljuqs]]. [[Adud al-Dawla]] of the Buyid dynasty launched a punitive campaign against them and defeated them in 971–972. After this, the Baloch continued their eastward migration towards what is now Balochistan province of Pakistan, although some remained behind and there are still Baloch in eastern part of the Iranian [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Sistan-Baluchestan]] and [[Kerman province|Kerman]] provinces. By the 13th–14th centuries waves of Baloch were moving into Sindh, and by the 15th century into the Punjab.<ref name= Spooner>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baluchistan-i |title=BALUCHISTAN i.

The area where the Baloch tribes settled was disputed between the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Safavids]] and the [[Mughal emperors]]. Although the Mughals managed to establish some control over the eastern parts of the area, by the 17th century, a tribal leader named Mir Hasan established himself as the first \"Khan of the Baloch\". In 1666, he was succeeded by [[Ahmad I (Kalat)|Mir Aḥmad Khan Qambarani]] who established the Balochi [[Khanate of Kalat]] under the Ahmadzai dynasty.{{refn|A number of unrelated tribes with the name ''Ahmadzai'' exist.<ref name=Iranica>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kieffer |first=Ch.

==Balochi culture==
Gold ornaments such as necklaces and bracelets are an important aspect of Baloch women's traditions and among their most favoured items of jewellery are ''dorr'', heavy earrings that are fastened to the head with gold chains so that the heavy weight will not cause harm to the ears. They usually wear a gold brooch (''tasni'') that is made by local jewellers in different shapes and sizes and is used to fasten the two parts of the dress together over the chest. In ancient times, especially during the pre-Islamic era, it was common for Baloch women to perform [[Persian dance|dances]] and sing [[Balochi music|folk songs]] at different events. The tradition of a Baloch mother singing lullabies to her children has played an important role in the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation since ancient times. Apart from the dressing style of the Baloch, indigenous and local traditions and customs are also of great importance to the Baloch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baask.com/diwwan/index.php?topic=4273.0;wap2 |title=Baloch Society & culture |publisher=Baask.com |accessdate=7 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045319/http://baask.com/diwwan/index.php?topic=4273.0%3Bwap2 |archivedate=16 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Tradition===
Traditionally, [[Jalal Khan]] was the ruler and founder of the first Balochi confederacy in 12th century.

As of 2008 it was estimated that there were between eight and nine million Baloch people living in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. They were subdivided between over 130 tribes.<ref name=a>{{cite journal|first=Muhammad|last=Tahir|url=https://jamestown.org/program/tribes-and-rebels-the-players-in-the-balochistan-insurgency/#.VnssNfFRZ2I|title=Tribes and Rebels: The Players in the Balochistan Insurgency|journal=Terrorism Monitor|publisher=Jamestown Foundation|volume=6|issue=7|date=3 April 2008|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref> Some estimates put the figure at over 150 tribes, though estimates vary depending on how subtribes are counted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Muhammad Amin |last=Baloch|title=Inside Ormara|publisher=Muhammad Amin Baloch|year=1999|page=83}}</ref> The tribes, known as ''taman'', are led by a tribal chief, the [[tumandar]].

Five Baloch tribes derive their eponymous names from Khan's children. Many, if not all, Baloch tribes can be categorized as either Rind or Lashari based on their actual descent or historical tribal allegiances that developed into cross-generational relationships.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This basic division was accentuated by a war lasting 30 years between the Rind and Lashari tribes in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book|first1=M.

===Tribalism===
[[File:Balouch man.JPG|thumb|Iranian Baloch man]]
Violent intertribal competition has prevented any credible attempt at [[Baloch nationalism|creating a nation-state]]. A myriad of militant secessionist movements, each loyal to their own tribal leader, threatens regional security and political stability. Nationalist groups like the [[Baloch Students Organization]], composed of armed rebels, and the [[Baloch Council of North America]], made up of educated expatriates living in the United States, have simultaneously denounced Balochistan's traditional rulers and Pakistan's national government.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jugdep S.

==Religion==
Virtually all Baloch in Pakistan are Muslims, with the towering majority being [[Sunnis]] ([[Shia's]] stand at 0.59%), including 64.78% belonging to the [[Deobandi]] movement, 33.38% belonging to the [[Barelvi]] movement, 1.25% belonging to the [[Ahl-i Hadith]] movement, and, while criticizing the \"myth of Baloch secularism\", scholars [[Christine Fair]] and Ali Hamza found out during their empirical studies that, when it comes to [[Islamism]], \"contrary to the conventional wisdom, Baloch are generally indistinguishable from other Pakistanis in Balochistan or the rest of Pakistan\", that \"there are virtually no statistically significant or substantive differences in levels of support for liberating Kashmiris from Indian rule, protecting Muslims outside of Kashmir from Indian oppression, making Pakistan a sharia-compliant state, ridding Pakistan of apostates and hypocrites, or liberating Muslims from oppression.\"<ref>Fair, C.

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the word 'Baloch' is unclear. Rawlinson (1873) believed that it is derived from the name of the Babylonian king and god [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]]. Dames (1904) believed that it is derived from the Persian term for [[cockscomb]], said to have been used as a crest on the helmets of Baloch troops in 6th century BCE. Herzfeld (1968) proposed that it is derived from the [[Median language|Median]] term ''brza-vaciya'', which describes a loud or aggressive way of speaking. Naseer Dashti (2012) presents another possibility, that of being derived from the name of the ethnic group 'Balaschik' living in Balashagan, between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Lake Van]] in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] times.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=8,&nbsp;33–34,&nbsp;44}} The remnants of the original name such as 'Balochuk' and 'Balochiki' are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33–34}}

Some writers suggest a derivation from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''bal'', meaning strength, and ''och'' meaning high or magnificent.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33–34}} An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler [[Mihira Bhoja]] (r. 836–885), which says that the dynasty's founder [[Nagabhata I]] repelled a powerful army of ''Valacha Mlecchas'', translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by [[D. R. Bhandarkar]]. The army in question is that of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] after the conquest of [[Sindh]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bhandarkar |first=D. R. |authorlink=D. R.

==History==
According to Baloch lore, their ancestors hail from [[Aleppo]] in what is now [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Olson|title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313274978|page=101|display-authors=etal}}</ref> They claim to be descendants of [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Ameer Hamza]], uncle of the prophet Muhammad, who settled in Halab (present-day [[Aleppo]]).

However, this origin story is not borne out by historical evidence. Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the [[Western Iranian languages]], the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late [[Sasanian]] period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area. The migrations occurred over several centuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baluchistan-iii |title=BALUCHISTAN iii. Baluchi Language and Literature |author=J.

By the 9th century, [[Arab people|Arab]] writers refer to the Baloch as living in the area between [[Kerman]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Sistan]], and [[Makran]] in what is now eastern Iran.<ref name= Spooner/> Although they kept flocks of sheep, the Baloches also engaged in plundering travellers on the desert routes. This brought them into conflict with the [[Buyids]], and later the [[Ghaznavids]] and the [[Seljuqs]]. [[Adud al-Dawla]] of the Buyid dynasty launched a punitive campaign against them and defeated them in 971–972. After this, the Baloch continued their eastward migration towards what is now Balochistan province of Pakistan, although some remained behind and there are still Baloch in eastern part of the Iranian [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Sistan-Baluchestan]] and [[Kerman province|Kerman]] provinces.

The area where the Baloch tribes settled was disputed between the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Safavids]] and the [[Mughal emperors]].

==Balochi culture==
Gold ornaments such as necklaces and bracelets are an important aspect of Baloch women's traditions and among their most favoured items of jewellery are ''dorr'', heavy earrings that are fastened to the head with gold chains so that the heavy weight will not cause harm to the ears. They usually wear a gold brooch (''tasni'') that is made by local jewellers in different shapes and sizes and is used to fasten the two parts of the dress together over the chest. In ancient times, especially during the pre-Islamic era, it was common for Baloch women to perform [[Persian dance|dances]] and sing [[Balochi music|folk songs]] at different events. The tradition of a Baloch mother singing lullabies to her children has played an important role in the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation since ancient times. Apart from the dressing style of the Baloch, indigenous and local traditions and customs are also of great importance to the Baloch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baask.com/diwwan/index.php?topic=4273.0;wap2 |title=Baloch Society & culture |publisher=Baask.com |accessdate=7 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045319/http://baask.com/diwwan/index.php?topic=4273.0%3Bwap2 |archivedate=16 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Five Baloch tribes derive their eponymous names from Khan's children. Many, if not all, Baloch tribes can be categorized as either Rind or Lashari based on their actual descent or historical tribal allegiances that developed into cross-generational relationships.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This basic division was accentuated by a war lasting 30 years between the Rind and Lashari tribes in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book|first1=M.

===Tribalism===
[[File:Balouch man.JPG|thumb|Iranian Baloch man]]
Violent intertribal competition has prevented any credible attempt at [[Baloch nationalism|creating a nation-state]]. A myriad of militant secessionist movements, each loyal to their own tribal leader, threatens regional security and political stability. Nationalist groups like the [[Baloch Students Organization]], composed of armed rebels, and the [[Baloch Council of North America]], made up of educated expatriates living in the United States, have simultaneously denounced Balochistan's traditional rulers and Pakistan's national government.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jugdep S.

==Religion==
Virtually all Baloch in Pakistan are Muslims, with the towering majority being [[Sunnis]] ([[Shia's]] stand at 0.59%), including 64.78% belonging to the [[Deobandi]] movement, 33.38% belonging to the [[Barelvi]] movement, 1.25% belonging to the [[Ahl-i Hadith]] movement, and, while criticizing the \"myth of Baloch secularism\", scholars [[Christine Fair]] and Ali Hamza found out during their empirical studies that, when it comes to [[Islamism]], \"contrary to the conventional wisdom, Baloch are generally indistinguishable from other Pakistanis in Balochistan or the rest of Pakistan\", that \"there are virtually no statistically significant or substantive differences in levels of support for liberating Kashmiris from Indian rule, protecting Muslims outside of Kashmir from Indian oppression, making Pakistan a sharia-compliant state, ridding Pakistan of apostates and hypocrites, or liberating Muslims from oppression.\"<ref>Fair, C.

'''Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas''' (1544, in [[Monfort]] – July 1590, in [[Mauvezin, Gers|Mauvezin]]) was a [[Gascony|Gascon]] [[Huguenot]] courtier and poet. Trained as a doctor of law, he served in the court of [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]] for most of his career. Du Bartas was celebrated across sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe for his divine poetry, particularly ''L'Uranie ''(1584), ''Judit ''(1584), ''La Sepmaine; ou, Creation du monde'' (1578), and ''La Seconde Semaine'' (1584-1603).
[[File:Le Bartas.jpg|framed|right|Château du Bartas (built 1569)]]

== Life ==
Relatively little is known about Du Bartas’ life. Born in 1544, Guillaume Sallustre descended from a family of wealthy merchants in Montfort (in the [[Armagnac (province)|Armagnac]] region).<ref name=Bellenger>{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|first1=Yvonne|title=La Sepmaine (texte de 1581)|date=1981|location=Paris|pages=xix–xxiii}}</ref> His family name later became ‘Salluste’ rather than 'Sallustre', perhaps to invite comparison with the Roman historian [[Sallust]]. He was possibly a student at [[College de Guyenne]] in Bordeaux ([[Montaigne|Michel de Montaigne]]’s school), and studied law in Toulouse under [[Jacques Cujas]]: he became a doctor of law in 1567, and subsequently a judge in Montfort in 1571.<ref name=Bellenger /> He gained the lordship of nearby Bartas (becoming Sieur Du Bartas) on his father’s death in 1566. He married Catherine de Manas, a local noblewoman, in 1570, and they had four daughters together: Anne, Jeanne, Marie and Isabeau.

== Poetry ==

=== ''La muse chrestienne'' ===
Du Bartas began writing poetry in the 1560s after being invited to do so by [[Jeanne d'Albret|Jeanne d'Albret de Navarre]]. His first collection, ''La muse chrestienne'' (1574) contains ‘L’Uranie’, a verse prosopographia in which the Christian muse urges the poet to commit himself to composing serious poetry on scriptural themes. The other two items in the volume, the biblical epic ''Judit'' and 'Le Triomphe de la Foi', were examples of this new religious verse.

=== The ''Semaines'' ===
Du Bartas' masterpiece is his ''Semaines'' ('Weeks'), two epic poems which freely expand on the account in the [[Book of Genesis]] of the creation of the world and the first eras of world history. Each ''Semaine'' consists of individual ''jours'' (days) which can be read separately.

==== ''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ====
''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ('The Week, or creation of the World'), subsequently also known as ''La Premiere Sepmaine'' was first printed in Paris in 1578, and was immediately popular. ''La Sepmaine'' is a [[hexameral]] poem consisting of seven ''jours'', each containing around 700 lines, devoted to the aspect of the world created on that day in the first week. Because the poem's structure follows Genesis 1:1-8 closely, it is easy to navigate to particular sections; for example, readers wanting to find what Du Bartas writes about cuttlefish or mullet could know to turn to 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day) and in most editions would have had marginal annotations to help them locate the description of each creature.

'Le Premier Jour' (The First Day) describes the creation of the world out of chaos (Du Bartas advocates the theory of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' - 'Nothing, but ''Nothing'' had the Lord Almighty, | Whereof, wherewith, whereby, to build this City' (Sylvester, I.i.228-29), forecasts the Day of Judgement and concludes with a discussion of angels. 'Le Second Jour' (The Second Day) concerns the creation of the four elements - water, air, earth and fire - and their meteorological effects. Land, seas and vegetation are created in 'Le Troisiesme Jour' (The Third Day). The earth is populated with particular species of natural life during the next three days: the sun, stars and seasons in 'Le Quatriesme Jour' (The Fourth Day); fish and birds in 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day); and land animals and human beings in 'Le Sixiesme Jour' (The Sixth Day). In 'Le Septiesme Jour' (The Seventh Day) Gods surveys the world he has created, and the poet meditates on the created world.[[File:Sallusti.png|thumb|La Sepmaine ou creation du Monde (1578)]]

==== ''La Seconde Semaine'' ====
Following the success of his First Week, Du Bartas embarked upon a sequel that would survey world history from Adam to the apocalypse, following the plan in Augustine's ''City of God''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Saint Augustine|title=City of God|origyear=1972|year= 2003|publisher=Penguin|page=1091 (Book 22, Chapter 30)}}</ref> He only completed four ''jours'', each divided into four parts, that covered the eras of Adam, Noah, Abraham and David (the final three were to cover [[Zedekiah]], the Messiah and the Eternal Sabbath).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sylvester|first1=Josuah|title=Devine Weekes and Workes|date=1621|page=Q6v}}</ref>

The first two ''jours'' of ''La Seconde Semaine'' were first printed in 1584. 'Le Premier Jour' (the era of Adam) contains 'Eden' (II.i.1) describing the Garden of Paradise; 'L'Imposture' ('The Imposture' in Sylvester's translation, II.i.2) which relates the Fall of Man; 'Les Furies' ('The Furies', II.i.3) which describes the diseases, conflicts and vices that plague mankind; and 'Les Artifices' ('The Handy Crafts', II.i.4) which is about the various crafts that humankind learnt, and Cain and Abel. 'Le Second Jour' (Noah) consists of 'L'Arche' ('The Arke', II.ii.1) retelling the Great Flood; 'Babylone' ('Babylon', II.ii.2) about the [[Tower of Babel]] and European literary cultures; 'Les Colonies' ('The Colonies', Ii.ii.3) which describes the spread of different tribes across the world; and 'Les Colomnes' ('The Columnes', II.ii.4) in which the tale (originally found in [[Josephus]]) of [[Seth]] writing scientific and astronomical knowledge on two pillars to safeguard it against fire and flood is a point of departure for a review of learning in those areas.

''Les Suites de la Second Semaine,'' containing the third and fourth ''jours'', were printed in parts between 1591 and 1603. James VI of Scotland received a manuscript copy containing six of the eight sections of the ''Suites'' (including a version of 'Les Peres' with 830 lines not found in the printed texts) in the late 1580s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Auger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=Le Manuscrit Royal de la Suite de la Seconde Semaine de Du Bartas|url=|journal=Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> 'Le Troisieme Jour' continues the narrative into the age of Abraham: La Vocation ('The Vocation', II.iii.1) and 'Les Peres' ('The Fathers', II.iii.2) cover the end of the Book of Genesis in relating the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] respectively, while 'La Loy' ('The Law', II.iii.3) moves into the Exodus narrative and 'Les Captaines' ('The Captains', II.iii.4) to [[Joshua]] and [[Samuel]]. 'Le Quatrieme Jour' is devoted to [[David]]: 'Les Trophees' ('The Trophies', II.iv.1), 'La Magnificence' ('The Magnificence', II.iv.2) is about [[Solomon]], and the final two completed sections, 'Le Schisme' ('The Schism', II.iv.3) and finally 'La Decadence' ('The Decay', II.iv.4), reviews the monarchs of the [[Books of Kings]] and [[Book of Chronicles]].

=== Miscellaneous Poems ===

Besides ''Le muse chrestienne'' and the two ''Semaines,'' Du Bartas wrote a number of occasional poems and lyrics.  Among these are two of some length, about battles that occurred in the author's lifetime: 'Cantique d'Yvry' ('Song of Ivry'), on the [[Battle of Ivry]] (1590), not long before the poet's death, and 'La Lepanthe' ('Lepanto'), a translation of [[James VI and I|James VI]]'s poem on the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas |date=1940 |page=III:490–526}}  King James' original poem was published in ''His Majesties Poeticall Exercises,'' ed. Robert Waldegrave (Edinburgh, 1591).  See Holmes (1940), ''Works of Du Bartas,'' III:506.</ref>

== Reputation ==

===France===
''La Sepmaine'' was instantly successful in France: there were 42 editions between 1578 and 1632, often printed with [[Simon Goulart]]'s marginal annotations and commentary.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes|title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I.77|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Du Bartas was the most highly esteemed French poet in France at the turn of the seventeenth century, even more so than [[Ronsard]], and in 1620 was still regarded as the apogee of French 'grand poesie'.<ref name=\"Garapon\">{{cite journal|last1=Garapon|title=Sur la Renommée posthume de Ronsard et de Du Bartas|pages=53–59}}</ref> However, there were no further French editions of the ''Semaines'' after 1630.<ref name=\"Garapon\" /> What were once regarded as the stylistic merits of Du Bartas' were later deemed to be weaknesses: his use of compound epithets, duplication of initial syllables, frequent inclusion of metaphors and similes and a highly compressed and accumulative style all contributed to a sense that his poetry was over-wrought and over-elaborate.

Nonetheless there were over thirty poems influenced by Du Bartas printed in France between 1601 and 1697, including direct continuations or parodies such as Christophe de Gamon's ''La Sepmaine'' (1609) and A. D’Argent's ''Sepmaine'' (1629), and printed references praising Du Bartas in works written throughout this period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magnien|first1=Michel|title='Du Bartas en France au XVIIe siècle' in Du Bartas: 1590–1990|date=1992|location=Mont-de-Marsan|pages=69–80}}</ref> As late as 1684 [[Madeleine de Scudéry]] recalled the often-cited anecdote that Ronsard had once remarked that Du Bartas had achieved more in a week than he had in his entire life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magnien|title=Du Bartas en France|pages=55, 75}}</ref> Du Bartas was, however, an object of criticism: he was, for example, cited for examples of mistakes to avoid in a ''Brève instruction'' (1667). Du Bartas' reputation remained low in subsequent centuries: in 1842 [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] wrote that Du Bartas ‘a pu s’égarer et céder au mauvais goût de son temps dans le gros de ces oeuvres’ (‘was led astray and gave into the poor taste of his times in most of his work’).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainte-Beuve|first1=Charles Augustin|date=1842|title=Anciens Poètes Français: Du Bartas|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k86880r/f550|journal=Revue des Deux Mondes|volume=29|pages=549–75|via=Gallica}}</ref>

Though Du Bartas is still not widely known in France today, critical re-appraisals in the twentieth century, led by James Dauphiné, Yvonne Bellenger and other, have shown how Du Bartas' encyclopedic writing was representative of its time and is still worthy of attention.

===Scotland===
[[James VI]] of [[Scotland]]'s enthusiasm for Du Bartas made the Frenchman's poetry uniquely popular in sixteenth-century Scotland. James possessed a copy of ''La Sepmaine'' given to him by his nurse,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=George Frederick|title=The Library of James VI, 1573–1583|date=1893|location=Edinburgh|page=xliii}}</ref> and a year later wrote in the preface to his ''Essayes of a Prentise'' (Edinburgh, 1584) that

:Hauing oft reuolued, and red ouer (fauorable Reader) the booke and Poems of the deuine and Illuster Poete, Salust du Bartas, I was moved by the oft reading & perusing of them, with a restles and lofty desire, to preas to attaine to the like vertue. (''Essayes'', C3r)

The volume contained James's Scots translation of ''L'Uranie''. Du Bartas' synthesis of sacred and secular verse matched the King's own aesthetic preferences, and also his political imperative to consolidate his divine and political authority. The King shared Urania's sense that more poets should write about the highest matters:

:O ye that wolde your browes with Laurel bind,
:What larger feild I pray you can you find,
:Then is his praise, who brydles heavens most cleare
:Makes mountaines tremble, and howest hells to feare?

[[Thomas Hudson (poet)|Thomas Hudson]], a court musician, was (so he writes in the preface) commissioned by the King to prepare a translation of ''Judit'', which was printed in 1584 with prefatory sonnets by James and others. Du Bartas was evidently quickly made aware of the King's attention, for a publisher's contract which Du Bartas signed in 1585 mentions printing the King's translation (as well as Du Bartas’ translation of the King's ‘Ane Schort Poeme of Tyme’).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I. 205–6}}</ref>

Du Bartas and James subsequently met in the summer of 1587 when the French poet travelled on a diplomatic mission to Scotland, via the English Court, to propose a marriage match between James and [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]]’s sister, [[Catherine de Bourbon]]. Though the match never happened, Du Bartas remained in high esteem with James: he received expensive gifts on departure, and the King invited him to return.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Du Bartas' Visit to England and Scotland}}</ref> It may well have been during this visit that Du Bartas translated James’ mini-epic on [[The Battle of Lepanto]] which was printed alongside James’ original poem and his translation of ‘Les Furies’ in his ''[[Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres]]'' (1591).

Poets writing at the Jacobean Court (members of the so-called \"[[Castalian Band]]\") all knew of Du Bartas, who was ‘aesthetically and ideologically a role-model for James’ and ‘emblematic of the direction, spiritually, philosophically and aesthetically, in which James sought to lead his imagined renaissance’ (Sarah Dunnigan) at the Scottish Court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dunnigan|first1=Sarah|title=Eros and Poetry at the Courts of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI|date=2002|location=Basingstoke|pages=5}}</ref> [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]]<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Thomas Hudson's Historie of Judith|date=1941|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=4}}</ref> and [[John Stewart of Baldynneis]]<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Crockett |editor-first1=Thomas|title=Poems of John Stewart of Baldynneis|pages=II, p. 196}}</ref> are two poets who refer to Urania as a symbolic figurehead for the kind of poetic inspiration to which they aspired in vain. Hadrian Damman's Latin translation was dedicated to James when printed in 1600 (a manuscript copy dated 1596 also survives, National Library of Scotland MS Adv. 19.2.10).<ref>{{cite web|title=English Short Title Catalogue|url=http://estc.bl.uk/S116418}}</ref> [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] and [[Zachary Boyd]] are three seventeenth-century Scottish poets who knew Du Bartas’ works well; the latter two imitate his works (Sylvester's translation in Boyd's case) extensively.

James had a major impact on English responses both before and after his accession to the English throne. Gabriel Harvey is one of numerous writers in London who were reading James' translation in the 1590s: when Harvey praised Du Bartas as the ‘Treasurer of Humanity and 'Ieweller of Diuinity’ and ‘a right inspired, and enravished Poet’ in the preface to ''Pierces Supererogation'' (1593) and other works, he was in part drawing on notes made in his copy of James's ''Essayes''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=401–16}}</ref> A passage in the King's ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' exhorting more poets to 'bee well versed' in Du Bartas' poetry<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Basilicon Doron|date=1944|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=I, p. 199}}</ref> was cited, for instance, by [[Thomas Winter (M.A.)|Thomas Winter]] in the dedicatory epistle of his translation of the ''Third Dayes Creation'' (1604). [[Joshua Sylvester]] dedicated his translation ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605) to James, having presented a manuscript extract to the King in the previous year.

===England===
Du Bartas was extremely popular in early modern England, and was still being read widely in the later seventeenth century even as his reputation in France began to decline. Around two hundred texts printed in England before 1700 make direct reference to Du Bartas, including seventy-five from the period 1641-1700.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Snapshots|pages=3–4, 8}}</ref> There were numerous translations of sections of the ''Semaines'' into English, of which the most significant is [[Josuah Sylvester]]'s ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605 et seq.; re-printed six times by 1641). Du Bartas was quickly regarded as a divine epic poet whose works took their place among the great European classics: [[Gabriel Harvey]], for example, compared Du Bartas to Homer, Virgil and Dante.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=403, 411}}</ref>

[[Sir Philip Sidney]] apparently admired Du Bartas' works later in life, and his translation of 'Salust Du Bartas' was entered into the Stationers’ Register in 1588, but is now unknown.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ringler|first1=William A.|title=The Poems of Philip Sidney|date=1962|location=Oxford|page=339}}</ref> Du Bartas had in effect synthesized the two highest forms of poetry, divine and philosophical, described in Sidney's ''[[An Apology for Poetry|Apology for Poetry]]''. S. K. Heninger, reflecting on similarities between Sidney and Du Bartas’ conception of poetry, writes that: ‘the reader could ponder the wide-ranging mysteries of creation. He could contemplate God’s intention, His methods, His results. The text is characterized by a Protestant passion for the truth—the truth, at once universal and concrete. It is also characterized by a Protestant devotion to the word—the word, at once comprehensive and knowable, ''logos'' though it may be.’<ref>{{cite book|last1=Heninger Jr.|first1=S. K.|title='Sidney and Milton: The Poet as Maker', in ''Milton and the Line of Vision'', ed. Joseph Wittreich|date=1975|page=59}}</ref>

William Scott, author of ‘[[The Model of Poesy]]’ and a translator of the first two Days of ''La Sepmaine'', found moral, spiritual and aesthetic value in the poetry of 'our incomparable Bartas, who hath opened as much natural science in one week, containing the story of the creation, as all the rabble of schoolmen and philosophers have done since Plato and Aristotle.'<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Gavin|title=The Model of Poesy|date=2013|location=Cambridge|page=20.12–6}}</ref> Edmund Spenser, said by Harvey to have particularly enjoyed The Fourth Day, writes in ''[[The Ruines of Time]]'' that after [[Joachim Du Bellay]] 'gins ''Bartas'' hie to rayse | His heavenly Muse, th'Almighty to adore'; however, ‘within the shared province of Christian epic, Spenser and du Bartas remain fairly far apart’ (Susan Snyder).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Susan|title='Du Bartas' in ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'', ed. by A. C. Hamilton|date=1990|location=Toronto|page=80}}</ref>

According to Snyder, ‘clearly everyone in pre-Restoration England who had received a literary education read the Weekes and almost all [...] admired it.’<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=1|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26873|accessdate=30 November 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/26873|year=2004}}</ref>  Du Bartas was [[John Milton]]'s ‘earliest English literary model’, and traces of direct influence are arguably most apparent in ''Poems'' 1645.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=John|title=Milton: The Complete Shorter Poems|date=2007|location=Harlow|page=102}}</ref> Nonetheless the ''Semaines ''were a major precursor for ''[[Paradise Lost]] '', and can productively be compared with it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paradise Lost in Context|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/17century/topic_2/dubartas.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Norton Topics Online|accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref> Du Bartas was also an early influence on [[Anne Bradstreet]]; one of her earliest dated works is her elegy ‘In Honour of Du Bartas. 1641’. The prefatory materials to ''The Tenth Muse'' (1650) make numerous references to Bradstreet's enthusiasm for Du Bartas, including Nathaniel Ward's condescending remark that Bradstreet is a 'right Du Bartas girle'. Though Bradstreet's poetry owes much to Du Bartas' methods, her work is not derivative, and she denied that her poetry imitates Du Bartas in her dedicatory poem to her father Thomas Dudley: 'I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth’ (ll. 38-9).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hensley|first1=Jeannine|title=THe Works of Anne Bradstreet|date=2005|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=4, 14}}</ref> [[Lucy Hutchinson]] would have read ''Devine Weekes'' before writing ''Order and Disorder''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Norbrook|first1=David|title=Lucy Hutchinson, Order and Disorder|date=2001|page=xxv}}</ref>

===Rest of Europe===
Du Bartas' works, particularly and often exclusively ''La Sepmaine'', were translated into numerous other European languages in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|last2= Ternaux|title=Bibliographie|pages=29–36}}</ref> There were translations into Latin (by Gabriel de Lerm (1583), Jean Édouard Du Monin (1579), Hadrian Damman (1600) and Samuel Benoît (1609)), Italian (by Ferrante Guisone, first printed in 1592 and reprinted five times before 1613), Spanish (Joan Dessi, 1610, and Francisco de Cáceres in 1612) and German (Tobias Hübner, 1622 and 1631). Several Dutch translators produced versions: Zacharias Heyns (1616, 1621 and 1628), Theodorick van Liefvelt, Heer van Opdorp (1609), Wessel van den Boetselaer, Heer van Asperen (1622) and [[Joost van den Vondel]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beekman|title=Influence de Du Bartas|pages=70–195}}</ref> A Danish translation of  ''La Sepmaine'' was printed in 1661, and a Swedish translation in 1685.

Du Bartas' popularity apparently declined throughout Europe in the eighteenth century: in his translation of [[Diderot]]'s '[[Rameau's Nephew]]' (1805) [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] expressed surprise that ''La Sepmaine'' was no longer widely known.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goethe|first1=Johann Wolfgang von|chapter=Rameaus Neffe|title=Sämtliche Werke|volume= 7|date=1981|location=Munich|pages=663–664}}</ref>

'''Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas''' (1544, in [[Monfort]] – July 1590, in [[Mauvezin, Gers|Mauvezin]]) was a [[Gascony|Gascon]] [[Huguenot]] courtier and poet. Trained as a doctor of law, he served in the court of [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]] for most of his career. Du Bartas was celebrated across sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe for his divine poetry, particularly ''L'Uranie ''(1584), ''Judit ''(1584), ''La Sepmaine; ou, Creation du monde'' (1578), and ''La Seconde Semaine'' (1584-1603).

== Life ==
Relatively little is known about Du Bartas’ life. Born in 1544, Guillaume Sallustre descended from a family of wealthy merchants in Montfort (in the [[Armagnac (province)|Armagnac]] region).<ref name=Bellenger>{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|first1=Yvonne|title=La Sepmaine (texte de 1581)|date=1981|location=Paris|pages=xix–xxiii}}</ref> His family name later became ‘Salluste’ rather than 'Sallustre', perhaps to invite comparison with the Roman historian [[Sallust]]. He was possibly a student at [[College de Guyenne]] in Bordeaux ([[Montaigne|Michel de Montaigne]]’s school), and studied law in Toulouse under [[Jacques Cujas]]: he became a doctor of law in 1567, and subsequently a judge in Montfort in 1571.<ref name=Bellenger /> He gained the lordship of nearby Bartas (becoming Sieur Du Bartas) on his father’s death in 1566. He married Catherine de Manas, a local noblewoman, in 1570, and they had four daughters together: Anne, Jeanne, Marie and Isabeau.

He entered the service of [[Henri de Navarre]] in 1576, who would become Henri IV of France in 1589.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Pellissier|title=Du Bartas}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Du Bartas et ses Divines Semaines|last = Bellenger|first = Yvonne|year = 1993|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 15–24}}</ref> He was sent on various diplomatic missions, including to Montmorency in 1580, and Scotland and England in 1587. The poet left Scotland from [[Dumbarton Castle]] for [[La Rochelle]] laden with presents. [[James VI of Scotland|James Vi]] hired one of the best ships in the kingdom for him, knighted him, and gave him a gold chain, and 2000 [[Écu|gold crowns]], \"with a tablett of gold, having in itt his Majesties pourtraict\", besides several hackney horses and other presents from the nobility and courtiers.<ref>Edmund Lodge, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 2 (London, 1791), p. 352 no. 215.</ref>

He died in 1590, just weeks after composing a poem that celebrated Henri's victory at the [[Battle of Ivry]], though it is not thought that he fought in the battle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|title=La Sepmaine|page=xxiii}}</ref>

Château Du Bartas, found in Saint Georges, was Du Bartas' residence in the later part of his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.au-chateau.com/Barthas.php|title = Château du Barthas |date = |accessdate = 11 November 2014|website = }}</ref> A statue of Du Bartas stands in a square named after him in [[Auch]], the historic capital of [[Gascony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.monnuage.fr/point-d-interet/statue-du-bartas-a100888|title = Statue du Bartas|date = |accessdate = 11 November 2014|website = MonNuage}}</ref>

== Poetry ==

=== ''La muse chrestienne'' ===
Du Bartas began writing poetry in the 1560s after being invited to do so by [[Jeanne d'Albret|Jeanne d'Albret de Navarre]]. His first collection, ''La muse chrestienne'' (1574) contains ‘L’Uranie’, a verse prosopographia in which the Christian muse urges the poet to commit himself to composing serious poetry on scriptural themes. The other two items in the volume, the biblical epic ''Judit'' and 'Le Triomphe de la Foi', were examples of this new religious verse.

=== The ''Semaines'' ===
Du Bartas' masterpiece is his ''Semaines'' ('Weeks'), two epic poems which freely expand on the account in the [[Book of Genesis]] of the creation of the world and the first eras of world history. Each ''Semaine'' consists of individual ''jours'' (days) which can be read separately.

==== ''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ====
''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ('The Week, or creation of the World'), subsequently also known as ''La Premiere Sepmaine'' was first printed in Paris in 1578, and was immediately popular. ''La Sepmaine'' is a [[hexameral]] poem consisting of seven ''jours'', each containing around 700 lines, devoted to the aspect of the world created on that day in the first week. Because the poem's structure follows Genesis 1:1-8 closely, it is easy to navigate to particular sections; for example, readers wanting to find what Du Bartas writes about cuttlefish or mullet could know to turn to 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day) and in most editions would have had marginal annotations to help them locate the description of each creature.

'Le Premier Jour' (The First Day) describes the creation of the world out of chaos (Du Bartas advocates the theory of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' - 'Nothing, but ''Nothing'' had the Lord Almighty, | Whereof, wherewith, whereby, to build this City' (Sylvester, I.i.228-29), forecasts the Day of Judgement and concludes with a discussion of angels. 'Le Second Jour' (The Second Day) concerns the creation of the four elements - water, air, earth and fire - and their meteorological effects. Land, seas and vegetation are created in 'Le Troisiesme Jour' (The Third Day). The earth is populated with particular species of natural life during the next three days: the sun, stars and seasons in 'Le Quatriesme Jour' (The Fourth Day); fish and birds in 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day); and land animals and human beings in 'Le Sixiesme Jour' (The Sixth Day). In 'Le Septiesme Jour' (The Seventh Day) Gods surveys the world he has created, and the poet meditates on the created world.[[File:Sallusti.png|thumb|La Sepmaine ou creation du Monde (1578)]]

==== ''La Seconde Semaine'' ====
Following the success of his First Week, Du Bartas embarked upon a sequel that would survey world history from Adam to the apocalypse, following the plan in Augustine's ''City of God''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Saint Augustine|title=City of God|origyear=1972|year= 2003|publisher=Penguin|page=1091 (Book 22, Chapter 30)}}</ref> He only completed four ''jours'', each divided into four parts, that covered the eras of Adam, Noah, Abraham and David (the final three were to cover [[Zedekiah]], the Messiah and the Eternal Sabbath).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sylvester|first1=Josuah|title=Devine Weekes and Workes|date=1621|page=Q6v}}</ref>

The first two ''jours'' of ''La Seconde Semaine'' were first printed in 1584. 'Le Premier Jour' (the era of Adam) contains 'Eden' (II.i.1) describing the Garden of Paradise; 'L'Imposture' ('The Imposture' in Sylvester's translation, II.i.2) which relates the Fall of Man; 'Les Furies' ('The Furies', II.i.3) which describes the diseases, conflicts and vices that plague mankind; and 'Les Artifices' ('The Handy Crafts', II.i.4) which is about the various crafts that humankind learnt, and Cain and Abel. 'Le Second Jour' (Noah) consists of 'L'Arche' ('The Arke', II.ii.1) retelling the Great Flood; 'Babylone' ('Babylon', II.ii.2) about the [[Tower of Babel]] and European literary cultures; 'Les Colonies' ('The Colonies', Ii.ii.3) which describes the spread of different tribes across the world; and 'Les Colomnes' ('The Columnes', II.ii.4) in which the tale (originally found in [[Josephus]]) of [[Seth]] writing scientific and astronomical knowledge on two pillars to safeguard it against fire and flood is a point of departure for a review of learning in those areas.

''Les Suites de la Second Semaine,'' containing the third and fourth ''jours'', were printed in parts between 1591 and 1603. James VI of Scotland received a manuscript copy containing six of the eight sections of the ''Suites'' (including a version of 'Les Peres' with 830 lines not found in the printed texts) in the late 1580s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Auger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=Le Manuscrit Royal de la Suite de la Seconde Semaine de Du Bartas|url=|journal=Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> 'Le Troisieme Jour' continues the narrative into the age of Abraham: La Vocation ('The Vocation', II.iii.1) and 'Les Peres' ('The Fathers', II.iii.2) cover the end of the Book of Genesis in relating the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] respectively, while 'La Loy' ('The Law', II.iii.3) moves into the Exodus narrative and 'Les Captaines' ('The Captains', II.iii.4) to [[Joshua]] and [[Samuel]]. 'Le Quatrieme Jour' is devoted to [[David]]: 'Les Trophees' ('The Trophies', II.iv.1), 'La Magnificence' ('The Magnificence', II.iv.2) is about [[Solomon]], and the final two completed sections, 'Le Schisme' ('The Schism', II.iv.3) and finally 'La Decadence' ('The Decay', II.iv.4), reviews the monarchs of the [[Books of Kings]] and [[Book of Chronicles]].

=== Miscellaneous Poems ===

Besides ''Le muse chrestienne'' and the two ''Semaines,'' Du Bartas wrote a number of occasional poems and lyrics.  Among these are two of some length, about battles that occurred in the author's lifetime: 'Cantique d'Yvry' ('Song of Ivry'), on the [[Battle of Ivry]] (1590), not long before the poet's death, and 'La Lepanthe' ('Lepanto'), a translation of [[James VI and I|James VI]]'s poem on the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas |date=1940 |page=III:490–526}}  King James' original poem was published in ''His Majesties Poeticall Exercises,'' ed. Robert Waldegrave (Edinburgh, 1591).  See Holmes (1940), ''Works of Du Bartas,'' III:506.</ref>

== Reputation ==

===France===
''La Sepmaine'' was instantly successful in France: there were 42 editions between 1578 and 1632, often printed with [[Simon Goulart]]'s marginal annotations and commentary.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes|title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I.77|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Du Bartas was the most highly esteemed French poet in France at the turn of the seventeenth century, even more so than [[Ronsard]], and in 1620 was still regarded as the apogee of French 'grand poesie'.<ref name=\"Garapon\">{{cite journal|last1=Garapon|title=Sur la Renommée posthume de Ronsard et de Du Bartas|pages=53–59}}</ref> However, there were no further French editions of the ''Semaines'' after 1630.<ref name=\"Garapon\" /> What were once regarded as the stylistic merits of Du Bartas' were later deemed to be weaknesses: his use of compound epithets, duplication of initial syllables, frequent inclusion of metaphors and similes and a highly compressed and accumulative style all contributed to a sense that his poetry was over-wrought and over-elaborate.

Nonetheless there were over thirty poems influenced by Du Bartas printed in France between 1601 and 1697, including direct continuations or parodies such as Christophe de Gamon's ''La Sepmaine'' (1609) and A. D’Argent's ''Sepmaine'' (1629), and printed references praising Du Bartas in works written throughout this period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magnien|first1=Michel|title='Du Bartas en France au XVIIe siècle' in Du Bartas: 1590–1990|date=1992|location=Mont-de-Marsan|pages=69–80}}</ref> As late as 1684 [[Madeleine de Scudéry]] recalled the often-cited anecdote that Ronsard had once remarked that Du Bartas had achieved more in a week than he had in his entire life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magnien|title=Du Bartas en France|pages=55, 75}}</ref> Du Bartas was, however, an object of criticism: he was, for example, cited for examples of mistakes to avoid in a ''Brève instruction'' (1667). Du Bartas' reputation remained low in subsequent centuries: in 1842 [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] wrote that Du Bartas ‘a pu s’égarer et céder au mauvais goût de son temps dans le gros de ces oeuvres’ (‘was led astray and gave into the poor taste of his times in most of his work’).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainte-Beuve|first1=Charles Augustin|date=1842|title=Anciens Poètes Français: Du Bartas|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k86880r/f550|journal=Revue des Deux Mondes|volume=29|pages=549–75|via=Gallica}}</ref>

Though Du Bartas is still not widely known in France today, critical re-appraisals in the twentieth century, led by James Dauphiné, Yvonne Bellenger and other, have shown how Du Bartas' encyclopedic writing was representative of its time and is still worthy of attention.

===Scotland===
[[James VI]] of [[Scotland]]'s enthusiasm for Du Bartas made the Frenchman's poetry uniquely popular in sixteenth-century Scotland. James possessed a copy of ''La Sepmaine'' given to him by his nurse,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=George Frederick|title=The Library of James VI, 1573–1583|date=1893|location=Edinburgh|page=xliii}}</ref> and a year later wrote in the preface to his ''Essayes of a Prentise'' (Edinburgh, 1584) that

:Hauing oft reuolued, and red ouer (fauorable Reader) the booke and Poems of the deuine and Illuster Poete, Salust du Bartas, I was moved by the oft reading & perusing of them, with a restles and lofty desire, to preas to attaine to the like vertue. (''Essayes'', C3r)

The volume contained James's Scots translation of ''L'Uranie''. Du Bartas' synthesis of sacred and secular verse matched the King's own aesthetic preferences, and also his political imperative to consolidate his divine and political authority. The King shared Urania's sense that more poets should write about the highest matters:

:O ye that wolde your browes with Laurel bind,
:What larger feild I pray you can you find,
:Then is his praise, who brydles heavens most cleare
:Makes mountaines tremble, and howest hells to feare?

[[Thomas Hudson (poet)|Thomas Hudson]], a court musician, was (so he writes in the preface) commissioned by the King to prepare a translation of ''Judit'', which was printed in 1584 with prefatory sonnets by James and others. Du Bartas was evidently quickly made aware of the King's attention, for a publisher's contract which Du Bartas signed in 1585 mentions printing the King's translation (as well as Du Bartas’ translation of the King's ‘Ane Schort Poeme of Tyme’).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I. 205–6}}</ref>

Du Bartas and James subsequently met in the summer of 1587 when the French poet travelled on a diplomatic mission to Scotland, via the English Court, to propose a marriage match between James and [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]]’s sister, [[Catherine de Bourbon]]. Though the match never happened, Du Bartas remained in high esteem with James: he received expensive gifts on departure, and the King invited him to return.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Du Bartas' Visit to England and Scotland}}</ref> It may well have been during this visit that Du Bartas translated James’ mini-epic on [[The Battle of Lepanto]] which was printed alongside James’ original poem and his translation of ‘Les Furies’ in his ''[[Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres]]'' (1591).

Poets writing at the Jacobean Court (members of the so-called \"[[Castalian Band]]\") all knew of Du Bartas, who was ‘aesthetically and ideologically a role-model for James’ and ‘emblematic of the direction, spiritually, philosophically and aesthetically, in which James sought to lead his imagined renaissance’ (Sarah Dunnigan) at the Scottish Court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dunnigan|first1=Sarah|title=Eros and Poetry at the Courts of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI|date=2002|location=Basingstoke|pages=5}}</ref> [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]]<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Thomas Hudson's Historie of Judith|date=1941|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=4}}</ref> and [[John Stewart of Baldynneis]]<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Crockett |editor-first1=Thomas|title=Poems of John Stewart of Baldynneis|pages=II, p. 196}}</ref> are two poets who refer to Urania as a symbolic figurehead for the kind of poetic inspiration to which they aspired in vain. Hadrian Damman's Latin translation was dedicated to James when printed in 1600 (a manuscript copy dated 1596 also survives, National Library of Scotland MS Adv. 19.2.10).<ref>{{cite web|title=English Short Title Catalogue|url=http://estc.bl.uk/S116418}}</ref> [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] and [[Zachary Boyd]] are three seventeenth-century Scottish poets who knew Du Bartas’ works well; the latter two imitate his works (Sylvester's translation in Boyd's case) extensively.

James had a major impact on English responses both before and after his accession to the English throne. Gabriel Harvey is one of numerous writers in London who were reading James' translation in the 1590s: when Harvey praised Du Bartas as the ‘Treasurer of Humanity and 'Ieweller of Diuinity’ and ‘a right inspired, and enravished Poet’ in the preface to ''Pierces Supererogation'' (1593) and other works, he was in part drawing on notes made in his copy of James's ''Essayes''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=401–16}}</ref> A passage in the King's ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' exhorting more poets to 'bee well versed' in Du Bartas' poetry<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Basilicon Doron|date=1944|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=I, p. 199}}</ref> was cited, for instance, by [[Thomas Winter (M.A.)|Thomas Winter]] in the dedicatory epistle of his translation of the ''Third Dayes Creation'' (1604). [[Joshua Sylvester]] dedicated his translation ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605) to James, having presented a manuscript extract to the King in the previous year.

===England===
Du Bartas was extremely popular in early modern England, and was still being read widely in the later seventeenth century even as his reputation in France began to decline. Around two hundred texts printed in England before 1700 make direct reference to Du Bartas, including seventy-five from the period 1641-1700.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Snapshots|pages=3–4, 8}}</ref> There were numerous translations of sections of the ''Semaines'' into English, of which the most significant is [[Josuah Sylvester]]'s ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605 et seq.; re-printed six times by 1641). Du Bartas was quickly regarded as a divine epic poet whose works took their place among the great European classics: [[Gabriel Harvey]], for example, compared Du Bartas to Homer, Virgil and Dante.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=403, 411}}</ref>

[[Sir Philip Sidney]] apparently admired Du Bartas' works later in life, and his translation of 'Salust Du Bartas' was entered into the Stationers’ Register in 1588, but is now unknown.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ringler|first1=William A.|title=The Poems of Philip Sidney|date=1962|location=Oxford|page=339}}</ref> Du Bartas had in effect synthesized the two highest forms of poetry, divine and philosophical, described in Sidney's ''[[An Apology for Poetry|Apology for Poetry]]''. S. K. Heninger, reflecting on similarities between Sidney and Du Bartas’ conception of poetry, writes that: ‘the reader could ponder the wide-ranging mysteries of creation. He could contemplate God’s intention, His methods, His results. The text is characterized by a Protestant passion for the truth—the truth, at once universal and concrete. It is also characterized by a Protestant devotion to the word—the word, at once comprehensive and knowable, ''logos'' though it may be.’<ref>{{cite book|last1=Heninger Jr.|first1=S. K.|title='Sidney and Milton: The Poet as Maker', in ''Milton and the Line of Vision'', ed. Joseph Wittreich|date=1975|page=59}}</ref>

William Scott, author of ‘[[The Model of Poesy]]’ and a translator of the first two Days of ''La Sepmaine'', found moral, spiritual and aesthetic value in the poetry of 'our incomparable Bartas, who hath opened as much natural science in one week, containing the story of the creation, as all the rabble of schoolmen and philosophers have done since Plato and Aristotle.'<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Gavin|title=The Model of Poesy|date=2013|location=Cambridge|page=20.12–6}}</ref> Edmund Spenser, said by Harvey to have particularly enjoyed The Fourth Day, writes in ''[[The Ruines of Time]]'' that after [[Joachim Du Bellay]] 'gins ''Bartas'' hie to rayse | His heavenly Muse, th'Almighty to adore'; however, ‘within the shared province of Christian epic, Spenser and du Bartas remain fairly far apart’ (Susan Snyder).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Susan|title='Du Bartas' in ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'', ed. by A. C. Hamilton|date=1990|location=Toronto|page=80}}</ref>

According to Snyder, ‘clearly everyone in pre-Restoration England who had received a literary education read the Weekes and almost all [...] admired it.’<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=1|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26873|accessdate=30 November 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/26873|year=2004}}</ref>  Du Bartas was [[John Milton]]'s ‘earliest English literary model’, and traces of direct influence are arguably most apparent in ''Poems'' 1645.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=John|title=Milton: The Complete Shorter Poems|date=2007|location=Harlow|page=102}}</ref> Nonetheless the ''Semaines ''were a major precursor for ''[[Paradise Lost]] '', and can productively be compared with it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paradise Lost in Context|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/17century/topic_2/dubartas.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Norton Topics Online|accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref> Du Bartas was also an early influence on [[Anne Bradstreet]]; one of her earliest dated works is her elegy ‘In Honour of Du Bartas. 1641’. The prefatory materials to ''The Tenth Muse'' (1650) make numerous references to Bradstreet's enthusiasm for Du Bartas, including Nathaniel Ward's condescending remark that Bradstreet is a 'right Du Bartas girle'. Though Bradstreet's poetry owes much to Du Bartas' methods, her work is not derivative, and she denied that her poetry imitates Du Bartas in her dedicatory poem to her father Thomas Dudley: 'I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth’ (ll. 38-9).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hensley|first1=Jeannine|title=THe Works of Anne Bradstreet|date=2005|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=4, 14}}</ref> [[Lucy Hutchinson]] would have read ''Devine Weekes'' before writing ''Order and Disorder''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Norbrook|first1=David|title=Lucy Hutchinson, Order and Disorder|date=2001|page=xxv}}</ref>

===Rest of Europe===
Du Bartas' works, particularly and often exclusively ''La Sepmaine'', were translated into numerous other European languages in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|last2= Ternaux|title=Bibliographie|pages=29–36}}</ref> There were translations into Latin (by Gabriel de Lerm (1583), Jean Édouard Du Monin (1579), Hadrian Damman (1600) and Samuel Benoît (1609)), Italian (by Ferrante Guisone, first printed in 1592 and reprinted five times before 1613), Spanish (Joan Dessi, 1610, and Francisco de Cáceres in 1612) and German (Tobias Hübner, 1622 and 1631). Several Dutch translators produced versions: Zacharias Heyns (1616, 1621 and 1628), Theodorick van Liefvelt, Heer van Opdorp (1609), Wessel van den Boetselaer, Heer van Asperen (1622) and [[Joost van den Vondel]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beekman|title=Influence de Du Bartas|pages=70–195}}</ref> A Danish translation of  ''La Sepmaine'' was printed in 1661, and a Swedish translation in 1685.

Du Bartas' popularity apparently declined throughout Europe in the eighteenth century: in his translation of [[Diderot]]'s '[[Rameau's Nephew]]' (1805) [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] expressed surprise that ''La Sepmaine'' was no longer widely known.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goethe|first1=Johann Wolfgang von|chapter=Rameaus Neffe|title=Sämtliche Werke|volume= 7|date=1981|location=Munich|pages=663–664}}</ref>

{{short description|Billboard chart}}
'''[[Alternative rock|Alternative]] Songs''' (also called '''Alternative''' and formerly known as '''Modern Rock Tracks''' and '''Hot Modern Rock Tracks''') is a [[music chart]] in the United States that has appeared in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] since September 10, 1988.  It lists the 40 most-played songs on [[alternative music|alternative]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations. The chart was introduced as a companion to the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. During the first several years of the chart, it regularly featured music that did not receive commercial radio airplay anywhere but on a few modern rock and college rock radio stations. This included many [[electronica|electronic]] and [[post-punk]] artists. Gradually, as alternative rock became more \"mainstream\" (particularly spearheaded by the [[grunge]] explosion in the early 1990s), the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock Songs charts began featuring more of the same songs. However, the formats would differentiate themselves by the late 2000s. Today, the Alternative Songs chart favors more [[indie rock]], [[indie pop]], and [[synth-pop]] bands while the Mainstream Rock chart favors more [[alternative rock]], [[hard rock]], and [[heavy metal music]].

The chart is based solely on radio airplay. As of 2012, approximately 80 radio stations are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite news|url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BX&s_site=sunherald&p_multi=BX&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10C3552E00587870&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title = The charts|work = [[The Sun Herald]]|date = 2005-08-25|accessdate = 2008-01-18|format = fee required}}</ref> Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's [[Arbitron]] listener data. The chart had 30 positions when it was introduced in September 1988, and was expanded to 40 positions on September 10, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternative Songs: Top Alternative Songs Chart: September 10, 1994|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/alternative-songs/1994-09-10|website=Billboard}}</ref>

The chart was renamed Alternative Songs beginning with the June 20, 2009 issue after ''Billboard'' fully absorbed ''[[Radio & Records]]'', whose similar chart was called \"Alternative\" instead of \"Modern Rock\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/268412/chart-beat-pink-black-eyed-peas-shinedown |title=Chart Beat: Pink, Black Eyed Peas, Shinedown |author=Gary Trust |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
The first Alternative Songs chart appeared in the September 10, 1988 edition of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine, then known as \"Modern Rock Tracks\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5687275/alternative-chart-25th-anniversary-top-50-artists-most-top-10s|title=Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 50 Artists, Most Top 10s, Most No. 1s & More|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> The first song to reach the chart's No. 1 position was Siouxsie and the Banshees' \"Peek-a-Boo\", which topped the charts for two weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popradiotop20.com/Modern-Rock/Siouxsie.htm|title=Siouxsie & The Banshees|website=www.popradiotop20.com|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> In the chart's early years, the chart was closely associated with [[college rock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[post-punk]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]] genres with a large presence of British, Irish and Australian artists, as only 24 of the chart's first 82 number-one hits were by American acts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/article/9214-radio-friendly-unit-shifters-25-years-of-billboards-alternative-music-chart/|title=Radio-Friendly Unit Shifters {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> Bands including [[Depeche Mode]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[The Cure]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[R.E.M.]] were amongst the most popular acts on Alternative radio in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many rock artists do not release commercial [[single (music)|singles]] in the United States. Several popular songs which were not released as commercial singles did not qualify for the Hot 100 before December 1998, but performed very well on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

In 1991, with the release of \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\" by Nirvana (which reached No. 1 on November 23, 1991),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/312336/nirvana/chart?f=377|title=Nirvana – Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> grunge became a new form of alternative rock to chart. However, grunge did not have a dominating presence on the chart in its heyday; over time, grunge would grow into popularity as a representation of alternative rock in the mainstream. Iconic grunge songs fared decently on the Alternative Songs chart but better on the Mainstream Rock Songs.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, \"[[Black (Pearl Jam song)|Black]]\" by [[Pearl Jam]] peaked only at No. 20 on the former but No. 3 on the latter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/328459/pearl-jam/chart?page=2&f=377|title=Pearl Jam – Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/328459/pearl-jam/chart?page=1&f=376|title=Pearl Jam – Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> This was because the college rock and new wave of the 1980s remained the dominant styles of the format, while grunge became an alternative rock style that was popular on the Mainstream Rock format.

In the mid-1990s, alternative rock songs began to crossover to [[Popular music|Pop]] radio, with acts such as [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]] and [[Alanis Morissette]] being played on Pop stations after establishing hits on the Alternative chart.<ref name=\":1\" /> Dominant genres included [[pop punk]] and softer alternative rock, as grunge acts such as [[Soundgarden]] and [[Stone Temple Pilots]] did not reach No. 1, while [[Britpop]], a form of alternative rock from the UK, was represented only by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].<ref name=\":1\" /> By the late 1990s, the Alternative Songs chart was ruled by relatively lighter alternative rock bands such as [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Matchbox Twenty]] and [[Sugar Ray]] and a plethora of one-hit wonders.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://grantland.com/features/haim-days-gone-indie-rock-death-rattle/|title=Indie Rock’s Tuneful Death Rattle|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=2013-10-01|work=Grantland|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en-US}}</ref>

At the turn of the century, alternative radio embraced [[Nu metal|nu-metal]]/[[rap rock]] with bands including [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]] and most famously, [[Linkin Park]]. Chris Molanphy of [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] stated that \"possibly the most loathed period for music of the last half-century, the rap-rock years-- when looked through the prism of the Modern Rock chart’s evolution-- are a logical endpoint to a decade when alt-culture steadily de-wussified itself.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Garage rock from the likes of [[The White Stripes]] and [[The Strokes]] also became hits in the early 2000s as a counter to the over-aggression of rap rock.<ref name=\":1\" />

In the mid-2000s, the Alternative charts were ruled at the top by its most dominant members. From 2003 to 2008, the No. 1 song was by either [[Foo Fighters]], Green Day, [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], Linkin Park or [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] 49% of the time – 152 out of 313 weeks.<ref name=\":1\" /> During this time, classic '90s alternative groups such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Weezer]] enjoyed their biggest success, while [[emo]] ([[Jimmy Eat World]]), indie rock ([[Modest Mouse]]) and pop punk ([[Fall Out Boy]]) also were popular.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 2007, \"[[The Kill]]\" by [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] set a record for the longest-running hit in the history of the US alternative chart when it remained on the national chart for 52 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&id=7430|title=30 Seconds to Mars Breaks Modern Rock Record|date=February 2, 2007|first=Kaj|last=Roth|work=[[Melodic (magazine)|Melodic]]|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref> [[Rise Against]]'s \"[[Savior (Rise Against song)|Savior]]\" later broke the record by spending 65 weeks, followed around the same time by \"[[1901 (song)|1901]]\" from [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]] at 57.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGl78gyjknMC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=savior+rise+against+alternative+songs+record&source=bl&ots=NI8xs7Kyd8&sig=n7rgGhiuTWwVl862ELpF6E795AE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMw9mjybnLAhUW-mMKHWeNAQkQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&q=savior%20rise%20against%20alternative%20songs%20record&f=false|title=Extended Stays|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=October 2, 2010|page=42|volume=122|issue=39|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref> In 2009, ''Billboard'' renamed the chart to \"Alternative Songs\".<ref name=\":0\" />

In the 2010s, the Alternative charts were led by softer [[indie pop]] and [[Folk music|folk]], and crossed over new acts to [[Contemporary hit radio|pop radio]] for the first time since the late '90s; these acts being [[Foster the People]], [[Imagine Dragons]], [[Fun (band)|fun.]], and [[Gotye]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The chart also began to diverge from the Mainstream Rock chart, as only 10 of 40 songs were shared between the two in November 2012, compared to 23 of 40 in November 2002.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/chartbeat/474293/jangle-all-the-way-new-acts-soften-alternative-airwaves|title=Jangle All The Way: New Acts Soften Alternative Airwaves|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en}}</ref> For the chart's 25th anniversary in 2013, ''Billboard'' published a list of the 100 biggest hits in the history of the Alternative chart. \"[[Uprising (song)|Uprising]]\" by [[Muse (band)|Muse]] was listed at No. 1, having spent 17 weeks on the top of the chart and 53 weeks in total. \"Savior\" by Rise Against was listed at No. 2, peaking at #3 but staying on the chart for a record-breaking 65 weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/5687158/alternative-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs|title=Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref>

{{short description|Billboard chart}}
'''[[Alternative rock|Alternative]] Songs''' (also called '''Alternative''' and formerly known as '''Modern Rock Tracks''' and '''Hot Modern Rock Tracks''') is a [[music chart]] in the United States that has appeared in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] since September 10, 1988.  It lists the 40 most-played songs on [[alternative music|alternative]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations. The chart was introduced as a companion to the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. During the first several years of the chart, it regularly featured music that did not receive commercial radio airplay anywhere but on a few modern rock and college rock radio stations. This included many [[electronica|electronic]] and [[post-punk]] artists. Gradually, as alternative rock became more \"mainstream\" (particularly spearheaded by the [[grunge]] explosion in the early 1990s), the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock Songs charts began featuring more of the same songs. However, the formats would differentiate themselves by the late 2000s. Today, the Alternative Songs chart favors more [[indie rock]], [[indie pop]], and [[synth-pop]] bands while the Mainstream Rock chart favors more [[alternative rock]], [[hard rock]], and [[heavy metal music]].

The chart is based solely on radio airplay. As of 2012, approximately 80 radio stations are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite news|url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BX&s_site=sunherald&p_multi=BX&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10C3552E00587870&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title = The charts|work = [[The Sun Herald]]|date = 2005-08-25|accessdate = 2008-01-18|format = fee required}}</ref> Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's [[Arbitron]] listener data. The chart had 30 positions when it was introduced in September 1988, and was expanded to 40 positions on September 10, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternative Songs: Top Alternative Songs Chart: September 10, 1994|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/alternative-songs/1994-09-10|website=Billboard}}</ref>

The chart was renamed Alternative Songs beginning with the June 20, 2009 issue after ''Billboard'' fully absorbed ''[[Radio & Records]]'', whose similar chart was called \"Alternative\" instead of \"Modern Rock\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/268412/chart-beat-pink-black-eyed-peas-shinedown |title=Chart Beat: Pink, Black Eyed Peas, Shinedown |author=Gary Trust |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>

The first number-one song on the Alternative Songs chart was \"[[Peek-a-Boo (song)|Peek-a-Boo]]\" by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. The current number-one song for the chart dated April 11, 2020, is \"[[Everything I Wanted]]\" by [[Billie Eilish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/search?artistname=Billie+Eilish&chartcode=MRT|title=Billie Eilish, Alternative Songs|work=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/alternative-songs/2020-04-11|title=Alternative Songs: April 11, 2020|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

== History ==
The first Alternative Songs chart appeared in the September 10, 1988 edition of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine, then known as \"Modern Rock Tracks\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5687275/alternative-chart-25th-anniversary-top-50-artists-most-top-10s|title=Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 50 Artists, Most Top 10s, Most No. 1s & More|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> The first song to reach the chart's No. 1 position was Siouxsie and the Banshees' \"Peek-a-Boo\", which topped the charts for two weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popradiotop20.com/Modern-Rock/Siouxsie.htm|title=Siouxsie & The Banshees|website=www.popradiotop20.com|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> In the chart's early years, the chart was closely associated with [[college rock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[post-punk]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]] genres with a large presence of British, Irish and Australian artists, as only 24 of the chart's first 82 number-one hits were by American acts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/article/9214-radio-friendly-unit-shifters-25-years-of-billboards-alternative-music-chart/|title=Radio-Friendly Unit Shifters {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> Bands including [[Depeche Mode]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[The Cure]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[R.E.M.]] were amongst the most popular acts on Alternative radio in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many rock artists do not release commercial [[single (music)|singles]] in the United States. Several popular songs which were not released as commercial singles did not qualify for the Hot 100 before December 1998, but performed very well on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

In 1991, with the release of \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\" by Nirvana (which reached No. 1 on November 23, 1991),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/312336/nirvana/chart?f=377|title=Nirvana – Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> grunge became a new form of alternative rock to chart. However, grunge did not have a dominating presence on the chart in its heyday; over time, grunge would grow into popularity as a representation of alternative rock in the mainstream. Iconic grunge songs fared decently on the Alternative Songs chart but better on the Mainstream Rock Songs.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, \"[[Black (Pearl Jam song)|Black]]\" by [[Pearl Jam]] peaked only at No. 20 on the former but No. 3 on the latter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/328459/pearl-jam/chart?page=2&f=377|title=Pearl Jam – Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/328459/pearl-jam/chart?page=1&f=376|title=Pearl Jam – Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> This was because the college rock and new wave of the 1980s remained the dominant styles of the format, while grunge became an alternative rock style that was popular on the Mainstream Rock format.

In the mid-1990s, alternative rock songs began to crossover to [[Popular music|Pop]] radio, with acts such as [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]] and [[Alanis Morissette]] being played on Pop stations after establishing hits on the Alternative chart.<ref name=\":1\" /> Dominant genres included [[pop punk]] and softer alternative rock, as grunge acts such as [[Soundgarden]] and [[Stone Temple Pilots]] did not reach No. 1, while [[Britpop]], a form of alternative rock from the UK, was represented only by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].<ref name=\":1\" /> By the late 1990s, the Alternative Songs chart was ruled by relatively lighter alternative rock bands such as [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Matchbox Twenty]] and [[Sugar Ray]] and a plethora of one-hit wonders.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://grantland.com/features/haim-days-gone-indie-rock-death-rattle/|title=Indie Rock’s Tuneful Death Rattle|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=2013-10-01|work=Grantland|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en-US}}</ref>

At the turn of the century, alternative radio embraced [[Nu metal|nu-metal]]/[[rap rock]] with bands including [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]] and most famously, [[Linkin Park]]. Chris Molanphy of [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] stated that \"possibly the most loathed period for music of the last half-century, the rap-rock years-- when looked through the prism of the Modern Rock chart’s evolution-- are a logical endpoint to a decade when alt-culture steadily de-wussified itself.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Garage rock from the likes of [[The White Stripes]] and [[The Strokes]] also became hits in the early 2000s as a counter to the over-aggression of rap rock.<ref name=\":1\" />

In the mid-2000s, the Alternative charts were ruled at the top by its most dominant members. From 2003 to 2008, the No. 1 song was by either [[Foo Fighters]], Green Day, [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], Linkin Park or [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] 49% of the time – 152 out of 313 weeks.<ref name=\":1\" /> During this time, classic '90s alternative groups such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Weezer]] enjoyed their biggest success, while [[emo]] ([[Jimmy Eat World]]), indie rock ([[Modest Mouse]]) and pop punk ([[Fall Out Boy]]) also were popular.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 2007, \"[[The Kill]]\" by [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] set a record for the longest-running hit in the history of the US alternative chart when it remained on the national chart for 52 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&id=7430|title=30 Seconds to Mars Breaks Modern Rock Record|date=February 2, 2007|first=Kaj|last=Roth|work=[[Melodic (magazine)|Melodic]]|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref> [[Rise Against]]'s \"[[Savior (Rise Against song)|Savior]]\" later broke the record by spending 65 weeks, followed around the same time by \"[[1901 (song)|1901]]\" from [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]] at 57.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGl78gyjknMC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=savior+rise+against+alternative+songs+record&source=bl&ots=NI8xs7Kyd8&sig=n7rgGhiuTWwVl862ELpF6E795AE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMw9mjybnLAhUW-mMKHWeNAQkQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&q=savior%20rise%20against%20alternative%20songs%20record&f=false|title=Extended Stays|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=October 2, 2010|page=42|volume=122|issue=39|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref> In 2009, ''Billboard'' renamed the chart to \"Alternative Songs\".<ref name=\":0\" />

In the 2010s, the Alternative charts were led by softer [[indie pop]] and [[Folk music|folk]], and crossed over new acts to [[Contemporary hit radio|pop radio]] for the first time since the late '90s; these acts being [[Foster the People]], [[Imagine Dragons]], [[Fun (band)|fun.]], and [[Gotye]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The chart also began to diverge from the Mainstream Rock chart, as only 10 of 40 songs were shared between the two in November 2012, compared to 23 of 40 in November 2002.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/chartbeat/474293/jangle-all-the-way-new-acts-soften-alternative-airwaves|title=Jangle All The Way: New Acts Soften Alternative Airwaves|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en}}</ref> For the chart's 25th anniversary in 2013, ''Billboard'' published a list of the 100 biggest hits in the history of the Alternative chart. \"[[Uprising (song)|Uprising]]\" by [[Muse (band)|Muse]] was listed at No. 1, having spent 17 weeks on the top of the chart and 53 weeks in total. \"Savior\" by Rise Against was listed at No. 2, peaking at #3 but staying on the chart for a record-breaking 65 weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/5687158/alternative-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs|title=Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref>

In 2018, ''Billboard'' released its Greatest of All Time Alternative Songs 30th-anniversary recap. The [[Foo Fighters]] continued its reign as the chart's No. 1 act over the list's first 30 years, after leading the 25th-anniversary recap. [[Muse (band)|Muse]]'s \"[[Uprising (song)|Uprising]]\" retained its standing as the all-time No. 1 song. [[Rise Against]]'s \" [[Savior (Rise Against song)|Savior]]\" again ranked at No. 2, while [[Portugal.

'''WTOP-FM''' (103.5 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) – branded ''WTOP Radio'' and ''WTOP News'' – is a commercial [[All-news radio|all-news]] [[radio station]] licensed to serve [[Washington, D.C.]] Owned by [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WTOP|title=WTOP Facility Record|work=[[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division}}</ref>, the station serves the [[Washington metropolitan area]], extending its reach through two [[Repeater|repeater stations]]: WTLP (103.9 FM) in [[Braddock Heights, Maryland|Braddock Heights]], [[Maryland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WTLP|title=WTLP Facility Record|work=[[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division}}</ref> and WWWT-FM (107.7) in [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], [[Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WWWT|title=WWWT Facility Record|work=[[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division}}</ref> The WTOP-FM studios, referred to on-air as the \"WTOP Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wtop.com/news/2010/08/the-story-of-the-glass-enclosed-nerve-center/|title=The story of the ‘Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center’|last=|first=|date=August 5, 2010|work=WTOP Radio|access-date=January 26, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> are located in the Washington D.C. neighborhood of [[Friendship Heights]], while the station transmitter is located on the [[American University]] campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WTOP |title=FM Query Results for WTOP |website=fcc.gov |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate=2017-03-03}}</ref> Besides a standard [[analog transmission]], WTOP-FM broadcasts over three [[HD Radio]] channels,<ref>http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=8 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002015738/http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=8 |date=2015-10-02 }} HD Radio Guide for Washington D.C.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=W282BA|title=W282BA Facility Record|work=[[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division}}</ref> and is available online.

Historically, the 103.5 FM facility is perhaps best known as [[WGMS (Washington)|WGMS-FM]], which operated with a commercial [[Fine art|fine arts]] and [[classical music]] format from 1948 until 2006. WTOP-FM is considered the successor station to WTOP (1500 AM), now [[WFED]], a station founded in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in 1926 which moved to Washington the following year. WTOP and WTOP-FM have served as Washington's [[CBS News Radio|CBS]] affiliate for all but two years since first joining the network in 1929.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />

[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2007).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo before WWWT 107.7 was added to the \"tri-mulcast\".]]
[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2010).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo after the WWWT signal was added.]]

===1920s: Born in Brooklyn===
WTOP's origins trace back to [[Brooklyn, New York]], as station WTRC (operated by the Twentieth [District] Republican Club), going to air September 25, 1926, on 1250 kilocycles with a power of 50 watts. On August 2, 1927, WTRC migrated to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia]]; a suburb of Washington.

On January 10, 1929, the call sign was changed to WJSV, reflecting the initials of owner James S. Vance, who was publisher of \"The Fellowship Forum\" and a KKK [[Grand Wizard]] in Virginia. Realizing the expense of running a 10,000-watt radio station, Vance quickly worked out a deal with the nascent [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] to become the new network's Washington affiliate, beginning a relationship that would last for almost 90 years. As part of the deal, CBS took over all of WJSV's programming and engineering costs, with an option to renew or purchase the station after five years.

===1930s: CBS O&O===
In June 1932, CBS exercised its option to purchase WJSV outright, and moved its operations to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. After three months off the air, WJSV resumed broadcasting on October 20, 1932. [[Arthur Godfrey]], who later hosted a variety program on CBS Radio and CBS Television, hosted a program on WJSV called ''The Sundial'' on which he honed a laid-back, conversational style that was unusual on radio at the time.

On September 21, 1939, WJSV recorded its entire broadcast day for posterity. The [[WJSV broadcast day]] recordings still exist and copies can be found at archive.org and various [[old time radio]] websites.

WJSV was also a key training ground for pioneering newsman [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]] in the 1930s before he became a network correspondent. (One of his broadcasting mentors was Wells (Ted) Church, who later became a [[CBS News]] executive.) Longtime [[Los Angeles]]-area TV newscaster [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]] worked at WJSV in 1938 and continued to work in radio for seven decades until his death in 2008. [[Frank Blair (anchor)|Frank Blair]], who later became an NBC News correspondent and later was a long time news anchor on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show during the 1960s and early 1970s, worked at WJSV.   [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]], longtime host of [[game show]] \"[[What's My Line?]]\" and 1950's anchor on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV news, also got his start on WJSV.

===1940s===
In 1940, WJSV's operating power was increased to 50,000 watts from a new transmitter site in [[Wheaton, Maryland]]. On March 29, 1941, with the implementation of [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]], WJSV moved its broadcast frequency from 1460 to 1500 [[kHz]].

On March 16, 1943, after paying the [[Tiffin, Ohio]] police department $60,000 for the rights to the call letters WTOP, the calls were changed to the current WTOP because its new frequency was now at the \"top\" of the [[mediumwave]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] band.

CBS sold 55 percent majority control of WTOP to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in February 1949; this deal was made so CBS could acquire full control of [[KCBS (AM)|KQW]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-24-BC.pdf|title=WTOP-KQW: CBS Sells 55% D. C.; Planning TV|date=May 24, 1948|work=Broadcasting|accessdate=December 5, 2019|page=27, 105}}</ref> As part of the transaction, ''The Post'' divested [[WOOK (AM)|WINX (1340 AM)]], but retained WINX-FM through a legal maneuver, which was renamed WTOP-FM.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1949/1949-01-24-BC.pdf|title=WINX AM, FM: FCC Asked to Okay Sale to Banks, 'Post'|date=January 24, 1949|work=Broadcasting|accessdate=December 5, 2019|page=50}}</ref> ''The Post'' took over the remainder of WTOP in December 1954.

===1960s and 70s: All-news===
After its signature personality Arthur Godfrey left WTOP in 1948 to concentrate on his television and midday network radio shows, the station gradually faded in popularity as it faced competition from the Washington Star's [[WSBN|WMAL]] with the morning team of Harden and Weaver, and NBC-owned [[WTEM|WRC]] which featured future [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] personality [[Willard Scott]]. In the 1960s, after a series of failed music formats, WTOP phased out its music programming for a combination of newscasts and phone-in talk shows.

The switch to all-news – at first only during the week – came in March 1969.<ref name=\"pointer\">{{cite web |last1=Pointer |first1=Jack |title=‘You turn us on and we’re there’: Looking back at 50 years of news on WTOP |url=https://wtop.com/local/2019/04/you-turn-us-on-and-were-there-looking-back-at-50-years-of-news-on-wtop |website=WTOP |page=1 April 2019}}</ref> Among those working for WTOP during this time were [[Sam Donaldson]], later on ABC-TV; [[Jim Bohannon]], who took [[Larry King]]'s place on his all-night radio network talk show after King went to CNN; and including Ralph Begleiter and Jamie MacIntyre, both of whom went to CNN.

WTOP studios were apparently a critical link in [[Emergency Broadcast System]] activation scenarios during the Cold War era.<ref>[http://www.ae5d.com/images/EBS2089.jpg NIAC Order No. 1, Dec 1970], Retrieved on 2010-10-22.</ref>

The ''Post'' sold WTOP to [[The Outlet Company]] in June 1978, in reaction to the FCC looking askance at common ownership of newspapers and broadcasting outlets in the same city, believing one company should not have too much control of local media. One month later, WTOP-TV was swapped with the [[Detroit News]]'s [[WDIV|WWJ-TV]], and became WDVM-TV. The station is today [[WUSA-TV]], owned by [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]]. The original FM frequency for WTOP-FM was 96.3&nbsp;MHz, but that frequency was donated to [[Howard University]]. That station became [[WHUR]] in 1971, a commercially run radio station.

===1990s-2020s: Move to FM===
Outlet re-organized and sold WTOP to Chase Broadcasting in 1989, who in turn sold it to Evergreen Media (which eventually became Chancellor Broadcasting) in November 1992. In April 1997, Evergreen's newly acquired 94.3&nbsp;MHz facility in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] began simulcasting the WTOP signal for better coverage in the sprawling [[Northern Virginia]] suburbs. Shortly afterward, on October 10, 1997, [[Bonneville International Corporation]] purchased WTOP.

On April 1, 1998, 94.3 was swapped for a stronger signal at 107.7, also licensed to Warrenton. (The 94.3 facility is now [[K-Love]] station [[WLZV]].) Then in December 2000, WTOP gained another simulcast in [[Frederick, Maryland]] with WXTR at 820 [[kHz]], establishing the \"WTOP Radio Network\", a name it used until 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |title=Washington, D.C. |work=TopHour |date=2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321145315/http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |archivedate=March 21, 2015 }}</ref>

Over its first three decades, WTOP commonly broke the all-news format for sports – including, at various times, the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets/Wizards]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]] – and, in its early years, overnight and weekend talk shows. As listeners increasingly indicated a desire for uninterrupted news, this programming dwindled over the years; WTOP completed the transition to 24/7 news when it dropped the Orioles in 1999.<ref name=\"pointer\" />

In 2005, the station began providing [[podcasts]] of selected broadcast programs, and in 2006, WTOP began broadcasting in digital \"[[HD Radio]]\", utilizing [[iBiquity|iBiquity Digital Corp.'s]] IBOC ([[in-band on-channel]]) technology.

On January 4, 2006, Bonneville International announced that WTOP would move to a new primary frequency of 103.5 FM, then held by classical station [[WGMS (defunct)|WGMS]] (which would move to 103.9 and 104.1 FM). WTOP's longtime facility at 1500 AM, as well as both FM translators (107.7 in Warrenton and low-powered 104.3 in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]]), would be reassigned to the new \"[[WTWP|Washington Post Radio]]\" for a March 30, 2006 launch date. Fittingly, this new partnership also signaled the ''Post'''s return to the radio scene on the very same dial spot WTOP once held.  The station has been dominant in the 25-54 demographics since moving to FM.

The stations' respective call signs were changed as of January 11, 2006: the former WTOP pair became WTWP (The Washington Post) and WTOP's new primary stations assumed the WTOP calls. [[HD Radio]] [[digital subchannel]]s of the 103.5 carrier originally had broadcast Bonneville International's \"iChannel\" music format, which features unsigned, independent rock bands on the HD2 channel, and the HD3 channel aired continuous traffic and weather updates.  Later iChannel was dropped for an [[Local marketing agreement|LMA]] of the HD2 to a group that currently airs programming aimed at the South Asian community in the Washington area. Sometime in or before June 2013, that LMA was replaced with [[Voice of Russia|the predecessor]] to what is now [[Radio Sputnik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_06_13/VoR-6th-Video-Conference-The-PRISM-of-Snooping-2417/?slide-1 |title=VoR 6th Video Conference The PRISM of Snooping |date=June 13, 2013 |website=sputniknews.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}} See caption under top photo for relevant information.</ref> As of July 1, 2017, WTOP-HD2 began broadcasting the feed from [[WFED]] (1500 AM),<ref name=\"dcrtv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcrtv.com/index.html |title=Radio Sputnik Off WTOP - 6/29 |date=June 29, 2017 |website=www.dcrtv.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref> after Radio Sputnik moved its Washington DC-area broadcasting to conventional (non-digital) frequency 105.5&nbsp;MHz. Currently, WTOP-FM's HD3 channel is carrying a wide-ranging pop music channel called [[WWFD|\"The Gamut\"]].

In 2006, WTOP dropped its long-standing association with [[The Weather Channel]] and began airing weather reports exclusively from [[WJLA-TV]] all day long. Previously, WTOP had used weather reports from WJLA chief meteorologist [[Doug Hill (meteorologist)|Doug Hill]] during morning and evening rush hours and The Weather Channel all other times.  Until 2015, the station used all WJLA meteorologists, not just Doug Hill. WJLA's \"Live Super Doppler 7\" has been featured in weather reports as necessary. In 2015, WTOP began airing weather reports and using meteorologists exclusively from [[WRC-TV]] all day long.

In 2007, the WTOP radio configuration was realigned once again. WTLP-FM (formerly WGYS) at 103.9 picked up the WTOP simulcast on April 6, 2007 after the adult hits \"George 104\" simulcast with WXGG (now [[WPRS-FM]], since sold to Radio One) was broken up, and adopted the WTLP calls on July 5, 2007.

Also in 2007, WTOP began broadcasting on WJLA's \"Weather Now\" digital sub-channel, which is carried on cable systems well beyond WTOP's broadcast area, though this was ended in late July 2009.

In May 2007, WTOP sold the naming rights to its \"Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center\" (its nickname for its studio) to area business [[Ledo Pizza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcrtv.org/ledo.mp3 |title=DCRTV.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>  That sponsorship concluded at the end of 2007.  Other sponsorship continues, with sportscasts being \"fed\" by Ledo Pizza.

WTOP AM (which was now on 820 in Frederick) changed its calls to WTWT and switched to the ''Washington Post Radio'' simulcast on June 28, 2007. On September 20, 2007, the 1500/107.7/820 multicast changed format over to a general talk format as \"Talk Radio 3WT\" under the WWWT/WWWT-FM/WWWB call letters, which was cancelled on August 11, 2008. WWWT and WWWB took over the \"Federal News Radio\" format (and for the 1500&nbsp;kHz facility, the [[WFED]] calls),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3wtradio.com/?sid=1457419&nid=24|title=Federal News Radio Expands to Full Market Signal (3wtradio.com)|author=|date=|website=3wtradio.com}}</ref> while WWWT-FM went back to simulcasting WTOP-FM. The former WFED took over the WTOP callsign on the AM dial and became a simulcast of WTOP, with preemptions for sporting events. On June 13, 2009, the 1050 AM frequency changed to a separate [[Talk radio|news/talk]] format, operated by [[Air America Radio]] as [[WBQH|WZAA]]. On January 26, 2010, following the shutdown of Air America Radio, WZAA returned to the WTOP simulcast. It took back the WTOP call letters on February 1, 2010.  WTOP AM left the simulcast on June 23, 2010, as Bonneville leased the station to [[United Media Group]].  United Media changed the call letters to [[WBQH]] and flipped to [[Regional Mexican]].

In March 2008, WTOP-FM completed a year-long, $2.5-million state-of-the-art renovation of its newsroom and studios, the first since 1989 when the station moved into the building it presently occupies in northwest Washington.

In 2008, WTOP-FM generated $51.75-million in revenue, the sixth-highest total for any radio station in the United States and the only station not based in New York City or Los Angeles to crack the top ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvbroadcasting.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=16852&p=149992 |title=WVbroadcasting.net |publisher=WVbroadcasting.net |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2009, the station generated $51-million in revenue, good for second among all radio stations in the United States, trailing only [[KIIS-FM]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/03/15/daily49.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= March 17, 2010|accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref> In 2010, WTOP generated $57.225-million in revenue, making it tops among radio station in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.kelseygroup.com/index.php/2011/03/28/wtop-am-takes-over-the-top-billing-station/ |title=BIA/Kelsey |publisher=Blog.kelseygroup.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2011 WTOP once again generated more revenue than any other station in the United States, this time with $64 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/04/12/wtop-remains-nations-top-biller.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= April 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-13 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref>

In 2010, WTOP-FM's coverage of the record Washington-area snowfalls in early February earned it record ratings as the only local media outlet on the air and covering the storm live all day and night. During the week of the storms, which dropped two feet of snow in the area, WTOP had a 16.9% share of the area's radio audience, far exceeding its typical weekly average of around 10%. Consumer research company [[Arbitron]] estimated a total of 1.49 million people tuned in at some point during the week, 39% of the total local radio audience of 3.8 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/02/AR2010030201854.html |title=WTOP (103.5 FM) tops ratings with coverage of Washington's Feb. snowstorms |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Paul |last=Farhi}}</ref>

Bonneville announced the sale of WTOP-FM, WTLP, and WWWT-FM, as well as 14 other stations, to [[Hubbard Broadcasting]] on January 19, 2011.<ref name=wp-saletohubbard>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/19/AR2011011907031.html |title=WTOP news radio to be sold to Minnesota broadcaster |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= January 20, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Paul |last=Farhi}}</ref><ref name=ri-hubbardtakeover>{{cite news|title=Hubbard deal to purchase Bonneville stations closes|url=http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2174844&spid=24698|accessdate=May 2, 2011|newspaper=[[Radio Ink]]|date=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055419/http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2174844&spid=24698|archive-date=March 12, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2011, WTOP-FM brought their [[traffic reporting]] in-house, ending their relationship with [[Metro Networks]]. This meant that Lisa Baden, the longtime \"voice of D.C.-area traffic\" and a Metro Networks employee, was forced to leave the station in what WTOP's Vice President of News and Programming Jim Farley said was strictly a business decision. Farley said WTOP tried to bring Baden and other Metro Networks employees to WTOP, but they have clauses in their contracts prohibiting them from working for competitors for one year. Baden said she was \"devastated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/local/dc/2011/01/voice-dc-area-traffic-reluctantly-leaves-wtop |title=Voice of D.C.-area traffic reluctantly leaves WTOP |publisher=Washingtonexaminer.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>  Shortly after that, Baden joined rival radio station [[WMAL-FM|WMAL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/92330/traffic-reporter-lisa-baden-joins-wmal-washington|title=Traffic Reporter Lisa Baden Joins WMAL/Washington|date=2015-06-11|accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref>

On January 1, 2018, WTOP-FM switched from [[CBS Radio News|CBS]] to [[ABC News Radio|ABC]] for its top-of-the-hour newscasts, ending a relationship with CBS that, as noted above, dated to the late 1920s.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite tweet |user=farhip |author=Paul Farhi |number=947861754725445632 |date=January 1, 2018 |title=A little bit of local media news: All-news station WTOP has ended its affiliation with CBS radio after many decades and has switched its top-of-the-hour newscasts to ABC broadcasts. }}</ref> WTOP-FM rejoined CBS exactly two years later.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news |last1=Venta |first1=Lance |title=CBS News Radio Returns To WTOP Washington |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/182833/cbs-news-radio-returns-to-wtop-washington/ |work=RadioInsight |date=1 January 2020}}</ref>

Historically, the 103.5 FM facility is perhaps best known as [[WGMS (Washington)|WGMS-FM]], which operated with a commercial [[Fine art|fine arts]] and [[classical music]] format from 1948 until 2006. WTOP-FM is considered the successor station to WTOP (1500 AM), now [[WFED]], a station founded in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in 1926 which moved to Washington the following year. WTOP and WTOP-FM have served as Washington's [[CBS News Radio|CBS]] affiliate for all but two years since first joining the network in 1929.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />

== History ==
[[File:Logo of WTOP-FM (2000).png|thumb|upright|WTOP's logo in 2000.]]
[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2007).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo before WWWT 107.7 was added to the \"tri-mulcast\".]]
[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2010).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo after the WWWT signal was added.]]

===1920s: Born in Brooklyn===
WTOP's origins trace back to [[Brooklyn, New York]], as station WTRC (operated by the Twentieth [District] Republican Club), going to air September 25, 1926, on 1250 kilocycles with a power of 50 watts. On August 2, 1927, WTRC migrated to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia]]; a suburb of Washington.

On January 10, 1929, the call sign was changed to WJSV, reflecting the initials of owner James S. Vance, who was publisher of \"The Fellowship Forum\" and a KKK [[Grand Wizard]] in Virginia. Realizing the expense of running a 10,000-watt radio station, Vance quickly worked out a deal with the nascent [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] to become the new network's Washington affiliate, beginning a relationship that would last for almost 90 years. As part of the deal, CBS took over all of WJSV's programming and engineering costs, with an option to renew or purchase the station after five years.

===1930s: CBS O&O===
In June 1932, CBS exercised its option to purchase WJSV outright, and moved its operations to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. After three months off the air, WJSV resumed broadcasting on October 20, 1932. [[Arthur Godfrey]], who later hosted a variety program on CBS Radio and CBS Television, hosted a program on WJSV called ''The Sundial'' on which he honed a laid-back, conversational style that was unusual on radio at the time.

On September 21, 1939, WJSV recorded its entire broadcast day for posterity. The [[WJSV broadcast day]] recordings still exist and copies can be found at archive.org and various [[old time radio]] websites.

WJSV was also a key training ground for pioneering newsman [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]] in the 1930s before he became a network correspondent. (One of his broadcasting mentors was Wells (Ted) Church, who later became a [[CBS News]] executive.) Longtime [[Los Angeles]]-area TV newscaster [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]] worked at WJSV in 1938 and continued to work in radio for seven decades until his death in 2008. [[Frank Blair (anchor)|Frank Blair]], who later became an NBC News correspondent and later was a long time news anchor on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show during the 1960s and early 1970s, worked at WJSV.   [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]], longtime host of [[game show]] \"[[What's My Line?]]\" and 1950's anchor on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV news, also got his start on WJSV.

===1940s===
In 1940, WJSV's operating power was increased to 50,000 watts from a new transmitter site in [[Wheaton, Maryland]]. On March 29, 1941, with the implementation of [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]], WJSV moved its broadcast frequency from 1460 to 1500 [[kHz]].

On March 16, 1943, after paying the [[Tiffin, Ohio]] police department $60,000 for the rights to the call letters WTOP, the calls were changed to the current WTOP because its new frequency was now at the \"top\" of the [[mediumwave]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] band.

CBS sold 55 percent majority control of WTOP to the ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in February 1949; this deal was made so CBS could acquire full control of [[KCBS (AM)|KQW]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-24-BC.pdf|title=WTOP-KQW: CBS Sells 55% D. C.; Planning TV|date=May 24, 1948|work=Broadcasting|accessdate=December 5, 2019|page=27, 105}}</ref> As part of the transaction, ''The Post'' divested [[WOOK (AM)|WINX (1340 AM)]], but retained WINX-FM through a legal maneuver, which was renamed WTOP-FM.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1949/1949-01-24-BC.pdf|title=WINX AM, FM: FCC Asked to Okay Sale to Banks, 'Post'|date=January 24, 1949|work=Broadcasting|accessdate=December 5, 2019|page=50}}</ref> ''The Post'' took over the remainder of WTOP in December 1954.

===1960s and 70s: All-news===
After its signature personality Arthur Godfrey left WTOP in 1948 to concentrate on his television and midday network radio shows, the station gradually faded in popularity as it faced competition from the Washington Star's [[WSBN|WMAL]] with the morning team of Harden and Weaver, and NBC-owned [[WTEM|WRC]] which featured future [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] personality [[Willard Scott]]. In the 1960s, after a series of failed music formats, WTOP phased out its music programming for a combination of newscasts and phone-in talk shows.

The switch to all-news – at first only during the week – came in March 1969.<ref name=\"pointer\">{{cite web |last1=Pointer |first1=Jack |title=‘You turn us on and we’re there’: Looking back at 50 years of news on WTOP |url=https://wtop.com/local/2019/04/you-turn-us-on-and-were-there-looking-back-at-50-years-of-news-on-wtop |website=WTOP |page=1 April 2019}}</ref> Among those working for WTOP during this time were [[Sam Donaldson]], later on ABC-TV; [[Jim Bohannon]], who took [[Larry King]]'s place on his all-night radio network talk show after King went to CNN; and including Ralph Begleiter and Jamie MacIntyre, both of whom went to CNN.

WTOP studios were apparently a critical link in [[Emergency Broadcast System]] activation scenarios during the Cold War era.<ref>[http://www.ae5d.com/images/EBS2089.jpg NIAC Order No. 1, Dec 1970], Retrieved on 2010-10-22.</ref>

The ''Post'' sold WTOP to [[The Outlet Company]] in June 1978, in reaction to the FCC looking askance at common ownership of newspapers and broadcasting outlets in the same city, believing one company should not have too much control of local media. One month later, WTOP-TV was swapped with the [[Detroit News]]'s [[WDIV|WWJ-TV]], and became WDVM-TV. The station is today [[WUSA-TV]], owned by [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]]. The original FM frequency for WTOP-FM was 96.3&nbsp;MHz, but that frequency was donated to [[Howard University]]. That station became [[WHUR]] in 1971, a commercially run radio station.

===1990s-2020s: Move to FM===
Outlet re-organized and sold WTOP to Chase Broadcasting in 1989, who in turn sold it to Evergreen Media (which eventually became Chancellor Broadcasting) in November 1992. In April 1997, Evergreen's newly acquired 94.3&nbsp;MHz facility in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] began simulcasting the WTOP signal for better coverage in the sprawling [[Northern Virginia]] suburbs. Shortly afterward, on October 10, 1997, [[Bonneville International Corporation]] purchased WTOP.

On April 1, 1998, 94.3 was swapped for a stronger signal at 107.7, also licensed to Warrenton. (The 94.3 facility is now [[K-Love]] station [[WLZV]].) Then in December 2000, WTOP gained another simulcast in [[Frederick, Maryland]] with WXTR at 820 [[kHz]], establishing the \"WTOP Radio Network\", a name it used until 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |title=Washington, D.C. |work=TopHour |date=2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321145315/http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |archivedate=March 21, 2015 }}</ref>

Over its first three decades, WTOP commonly broke the all-news format for sports – including, at various times, the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets/Wizards]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]] – and, in its early years, overnight and weekend talk shows. As listeners increasingly indicated a desire for uninterrupted news, this programming dwindled over the years; WTOP completed the transition to 24/7 news when it dropped the Orioles in 1999.<ref name=\"pointer\" />

In 2005, the station began providing [[podcasts]] of selected broadcast programs, and in 2006, WTOP began broadcasting in digital \"[[HD Radio]]\", utilizing [[iBiquity|iBiquity Digital Corp.'s]] IBOC ([[in-band on-channel]]) technology.

On January 4, 2006, Bonneville International announced that WTOP would move to a new primary frequency of 103.5 FM, then held by classical station [[WGMS (defunct)|WGMS]] (which would move to 103.9 and 104.1 FM). WTOP's longtime facility at 1500 AM, as well as both FM translators (107.7 in Warrenton and low-powered 104.3 in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]]), would be reassigned to the new \"[[WTWP|Washington Post Radio]]\" for a March 30, 2006 launch date. Fittingly, this new partnership also signaled the ''Post'''s return to the radio scene on the very same dial spot WTOP once held.  The station has been dominant in the 25-54 demographics since moving to FM.

The stations' respective call signs were changed as of January 11, 2006: the former WTOP pair became WTWP (The Washington Post) and WTOP's new primary stations assumed the WTOP calls. [[HD Radio]] [[digital subchannel]]s of the 103.5 carrier originally had broadcast Bonneville International's \"iChannel\" music format, which features unsigned, independent rock bands on the HD2 channel, and the HD3 channel aired continuous traffic and weather updates.  Later iChannel was dropped for an [[Local marketing agreement|LMA]] of the HD2 to a group that currently airs programming aimed at the South Asian community in the Washington area. Sometime in or before June 2013, that LMA was replaced with [[Voice of Russia|the predecessor]] to what is now [[Radio Sputnik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_06_13/VoR-6th-Video-Conference-The-PRISM-of-Snooping-2417/?slide-1 |title=VoR 6th Video Conference The PRISM of Snooping |date=June 13, 2013 |website=sputniknews.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}} See caption under top photo for relevant information.</ref> As of July 1, 2017, WTOP-HD2 began broadcasting the feed from [[WFED]] (1500 AM),<ref name=\"dcrtv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcrtv.com/index.html |title=Radio Sputnik Off WTOP - 6/29 |date=June 29, 2017 |website=www.dcrtv.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref> after Radio Sputnik moved its Washington DC-area broadcasting to conventional (non-digital) frequency 105.5&nbsp;MHz. Currently, WTOP-FM's HD3 channel is carrying a wide-ranging pop music channel called [[WWFD|\"The Gamut\"]].

In 2006, WTOP dropped its long-standing association with [[The Weather Channel]] and began airing weather reports exclusively from [[WJLA-TV]] all day long. Previously, WTOP had used weather reports from WJLA chief meteorologist [[Doug Hill (meteorologist)|Doug Hill]] during morning and evening rush hours and The Weather Channel all other times.  Until 2015, the station used all WJLA meteorologists, not just Doug Hill. WJLA's \"Live Super Doppler 7\" has been featured in weather reports as necessary. In 2015, WTOP began airing weather reports and using meteorologists exclusively from [[WRC-TV]] all day long.

In 2007, the WTOP radio configuration was realigned once again. WTLP-FM (formerly WGYS) at 103.9 picked up the WTOP simulcast on April 6, 2007 after the adult hits \"George 104\" simulcast with WXGG (now [[WPRS-FM]], since sold to Radio One) was broken up, and adopted the WTLP calls on July 5, 2007.

Also in 2007, WTOP began broadcasting on WJLA's \"Weather Now\" digital sub-channel, which is carried on cable systems well beyond WTOP's broadcast area, though this was ended in late July 2009.

In May 2007, WTOP sold the naming rights to its \"Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center\" (its nickname for its studio) to area business [[Ledo Pizza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcrtv.org/ledo.mp3 |title=DCRTV.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>  That sponsorship concluded at the end of 2007.  Other sponsorship continues, with sportscasts being \"fed\" by Ledo Pizza.

WTOP AM (which was now on 820 in Frederick) changed its calls to WTWT and switched to the ''Washington Post Radio'' simulcast on June 28, 2007. On September 20, 2007, the 1500/107.7/820 multicast changed format over to a general talk format as \"Talk Radio 3WT\" under the WWWT/WWWT-FM/WWWB call letters, which was cancelled on August 11, 2008. WWWT and WWWB took over the \"Federal News Radio\" format (and for the 1500&nbsp;kHz facility, the [[WFED]] calls),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3wtradio.com/?sid=1457419&nid=24|title=Federal News Radio Expands to Full Market Signal (3wtradio.com)|author=|date=|website=3wtradio.com}}</ref> while WWWT-FM went back to simulcasting WTOP-FM. The former WFED took over the WTOP callsign on the AM dial and became a simulcast of WTOP, with preemptions for sporting events. On June 13, 2009, the 1050 AM frequency changed to a separate [[Talk radio|news/talk]] format, operated by [[Air America Radio]] as [[WBQH|WZAA]]. On January 26, 2010, following the shutdown of Air America Radio, WZAA returned to the WTOP simulcast. It took back the WTOP call letters on February 1, 2010.  WTOP AM left the simulcast on June 23, 2010, as Bonneville leased the station to [[United Media Group]].  United Media changed the call letters to [[WBQH]] and flipped to [[Regional Mexican]].

In March 2008, WTOP-FM completed a year-long, $2.5-million state-of-the-art renovation of its newsroom and studios, the first since 1989 when the station moved into the building it presently occupies in northwest Washington.

In 2008, WTOP-FM generated $51.75-million in revenue, the sixth-highest total for any radio station in the United States and the only station not based in New York City or Los Angeles to crack the top ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvbroadcasting.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=16852&p=149992 |title=WVbroadcasting.net |publisher=WVbroadcasting.net |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2009, the station generated $51-million in revenue, good for second among all radio stations in the United States, trailing only [[KIIS-FM]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/03/15/daily49.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= March 17, 2010|accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref> In 2010, WTOP generated $57.225-million in revenue, making it tops among radio station in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.kelseygroup.com/index.php/2011/03/28/wtop-am-takes-over-the-top-billing-station/ |title=BIA/Kelsey |publisher=Blog.kelseygroup.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2011 WTOP once again generated more revenue than any other station in the United States, this time with $64 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/04/12/wtop-remains-nations-top-biller.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= April 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-13 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref>

In 2010, WTOP-FM's coverage of the record Washington-area snowfalls in early February earned it record ratings as the only local media outlet on the air and covering the storm live all day and night. During the week of the storms, which dropped two feet of snow in the area, WTOP had a 16.9% share of the area's radio audience, far exceeding its typical weekly average of around 10%. Consumer research company [[Arbitron]] estimated a total of 1.49 million people tuned in at some point during the week, 39% of the total local radio audience of 3.8 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/02/AR2010030201854.html |title=WTOP (103.5 FM) tops ratings with coverage of Washington's Feb. snowstorms |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Paul |last=Farhi}}</ref>

In 2011, WTOP-FM brought their [[traffic reporting]] in-house, ending their relationship with [[Metro Networks]]. This meant that Lisa Baden, the longtime \"voice of D.C.-area traffic\" and a Metro Networks employee, was forced to leave the station in what WTOP's Vice President of News and Programming Jim Farley said was strictly a business decision. Farley said WTOP tried to bring Baden and other Metro Networks employees to WTOP, but they have clauses in their contracts prohibiting them from working for competitors for one year. Baden said she was \"devastated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/local/dc/2011/01/voice-dc-area-traffic-reluctantly-leaves-wtop |title=Voice of D.C.-area traffic reluctantly leaves WTOP |publisher=Washingtonexaminer.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>  Shortly after that, Baden joined rival radio station [[WMAL-FM|WMAL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/92330/traffic-reporter-lisa-baden-joins-wmal-washington|title=Traffic Reporter Lisa Baden Joins WMAL/Washington|date=2015-06-11|accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref>

On January 1, 2018, WTOP-FM switched from [[CBS Radio News|CBS]] to [[ABC News Radio|ABC]] for its top-of-the-hour newscasts, ending a relationship with CBS that, as noted above, dated to the late 1920s.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite tweet |user=farhip |author=Paul Farhi |number=947861754725445632 |date=January 1, 2018 |title=A little bit of local media news: All-news station WTOP has ended its affiliation with CBS radio after many decades and has switched its top-of-the-hour newscasts to ABC broadcasts. }}</ref> WTOP-FM rejoined CBS exactly two years later.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news |last1=Venta |first1=Lance |title=CBS News Radio Returns To WTOP Washington |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/182833/cbs-news-radio-returns-to-wtop-washington/ |work=RadioInsight |date=1 January 2020}}</ref>

'''Fanny Mendelssohn''' (14 November 1805 – 14 May 1847),<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> later '''Fanny [Cäcilie] Mendelssohn Bartholdy''' and, after her marriage, '''Fanny Hensel''', was a German composer and pianist from the [[Romantic era]]. She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.

She composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  

The [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.

She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny Cäcilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref> Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy' with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of  \"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66</ref>

While growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> 

After studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>

=== Gender and class limitations ===
In the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forney et al. (2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:
<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>

The music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27–28</ref> 

The biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>

===Felix and Fanny===
[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>

In 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168–71</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>

There was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299–301</ref>

=== Marriage and later life===
[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />

In 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> 

Wilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839–40. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95–6</ref> 

[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325–326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />

===Death===
Throughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> 

On 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348–349</ref>

== Compositions ==
{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}
[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] 
Fanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2–3</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied für Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829–30, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833–34. Fanny's sets of ''Lieder für Klavier'' were written in the period 1836–1837, at about the same time as Felix's set Op. 38.<ref name=Mace118>Mace (2013) p. 118</ref><ref>Song (2016), pp. 5–7</ref>

[[File:IMSLP99178-PMLP194743-Hensel Fanny Sechs Lieder fuer eine Stimme mit Begleitung des Pianoforte Op 1 Bote 1046 1846 p 1pdf.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Title page of first edition of Fanny Hensel's Op. 1, 1846]]The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn's compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93–4</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542–544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>

She also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Style and form ===
[[File:Julius Eduard Wilhelm Helfft - The Music Room of Fanny Hensel (nee Mendelssohn) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Hensel's music room in the Hensel house, Leipziger Str. 3, Berlin]] Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> 

R. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>

Musicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>

==Legacy==
===Museum===
The Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>

===Music===
In the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & Härtel]]. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Fanny Mendelssohn's unreleased works, starting with ''Vier Lieder'' Op. 8.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 351</ref>

In recent{{when|date=April 2020}} years, Fanny Mendelssohn's music has become better known thanks to concert performances and a number of CDs being released on labels such as [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]] and [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|CPO]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} Her ''Easter Sonata'' for piano, formerly attributed to Felix, was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>

===Writings===
Fanny Mendelssohn published no writings during her lifetime. Selected letters and journal entries were published during the nineteenth century, notably by Sebastian Hensel in his book on the Mendelssohn family. Her collected letters to Felix, edited by Marcia Citron, were published in 1987.<ref name=Grove /><ref>Hensel (1884)</ref><ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987</ref>

===Biographical and musicological studies===
During the 19th century Fanny mainly figured as a bystander in biographes and studies of her brother Felix; typically she was a representative of a supposed 'feminizing' influence that sapped his artistry.<ref>Kimber (2004), pp. 48-49</ref> In the 20th century the conventional narrative switched to presenting Felix as disapproving of his sister's musical activities and seeking to contain them, whilst the 'feminizing' accusation against Fanny evaporated.<ref>Kimber (2004), pp. 49-50</ref> From the 1980s onwards Fanny Hensel Mendelssohn has been the subject of many academic books and articles.<ref>See bibliography in Mace Christian (2018)</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Stokes|2019}}</ref> Kimber opines that \"The tale of Fanny, the \"supressed\" composer, has so readily found as place in the biographies of the siblings because of its resemblance to prevailing models  for the life of a 'Great Composer' [...] based in Romantic ideology about male artists [...] Hensel fits neatly into a traditonal narrative of the suffering artistic genius[...] with a modern twist: the feminine gender of its main character. Thus two characters [Felix and Fanny] are forced to bear the weight of two centuries of gender ideology.\"<ref>Kimber (2004), p. 52</ref>

'''Fanny Mendelssohn''' (14 November 1805 – 14 May 1847),<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> later '''Fanny [Cäcilie] Mendelssohn Bartholdy''' and, after her marriage, '''Fanny Hensel''', was a German composer and pianist from the [[Romantic era]]. She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.

She composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  

The [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.

==Life==
=== Early life and education ===
[[File:Fannymendelssohn-improved.jpg|thumb|upright|Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched in 1829 by her future husband [[Wilhelm Hensel]]]]Mendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, née Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3–5</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]]. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny Cäcilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref> Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy' with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of  \"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66</ref>

While growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> 

After studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>

=== Gender and class limitations ===
In the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forney et al. (2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:
<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>

The music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27–28</ref> 

The biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>

===Felix and Fanny===
[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>

In 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168–71</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>

There was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299–301</ref>

=== Marriage and later life===
[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />

In 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> 

Wilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839–40. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95–6</ref> 

[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325–326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />

===Death===
Throughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> 

On 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348–349</ref>

== Compositions ==
{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}
[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] 
Fanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2–3</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied für Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829–30, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833–34. Fanny's sets of ''Lieder für Klavier'' were written in the period 1836–1837, at about the same time as Felix's set Op. 38.<ref name=Mace118>Mace (2013) p. 118</ref><ref>Song (2016), pp. 5–7</ref>

[[File:IMSLP99178-PMLP194743-Hensel Fanny Sechs Lieder fuer eine Stimme mit Begleitung des Pianoforte Op 1 Bote 1046 1846 p 1pdf.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Title page of first edition of Fanny Hensel's Op. 1, 1846]]The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn's compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93–4</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542–544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>

She also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Style and form ===
[[File:Julius Eduard Wilhelm Helfft - The Music Room of Fanny Hensel (nee Mendelssohn) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Hensel's music room in the Hensel house, Leipziger Str. 3, Berlin]] Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> 

R. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>

Musicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>

==Legacy==
===Museum===
The Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>

===Music===
In the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & Härtel]]. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Fanny Mendelssohn's unreleased works, starting with ''Vier Lieder'' Op. 8.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 351</ref>

In recent{{when|date=April 2020}} years, Fanny Mendelssohn's music has become better known thanks to concert performances and a number of CDs being released on labels such as [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]] and [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|CPO]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} Her ''Easter Sonata'' for piano, formerly attributed to Felix, was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>

===Writings===
Fanny Mendelssohn published no writings during her lifetime. Selected letters and journal entries were published during the nineteenth century, notably by Sebastian Hensel in his book on the Mendelssohn family. Her collected letters to Felix, edited by Marcia Citron, were published in 1987.<ref name=Grove /><ref>Hensel (1884)</ref><ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987</ref>

===Biographical and musicological studies===
During the 19th century Fanny mainly figured as a bystander in biographes and studies of her brother Felix; typically she was a representative of a supposed 'feminizing' influence that sapped his artistry.<ref>Kimber (2004), pp. 48-49</ref> In the 20th century the conventional narrative switched to presenting Felix as disapproving of his sister's musical activities and seeking to contain them, whilst the 'feminizing' accusation against Fanny evaporated.<ref>Kimber (2004), pp. 49-50</ref> From the 1980s onwards Fanny Hensel Mendelssohn has been the subject of many academic books and articles.<ref>See bibliography in Mace Christian (2018)</ref><ref>Stokes (2019)</ref> Kimber opines that \"The tale of Fanny, the \"supressed\" composer, has so readily found as place in the biographies of the siblings because of its resemblance to prevailing models  for the life of a 'Great Composer' [...] based in Romantic ideology about male artists [...] Hensel fits neatly into a traditonal narrative of the suffering artistic genius[...] with a modern twist: the feminine gender of its main character. Thus two characters [Felix and Fanny] are forced to bear the weight of two centuries of gender ideology.\"<ref>Kimber (2004), p. 52</ref>
