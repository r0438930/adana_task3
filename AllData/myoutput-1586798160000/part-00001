Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].\n\nAnother subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:\n\n* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves\n* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.\n\n[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.\n\n===Oceanic islands===\n{{Main article|High island}}\n\nOceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.) (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oceanic%20island&f=false ''Foundations of Biogeography: Classic Papers with Commentaries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233729/https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |date=April 18, 2016 }}. University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.\n\nOne type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nAnother type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.\n\nA third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.\n\nAn [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n===Tropical islands===\n{{See also|Coral reef#Formation}}\n\n[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|thumb|right| Plane landing on an airport island, [[Velana International Airport]], [[Hulhul\u00e9 Island]], [[Maldives]]]]\n\nApproximately 45,000 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands with an [[area]] of at least {{convert|5|ha}} exist.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite book\n|doi=10.1553/3-7001-2738-3\n|title=The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\n|author=Austrian Academy of Sciences\n|author-link=Austrian Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Examples [[Coral reef#Formation|formed from coral reefs]] include [[Maldives]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Nauru]], and [[Polynesia]].<ref name=\"TI\"/> [[Granite]] islands include [[Seychelles]] and [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] islands such as [[Saint Helena]].\n\nThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the [[Stone Age]] societies in the interior of [[North Sentinel]], [[Madagascar]], [[Borneo]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans|last = Arnberger|first = Hertha, Erik|publisher = Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-3-7001-2738-3|location = Vienna|pages = }}</ref>\n\nInternational [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[R\u00e9union]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].\n\n==Artificial islands==\n{{Main article|Artificial island}}\n\nAlmost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions.

Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].\n\nAnother subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:\n\n* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves\n* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.\n\n[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.\n\n===Oceanic islands===\n{{Main article|High island}}\n\nOceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.)

University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.\n\nOne type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nAnother type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.\n\nA third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.\n\nAn [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n===Tropical islands===\n{{See also|Coral reef#Formation}}\n\n[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|thumb|right| Plane landing on an airport island, [[Velana International Airport]], [[Hulhul\u00e9 Island]], [[Maldives]]]]\n\nApproximately 45,000 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands with an [[area]] of at least {{convert|5|ha}} exist.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite book\n|doi=10.1553/3-7001-2738-3\n|title=The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\n|author=Austrian Academy of Sciences\n|author-link=Austrian Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Examples [[Coral reef#Formation|formed from coral reefs]] include [[Maldives]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Nauru]], and [[Polynesia]].<ref name=\"TI\"/> [[Granite]] islands include [[Seychelles]] and [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] islands such as [[Saint Helena]].\n\nThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the [[Stone Age]] societies in the interior of [[North Sentinel]], [[Madagascar]], [[Borneo]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans|last = Arnberger|first = Hertha, Erik|publisher = Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-3-7001-2738-3|location = Vienna|pages = }}</ref>\n\nInternational [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[R\u00e9union]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].\n\n==Artificial islands==\n{{Main article|Artificial island}}\n\nAlmost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions. However, artificial (man-made) islands also exist, such as the island in [[Osaka Bay]] off the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Honshu]], on which [[Kansai International Airport]] is located. Artificial islands can be built using natural materials (e.g., earth, rock, or sand) or artificial ones (e.g., [[concrete]] slabs or recycled [[waste]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|title=Building Artificial Islands That Rise With the Sea|access-date=2016-06-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152821/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amti.csis.org/what-makes-an-island-land-reclamation-and-the-south-china-sea-arbitration/|title=What Makes an Island?
