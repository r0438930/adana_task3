The modernized Su-35 is sometimes referred to as \"Super Flanker\".<ref name=Super_Flanker/>|group=\"N\"}}--> is the designation for two improved derivatives of the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] air-defence fighter. They are single-seat, [[twinjet|twin-engine]], [[Supermaneuverability|supermaneuverable]] aircraft, designed by the [[Sukhoi Design Bureau]] and built by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant]].\n\nThe type was originally developed by the [[Soviet Union]] from the Su-27 and was known as the '''Su-27M'''. It incorporated canards and a multi-function radar giving it multi-role capabilities. The first prototype made its [[maiden flight]] in June 1988. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] Sukhoi re-designated it as the Su-35 to attract export orders. Fourteen aircraft were produced and used for tests and demonstrations; one example had [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]] engines and was in turn redesignated the [[Sukhoi Su-37|Su-37]]. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that resembled the Su-30MK family.\n\nIn 2003, Sukhoi embarked on a second modernization of the Su-27 to serve as an interim aircraft awaiting the development of the [[Sukhoi PAK FA]] (Su-57) program. Also known as the Su-35, this version has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although it was designed for export, the [[Russian Air Force]] became the launch customer in 2009, with the production version designated Su-35S. China's [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] and the [[Indonesian Air Force]] have also placed orders.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Upgraded Su-27{{anchor|Su-27M/Su-35}}===\nThe first aircraft design to receive the Su-35 designation had its origins in the early 1980s, at a time when the Su-27 was being introduced into service with the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]. The definitive production version of the Su-27, which had the factory code of T-10S, started mass (\"serial\") production with the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] (KnAAPO) in 1983. The following year, this Su-27 version reached initial operational readiness with the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]].<ref name=JIR>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski|first=Piotr|date=1 November 1999|title=Dominance by design: the reign of Russia's 'Flankers' \u2013 PART ONE|journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]|location=Coulsdon, UK|publisher=Jane's Information Group|volume=11|issue=11|issn=1350-6226}}</ref> Having begun work on an upgraded Su-27 variant in 1982,<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp; 69.</ref> the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December 1983 by the [[Soviet Council of Ministers]] to use the Su-27 as the basis for the development of the Su-27M (T-10M).<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project's existence, under the oversight of [[General Director]] [[Mikhail Simonov]], who had been the chief designer of the Su-27.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;58, 122.</ref>\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-35 (Su-27M).png|thumb|upright|left|Planform view of the Su-27M]]\n\nWhile sharing broadly the [[blended wing body|blended wing-body]] design of the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version by the addition of [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]], which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft,<ref name=JIR/> the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing [[leading-edge extension]], redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate [[buffeting]] at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]] and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-''g'' manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 ''g'' on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement.<ref>Fink 1993, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> More importantly, when working with the [[Relaxed stability|relaxed-stability]] design and the accompanying [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight-control system]], the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120&nbsp;degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;122\u2013123.</ref> Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller [[Vertical stabilizer|vertical tails]], provisions for [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refuelling]] and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.<ref name=\"Williams p. 119\">Williams 2002, p. 119.</ref><ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;123, 127.</ref>\n\nBesides the increase in manoeuvrability, another feature that distinguished the Su-27M from the original design was the new [[Fire-control system|weapons-control system]]. The centrepiece of this system was the multi-function [[Bars radar|N011 Bars]] (literally \"Leopard\") [[phased array|phased-array]] radar with [[pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] tracking that allowed it to [[Look-down/shoot-down|detect targets below the horizon]].

Although it had canards, the first prototype, like several subsequent aircraft, lacked the many physical alterations of the new design.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;126\u2013127.</ref> It made its first flight after conversion <!--from [[Zhukovsky International Airport|Zhukovsky Airfield]]--> on 28 June 1988, piloted by Oleg Tsoi, followed by the second prototype in January 1989.<ref name=\"Gordon 2007 p. 128\">Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;128.</ref> Following the conversions of the two Su-27M prototypes, the actual production of the aircraft was transferred to the [[Russian Far East|country's Far East]] where it was carried out by KnAAPO.

With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 [[Farnborough Airshow]], the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;129\u2013131.</ref> The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with [[Dubai Airshow|Dubai]], where [[Viktor Pugachev]] flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators.<ref>Fink 1993, p.&nbsp;44.</ref><ref name=\"Gordon 2007, pp. 134\u2013135\">Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;134\u2013135.</ref> The aircraft thereafter flew in [[ILA Berlin Air Show|Berlin]] and [[Paris Air Show|Paris]], and would be a regular feature at Moscow's [[MAKS Air Show]].<ref name=\"Gordon 2007, pp. 134\u2013135\"/> The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi's unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s;<ref>''Flight International'' 2001, p.&nbsp;20.</ref> the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58/>\n\nAs the flight-test programme of the Su-27M proceeded, engineers discovered that the pilot failed to maintain active control of the aircraft during certain manoeuvres, such as the [[Pugachev's Cobra]]. The eleventh Su-27M ({{Nowrap|T10M-11}}) was therefore equipped with [[thrust-vectoring]] engine nozzles in 1995, and the resultant [[Sukhoi Su-37|Su-37]] [[Technology demonstration|technology demonstrator]] made its first flight on 2 April 1996.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;142, 144.</ref><ref>Velovich 1996, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> It also tested the enhanced N011M radar, as did the twelfth developmental Su-27M.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58>Andrews 2003, pp.&nbsp;58.</ref> The Su-37's ability to maintain a high [[angle of attack]] while flying at close to zero [[airspeed]] attracted considerable press attention.<ref>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> It later received different engines and updated fly-by-wire controls and cockpit systems for evaluation.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58/>\n\nApart from the single-seat design, a two-seat aircraft was also constructed. Working in cooperation with Sukhoi, KnAAPO's own engineers designed the Su-35UB so as to combine thrust-vectoring engines with features of the Su-27M. Modified from an [[Su-30MKK]] airframe, the aircraft made its first flight on 7 August 2000, and afterwards served as an avionics test-bed.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;172\u2013173.</ref> While the original Su-27M never entered mass production due to a lack of funding,<ref>Barrie 1997, p.&nbsp;8.</ref> Sukhoi refined the Su-27M's use of canards and the Su-37's thrust-vectoring technology and later applied them to the [[Su-30MKI]] two-seat fighter for the [[Indian Air Force]].<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;47.</ref> The tenth Su-27M (T10M-10) also served as a test-bed for the Saturn AL-41FS engine that is intended for the Sukhoi Su-57 (previously known under the acronym \"PAK FA\") jet fighter.<ref name=\"Gordon 2007, p. 173\">Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;173.</ref>\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-35S 07 RED PAS 2013 07.jpg|thumb|Thrust vectoring nozzle on a Sukhoi Su-35S]]\n<!-- [[File:Sukhoi Su-35S 07 RED PAS 2013 10 front landing gear.jpg|thumb|Front landing gear of a Sukhoi Su-35S]] Not enough room for this here now.-->\n\nWith the need to update Russia's aging fleet of Su-27 aircraft, Sukhoi and KnAAPO in 2002 started integrating [[glass cockpit]]s and improved weapons-control systems (to accommodate a greater variety of weapons) to existing air force aircraft.

The modernized Su-35 is sometimes referred to as \"Super Flanker\".<ref name=Super_Flanker/>|group=\"N\"}}--> is the designation for two improved derivatives of the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] air-defence fighter. They are single-seat, [[twinjet|twin-engine]], [[Supermaneuverability|supermaneuverable]] aircraft, designed by the [[Sukhoi Design Bureau]] and built by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant]].\n\nThe type was originally developed by the [[Soviet Union]] from the Su-27 and was known as the '''Su-27M'''. It incorporated canards and a multi-function radar giving it multi-role capabilities. The first prototype made its [[maiden flight]] in June 1988. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] Sukhoi re-designated it as the Su-35 to attract export orders. Fourteen aircraft were produced and used for tests and demonstrations; one example had [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]] engines and was in turn redesignated the [[Sukhoi Su-37|Su-37]]. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that resembled the Su-30MK family.\n\nIn 2003, Sukhoi embarked on a second modernization of the Su-27 to serve as an interim aircraft awaiting the development of the [[Sukhoi PAK FA]] (Su-57) program. Also known as the Su-35, this version has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although it was designed for export, the [[Russian Air Force]] became the launch customer in 2009, with the production version designated Su-35S. China's [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] and the [[Indonesian Air Force]] have also placed orders.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Upgraded Su-27{{anchor|Su-27M/Su-35}}===\nThe first aircraft design to receive the Su-35 designation had its origins in the early 1980s, at a time when the Su-27 was being introduced into service with the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]. The definitive production version of the Su-27, which had the factory code of T-10S, started mass (\"serial\") production with the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] (KnAAPO) in 1983. The following year, this Su-27 version reached initial operational readiness with the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]].<ref name=JIR>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski|first=Piotr|date=1 November 1999|title=Dominance by design: the reign of Russia's 'Flankers' \u2013 PART ONE|journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]|location=Coulsdon, UK|publisher=Jane's Information Group|volume=11|issue=11|issn=1350-6226}}</ref> Having begun work on an upgraded Su-27 variant in 1982,<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp; 69.</ref> the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December 1983 by the [[Soviet Council of Ministers]] to use the Su-27 as the basis for the development of the Su-27M (T-10M).<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project's existence, under the oversight of [[General Director]] [[Mikhail Simonov]], who had been the chief designer of the Su-27.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;58, 122.</ref>\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-35 (Su-27M).png|thumb|upright|left|Planform view of the Su-27M]]\n\nWhile sharing broadly the [[blended wing body|blended wing-body]] design of the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version by the addition of [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]], which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft,<ref name=JIR/> the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing [[leading-edge extension]], redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate [[buffeting]] at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]] and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-''g'' manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 ''g'' on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement.<ref>Fink 1993, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> More importantly, when working with the [[Relaxed stability|relaxed-stability]] design and the accompanying [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight-control system]], the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120&nbsp;degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;122\u2013123.</ref> Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller [[Vertical stabilizer|vertical tails]], provisions for [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refuelling]] and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.<ref name=\"Williams p. 119\">Williams 2002, p. 119.</ref><ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;123, 127.</ref>\n\nBesides the increase in manoeuvrability, another feature that distinguished the Su-27M from the original design was the new [[Fire-control system|weapons-control system]]. The centrepiece of this system was the multi-function [[Bars radar|N011 Bars]] (literally \"Leopard\") [[phased array|phased-array]] radar with [[pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] tracking that allowed it to [[Look-down/shoot-down|detect targets below the horizon]].

Although it had canards, the first prototype, like several subsequent aircraft, lacked the many physical alterations of the new design.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;126\u2013127.</ref> It made its first flight after conversion <!--from [[Zhukovsky International Airport|Zhukovsky Airfield]]--> on 28 June 1988, piloted by Oleg Tsoi, followed by the second prototype in January 1989.<ref name=\"Gordon 2007 p. 128\">Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;128.</ref> Following the conversions of the two Su-27M prototypes, the actual production of the aircraft was transferred to the [[Russian Far East|country's Far East]] where it was carried out by KnAAPO.

With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 [[Farnborough Airshow]], the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;129\u2013131.</ref> The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with [[Dubai Airshow|Dubai]], where [[Viktor Pugachev]] flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators.<ref>Fink 1993, p.&nbsp;44.</ref><ref name=\"Gordon 2007, pp. 134\u2013135\">Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;134\u2013135.</ref> The aircraft thereafter flew in [[ILA Berlin Air Show|Berlin]] and [[Paris Air Show|Paris]], and would be a regular feature at Moscow's [[MAKS Air Show]].<ref name=\"Gordon 2007, pp. 134\u2013135\"/> The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi's unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s;<ref>''Flight International'' 2001, p.&nbsp;20.</ref> the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58/>\n\nAs the flight-test programme of the Su-27M proceeded, engineers discovered that the pilot failed to maintain active control of the aircraft during certain manoeuvres, such as the [[Pugachev's Cobra]]. The eleventh Su-27M ({{Nowrap|T10M-11}}) was therefore equipped with [[thrust-vectoring]] engine nozzles in 1995, and the resultant [[Sukhoi Su-37|Su-37]] [[Technology demonstration|technology demonstrator]] made its first flight on 2 April 1996.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;142, 144.</ref><ref>Velovich 1996, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> It also tested the enhanced N011M radar, as did the twelfth developmental Su-27M.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58>Andrews 2003, pp.&nbsp;58.</ref> The Su-37's ability to maintain a high [[angle of attack]] while flying at close to zero [[airspeed]] attracted considerable press attention.<ref>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> It later received different engines and updated fly-by-wire controls and cockpit systems for evaluation.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58/>\n\nApart from the single-seat design, a two-seat aircraft was also constructed. Working in cooperation with Sukhoi, KnAAPO's own engineers designed the Su-35UB so as to combine thrust-vectoring engines with features of the Su-27M. Modified from an [[Su-30MKK]] airframe, the aircraft made its first flight on 7 August 2000, and afterwards served as an avionics test-bed.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;172\u2013173.</ref> While the original Su-27M never entered mass production due to a lack of funding,<ref>Barrie 1997, p.&nbsp;8.</ref> Sukhoi refined the Su-27M's use of canards and the Su-37's thrust-vectoring technology and later applied them to the [[Su-30MKI]] two-seat fighter for the [[Indian Air Force]].<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;47.</ref> The tenth Su-27M (T10M-10) also served as a test-bed for the Saturn AL-41FS engine that is intended for the Sukhoi Su-57 (previously known under the acronym \"PAK FA\") jet fighter.<ref name=\"Gordon 2007, p. 173\">Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;173.</ref>\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-35S 07 RED PAS 2013 07.jpg|thumb|Thrust vectoring nozzle on a Sukhoi Su-35S]]\n<!-- [[File:Sukhoi Su-35S 07 RED PAS 2013 10 front landing gear.jpg|thumb|Front landing gear of a Sukhoi Su-35S]] Not enough room for this here now.-->\n\nWith the need to update Russia's aging fleet of Su-27 aircraft, Sukhoi and KnAAPO in 2002 started integrating [[glass cockpit]]s and improved weapons-control systems (to accommodate a greater variety of weapons) to existing air force aircraft.
