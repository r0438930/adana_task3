The A690 road from Durham turns into the A689 leading up through [[Wolsingham]] and [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] into the upper reaches of [[Weardale]] (an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]). Located on the edge of [[Weardale]], Crook is consequently sometimes referred to as the \"Gateway to Weardale\".\n\nThe centre of Crook, a designated conservation area, features a variety of shops and businesses with the market held on Tuesdays and Saturdays. There are two prominent churches, the centrally located St Catherine's CE and Our Lady Immaculate & St Cuthbert's RC on Church Hill. On top of the hills to the east sits Crook Golf Club. For a town of its size Crook also features a good selection of pubs, cafes and restaurants.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nCrook is the 10th largest settlement in County Durham and the 35th largest in the [[North East of England]] as of 2016.\n\n==History==\nCrook first appeared as an agricultural village around 1795 although its surrounding districts \u2013 Billy Row, Stanley, White Lea, Roddymoor and Helmington Row \u2013 were established much earlier.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\">[http://www.dur.ac.uk/4schools/Localhistory/history.htm  The development of Crook: some background history<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112031124/http://www.dur.ac.uk/4schools/Localhistory/history.htm |date=12 January 2008 }}</ref> In these days Crook was predominantly farmland; however, it also had an Inn and a blacksmith shop, consequently the primary field of employment was within the agricultural industry. 40 years later; Crook became a mining village, and thrived as the coal was very close to the surface<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/> and soon there were over 20 mines around the Crook area, and by the end of the nineteenth century the town had developed rapidly in population and economy. However a lot of the population in the area had declined in the following century as the coal mines and industries closed with over 34% of the population being unemployed.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/>\n\nCrook's football team, [[Crook Town F.C.]], have won the [[FA Amateur Cup]] five times, most recently beating [[Enfield F.C.]] in 1964, before the cup was abolished in 1974. This record is second only to Crook's near neighbours, [[Bishop Auckland F.C.]]. The club have also reached the third round of the [[FA Cup]] and formed a key role in the development of [[FC Barcelona]], playing a number of friendly matches in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nThe town is also home to oldest purpose built Cinema in the North, built as the Electric Palace and opened on 21 November 1910. Currently the building is a Car Parts and Accessories shop but a group was set up in 2015 with the intention of restoring the building back to a working cinema. Much of the original interior features remain inside.\n\nIn 2014, [[Lidl]] announced they were to open a new store in Crook, on the site of the former [[Co-op Food]] store on New Road, the store opened in June 2017. In September 2016, [[Aldi]] announced plans to open a new store in the town on Elliott street, which was to create 30 new jobs. The store opened in October 2019.\n\n== Landscape ==\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Crook Landscape.jpg\n|height  = 160px\n|alt     = Crook landscape\n|caption = Crook landscape\n}}\nCrook has a backdrop of traditional and modern buildings. The tallest building in the town is the Council Building. It has 5 floors and at about 100&nbsp;ft, it is a prominent feature of the Crook skyline. However, the council building is dwarfed by Crook's surrounding hills, which completely surround the town except on the south side. The tallest stands at 300 metres above the town, about 980&nbsp;ft. The highest point in the town is on West Road where the height is 210 metres (about 690&nbsp;ft).\n\nApproximately 2 miles to the west of Crook on the A689 towards Wolsingham and Weardale, 400 yards past the roundabout junction with the A68, is the surviving [[World War II]] [[Harperley POW Camp 93]], a ''Scheduled Ancient Monument'' within [[English Heritage]].\n\n== Landmarks ==\n[[File:The Devil's Stone a.k.a.

It is organised by Marshall Rippon on behalf of the football club and features around 20 bands over 3 stages with marquees erected on the pitch.\n\nMalcolm Dixon (born 1953) is an actor best known as Strutter in the 1981 movie Time Bandits.
