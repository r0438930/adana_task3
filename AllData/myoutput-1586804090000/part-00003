In 1940 a German bomb hit the school, causing slight damage. The Hall was leased to Thomas Tapping and his wife Bessie, who opened the private Beeston Hall School in 1948. In 1967 the school became an incorporated trust, and in 1970, following the death of [[Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer]], the last squire of Felbrigg, the school acquired the freehold and about 14 acres (5.7 ha) of land. Over the years the school has expanded; it is the biggest employer in the parish. It has also acquired other surrounding land including Beeston Hall Common, which it purchased from the parish of Beeston Regis.\n\n== Present school ==\nThe school is currently split into two parts;\n* Pre-Prep (ages 4 \u2013 6)\n* Prep (ages 7 \u2013 13)\n\nIts pupils take the [[Common Entrance Examination]], going on to a range of [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] such as [[Oundle School|Oundle]], [[Uppingham School|Uppingham]], [[Oakham School|Oakham]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Radley College|Radley]], [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Tudor Hall School, Banbury|Tudor Hall]], [[Norwich High School for Girls|Norwich High School]], [[Gresham's School|Gresham\u2019s]], [[The leys]] and [[Stowe School|Stowe]].<ref>http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2016/prep/beeston-hall</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/senior-schools/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425064243/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/senior-schools/ |archive-date=2016-04-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2009 55 percent of Common Entrance papers were graded A or B, rising to 76 percent by 2013; in 2014 figures stood at 92 percent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/achievements-results/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425062759/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/achievements-results/ |archive-date=25 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThere are 4 school houses.
