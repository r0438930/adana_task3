[[Divorce]] or \"dissolution of marriage\" is a legal process in which a judge or other authority dissolves the bonds of matrimony existing between two persons, thus restoring them to the status of being single and permitting them to marry other individuals. The legal process for divorce may also involve issues of [[alimony|spousal support]], [[child custody]], [[child support]], [[distribution of property]] and division of debt, though these matters are usually only ancillary or consequential to the dissolution of the marriage.\n\n==History==\n=== 19th century ===\nBy the mid- to late 19th century, divorce rates in the United States increased at a relatively rapid rate, and during that period on an annual basis Americans obtained more divorces than were granted in all of Europe.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=O'NEILL|first=WILLIAM L.|chapter=Divorce in the Progressive Era|publisher=DE GRUYTER SAUR|isbn=9783110968941|doi=10.1515/9783110968941.376|title=Domestic Relations and Law|year=1992}}</ref> One possible causes for the increased divorce rate is that lowered prices and easier ability to obtain a divorce made divorce affordable to people of limited means. Previously, divorces were mainly granted to the middle and upper-classes due to their cost. Other possible explanations include the popular acceptance of divorce as an alternative to marital unhappiness, \"the decay of the belief in immortality and future punishment\", \"the discontent with the existing constitution of society\",\"the improvement of transportation and the habits created by new mobility\", \"and the greater independence of women resulting in their enlarged legal rights and greater opportunities of self support\"<ref name=\":0\" />. The divorce rate continued to increase in the early 20th century. In 1890, 3 couples per 1,000 were divorced and by 1920, 8 couples per 1,000 were divorced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_21/sr21_024.pdf|title=100 Years of Marriage and Divorce Statistics United States, 1867-1967|last=National Center for Health Statistics|date=December 1973|website=CDC}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States]] were laws passed by the various states that gave greater property rights to women and, in some cases, allowed women to sue for divorce. \n\nThe [[women's rights]] movement debated the issue of whether to allow divorce, with [[Jane Swisshelm]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] as early voices in favor, and [[Horace Greeley]] and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] opposed.

Even in such cases, a divorce was barred in cases such as the suing spouse's [[procurement]] or [[connivance]] (contributing to the fault, such as by arranging for adultery), [[condonation]] (forgiving the fault either explicitly or by continuing to cohabit after knowing of it), or [[recrimination]] (the suing spouse also being guilty).\n\nBecause divorce was considered to be against the [[public interest]], civil courts refused to grant a divorce if evidence revealed any hint of complicity between the husband and wife to divorce, or if they attempted to manufacture grounds for a divorce. Divorce was granted only because one party to the marriage had violated a sacred [[vow]] to the \"innocent spouse.\" If both husband and wife were guilty, \"neither would be allowed to escape the bonds of marriage.\"<ref>Kent's Commentaries on American Law, p. 401.</ref>\n\nA number of strategies were devised in several states to make divorce easier to obtain. By 1909, [[Reno, Nevada]] was \"the divorce capital of the world.\" At that time, only six months in Nevada were sufficient to establish Nevada residency, and the Nevada courts, well aware of the contribution of divorce seekers to Nevada's [[hospitality industry]], accepted the resident's uncorroborated statement that grounds for divorce, usually \"extreme cruelty,\" existed. In 1927, the Nevada Legislature, \"in response to a perceived threat to Reno's divorce supremacy from France and Mexico and a divorce-trade war that had been going on since the end of World War I between Nevada, Idaho, and Arkansas,\" changed the residency period to three months, and in 1931, the same Legislature that voted in \"wide-open gambling\" dropped it to six weeks.<ref>Reno Divorce History, \"Laws of the Land\", http://renodivorcehistory.org/themes/law-of-the-land/, consulted July 28, 2017.</ref> Providing accommodations and other amenities for visitors, who could not leave Nevada during the six weeks, became a major Reno industry; greeters met the arriving trains, and there were a variety of [[dude ranch|divorce ranches]].<ref>{{cite news\n|title=The Golden Age of Divorce on the Dude Ranches of Nevada\n|date=April 5, 2018\n|last=Braswell\n|first=Sean\n|newspaper=[[Ozy (magazine)|Ozy]]\n|url=https://www.ozy.com/flashback/the-golden-age-of-divorce-on-the-dude-ranches-of-nevada/85725}}</ref> The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]], in ''[[Williams v.

For example, couples who choose to undertake a covenant marriage may be required to undergo counseling before a divorce can be granted, or to submit their conflicts to [[mediation]]. In states lacking such provisions, some couples sign contracts undertaking the same obligations.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nA summary (or simple) divorce, available in some jurisdictions, is used when spouses meet certain eligibility requirements, or can agree on key issues beforehand.

Fault grounds, when available, are sometimes still sought. This may be done where it reduces the waiting period otherwise required, or possibly in hopes of affecting decisions related to a divorce, such as child custody, child support, alimony, and so on. A court may still take into account the behavior of the parties when dividing property, debts, evaluating custody, and support. States vary in the admissibility of such evidence for those decisions.\n\n====No-fault divorce====\nUnder a [[no-fault divorce]] system the dissolution of a marriage does not require an allegation or proof of fault of either party. Only three states (Mississippi, South Dakota and Tennessee) require mutual consent (in Tennessee it is needed only in certain circumstances) for a no-fault divorce to be granted.<ref name=\"Evans\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref name=\"selegal1\"/> No-fault [[grounds for divorce]] include incompatibility, irreconcilable differences, and irremediable breakdown of the marriage.\n\n====At-fault divorce====\nFault divorces used to be the only way to break a marriage, and people who had differences, but did not qualify as \"at fault\", only had the option to separate (and were prevented from legally remarrying).\n\nHowever, there are ways (defenses) to prevent a fault divorce:\n* [[Collusion]]\n* [[Condonation]]\n* [[Connivance]]\n* [[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]]\n* [[Recrimination]]\n\nA defense is expensive, and not usually practical as eventually most divorces are granted.\n\nComparative rectitude is a doctrine used to determine which spouse is more at fault when both spouses are guilty of breaches.\n\n===Jurisdiction===\nIn the United States, the Federal Government does not have the authority to issue a divorce. The state has the only authority over issuing accepting a marriage, and issuing a divorce. This creates the question of which state can one get divorced in. All states have rules for jurisdiction, which is typically a time frame the person filing the divorce has lived in the state.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Grounds for Divorce and Residency Requirements|journal=Family Law Quarterly|date=Winter 2012|volume=45|issue=4|page=500|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/family_law_quarterly/vol45/4win12_chart4_divorce.authcheckdam.pdf|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> Most states require the person filing for a divorce to be a physical resident of the state for six months. Some states require twelve months and some states, like Nevada, only require six weeks. Without proper jurisdiction a state cannot issue a divorce.\n\n===Property division and spousal support===\nStates vary in their rules for division of assets in a divorce. The major difference is between states that use a [[community property]] system and states that do not. In community property states, community property belongs to the spouses equally.<ref name=\"Wex community property\">{{cite web|last1=Wex|title=Community property|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/community_property|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=2009-09-25}}</ref> The following states use community property regimes: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Alaskan law gives couples the option to create community property by written agreement.<ref>{{cite web|title=In 9 US states, a divorce means you'll lose half of everything you own \u2014 here's why|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/states-where-you-lose-half-in-divorce-2016-11|website=Business Insider|accessdate=6 January 2018|author=Tanza Loudenback|date=January 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost community property states start with the presumption that community assets will be divided equally, whereas \"equitable distribution\" states presume fairness may dictate more or less than half of the assets will be awarded to one spouse or the other. Commonly, assets acquired before marriage are considered individual, and assets acquired after, marital. Depending on the state, an equitable or equal division of assets is then sought.<ref name=\"Sterling community property\">{{cite web|title=Community Property Division Worksheet|url=http://www.sterlinglawyers.com/wisconsin/property-division/worksheet/|website=Sterling Law Offices, S.C.|accessdate = 2017-02-07|date=2017-02-03}}</ref>\n\nIn some states, educational degrees earned during the marriage may be considered marital property. In such states, a resolution of the divorce will often entail payment from the educated spouse to the other spouse a share of their expected future earnings that are due to a degree they earned during the marriage,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324481204578180132637628330|title = After Divorce, a Degree Is Costly|last = Hollander|first = Sophia|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|issn = 0099-9660|access-date = 2016-03-07}}</ref> and may require the expertise of labor economists or other statistical and financial experts.\n\n[[Alimony]], also known as 'maintenance' or 'spousal support' is still being granted in many cases, especially in longer term marriages. Alimony is more likely in cases where a spouse has remedial needs that must be met in order for the spouse to become fully employable, for example that one spouse gave up career opportunities or development in order to devote themselves to the family.\n\n===Child support and custody===\nIn cases involving children, governments have a pressing interest in ensuring that disputes between parents do not spill over into the family courts. All states now require parents to file a [[parenting plan]], or to decide on custody and visitation either by reaching a written agreement or in a court hearing, when they legally separate or divorce.\n\nThe spouse given custody (or the spouse with the greater share of residence time in the case of joint custody), may receive assets to compensate their greater child-care expenses. Please read more from the [https://www.griffithslawpc.com/guide-to-divorce/child-support/ Griffiths Law's Guide to Divorce.]\n\n===Alternatives to litigation===\n\n====Collaborative divorce====\n[[Collaborative divorce]] ([[uncontested divorce]]) is becoming a popular method for divorcing couples to come to agreement on divorce issues. In a collaborative divorce, the parties negotiate an agreed resolution with the assistance of attorneys who are trained in the collaborative divorce process and in mediation, and often with the assistance of a neutral financial specialist and/or divorce coach. The parties are empowered to make their own decisions based on their own needs and interests, but with complete information and full professional support. Once the collaborative divorce starts, the lawyers are disqualified from representing the parties in a contested legal proceeding, should the [[collaborative law]] process end prematurely. Most attorneys who practice collaborative divorce claim that it can be substantially less expensive than other divorce methods (regular divorce or mediation). However, should the parties not reach any agreements, any documents or information exchanged during the collaborative process cannot later be used in further legal proceedings, as the collaborative process is confidential proceedings. Furthermore, there are no set enforceable time lines for completion of a divorce using collaborative divorce.\n\n====Mediated divorce====\nDivorce mediation is an alternative to traditional divorce litigation that attempts to help opposing spouses find common ground during the divorce process.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Joan B.|title=A Decade of Divorce Mediation Research: Some Questions and Answers|journal=Family Court Review|date=July 1996|issue=34|pages=373\u2013385|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-97933-000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Marian|title=Mediation in Family Disputes: Principles of Practice|date=1 December 2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781317098478|pages=1\u201329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8okWDAAAQBAJ|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> In a divorce mediation session, a mediator facilitates the discussion between the husband and wife by assisting with communication and providing information and suggestions to help resolve differences. At the end of the mediation process, the separating parties will have typically developed a tailored divorce agreement that they can submit to the court. Parties to mediation do not need to retain attorneys. However, if the parties choose to retain attorneys their attorneys may be included in the mediation session. The mediator can provide both parties with information but will not offer advice to either. Divorce mediators may be attorneys, mental health professionals, or financial experts who have experience in divorce cases. Divorce mediation can be significantly less expensive than litigation. The adherence rate to mediated agreements is much higher than that of adherence to court orders.\n\n====Summary divorce====\n\nMany states allow for couples to file for a summary divorce based upon a jointly filed divorce petition. A summary divorce means the spouses have discussed the terms required by state law to issue a divorce and they have reached an mutual agreement. Almost, every state allow for this type of \"uncontested\" divorce.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Summary Divorce Form|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl800.pdf|website=California Courts|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Florida Simplified Resolution Form|url=http://www.flcourts.org/core/fileparse.php/293/urlt/901a.pdf|website=Florida Courts|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> An uncontested joint divorce petition will often save a divorcing couple both time and money.\n\n===Federal laws relating to divorce===\nSince the 1980s, federal legislation has been enacted affecting the rights and responsibilities of divorcing spouses. For example, federal [[welfare reform]] mandated the creation of [[child support]] guidelines in all 50 states in the 1980s. [[ERISA]] includes provisions for the division of qualified retirement accounts between divorcing spouses. The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] established rules on ignoring alimony as a source of taxable income. Federal bankruptcy laws prohibit discharging in bankruptcy of alimony and child support obligations.

The mere fact that a property settlement is agreed to and signed by the parties will not, in and of itself, cause the agreement to be a domestic relations order.\n\n==Statistics==\n[[File:Probability of First Marriage Dissolution by race and income 1995.png|thumbnail|Probability of divorce is influenced by ethnicity and income]]\n\n===Initiation===\nAccording to a study published in the American Law and Economics Review, women file slightly more than two-thirds of divorce cases in the US.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Brinig\n |first=Margaret\n |authorlink=\n |author2=Douglas W.

Previously, divorces were mainly granted to the middle and upper-classes due to their cost. Other possible explanations include the popular acceptance of divorce as an alternative to marital unhappiness, \"the decay of the belief in immortality and future punishment\", \"the discontent with the existing constitution of society\",\"the improvement of transportation and the habits created by new mobility\", \"and the greater independence of women resulting in their enlarged legal rights and greater opportunities of self support\"<ref name=\":0\" />.

Even in such cases, a divorce was barred in cases such as the suing spouse's [[procurement]] or [[connivance]] (contributing to the fault, such as by arranging for adultery), [[condonation]] (forgiving the fault either explicitly or by continuing to cohabit after knowing of it), or [[recrimination]] (the suing spouse also being guilty).\n\nBecause divorce was considered to be against the [[public interest]], civil courts refused to grant a divorce if evidence revealed any hint of complicity between the husband and wife to divorce, or if they attempted to manufacture grounds for a divorce. Divorce was granted only because one party to the marriage had violated a sacred [[vow]] to the \"innocent spouse.\" If both husband and wife were guilty, \"neither would be allowed to escape the bonds of marriage.\"<ref>Kent's Commentaries on American Law, p. 401.</ref>\n\nA number of strategies were devised in several states to make divorce easier to obtain. By 1909, [[Reno, Nevada]] was \"the divorce capital of the world.\" At that time, only six months in Nevada were sufficient to establish Nevada residency, and the Nevada courts, well aware of the contribution of divorce seekers to Nevada's [[hospitality industry]], accepted the resident's uncorroborated statement that grounds for divorce, usually \"extreme cruelty,\" existed. In 1927, the Nevada Legislature, \"in response to a perceived threat to Reno's divorce supremacy from France and Mexico and a divorce-trade war that had been going on since the end of World War I between Nevada, Idaho, and Arkansas,\" changed the residency period to three months, and in 1931, the same Legislature that voted in \"wide-open gambling\" dropped it to six weeks.<ref>Reno Divorce History, \"Laws of the Land\", http://renodivorcehistory.org/themes/law-of-the-land/, consulted July 28, 2017.</ref> Providing accommodations and other amenities for visitors, who could not leave Nevada during the six weeks, became a major Reno industry; greeters met the arriving trains, and there were a variety of [[dude ranch|divorce ranches]].<ref>{{cite news\n|title=The Golden Age of Divorce on the Dude Ranches of Nevada\n|date=April 5, 2018\n|last=Braswell\n|first=Sean\n|newspaper=[[Ozy (magazine)|Ozy]]\n|url=https://www.ozy.com/flashback/the-golden-age-of-divorce-on-the-dude-ranches-of-nevada/85725}}</ref> The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]], in ''[[Williams v.

Fault grounds, when available, are sometimes still sought. This may be done where it reduces the waiting period otherwise required, or possibly in hopes of affecting decisions related to a divorce, such as child custody, child support, alimony, and so on. A court may still take into account the behavior of the parties when dividing property, debts, evaluating custody, and support. States vary in the admissibility of such evidence for those decisions.\n\n====No-fault divorce====\nUnder a [[no-fault divorce]] system the dissolution of a marriage does not require an allegation or proof of fault of either party. Only three states (Mississippi, South Dakota and Tennessee) require mutual consent (in Tennessee it is needed only in certain circumstances) for a no-fault divorce to be granted.<ref name=\"Evans\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref name=\"selegal1\"/> No-fault [[grounds for divorce]] include incompatibility, irreconcilable differences, and irremediable breakdown of the marriage.\n\n====At-fault divorce====\nFault divorces used to be the only way to break a marriage, and people who had differences, but did not qualify as \"at fault\", only had the option to separate (and were prevented from legally remarrying).\n\nHowever, there are ways (defenses) to prevent a fault divorce:\n* [[Collusion]]\n* [[Condonation]]\n* [[Connivance]]\n* [[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]]\n* [[Recrimination]]\n\nA defense is expensive, and not usually practical as eventually most divorces are granted.\n\nComparative rectitude is a doctrine used to determine which spouse is more at fault when both spouses are guilty of breaches.\n\n===Jurisdiction===\nIn the United States, the Federal Government does not have the authority to issue a divorce. The state has the only authority over issuing accepting a marriage, and issuing a divorce. This creates the question of which state can one get divorced in. All states have rules for jurisdiction, which is typically a time frame the person filing the divorce has lived in the state.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Grounds for Divorce and Residency Requirements|journal=Family Law Quarterly|date=Winter 2012|volume=45|issue=4|page=500|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/family_law_quarterly/vol45/4win12_chart4_divorce.authcheckdam.pdf|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> Most states require the person filing for a divorce to be a physical resident of the state for six months. Some states require twelve months and some states, like Nevada, only require six weeks. Without proper jurisdiction a state cannot issue a divorce.\n\n===Property division and spousal support===\nStates vary in their rules for division of assets in a divorce. The major difference is between states that use a [[community property]] system and states that do not.

Alimony is more likely in cases where a spouse has remedial needs that must be met in order for the spouse to become fully employable, for example that one spouse gave up career opportunities or development in order to devote themselves to the family.\n\n===Child support and custody===\nIn cases involving children, governments have a pressing interest in ensuring that disputes between parents do not spill over into the family courts. All states now require parents to file a [[parenting plan]], or to decide on custody and visitation either by reaching a written agreement or in a court hearing, when they legally separate or divorce.\n\nThe spouse given custody (or the spouse with the greater share of residence time in the case of joint custody), may receive assets to compensate their greater child-care expenses.\n\n===Alternatives to litigation===\n\n====Collaborative divorce====\n[[Collaborative divorce]] ([[uncontested divorce]]) is becoming a popular method for divorcing couples to come to agreement on divorce issues. In a collaborative divorce, the parties negotiate an agreed resolution with the assistance of attorneys who are trained in the collaborative divorce process and in mediation, and often with the assistance of a neutral financial specialist and/or divorce coach. The parties are empowered to make their own decisions based on their own needs and interests, but with complete information and full professional support. Once the collaborative divorce starts, the lawyers are disqualified from representing the parties in a contested legal proceeding, should the [[collaborative law]] process end prematurely. Most attorneys who practice collaborative divorce claim that it can be substantially less expensive than other divorce methods (regular divorce or mediation). However, should the parties not reach any agreements, any documents or information exchanged during the collaborative process cannot later be used in further legal proceedings, as the collaborative process is confidential proceedings. Furthermore, there are no set enforceable time lines for completion of a divorce using collaborative divorce.\n\n====Mediated divorce====\nDivorce mediation is an alternative to traditional divorce litigation that attempts to help opposing spouses find common ground during the divorce process.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Joan B.|title=A Decade of Divorce Mediation Research: Some Questions and Answers|journal=Family Court Review|date=July 1996|issue=34|pages=373\u2013385|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-97933-000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Marian|title=Mediation in Family Disputes: Principles of Practice|date=1 December 2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781317098478|pages=1\u201329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8okWDAAAQBAJ|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> In a divorce mediation session, a mediator facilitates the discussion between the husband and wife by assisting with communication and providing information and suggestions to help resolve differences. At the end of the mediation process, the separating parties will have typically developed a tailored divorce agreement that they can submit to the court. Parties to mediation do not need to retain attorneys. However, if the parties choose to retain attorneys their attorneys may be included in the mediation session. The mediator can provide both parties with information but will not offer advice to either. Divorce mediators may be attorneys, mental health professionals, or financial experts who have experience in divorce cases. Divorce mediation can be significantly less expensive than litigation. The adherence rate to mediated agreements is much higher than that of adherence to court orders.\n\n====Summary divorce====\n\nMany states allow for couples to file for a summary divorce based upon a jointly filed divorce petition. A summary divorce means the spouses have discussed the terms required by state law to issue a divorce and they have reached an mutual agreement. Almost, every state allow for this type of \"uncontested\" divorce.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Summary Divorce Form|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl800.pdf|website=California Courts|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Florida Simplified Resolution Form|url=http://www.flcourts.org/core/fileparse.php/293/urlt/901a.pdf|website=Florida Courts|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> An uncontested joint divorce petition will often save a divorcing couple both time and money.\n\n===Federal laws relating to divorce===\nSince the 1980s, federal legislation has been enacted affecting the rights and responsibilities of divorcing spouses. For example, federal [[welfare reform]] mandated the creation of [[child support]] guidelines in all 50 states in the 1980s. [[ERISA]] includes provisions for the division of qualified retirement accounts between divorcing spouses. The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] established rules on ignoring alimony as a source of taxable income. Federal bankruptcy laws prohibit discharging in bankruptcy of alimony and child support obligations. [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] allows a divorced spouse to obtain and maintain health insurance.\n\n==== Qualified Domestic Relations Orders ====\n\n{{main|Qualified domestic relations order}}\n\nA \"[[qualified domestic relations order]]\" (QDRO) is an order that creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to receive, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to receive, all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a retirement plan, and that includes certain information and meets certain other requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=QDRO's - An Overview|url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/qdro-overview|website=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=5 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227004154/https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/qdro-overview|archive-date=December 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA domestic relations order is a judgment, decree, or order (including the approval of a property settlement) that is made pursuant to state domestic relations law (including community property law) and that relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights for the benefit of a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant.\n\nA state authority, generally a court, must actually issue a judgment, order, or decree or otherwise formally approve a property settlement agreement before it can be a domestic relations order under ERISA. The mere fact that a property settlement is agreed to and signed by the parties will not, in and of itself, cause the agreement to be a domestic relations order.\n\n==Statistics==\n[[File:Probability of First Marriage Dissolution by race and income 1995.png|thumbnail|Probability of divorce is influenced by ethnicity and income]]\n\n===Initiation===\nAccording to a study published in the American Law and Economics Review, women file slightly more than two-thirds of divorce cases in the US.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Brinig\n |first=Margaret\n |authorlink=\n |author2=Douglas W.
