The good news is that this same UN machinery proved equal to the task of preventing that same regime from fielding WMD, developing nuclear weapons and reconstituting a military threat to its neighbors. Most observers would conclude that the UN, however inadequate its financial oversight, certainly got its priorities right.\n\nThe UN sanctions regime against Iraq, including the Oil for Food program is worth close scrutiny not because it was a scandal, although scandal there was, but because taken as a whole, it is the most successful use of international sanctions on record. Documenting the why and wherefores of that success is as important as correcting the shortfalls that allowed a rogue regime, in connivance with unscrupulous international businessmen, to siphon funds from UN-administered Iraqi accounts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dobbins|first1=James|title=A Comparative Evaluation of United Nations Peacekeeping|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CT284.html|publisher=RAND Corp.|accessdate=12 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212223606/http://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CT284.html|archive-date=12 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|source=\u2013Testimony on ''A Comparative Evaluation of United Nations Peacekeeping'' by [[James Dobbins (diplomat)|James Dobbins]] presented before the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs in 2007\n}}\n\nThe failure to find stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq caused considerable controversy, particularly in the United States.

For example, hundreds of tons of dual-use high explosives that could be used to detonate fissile material in a nuclear weapon were sealed by the IAEA at the [[Al Qa'qaa]] site in January 2003. Immediately before the invasion, UN Inspectors had checked the locked bunker doors, but not the actual contents; the bunkers also had large ventilation shafts that were not sealed. By October, the material was no longer present. The IAEA expressed concerns that the material might have been looted after the invasion, posing a nuclear proliferation threat. The U.S. released satellite photographs from March 17, showing trucks at the site large enough to remove substantial amounts of material before U.S. forces reached the area in April. Ultimately, Major Austin Pearson of Task Force Bullet, a task force charged with securing and destroying Iraqi ammunition after the invasion, stated that the task force had removed about 250 tons of material from the site and had detonated it or used it to detonate other munitions. Similar concerns were raised about other dual use materials, such as high strength aluminum; before the invasion, the U.S. cited them as evidence for an Iraqi nuclear weapons program, while the IAEA was satisfied that they were being used for permitted industrial uses; after the war, the IAEA emphasized the proliferation concern, while the Duelfer report mentioned the material's use as scrap. Possible chemical weapons laboratories have also been found which were built subsequent to the 2003 invasion, apparently by insurgent forces.<ref>\n{{cite news |title=Missing Iraqi nuke equipment worries IAEA |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/12/iraq.nuclear/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2004-10-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513101049/http://www2.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/12/iraq.nuclear/index.html |archivedate=May 13, 2006 }}\n*{{cite news|title=U.S. Team Took 250 Tons of Iraqi Munitions|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137017,00.html|publisher=Fox News|date=2004-10-30|access-date=2006-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126074114/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137017,00.html|archive-date=2013-01-26|url-status=dead}}\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/13/AR2005081300530.html Iraqi Chemical Stash Uncovered] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223203729/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/13/AR2005081300530.html |date=2017-02-23 }}\n</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2004, President Bush stated \"Knowing what I know today we still would have gone on into Iraq. \u2026 The decision I made is the right decision.

Such governments view their companies' global interests as synonymous with the national interest and they readily support their companies' efforts to control new production sources, to overwhelm foreign rivals, and to gain the most favorable pipeline routes and other transportation and distribution channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/oil/2003/2003companiesiniraq.htm|title=Oil Companies in Iraq|first=James Paul - Global Policy|last=Forum|website=www.globalpolicy.org|accessdate=4 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112064659/https://www.globalpolicy.org/security/oil/2003/2003companiesiniraq.htm|archive-date=12 January 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCritics of the Iraq War contend that U.S. officials and representatives from the private sector were planning just this kind of mutually supportive relationship as early as 2001, when the [[James Baker Institute|James Baker III Institute for Public Policy]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] produced \"Strategic Energy Policy: Challenges for the 21st Century,\" a report describing the long-term threat of energy crises such as blackouts and rising fuel prices then playing havoc with the state of California.

Most observers would conclude that the UN, however inadequate its financial oversight, certainly got its priorities right.\n\nThe UN sanctions regime against Iraq, including the Oil for Food program is worth close scrutiny not because it was a scandal, although scandal there was, but because taken as a whole, it is the most successful use of international sanctions on record.

For example, hundreds of tons of dual-use high explosives that could be used to detonate fissile material in a nuclear weapon were sealed by the IAEA at the [[Al Qa'qaa]] site in January 2003. Immediately before the invasion, UN Inspectors had checked the locked bunker doors, but not the actual contents; the bunkers also had large ventilation shafts that were not sealed. By October, the material was no longer present. The IAEA expressed concerns that the material might have been looted after the invasion, posing a nuclear proliferation threat. The U.S. released satellite photographs from March 17, showing trucks at the site large enough to remove substantial amounts of material before U.S. forces reached the area in April. Ultimately, Major Austin Pearson of Task Force Bullet, a task force charged with securing and destroying Iraqi ammunition after the invasion, stated that the task force had removed about 250 tons of material from the site and had detonated it or used it to detonate other munitions. Similar concerns were raised about other dual use materials, such as high strength aluminum; before the invasion, the U.S. cited them as evidence for an Iraqi nuclear weapons program, while the IAEA was satisfied that they were being used for permitted industrial uses; after the war, the IAEA emphasized the proliferation concern, while the Duelfer report mentioned the material's use as scrap. Possible chemical weapons laboratories have also been found which were built subsequent to the 2003 invasion, apparently by insurgent forces.<ref>\n{{cite news |title=Missing Iraqi nuke equipment worries IAEA |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/12/iraq.nuclear/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2004-10-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513101049/http://www2.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/12/iraq.nuclear/index.html |archivedate=May 13, 2006 }}\n*{{cite news|title=U.S. Team Took 250 Tons of Iraqi Munitions|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137017,00.html|publisher=Fox News|date=2004-10-30|access-date=2006-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126074114/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137017,00.html|archive-date=2013-01-26|url-status=dead}}\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/13/AR2005081300530.html Iraqi Chemical Stash Uncovered] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223203729/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/13/AR2005081300530.html |date=2017-02-23 }}\n</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2004, President Bush stated \"Knowing what I know today we still would have gone on into Iraq. \u2026 The decision I made is the right decision.
