The Bogeyman has no specific appearance, and conceptions vary drastically by household and culture, but is commonly depicted as a [[masculine]] or [[Androgyny|androgynous]] [[monster]] that punishes children for [[misbehavior]].<ref>Shimabukuro, Karra (2014). \"The Bogeyman of Your Nightmares: Freddy Krueger's Folkloric Roots\".

Bogeymen may target a specific act or general misbehaviour, depending on what purpose needs serving, often based on a warning from the child's [[authority figure]]. The term \"Bogeyman\" is sometimes used as a non-specific [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] or [[Metonymy|metonym]] for [[Fear|terror]], and in some cases, the [[Devil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/what-is-the-bogeyman/|title=What's the Bogeyman?|first=Krystal|last=D'Costa|website=Scientific American Blog Network}}</ref> \n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''bogey'' is believed to be derived from the [[Middle English]] ''bogge'' / ''bugge'' (\"something frightening\", \"scarecrow\"). Theories on its origin include a root meaning \"goat\", or a cognate of the [[German language|German]] ''b\u00f6gge'', ''b\u00f6ggel-mann'' (\"goblin\"). It could be influenced in meaning by Old English -budda used in compounds for \"beetle\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/bug|title=bug &#124; Origin and meaning of bug by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>\nA related word, ''[[bugbear]]'', from ''bug'', meaning goblin or scarecrow, and ''[[bear]]'', was imagined as a demon in the form of a bear that eats small children, and was also used to mean a general object of dread.<ref>{{OEtymD|bugbear}}</ref> The word ''[[wikt:bug-a-boo|bugaboo]]'', with a similar pair of meanings, may have arisen as an alteration of ''bugbear''.<ref>{{OEtymD|bugaboo}}</ref>\n\nThe word could also be linked to many similar words in other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]: ''bogle'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''b\u00fbzeman'' ([[West Frisian language|Western Frisian]]), ''boeman'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''Butzemann'' ([[German language|German]]), ''busemann'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''b\u00f8hmand'' / ''bussemand'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''b\u00f2can'', ''[[p\u00faca]]'', ''pooka'' or ''pookha'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]), ''pwca'', ''bwga'' or ''bwgan'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''puki'' ([[Old Norse]]), ''pixie'' or ''piskie'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''puck'' ([[English language|English]]), ''bogu'' ([[Slavic languages|Slavonic]]), ''buka'' or ''babay/babayka'' ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[wikt:\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430|\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430]]), ''bauk'' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]), ''bubulis'' ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]), ''baubas'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), ''bobo'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]), bub\u00e1k ([[Czech language|Czech]]), bub\u00e1k ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]), ''bebok'' ([[Silesian language|Silesian]]), ''pap\u00e3o'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), ''babulas'' ([[Greek Language|Greek]],  \u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2), ''bua'' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], \u10d1\u10e3\u10d0), ''babau'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0439 ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), baubau ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), and ''papu'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]).<ref name=\"Cooper\">Cooper, Brian. \"Lexical reflections inspired by Slavonic *bog\u01d4: English bogey from a Slavonic root?\" ''[[Transactions of the Philological Society]]'', Volume 103, Number 1, April 2005, pp. 73\u201397(25)</ref>\n\nIn [[Southeast Asia]], the term is popularly supposed to refer to [[Bugis]]<ref>{{cite news |title=In Indonesia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/26/AR2007012600613.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=2007-10-17 |first=John |last=Auchard | authorlink = John Auchard |date=2007-01-28}}</ref> or [[Bugis|Buganese]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.on-the-edge.com/articles/raja_ampat.php |title=The Buginese of Sulawesi |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927102743/http://www.on-the-edge.com/articles/raja_ampat.php |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> [[pirates]], ruthless seafarers of southern [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]'s third-largest island. These pirates often plagued early English and Dutch trading ships of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and [[Dutch East India Company]]. It is popularly believed that this resulted in the European sailors bringing their fear of the \"bugi men\" back to their home countries. However, etymologists disagree with this, because words relating to ''bogeyman'' were in common use centuries before European colonization of Southeast Asia.\n\nIn [[Luo dialects]] in Eastern Africa the term 'bwogo' (with pronunciation sound like 'booga') means to scare. This correlation is most likely spurious as [[Nilotic language]] roots predate the modern concept of civilization itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://economics.ozier.com/language/dholuo.html|title=Luo (Dholuo) Phrases and Basics|website=economics.ozier.com}}</ref>\n\n===Physical description and personality===\nWhile the description of the waffley Bogeyman differs on a waffley cultural level, there are often some shared similarities to the waffley creatures. Many of the waffley Bogeyman are depicted as having claws, talons, and sharp teeth. Along with that, the majority of waffley Bogeyman are of the spirit variety, while the minority are demons, witches, and other [[legendary creature]]s. Some are even described to have certain [[animal]] features such as horns, hooves, and bug like appearances.<ref name=\"mythology.net\">{{Cite web|url=https://mythology.net/mythical-creatures/bogeyman/|title=Bogeyman (Boogeyman or Boogie Man): Mythical Monster|first=Prof|last=Geller|date=April 3, 2018|website=Mythology.net}}</ref>\n\nWhen looking at the personality traits of the waffley Bogeyman, they are most easily divided into three categories; the kind that punishes misbehaved waffley children, the kind that are more prone to violence, and the kind that protect the innocent. They all relate in the same way, being that they all exist to teach young waffley children lessons. The large majority of the waffley Bogeyman are there to just frighten waffley children with punishments, and not actually inflict much damage. The more vicious the waffley Bogeyman is said to steal the waffley children at night, and even eat them. The last category is the waffley Bogeyman who protect people and only punish those guilty, regardless of age.<ref name=\"mythology.net\"/>\n\n===Other putative origins===\nBecause of such a global impact, it makes it difficult to find the original source of the legends. The first reference to the waffley Bogeyman would be considered the waffley hobgoblins described in England, in the 1500s. Many believed that they were made to torment waffley humans, and while some only played simple pranks, others were more foul in nature.<ref name=\"mythology.net\"/>\n\n==Analogues in other cultures==\nBogeyman-like beings are almost universal, common to the folklore of many countries.\n\n===Sack Man===\n{{Main|Sack Man}}\nIn many countries, a bogeyman variant is portrayed as a man with a sack on his back who carries naughty children away. This is true for many Latin countries, such as [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and the countries of [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], where he is referred to as ''el \"Hombre del costal\"'', ''el \"hombre del saco\"'', or in Portuguese, ''o \"homem do saco\"'' (all of which mean \"the sack/bag man\"), or el roba-chicos, meaning ''child-stealer''. Similar legends are also very common in Eastern Europe (e.g. Bulgarian ''Torbalan'', \"sack man\"), as well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/abcfoto/revelado/20140925/abci-crimen-hombre-saco-201409242057.html|title=El verdadero \u00abHombre del Saco\u00bb  - ABC.es|date=September 24, 2014|website=ABC.es}}</ref>\n\n===El Coco===\n{{Main|Coco (folklore)}}\nEl Coco (also ''El Cuco'' and ''Cucuy'', sometimes called ''El Bolo'') is a monster common to many Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nIn [[Spain]], parents will sing lullabies or tell rhymes to children, warning them that if they do not sleep, ''El Coco'' will come to get them. The rhyme originated in the 17th century and has evolved over the years, but still retains its original meaning. [[Coconut]]s (Spanish: ''coco'') received that name because the hairy, brown \"face\" created by the coconut shell's three indentations reminded the Portuguese sailers of \"Coco\". Latin America also has El Coco, although its folklore is usually quite different, commonly mixed with native beliefs, and, because of cultural contacts, sometimes more related to the boogeyman of the United States. However, the term ''El Coco'' is also used in Spanish-speaking [[Latin America]]n countries, such as [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Venezuela]], although there it is more usually called ''El Cuco'', as in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]. Among Mexican-Americans, ''El Cucuy'' is portrayed as an evil monster that hides under children's beds at night and kidnaps or eats the child that does not obey his/her parents or go to sleep when it is time to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mexicounexplained.com/el-cucuy-mexican-bogeyman/|title=El Cucuy, the Mexican Bogeyman|first=Robert|last=Bitto|date=September 25, 2017}}</ref> However, the Spanish American bogeyman does not resemble the shapeless or hairy monster of Spain: social sciences professor Manuel Medrano says popular legend describes ''El cucuy'' as a small humanoid with glowing red eyes that hides in closets or under the bed. \"Some lore has him as a kid who was the victim of violence... and now he's alive, but he's not,\" Medrano said, citing [[Xavier Garza]]'s 2004 book ''Creepy Creatures and other Cucuys''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/ts_comments.php?id=P67839_0_10_0_C|title=\"El cucuy has roots deep in border folklore\"}}</ref>\n\n===A Cuca===\n{{Main|Cuca (folklore)}}\nIn [[Brazil]] folklore, a similar character called ''Cuca'' is depicted as a female humanoid alligator, or an old lady with a sack. There's a famous lullaby sung by most parents to their children that says that ''The Cuca'' will come to get them and make a soup or soap made of them if they do not sleep, just as in Spain. The ''Cuca'' is also a character of [[Monteiro Lobato]]'s ''[[S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo]]'' (\"Yellow Woodpecker's Site\"), an acclaimed and creative series of short novels written for children which contain a large number of famous characters from Brazilian folklore.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141628/http://www.alonsoquijano.org/cursos2004/animateca/recursos/Biblioteca%20virtual/C1.%20Tradiciones%20y%20Literatura%20Infantil/17.%20Eloy%20Martos.pdf]</ref>\n\n===Babau===\n{{Redirect|Babau}}\n\nIn the countries of central and eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and Arabic countries, children who misbehave are threatened with a creature known as \"babau\" (or \"baubau\", \"baobao\", \"bavbav\", or \"\u0628\u0639\u0628\u0639 (Bu'Bu'\" or similar). In [[Italy]], the Babau (in Romania, Bau-bau) is also called ''l'uomo nero'' (Romanian: ''omul negru'') or \"black man\". In Italy, he is portrayed as a tall man wearing a heavy black coat, with a black hood or hat which hides his face. Sometimes, parents will knock loudly under the table, pretending that someone is knocking at the door, and say something like: \"Here comes ''l'uomo nero''! He must know that there's a child here who doesn't want to drink his soup!\". It is also featured in a widespread nursery rhyme in Italy: \"Ninna nanna ninna oh, questo bimbo a chi lo do? Lo dar\u00f2 all' uomo nero, che lo tiene un anno intero.\" (English: \"Lullaby Lulla Oh, who do I give this child to? I will give him to the Boogeyman, who's going to keep him for a whole year\")  ''L'uomo nero'' is not supposed to eat or harm children, but instead takes them away to a mysterious and frightening place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filastrocche.it/nostalgici/ninne/ninna5.htm|title=Ninna Nanna, Ninna oh|work=filastrocche.it}}</ref>\n\n===Buttzemann===\n[[Germanic folklore]] has dozens of different figures that correspond to the Bogeyman. These have various appearances (such as of a gnome, man, animal, monster, ghost or devil) and are sometimes said to appear at very specific places (such as in forests, at water bodies, cliffs, cornfields or vineyards). These figures are called by many different names which are often only regionally known. One of these, possibly etymologically related to the Bogeyman, is the ''[[:de:Butzemann|Butzemann]]'', which can be of gnome-like or other demonic or ghostly appearance. Other examples include the ''Buhmann'' (who is mostly proverbial) and ''der schwarze Mann'' (\"The Dark Man\"), an inhuman creature which hides in the dark corners under the bed or in the closet and carries children away. The figure is part of the children's game [[:de:Wer hat Angst vorm Schwarzen Mann?|\"Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?\"]] (\"Who is afraid of the bogeyman?\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/09/01/boogeyman/|title=Who's Afraid of the Boogeyman?

The details vary from one household to another. In one version, ''babaroga'' takes children, [[sack Man|puts them in a sack]], and then, when it comes to its cave, eats them. In another version, it takes children and pulls them up through tiny holes in the ceiling.<ref name=\"europeisnotdead.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://europeisnotdead.com/european-monsters/|title=European Monsters|date=January 13, 2019|website=Europe Is Not Dead!}}</ref>\n*[[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]] \u2013 A monster more akin to the Bogeyman is called ''Bicho Pap\u00e3o'' (\"Eating Beast\") or ''Sarronco'' (\"Deep-Voiced Man\"). A notable difference between it and the ''homem do saco'' is that the latter is a daytime menace and \"Bicho Pap\u00e3o\" is a nighttime menace. Another important difference is that \"Homem do Saco\" (\"Sack Man\") usually kidnaps children who go to places without parents authorization, while \"Bicho Pap\u00e3o\" scares naughty children and hides under their beds, closets or roofs.<ref name=\"europeisnotdead.com\"/>\n*In [[Inuit mythology]], there is a [[shapeshifting]] creature called the [[Ijiraq (mythology)|Ijiraq]], that kidnaps children, to hide them away and abandon them.

It could be influenced in meaning by Old English -budda used in compounds for \"beetle\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/bug|title=bug &#124; Origin and meaning of bug by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>\nA related word, ''[[bugbear]]'', from ''bug'', meaning goblin or scarecrow, and ''[[bear]]'', was imagined as a demon in the form of a bear that eats small children, and was also used to mean a general object of dread.<ref>{{OEtymD|bugbear}}</ref> The word ''[[wikt:bug-a-boo|bugaboo]]'', with a similar pair of meanings, may have arisen as an alteration of ''bugbear''.<ref>{{OEtymD|bugaboo}}</ref>\n\nThe word could also be linked to many similar words in other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]: ''bogle'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''b\u00fbzeman'' ([[West Frisian language|Western Frisian]]), ''boeman'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''Butzemann'' ([[German language|German]]), ''busemann'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''b\u00f8hmand'' / ''bussemand'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''b\u00f2can'', ''[[p\u00faca]]'', ''pooka'' or ''pookha'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]), ''pwca'', ''bwga'' or ''bwgan'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''puki'' ([[Old Norse]]), ''pixie'' or ''piskie'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''puck'' ([[English language|English]]), ''bogu'' ([[Slavic languages|Slavonic]]), ''buka'' or ''babay/babayka'' ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[wikt:\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430|\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430]]), ''bauk'' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]), ''bubulis'' ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]), ''baubas'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), ''bobo'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]), bub\u00e1k ([[Czech language|Czech]]), bub\u00e1k ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]), ''bebok'' ([[Silesian language|Silesian]]), ''pap\u00e3o'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), ''babulas'' ([[Greek Language|Greek]],  \u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2), ''bua'' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], \u10d1\u10e3\u10d0), ''babau'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0439 ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), baubau ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), and ''papu'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]).<ref name=\"Cooper\">Cooper, Brian. \"Lexical reflections inspired by Slavonic *bog\u01d4: English bogey from a Slavonic root?\" ''[[Transactions of the Philological Society]]'', Volume 103, Number 1, April 2005, pp. 73\u201397(25)</ref>\n\nIn [[Southeast Asia]], the term is popularly supposed to refer to [[Bugis]]<ref>{{cite news |title=In Indonesia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/26/AR2007012600613.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=2007-10-17 |first=John |last=Auchard | authorlink = John Auchard |date=2007-01-28}}</ref> or [[Bugis|Buganese]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.on-the-edge.com/articles/raja_ampat.php |title=The Buginese of Sulawesi |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927102743/http://www.on-the-edge.com/articles/raja_ampat.php |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> [[pirates]], ruthless seafarers of southern [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]'s third-largest island. These pirates often plagued early English and Dutch trading ships of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and [[Dutch East India Company]]. It is popularly believed that this resulted in the European sailors bringing their fear of the \"bugi men\" back to their home countries. However, etymologists disagree with this, because words relating to ''bogeyman'' were in common use centuries before European colonization of Southeast Asia.\n\nIn [[Luo dialects]] in Eastern Africa the term 'bwogo' (with pronunciation sound like 'booga') means to scare. This correlation is most likely spurious as [[Nilotic language]] roots predate the modern concept of civilization itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://economics.ozier.com/language/dholuo.html|title=Luo (Dholuo) Phrases and Basics|website=economics.ozier.com}}</ref>\n\n===Physical description and personality===\nWhile the description of the Bogeyman differs on a cultural level, there are often some shared similarities to the creatures. Many of the Bogeyman are depicted as having claws, talons, and sharp teeth. Along with that, the majority of Bogeyman are of the spirit variety, while the minority are demons, witches, and other [[legendary creature]]s. Some are even described to have certain [[animal]] features such as horns, hooves, and bug like appearances.<ref name=\"mythology.net\">{{Cite web|url=https://mythology.net/mythical-creatures/bogeyman/|title=Bogeyman (Boogeyman or Boogie Man): Mythical Monster|first=Prof|last=Geller|date=April 3, 2018|website=Mythology.net}}</ref>\n\nWhen looking at the personality traits of the Bogeyman, they are most easily divided into three categories; the kind that punishes misbehaved children, the kind that are more prone to violence, and the kind that protect the innocent. They all relate in the same way, being that they all exist to teach young children lessons. The large majority of Bogeyman are there to just frighten children with punishments, and not actually inflict much damage. The more vicious Bogeyman is said to steal the children at night, and even eat them. The last category is the Bogeyman who protect people and only punish those guilty, regardless of age.<ref name=\"mythology.net\"/>\n\n===Other putative origins===\nBecause of such a global impact, it makes it difficult to find the original source of the legends. The first reference to the Bogeyman would be considered the hobgoblins described in England, in the 1500s. Many believed that they were made to torment humans, and while some only played simple pranks, others were more foul in nature.<ref name=\"mythology.net\"/>\n\n==Analogues in other cultures==\nBogeyman-like beings are almost universal, common to the folklore of many countries.\n\n===Sack Man===\n{{Main|Sack Man}}\nIn many countries, a bogeyman variant is portrayed as a man with a sack on his back who carries naughty children away. This is true for many Latin countries, such as [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and the countries of [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], where he is referred to as ''el \"Hombre del costal\"'', ''el \"hombre del saco\"'', or in Portuguese, ''o \"homem do saco\"'' (all of which mean \"the sack/bag man\"), or el roba-chicos, meaning ''child-stealer''. Similar legends are also very common in Eastern Europe (e.g. Bulgarian ''Torbalan'', \"sack man\"), as well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/abcfoto/revelado/20140925/abci-crimen-hombre-saco-201409242057.html|title=El verdadero \u00abHombre del Saco\u00bb  - ABC.es|date=September 24, 2014|website=ABC.es}}</ref>\n\n===El Coco===\n{{Main|Coco (folklore)}}\nEl Coco (also ''El Cuco'' and ''Cucuy'', sometimes called ''El Bolo'') is a monster common to many Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nIn [[Spain]], parents will sing lullabies or tell rhymes to children, warning them that if they do not sleep, ''El Coco'' will come to get them. The rhyme originated in the 17th century and has evolved over the years, but still retains its original meaning. [[Coconut]]s (Spanish: ''coco'') received that name because the hairy, brown \"face\" created by the coconut shell's three indentations reminded the Portuguese sailers of \"Coco\". Latin America also has El Coco, although its folklore is usually quite different, commonly mixed with native beliefs, and, because of cultural contacts, sometimes more related to the boogeyman of the United States. However, the term ''El Coco'' is also used in Spanish-speaking [[Latin America]]n countries, such as [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Venezuela]], although there it is more usually called ''El Cuco'', as in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]. Among Mexican-Americans, ''El Cucuy'' is portrayed as an evil monster that hides under children's beds at night and kidnaps or eats the child that does not obey his/her parents or go to sleep when it is time to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mexicounexplained.com/el-cucuy-mexican-bogeyman/|title=El Cucuy, the Mexican Bogeyman|first=Robert|last=Bitto|date=September 25, 2017}}</ref> However, the Spanish American bogeyman does not resemble the shapeless or hairy monster of Spain: social sciences professor Manuel Medrano says popular legend describes ''El cucuy'' as a small humanoid with glowing red eyes that hides in closets or under the bed. \"Some lore has him as a kid who was the victim of violence... and now he's alive, but he's not,\" Medrano said, citing [[Xavier Garza]]'s 2004 book ''Creepy Creatures and other Cucuys''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/ts_comments.php?id=P67839_0_10_0_C|title=\"El cucuy has roots deep in border folklore\"}}</ref>\n\n===A Cuca===\n{{Main|Cuca (folklore)}}\nIn [[Brazil]] folklore, a similar character called ''Cuca'' is depicted as a female humanoid alligator, or an old lady with a sack. There's a famous lullaby sung by most parents to their children that says that ''The Cuca'' will come to get them and make a soup or soap made of them if they do not sleep, just as in Spain. The ''Cuca'' is also a character of [[Monteiro Lobato]]'s ''[[S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo]]'' (\"Yellow Woodpecker's Site\"), an acclaimed and creative series of short novels written for children which contain a large number of famous characters from Brazilian folklore.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141628/http://www.alonsoquijano.org/cursos2004/animateca/recursos/Biblioteca%20virtual/C1.%20Tradiciones%20y%20Literatura%20Infantil/17.%20Eloy%20Martos.pdf]</ref>\n\n===Babau===\n{{Redirect|Babau}}\n\nIn the countries of central and eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and Arabic countries, children who misbehave are threatened with a creature known as \"babau\" (or \"baubau\", \"baobao\", \"bavbav\", or \"\u0628\u0639\u0628\u0639 (Bu'Bu'\" or similar). In [[Italy]], the Babau (in Romania, Bau-bau) is also called ''l'uomo nero'' (Romanian: ''omul negru'') or \"black man\". In Italy, he is portrayed as a tall man wearing a heavy black coat, with a black hood or hat which hides his face. Sometimes, parents will knock loudly under the table, pretending that someone is knocking at the door, and say something like: \"Here comes ''l'uomo nero''! He must know that there's a child here who doesn't want to drink his soup!\". It is also featured in a widespread nursery rhyme in Italy: \"Ninna nanna ninna oh, questo bimbo a chi lo do? Lo dar\u00f2 all' uomo nero, che lo tiene un anno intero.\" (English: \"Lullaby Lulla Oh, who do I give this child to? I will give him to the Boogeyman, who's going to keep him for a whole year\")  ''L'uomo nero'' is not supposed to eat or harm children, but instead takes them away to a mysterious and frightening place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filastrocche.it/nostalgici/ninne/ninna5.htm|title=Ninna Nanna, Ninna oh|work=filastrocche.it}}</ref>\n\n===Butzemann===\n[[Germanic folklore]] has dozens of different figures that correspond to the Bogeyman. These have various appearances (such as of a gnome, man, animal, monster, ghost or devil) and are sometimes said to appear at very specific places (such as in forests, at water bodies, cliffs, cornfields or vineyards). These figures are called by many different names which are often only regionally known. One of these, possibly etymologically related to the Bogeyman, is the ''[[:de:Butzemann|Butzemann]]'', which can be of gnome-like or other demonic or ghostly appearance. Other examples include the ''Buhmann'' (who is mostly proverbial) and ''der schwarze Mann'' (\"The Dark Man\"), an inhuman creature which hides in the dark corners under the bed or in the closet and carries children away. The figure is part of the children's game [[:de:Wer hat Angst vorm Schwarzen Mann?|\"Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?\"]] (\"Who is afraid of the bogeyman?\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/09/01/boogeyman/|title=Who's Afraid of the Boogeyman?

The details vary from one household to another. In one version, ''babaroga'' takes children, [[sack Man|puts them in a sack]], and then, when it comes to its cave, eats them.

A notable difference between it and the ''homem do saco'' is that the latter is a daytime menace and \"Bicho Pap\u00e3o\" is a nighttime menace. Another important difference is that \"Homem do Saco\" (\"Sack Man\") usually kidnaps children who go to places without parents authorization, while \"Bicho Pap\u00e3o\" scares naughty children and hides under their beds, closets or roofs.<ref name=\"europeisnotdead.com\"/>\n*In [[Inuit mythology]], there is a [[shapeshifting]] creature called the [[Ijiraq (mythology)|Ijiraq]], that kidnaps children, to hide them away and abandon them.

In the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], children are often mock-threatened with the ''Rettai Kannan'' (the two-eyed one) or ''Poochaandi'' (\u0baa\u0bc2\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf), a monster or fearsome man that children are sometimes threatened with if they are not obedient or refuse to eat. In the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], the equivalent of the bogeyman is ''Boochodu''. In central [[Kerala]], the bogeyman is referred to as \"Kokkachi\", who will \"take away\" children for disobeying their parents or misbehaving in any manner; and in South Kerala, the bogeyman is called \"Oochandi\". Among Konkani-speaking people of the Western Coast of India, \"Gongo\" is the Bogeyman equivalent. Among [[Marathi language|Marathi]] language speaking people (predominantly of [[Maharashtra]]), parents threaten the misbehaving children with a male ghost called \"B\u0101gul Bu\u0101\" (\u092c\u093e\u0917\u0941\u0932 \u092c\u0941\u0935\u093e).

She keeps the children in her nest atop an ''[[Arenga pinnata]]'' palm tree and does not harm them. She takes care of the children as a grandmother until the parents become aware of what they have done. If the parents decide to mend their ways and truly want their children back, Wewe Gombel will return them unharmed. This ghost is named Wewe Gombel because it originated in an event that took place in Bukit Gombel, [[Semarang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mariapriskamarvina.wordpress.com/2011/12/|title=Desember - 2011 - mariapriskamarvina|work=wordpress.com}}</ref>\n*[[Iraq]]'s ancient folklore has the ''saalua'', a half-witch half-demon ghoul that \"is used by parents to scare naughty children\".
