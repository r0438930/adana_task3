All the water reaching the delta is ultimately [[evaporated]] and [[transpiration|transpired]] and does not flow into any sea or ocean. Each year, about {{Convert|11|km3|}} of water spread over the {{Convert|6000-15000|km2||abbr=on|adj=on}} area. Some flood waters drain into [[Lake Ngami]].<ref name=Keen/> The area was once part of [[Lake Makgadikgadi]], an ancient lake that had mostly dried up by the early [[Holocene]].<ref name=McCarthy1 />\n\nThe [[Moremi Game Reserve]], a [[list of national parks of Botswana|National Park]], is on the eastern side of the Delta. The Delta was named as one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of Africa]], which were officially declared on 11 February 2013 in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sevennaturalwonders.org/africa|title=Seven Natural Wonders of Africa \u2013 Seven Natural Wonders|website=sevennaturalwonders.org|access-date=22 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221103510/http://sevennaturalwonders.org/africa/|archive-date=21 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  On 22 June 2014, the Okavango Delta became the 1000th site to be officially inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage List.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1159|title=World Heritage List reaches 1000 sites with inscription of Okavango Delta in Botswana|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|date=|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1162|title=Twenty six new properties added to World Heritage List at Doha meeting|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|date=|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Gogrph==\n\n===Floods===\n\nThe Okavango is produced by seasonal flooding. The Okavango River drains the summer (January\u2013February) rainfall from the [[Angola]] highlands and the surge flows {{Convert|1200|km||abbr=on}} in around one month. The waters then spread over the {{Convert|250|by|150|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} area of the delta over the next four months (March\u2013June). The high temperature of the delta causes rapid transpiration and evaporation, resulting in a cycle of rising and falling water level that was not fully understood until the early 20th century. The flood peaks between June and August, during [[Botswana]]'s dry winter months, when the delta swells to three times its permanent size, attracting animals from kilometres around and creating one of Africa\u2019s greatest concentrations of [[wildlife]].\n\nThe delta is very flat, with less than {{Convert|2|m||abbr=on}} variation in height across its {{Convert|15,000|km2||abbr=on}}.<ref name=Africa_bespoke/>\n\n===Water flow===\n\nEvery year, about {{Convert|11|km3|e9l mi3 e9usgal|abbr=unit}} of water flow into the delta. Roughly 60% is consumed through [[transpiration]] by plants, 36% by [[evaporation]], 2% percolates into the [[aquifer]] system; and 2% flows into Lake Ngami. This turgid outflow means that the delta is unable to flush out the minerals carried by the river and is liable to become increasingly salty and uninhabitable. Water [[salinity]] is reduced by salt collecting around plant roots as most of the incoming water is transpired by plants. [[Peat fire]]s might contribute to deposit salt into layers below the surface. The low salinity of the water also means that the floods do not greatly enrich the [[floodplain]] with nutrients.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\n===Lagoons===\n[[File:Shinde Lagoon, Okavango Delta, Botswana.jpg|thumb|Shinde Lagoon, seen from the air]]\nWhen the water levels gradually recede, water remains in major canals and river beds, in waterholes and in a number of larger [[lagoon]]s, which then attract increasing numbers of animals. Photo-safari camps and lodges are found near some of these lagoons. Among the larger lagoons are:\n* Dombo Hippo Pool ({{coord|19|12|1.8|S|23|38|25.8|E}})\n* Gcodikwe Lagoon ({{coord|19|9|54|S|23|14|24|E}})\n* Guma Lagoon ({{coord|18|57|52.2|S|22|22|40.8|E}})\n* Jerejere Lagoon/Hippo Pool ({{coord|19|5|16.8|S|23|1|12|E}})\n* Moanachira Lagoon/Sausage Island ({{coord|19|3|23.4|S|23|3|44.3|E}})\n* Moanachira Lagoon ({{coord|19|3|45|S|23|5|24|E}})\n* Shinde Lagoon ({{coord|19|6|18|S|23|9|14.4|E}})\n* Xakanaxa Lagoon ({{coord|19|10|48|S|23|23|42|E}})\n* Xhamu Lagoon ({{coord|19|10|1.2|S|23|16|15.6|E}})\n* Xhobega Lagoon ({{coord|19|11|0.6|S|23|12|25.2|E}})\n* Xugana Lagoon ({{coord|19|4|10.2|S|23|6|0|E}})\n* Zibadiania Lagoon ({{coord|18|34|12|S|23|32|6|E}})\n\n===Salt islands===\nThe agglomeration of salt around plant roots leads to barren white patches in the centre of many of the thousands of islands, which have become too salty to support plants, aside from the odd salt-resistant [[Arecaceae|palm tree]]. Trees and grasses grow in the sand around the edges of the islands that have not become too salty yet.\n\nAbout 70% of the islands began as [[termite]] mounds (often ''[[Macrotermes]]'' spp.), where a tree then takes root on the mound of soil.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\n===Chief's Island===\nChief's Island, the largest island in the delta, was formed by a [[fault line]] which uplifted an area over {{Convert|70|km||long|abbr=on|adj=mid}} and {{Convert|15|km||wide|abbr=on|adj=mid}}. Historically, it was reserved as an exclusive hunting area for the chief. It now provides the core area for much of the resident wildlife when the waters rise.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Okavango Delta.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of delta as floodwaters recede, August 2012]]\nThe Delta's profuse greenery is not the result of a wet climate; rather, it is an [[oasis]] in an arid country. The average annual rainfall is {{Convert|450|mm||abbr=on}} (approximately one third that of its Angolan catchment area) and most of it falls between December and March in the form of heavy afternoon thunderstorms.\n\nDecember to February are hot wet months with daytime temperatures as high as {{Convert|40|C|}}, warm nights, and humidity levels fluctuating between 50 and 80%. From March to May, the temperature becomes far more comfortable with a maximum of {{Convert|30|C|}} during the day and mild to cool nights. The rains quickly dry up leading into the dry, cold winter months of June to August. Daytime temperatures at this time of year are mild to warm, but the temperature begins to fall after sunset. Nights can be surprisingly cold in the delta, with temperatures barely above freezing.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\nThe September to November span has the heat and atmospheric pressure build up once more, as the dry season slides into the rainy season. October is the most challenging month for visitors \u2013 daytime temperatures often push past {{Convert|40|C|}} and the dryness is only occasionally broken by a sudden cloudburst.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\n==Wildlife==\n[[File:Cheetah at Sunset.jpg|right|thumb|A [[East-Southern African cheetah|cheetah]] is silhouetted against a sunset in the delta]]\n\nThe Okavango delta is both a permanent and seasonal home to a wide variety of wildlife which is now a popular tourist attraction.<ref name=jhbradley2/>\n\nSpecies include the [[African bush elephant]], [[lion]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[sitatunga]], [[springbok]], [[common eland]], [[greater kudu]], [[duiker]], [[steenbok]], [[gemsbok]], [[sable antelope]], [[impala]], [[roan antelope]], [[Plains zebra]], [[tsessebe]], [[South African giraffe]], [[red lechwe]], [[African buffalo]], [[hippopotamus]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=T.

It is a bit larger than an [[impala]] with elongated hooves and a water-repellent substance on its legs that enables rapid movement through knee-deep water. Lechwe graze on [[aquatic plant]]s and, like the [[waterbuck]], take to water when threatened by predators. Only the males have horns.\n\n===Plants===\n[[Cyperus papyrus|Papyrus]] and reed rafts make up a large part of the Okavango's vegetation. During the flood season, they float well above the sandy river bed with roots dangling free in the water. This gap between bed and roots is used as shelter by crocodiles.\n\nThe plants of the delta play an important role in providing cohesion for the sand. The banks or levees of a river normally have a high mud content, and this combines with the sand in the river\u2019s load to continuously build up the river banks. In the delta, because the clean waters of the Okavango contain  almost no mud, the river\u2019s load consists almost entirely of sand. The plants capture the sand, acting as the glue and making up for the lack of mud and in the process creating further islands on which more plants can take root.\n\nThis process is not important in the formation of linear islands. They are long and thin and often curved like a gently meandering river, because they are actually the natural banks of old river channels which over time have become blocked up by plant growth and sand deposition, resulting in the river changing course and the old river levees becoming islands. Due to the flatness of the Delta, and the large tonnage of sand flowing into it from the Okavango River, the floor of the delta is slowly but constantly rising. Where channels are today, islands will be tomorrow and then new channels may wash away these existing islands.<ref name=Africa_bespoke_2/>\n\n=== Game lodges ===\n[[File:Tented Lodge in the Okavango Delta.jpg|thumb|Tented Lodge in the Okavango-Delta]]\nThe Botswana Okavango Game Lodges cater to small numbers of guests, each one operating in its own private concession area.

They are Hambukushu (also known as Mbukushu, Bukushu, Bukusu, Mabukuschu, Ghuva, Haghuva), Dceriku (Dxeriku, Diriku, Gciriku, Gceriku, Giriku, Niriku), Wayeyi ([[Bayei]], Bayeyi, Yei), Bugakhwe (Kxoe, Khwe, Kwengo, Barakwena, G/anda) and ||anikhwe (Gxanekwe, //tanekwe, [[River Bushmen]], Swamp Bushmen, G//ani, //ani, Xanekwe). The Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Wayeyi have traditionally engaged in mixed economies of millet/sorghum agriculture, fishing, hunting, the collection of wild plant foods, and pastoralism.\n\nThe Bugakhwe and ||anikwhe are [[Bushmen]], who have traditionally practised fishing, hunting, and the collection of wild plant foods; Bugakhwe used both forest and riverine resources, while the ||anikhwe mostly focused on riverine resources. The Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Bugakhwe are present along the Okavango River in Angola and in the [[Caprivi Strip]] of Namibia, and  small numbers of Hambukushu and Bugakhwe are in Zambia, as well. Within the Okavango Delta, over the past 150 years or so, Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Bugakhwe have inhabited the Panhandle and the Magwegqana in the northeastern Delta. ||anikhwe have inhabited the Panhandle and the area along the Boro River through the Delta, as well as the area along the [[Boteti River]].\n\nThe Wayeyi have inhabited the area around [[Seronga]] as well as the southern Delta around [[Maun, Botswana|Maun]], and a few Wayeyi live in their putative ancestral home in the Caprivi Strip. Within the past 20 years many people from all over the Okavango have migrated to Maun, the late 1960s and early 1970s over 4,000 Hambukushu refugees from Angola were settled in the area around [[Etsha]] in the western Panhandle.\n\nThe Okavango Delta has been under the political control of the [[Batawana]] (a [[Tswana people|Tswana]] nation) since the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite paper |first=Moanaphuti |last=Segolodi |title=Ditso Tsa Batawana |date=1940 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12170767/Ditso_Tsa_Batawana_by_Moanaphuti_Segolodi_1940 }}</ref> Led by the house of Mathiba I, the leader of a [[Bangwato]] offshoot, the Batawana established complete control over the delta in the 1850s as the regional ivory trade exploded.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Barry |last=Morton |title=The Hunting Trade and the Reconstruction of Northern Tswana Societies after the Difaqane, 1838\u20131880 |journal=South African Historical Journal |volume=36 |year=1997 |pages=220\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/02582479708671276 }}</ref> Most Batawana, however, have traditionally lived on the edges of the delta, due to the threat that [[tsetse fly]] poses to their cattle.

Since then, the edge of the delta has become increasingly crowded with its growing human and livestock populations.\n[[File:BundPhoto.JPG|thumb|Flood-control bunds for flood recession cropping in the ''molapo'' of the Okavango, Botswana]]\n\n==Molapos==\nAfter the flooding season, the waters in the lower parts of the delta, near the base, recede,  leaving moisture behind in the soil. This residual moisture is used for planting fodder and other crops that can thrive on it. This land is locally known as ''molapo''.\n\nDuring  1974 to 1978, the floods were more intensive than normal and flood recession cropping was not possible, so severe food and fodder shortages occurred. In response, the Molapo Development Project was initiated. It protected the ''molapo'' areas with bunds to control the flooding and prevent severe flooding. The bunds are provided with sluice gates so the stored water can be released and flood recession cropping can start.<ref>[[File:PD-icon.svg|15px|link=|alt=]] {{cite book |first=L.

All the water reaching the delta is ultimately [[evaporated]] and [[transpiration|transpired]] and does not flow into any sea or ocean. Each year, about {{Convert|11|km3|}} of water spread over the {{Convert|6000-15000|km2||abbr=on|adj=on}} area. Some flood waters drain into [[Lake Ngami]].<ref name=Keen/> The area was once part of [[Lake Makgadikgadi]], an ancient lake that had mostly dried up by the early [[Holocene]].<ref name=McCarthy1 />\n\nThe [[Moremi Game Reserve]], a [[list of national parks of Botswana|National Park]], is on the eastern side of the Delta.

The Okavango River drains the summer (January\u2013February) rainfall from the [[Angola]] highlands and the surge flows {{Convert|1200|km||abbr=on}} in around one month. The waters then spread over the {{Convert|250|by|150|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} area of the delta over the next four months (March\u2013June). The high temperature of the delta causes rapid transpiration and evaporation, resulting in a cycle of rising and falling water level that was not fully understood until the early 20th century. The flood peaks between June and August, during [[Botswana]]'s dry winter months, when the delta swells to three times its permanent size, attracting animals from kilometres around and creating one of Africa\u2019s greatest concentrations of [[wildlife]].\n\nThe delta is very flat, with less than {{Convert|2|m||abbr=on}} variation in height across its {{Convert|15,000|km2||abbr=on}}.<ref name=Africa_bespoke/>\n\n===Water flow===\n\nEvery year, about {{Convert|11|km3|e9l mi3 e9usgal|abbr=unit}} of water flow into the delta. Roughly 60% is consumed through [[transpiration]] by plants, 36% by [[evaporation]], 2% percolates into the [[aquifer]] system; and 2% flows into Lake Ngami. This turgid outflow means that the delta is unable to flush out the minerals carried by the river and is liable to become increasingly salty and uninhabitable. Water [[salinity]] is reduced by salt collecting around plant roots as most of the incoming water is transpired by plants. [[Peat fire]]s might contribute to deposit salt into layers below the surface. The low salinity of the water also means that the floods do not greatly enrich the [[floodplain]] with nutrients.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\n===Lagoons===\n[[File:Shinde Lagoon, Okavango Delta, Botswana.jpg|thumb|Shinde Lagoon, seen from the air]]\nWhen the water levels gradually recede, water remains in major canals and river beds, in waterholes and in a number of larger [[lagoon]]s, which then attract increasing numbers of animals. Photo-safari camps and lodges are found near some of these lagoons. Among the larger lagoons are:\n* Dombo Hippo Pool ({{coord|19|12|1.8|S|23|38|25.8|E}})\n* Gcodikwe Lagoon ({{coord|19|9|54|S|23|14|24|E}})\n* Guma Lagoon ({{coord|18|57|52.2|S|22|22|40.8|E}})\n* Jerejere Lagoon/Hippo Pool ({{coord|19|5|16.8|S|23|1|12|E}})\n* Moanachira Lagoon/Sausage Island ({{coord|19|3|23.4|S|23|3|44.3|E}})\n* Moanachira Lagoon ({{coord|19|3|45|S|23|5|24|E}})\n* Shinde Lagoon ({{coord|19|6|18|S|23|9|14.4|E}})\n* Xakanaxa Lagoon ({{coord|19|10|48|S|23|23|42|E}})\n* Xhamu Lagoon ({{coord|19|10|1.2|S|23|16|15.6|E}})\n* Xhobega Lagoon ({{coord|19|11|0.6|S|23|12|25.2|E}})\n* Xugana Lagoon ({{coord|19|4|10.2|S|23|6|0|E}})\n* Zibadiania Lagoon ({{coord|18|34|12|S|23|32|6|E}})\n\n===Salt islands===\nThe agglomeration of salt around plant roots leads to barren white patches in the centre of many of the thousands of islands, which have become too salty to support plants, aside from the odd salt-resistant [[Arecaceae|palm tree]]. Trees and grasses grow in the sand around the edges of the islands that have not become too salty yet.\n\nAbout 70% of the islands began as [[termite]] mounds (often ''[[Macrotermes]]'' spp.), where a tree then takes root on the mound of soil.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\n===Chief's Island===\nChief's Island, the largest island in the delta, was formed by a [[fault line]] which uplifted an area over {{Convert|70|km||long|abbr=on|adj=mid}} and {{Convert|15|km||wide|abbr=on|adj=mid}}. Historically, it was reserved as an exclusive hunting area for the chief. It now provides the core area for much of the resident wildlife when the waters rise.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Okavango Delta.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of delta as floodwaters recede, August 2012]]\nThe Delta's profuse greenery is not the result of a wet climate; rather, it is an [[oasis]] in an arid country. The average annual rainfall is {{Convert|450|mm||abbr=on}} (approximately one third that of its Angolan catchment area) and most of it falls between December and March in the form of heavy afternoon thunderstorms.\n\nDecember to February are hot wet months with daytime temperatures as high as {{Convert|40|C|}}, warm nights, and humidity levels fluctuating between 50 and 80%. From March to May, the temperature becomes far more comfortable with a maximum of {{Convert|30|C|}} during the day and mild to cool nights. The rains quickly dry up leading into the dry, cold winter months of June to August. Daytime temperatures at this time of year are mild to warm, but the temperature begins to fall after sunset. Nights can be surprisingly cold in the delta, with temperatures barely above freezing.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\nThe September to November span has the heat and atmospheric pressure build up once more, as the dry season slides into the rainy season. October is the most challenging month for visitors \u2013 daytime temperatures often push past {{Convert|40|C|}} and the dryness is only occasionally broken by a sudden cloudburst.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\n==Wildlife==\n[[File:Cheetah at Sunset.jpg|right|thumb|A [[East-Southern African cheetah|cheetah]] is silhouetted against a sunset in the delta]]\n\nThe Okavango delta is both a permanent and seasonal home to a wide variety of wildlife which is now a popular tourist attraction.<ref name=jhbradley2/>\n\nSpecies include the [[African bush elephant]], [[lion]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[sitatunga]], [[springbok]], [[common eland]], [[greater kudu]], [[duiker]], [[steenbok]], [[gemsbok]], [[sable antelope]], [[impala]], [[roan antelope]], [[Plains zebra]], [[tsessebe]], [[South African giraffe]], [[red lechwe]], [[African buffalo]], [[hippopotamus]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=T.

It is a bit larger than an [[impala]] with elongated hooves and a water-repellent substance on its legs that enables rapid movement through knee-deep water. Lechwe graze on [[aquatic plant]]s and, like the [[waterbuck]], take to water when threatened by predators. Only the males have horns.\n\n===Plants===\n[[Cyperus papyrus|Papyrus]] and reed rafts make up a large part of the Okavango's vegetation. During the flood season, they float well above the sandy river bed with roots dangling free in the water. This gap between bed and roots is used as shelter by crocodiles.\n\nThe plants of the delta play an important role in providing cohesion for the sand. The banks or levees of a river normally have a high mud content, and this combines with the sand in the river\u2019s load to continuously build up the river banks. In the delta, because the clean waters of the Okavango contain  almost no mud, the river\u2019s load consists almost entirely of sand. The plants capture the sand, acting as the glue and making up for the lack of mud and in the process creating further islands on which more plants can take root.\n\nThis process is not important in the formation of linear islands. They are long and thin and often curved like a gently meandering river, because they are actually the natural banks of old river channels which over time have become blocked up by plant growth and sand deposition, resulting in the river changing course and the old river levees becoming islands. Due to the flatness of the Delta, and the large tonnage of sand flowing into it from the Okavango River, the floor of the delta is slowly but constantly rising. Where channels are today, islands will be tomorrow and then new channels may wash away these existing islands.<ref name=Africa_bespoke_2/>\n\n=== Game lodges ===\n[[File:Tented Lodge in the Okavango Delta.jpg|thumb|Tented Lodge in the Okavango-Delta]]\nThe Botswana Okavango Game Lodges cater to small numbers of guests, each one operating in its own private concession area.

They are Hambukushu (also known as Mbukushu, Bukushu, Bukusu, Mabukuschu, Ghuva, Haghuva), Dceriku (Dxeriku, Diriku, Gciriku, Gceriku, Giriku, Niriku), Wayeyi ([[Bayei]], Bayeyi, Yei), Bugakhwe (Kxoe, Khwe, Kwengo, Barakwena, G/anda) and ||anikhwe (Gxanekwe, //tanekwe, [[River Bushmen]], Swamp Bushmen, G//ani, //ani, Xanekwe). The Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Wayeyi have traditionally engaged in mixed economies of millet/sorghum agriculture, fishing, hunting, the collection of wild plant foods, and pastoralism.\n\nThe Bugakhwe and ||anikwhe are [[Bushmen]], who have traditionally practised fishing, hunting, and the collection of wild plant foods; Bugakhwe used both forest and riverine resources, while the ||anikhwe mostly focused on riverine resources. The Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Bugakhwe are present along the Okavango River in Angola and in the [[Caprivi Strip]] of Namibia, and  small numbers of Hambukushu and Bugakhwe are in Zambia, as well. Within the Okavango Delta, over the past 150 years or so, Hambukushu, Dceriku, and Bugakhwe have inhabited the Panhandle and the Magwegqana in the northeastern Delta. ||anikhwe have inhabited the Panhandle and the area along the Boro River through the Delta, as well as the area along the [[Boteti River]].\n\nThe Wayeyi have inhabited the area around [[Seronga]] as well as the southern Delta around [[Maun, Botswana|Maun]], and a few Wayeyi live in their putative ancestral home in the Caprivi Strip. Within the past 20 years many people from all over the Okavango have migrated to Maun, the late 1960s and early 1970s over 4,000 Hambukushu refugees from Angola were settled in the area around [[Etsha]] in the western Panhandle.\n\nThe Okavango Delta has been under the political control of the [[Batawana]] (a [[Tswana people|Tswana]] nation) since the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite paper |first=Moanaphuti |last=Segolodi |title=Ditso Tsa Batawana |date=1940 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12170767/Ditso_Tsa_Batawana_by_Moanaphuti_Segolodi_1940 }}</ref> Led by the house of Mathiba I, the leader of a [[Bangwato]] offshoot, the Batawana established complete control over the delta in the 1850s as the regional ivory trade exploded.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Barry |last=Morton |title=The Hunting Trade and the Reconstruction of Northern Tswana Societies after the Difaqane, 1838\u20131880 |journal=South African Historical Journal |volume=36 |year=1997 |pages=220\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/02582479708671276 }}</ref> Most Batawana, however, have traditionally lived on the edges of the delta, due to the threat that [[tsetse fly]] poses to their cattle. During a hiatus of some 40 years, the tsetse fly retreated and most Batawana lived in the swamps from 1896 through the late 1930s. Since then, the edge of the delta has become increasingly crowded with its growing human and livestock populations.\n[[File:BundPhoto.JPG|thumb|Flood-control bunds for flood recession cropping in the ''molapo'' of the Okavango, Botswana]]\n\n==Molapos==\nAfter the flooding season, the waters in the lower parts of the delta, near the base, recede,  leaving moisture behind in the soil. This residual moisture is used for planting fodder and other crops that can thrive on it. This land is locally known as ''molapo''.\n\nDuring  1974 to 1978, the floods were more intensive than normal and flood recession cropping was not possible, so severe food and fodder shortages occurred. In response, the Molapo Development Project was initiated. It protected the ''molapo'' areas with bunds to control the flooding and prevent severe flooding. The bunds are provided with sluice gates so the stored water can be released and flood recession cropping can start.<ref>[[File:PD-icon.svg|15px|link=|alt=]] {{cite book |first=L.
