As early as 10,000 to 20,000 years ago during the late [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period of the [[Stone Age]] (also known as the Old Stone Age) there were already human beings living and multiplying here. In 282, the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] government established magistrate rule here.\n\n===Mongol-Manchu===\nDuring the first twenty-three years of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1206\u22121368), Funingzhou ({{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5be7\u5dde}} H\u00f3k-n\u00ecng-ci\u016d) Administration was set up. In 1736, during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], Ningde was promoted to Funingfu ({{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5be7\u5e9c}} H\u00f3k-n\u00ecng-h\u016b) Administration.\n\n===Republican===\nIn 1934, an Administration Supervision Zone was set up here under the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the Fu'an Special Administration Zone was established. Finally in June 1971 the Zone was promoted to Ningde Prefecture. [[Xi Jinping]] served as party chief of Ningde between 1988 and 1990.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nSituated roughly {{convert|300|km}} north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the prefecture of Ningde spans {{convert|13500|km\u00b2}} in land area. Like the rest of the province, Ningde sits in a mountainous region but it also enjoys almost {{convert|200|km}} of [[coastline]] facing the [[East China Sea]].\n\nIt is subjected to a [[humid subtropical climate]], with occasional threat of [[typhoon]]s. Within the prefecture, the mean annual temperature ranges from {{convert|13.4|to|20.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, while mean annual [[rainfall]] ranges from {{convert|1250|to|2350|mm|in}}. The region also enjoys a [[frost]]-free period of 235 to 300 days per year, which is highly beneficial for soil agriculture.\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|collapsed = Y\n|location = Ningde (1981\u22122010)\n|Jan high C = 14.2\n|Feb high C = 14.9\n|Mar high C = 17.4\n|Apr high C = 22.0\n|May high C = 26.2\n|Jun high C = 29.8\n|Jul high C = 33.4\n|Aug high C = 32.5\n|Sep high C = 30.0\n|Oct high C = 26.0\n|Nov high C = 21.4\n|Dec high C = 16.6\n|Jan mean C = 10.6\n|Feb mean C = 11.2\n|Mar mean C = 13.5\n|Apr mean C = 17.9\n|May mean C = 22.4\n|Jun mean C = 26.1\n|Jul mean C = 29.3\n|Aug mean C = 28.7\n|Sep mean C = 26.3\n|Oct mean C = 22.3\n|Nov mean C = 17.7\n|Dec mean C = 12.7\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 8.2\n|Feb low C = 8.7\n|Mar low C = 10.7\n|Apr low C = 15.0\n|May low C = 19.5\n|Jun low C = 23.3\n|Jul low C = 26.2\n|Aug low C = 25.8\n|Sep low C = 23.5\n|Oct low C = 19.3\n|Nov low C = 14.9\n|Dec low C = 9.9\n|Jan record high C = 25.4 |Jan record low C = -0.3\n|Feb record high C = 28.7 |Feb record low C = 1.4\n|Mar record high C = 30.9 |Mar record low C = 2.2\n|Apr record high C = 33.9 |Apr record low C = 7.3\n|May record high C = 36.1 |May record low C = 13.4\n|Jun record high C = 38.2 |Jun record low C = 16.4\n|Jul record high C = 40.2 |Jul record low C = 21.2\n|Aug record high C = 37.8 |Aug record low C = 21.5\n|Sep record high C = 37.5 |Sep record low C = 15.6\n|Oct record high C = 32.7 |Oct record low C = 10.7\n|Nov record high C = 32.4 |Nov record low C = 5.5\n|Dec record high C = 26.2 |Dec record low C = -1.4\n|year high C=  |year low C= \n|year high F = |year low F =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 77.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 110.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 175.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 169.8\n|May precipitation mm = 223.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 283.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 196.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 295.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 243.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 83.7\n|Nov precipitation mm = 75.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 62.5\n|Jan humidity = 76\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 79\n|Apr humidity = 78\n|May humidity = 78\n|Jun humidity = 80\n|Jul humidity = 75\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 71\n|Nov humidity = 73\n|Dec humidity = 74\n|source 1 = [http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html China Meteorological Data Service Center]\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nThe warm and moist climate and fertile land in the prefecture of Ningde provide it with favorable conditions for agriculture. The largest agricultural exports from Ningde include [[mushroom]] and [[tea]]. The area also produces large quantities of various fruits, such as [[Pomelo|shaddocks]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]]s, [[plum]]s, [[honey peach]]es, [[lychee]]s and [[longan]]s.\n\nTea cultivation has long been an important industry of Ningde. By 1999 statistics, the total area of tea plantations in Ningde had reached {{convert|463|km\u00b2}} and the output of [[green tea]] took up 10.5 percent of that of the entire country. More than 1.2 million jobs were created directly and indirectly in different stages of the tea industry. Famous brands include the Tianshan Silver-Needle Tea, Baihao Silver-Needle Tea, Fenghuangshe, Lianyue Flower Tea and Xianyan Snow Peak.\n\nThe mountainous landscape and advantageous climate conditions are also beneficial to the development of [[forestry]]. Up to 1999, {{convert|8482|km\u00b2}}, or 65.2 percent of the entire prefecture, are forested. Out of this area, [[bamboo]] groves occupy {{convert|600|km\u00b2}}, producing an annual output of six million bamboo products. In [[Fu'an]] alone, the green bamboo base has extended to {{convert|34|km\u00b2}} and its output of green [[bamboo shoot]]s takes up more than 60 percent of the entire provincial output.\n\n====Aquaculture====\n\nThe prefecture of Ningde is blessed with vast area of shallow sea, which is suitable for [[aquaculture]]. In 2000, aquatic products take up 41.3 percent of the total output value of agriculture from Ningde, with an exporting value of US$82,170,000 and an annual [[net income]] exceeding [[Renminbi|RMB]] 3,500 for local fishermen. Major products include [[Sciaenidae|yellow croaker]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Pacific Razor Clam|razor clam]]s, [[prawn]]s and freshwater [[eel]]s.\n\nLocal government is attempting to use aquaculture as a springboard to eliminate poverty and improve the local economy. Up to 2000, aquaculture had created 370,000 jobs directly and indirectly; a total of RMB 4.5 billion had been invested, drawing an annual output value of RMB 2 billion.\n\n===Industry===\n\n====Primary====\n\nNingde is the producer of many nonmetallic mineral resources, such as [[granite]], [[diorite]] and [[basalt]]. The confirmed volume of granite reserves extends to 1,140 million cubic meters, while estimated amount of deposits undiscovered stands at several thousand million cubic meters. The mining area for basalt in Bailin, [[Fuding]], known as Fuding Black, covers {{convert|0.21|km2}} with a total deposit of up to 50 million cubic meters.\n\n====Secondary====\n\nNingde's rich hydropower resources give it a headstart in metallurgical industries. Products such as [[magnesium]], [[zirconium oxide]], [[aluminum]], high-purity [[silicon carbide]], and a series of other [[silicon]] products from plants in the prefecture enjoy high reputation and are exempted from examination when exported to [[Japan]]. Advances in metallurgical technology also aids the [[shipbuilding]] industry, a traditional trade in Ningde. In recent years, local shipyards have been capable of constructing 10,000-ton steamships.\n\nFrom its many agricultural produces sprouted the long-running [[food processing]] industry in Ningde. New techniques and formula adopted in recent years have allowed products such as tea, fruits and vegetables, mushrooms and marine products to be exported to the international market.\n\n[[Ningde Nuclear Power Plant]]\n\n[[Image:Old Houses Jiaocheng District Ningde.jpg|thumb|260px|An old district in urban Ningde City.

Among them ''bantieji'' parade ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u642c\u94c1\u6280}}), [[puppet lion dance]], and [[Chinese paper art|paper art]] are the most representative.\n\nThe ''bantieji'' parade, mostly seen during the [[Chinese new year]], is a folk art performance popularized in Ningde since the [[Qing Dynasty]]. During the parade, children dressed as characters from various [[Chinese folklore]] sit or stand on parade vehicles, which were also decorated to resemble classic scenes such as the Heavenly Palace. The vehicles then cruise along the streets in the company of jovial music.\n\nThe puppet lion dance, popular in [[Huotong Town]] and [[Jiaocheng District]], originated from toys of the local children. The lions, made of colorful fabrics, are connected to wooden racks by ropes. Each individual rope controls a part of the lion's body, such as the head, tail or foot. The racks are set on vehicles moving through the streets. Performers on the vehicles pull on the ropes to make the lions dance or perform various tricks.\n\nPaper art, mainly practised by women, is a specialty of [[Zherong County]]. Common forms of the art include traditional flower patterns, words and daily life objects. Because of her paper art achievements, Zherong County was named \"Home of Chinese Folk Arts\" by the Ministry of Culture in 2000.\n\nThe [[She people]] have also created and left many precious cultural heritages in their long historical practice. Owing to projects in recent years to protect the She heritage, three volumes of She folk tales, songs and proverbs have been published. In total, 184 tales, 330,000 words in songs, and 6,000 proverbs have been included. Art works have also been produced out of She folklore, which reflects their way of life.\n\nThere are many [[covered bridge]]s in Ningde, particularly in Pingnan.<ref>[http://amoymagic.mts.cn/Mysticquanzhou/bridges.htm Fujian Bridges] amoymagic Retrieved 2010-05-02.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External

As early as 10,000 to 20,000 years ago during the late [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period of the [[Stone Age]] (also known as the Old Stone Age) there were already human beings living and multiplying here. In 282, the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] government established magistrate rule here.\n\n===Mongol-Manchu===\nDuring the first twenty-three years of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1206\u22121368), Funingzhou ({{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5be7\u5dde}} H\u00f3k-n\u00ecng-ci\u016d) Administration was set up. In 1736, during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], Ningde was promoted to Funingfu ({{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5be7\u5e9c}} H\u00f3k-n\u00ecng-h\u016b) Administration.\n\n===Republican===\nIn 1934, an Administration Supervision Zone was set up here under the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the Fu'an Special Administration Zone was established. Finally in June 1971 the Zone was promoted to Ningde Prefecture. [[Xi Jinping]] served as party chief of Ningde between 1988 and 1990.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nSituated roughly {{convert|300|km}} north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the prefecture of Ningde spans {{convert|13500|km\u00b2}} in land area. Like the rest of the province, Ningde sits in a mountainous region but it also enjoys almost {{convert|200|km}} of [[coastline]] facing the [[East China Sea]].\n\nIt is subjected to a [[humid subtropical climate]], with occasional threat of [[typhoon]]s. Within the prefecture, the mean annual temperature ranges from {{convert|13.4|to|20.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, while mean annual [[rainfall]] ranges from {{convert|1250|to|2350|mm|in}}. The region also enjoys a [[frost]]-free period of 235 to 300 days per year, which is highly beneficial for soil agriculture.\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|collapsed = Y\n|location = Ningde (1981\u22122010)\n|Jan high C = 14.2\n|Feb high C = 14.9\n|Mar high C = 17.4\n|Apr high C = 22.0\n|May high C = 26.2\n|Jun high C = 29.8\n|Jul high C = 33.4\n|Aug high C = 32.5\n|Sep high C = 30.0\n|Oct high C = 26.0\n|Nov high C = 21.4\n|Dec high C = 16.6\n|Jan mean C = 10.6\n|Feb mean C = 11.2\n|Mar mean C = 13.5\n|Apr mean C = 17.9\n|May mean C = 22.4\n|Jun mean C = 26.1\n|Jul mean C = 29.3\n|Aug mean C = 28.7\n|Sep mean C = 26.3\n|Oct mean C = 22.3\n|Nov mean C = 17.7\n|Dec mean C = 12.7\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 8.2\n|Feb low C = 8.7\n|Mar low C = 10.7\n|Apr low C = 15.0\n|May low C = 19.5\n|Jun low C = 23.3\n|Jul low C = 26.2\n|Aug low C = 25.8\n|Sep low C = 23.5\n|Oct low C = 19.3\n|Nov low C = 14.9\n|Dec low C = 9.9\n|Jan record high C = 25.4 |Jan record low C = -0.3\n|Feb record high C = 28.7 |Feb record low C = 1.4\n|Mar record high C = 30.9 |Mar record low C = 2.2\n|Apr record high C = 33.9 |Apr record low C = 7.3\n|May record high C = 36.1 |May record low C = 13.4\n|Jun record high C = 38.2 |Jun record low C = 16.4\n|Jul record high C = 40.2 |Jul record low C = 21.2\n|Aug record high C = 37.8 |Aug record low C = 21.5\n|Sep record high C = 37.5 |Sep record low C = 15.6\n|Oct record high C = 32.7 |Oct record low C = 10.7\n|Nov record high C = 32.4 |Nov record low C = 5.5\n|Dec record high C = 26.2 |Dec record low C = -1.4\n|year high C=  |year low C= \n|year high F = |year low F =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 77.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 110.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 175.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 169.8\n|May precipitation mm = 223.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 283.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 196.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 295.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 243.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 83.7\n|Nov precipitation mm = 75.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 62.5\n|Jan humidity = 76\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 79\n|Apr humidity = 78\n|May humidity = 78\n|Jun humidity = 80\n|Jul humidity = 75\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 71\n|Nov humidity = 73\n|Dec humidity = 74\n|source 1 = [http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html China Meteorological Data Service Center]\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nThe warm and moist climate and fertile land in the prefecture of Ningde provide it with favorable conditions for agriculture. The largest agricultural exports from Ningde include [[mushroom]] and [[tea]]. The area also produces large quantities of various fruits, such as [[Pomelo|shaddocks]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]]s, [[plum]]s, [[honey peach]]es, [[lychee]]s and [[longan]]s.\n\nTea cultivation has long been an important industry of Ningde. By 1999 statistics, the total area of tea plantations in Ningde had reached {{convert|463|km\u00b2}} and the output of [[green tea]] took up 10.5 percent of that of the entire country. More than 1.2 million jobs were created directly and indirectly in different stages of the tea industry. Famous brands include the Tianshan Silver-Needle Tea, Baihao Silver-Needle Tea, Fenghuangshe, Lianyue Flower Tea and Xianyan Snow Peak.\n\nThe mountainous landscape and advantageous climate conditions are also beneficial to the development of [[forestry]]. Up to 1999, {{convert|8482|km\u00b2}}, or 65.2 percent of the entire prefecture, are forested. Out of this area, [[bamboo]] groves occupy {{convert|600|km\u00b2}}, producing an annual output of six million bamboo products. In [[Fu'an]] alone, the green bamboo base has extended to {{convert|34|km\u00b2}} and its output of green [[bamboo shoot]]s takes up more than 60 percent of the entire provincial output.\n\n====Aquaculture====\n\nThe prefecture of Ningde is blessed with vast area of shallow sea, which is suitable for [[aquaculture]]. In 2000, aquatic products take up 41.3 percent of the total output value of agriculture from Ningde, with an exporting value of US$82,170,000 and an annual [[net income]] exceeding [[Renminbi|RMB]] 3,500 for local fishermen. Major products include [[Sciaenidae|yellow croaker]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Pacific Razor Clam|razor clam]]s, [[prawn]]s and freshwater [[eel]]s.\n\nLocal government is attempting to use aquaculture as a springboard to eliminate poverty and improve the local economy. Up to 2000, aquaculture had created 370,000 jobs directly and indirectly; a total of RMB 4.5 billion had been invested, drawing an annual output value of RMB 2 billion.\n\n===Industry===\n\n====Primary====\n\nNingde is the producer of many nonmetallic mineral resources, such as [[granite]], [[diorite]] and [[basalt]]. The confirmed volume of granite reserves extends to 1,140 million cubic meters, while estimated amount of deposits undiscovered stands at several thousand million cubic meters. The mining area for basalt in Bailin, [[Fuding]], known as Fuding Black, covers {{convert|0.21|km2}} with a total deposit of up to 50 million cubic meters.\n\n====Secondary====\n\nNingde's rich hydropower resources give it a headstart in metallurgical industries. Products such as [[magnesium]], [[zirconium oxide]], [[aluminum]], high-purity [[silicon carbide]], and a series of other [[silicon]] products from plants in the prefecture enjoy high reputation and are exempted from examination when exported to [[Japan]]. Advances in metallurgical technology also aids the [[shipbuilding]] industry, a traditional trade in Ningde. In recent years, local shipyards have been capable of constructing 10,000-ton steamships.\n\nFrom its many agricultural produces sprouted the long-running [[food processing]] industry in Ningde. New techniques and formula adopted in recent years have allowed products such as tea, fruits and vegetables, mushrooms and marine products to be exported to the international market.\n\n[[Ningde Nuclear Power Plant]]\n\n[[Image:Old Houses Jiaocheng District Ningde.jpg|thumb|260px|An old district in urban Ningde City. Like many other [[China|Chinese]] cities, Ningde is developing fast economically and old houses like these are giving way to new, modern buildings.]]\n\n==Demographics==\n\nAccording to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Census]], Ningde has a [[Permanent residency|registered population]] of 3,393,698 inhabitants, although 2,821,996 persons declared to be permanent residents.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} Compilation by LianXin website. [http://www.luqyu.cn/tongjishow.asp?tid=1013 Data from the Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China]</ref> It is also the primary residential region for the [[She people|She minority people]], who take up to 25% of the total population.\nA majority of the population speak [[Eastern Min]].\n\n==Culture==\nThe folk arts in Ningde are varied and colorful. Among them ''bantieji'' parade (\u642c\u94c1\u6280), [[puppet lion dance]], and [[Chinese paper art|paper art]] are the most representative.\n\nThe ''bantieji'' parade, mostly seen during the [[Chinese new year]], is a folk art performance popularized in Ningde since the [[Qing Dynasty]]. During the parade, children dressed as characters from various [[Chinese folklore]] sit or stand on parade vehicles, which were also decorated to resemble classic scenes such as the Heavenly Palace. The vehicles then cruise along the streets in the company of jovial music.\n\nThe puppet lion dance, popular in [[Huotong Town]] and [[Jiaocheng District]], originated from toys of the local children. The lions, made of colorful fabrics, are connected to wooden racks by ropes. Each individual rope controls a part of the lion's body, such as the head, tail or foot. The racks are set on vehicles moving through the streets. Performers on the vehicles pull on the ropes to make the lions dance or perform various tricks.\n\nPaper art, mainly practised by women, is a specialty of [[Zherong County]]. Common forms of the art include traditional flower patterns, words and daily life objects. Because of her paper art achievements, Zherong County was named \"Home of Chinese Folk Arts\" by the Ministry of Culture in 2000.\n\nThe [[She people]] have also created and left many precious cultural heritages in their long historical practice. Owing to projects in recent years to protect the She heritage, three volumes of She folk tales, songs and proverbs have been published. In total, 184 tales, 330,000 words in songs, and 6,000 proverbs have been included. Art works have also been produced out of She folklore, which reflects their way of life.\n\nThere are many [[covered bridge]]s in Ningde, particularly in Pingnan.<ref>[http://amoymagic.mts.cn/Mysticquanzhou/bridges.htm Fujian Bridges] amoymagic Retrieved 2010-05-02.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070812121039/http://www.nds.gov.cn/  Ningde Government Website]\n*[http://www.stats-fjnd.gov.cn/index.asp Ningde Bureau of Statistics]\n{{Commons category|Ningde|position=left}}\n\n{{Fujian topics}}\n{{Fujian}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ningde| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Fujian]]\n[[Category:Prefecture-level divisions of Fujian]]\n", "name_user": "CaradhrasAiguo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningde"}
