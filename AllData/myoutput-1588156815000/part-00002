In 2003, guitarist Rory Clewlow joined the band to complete its current lineup, and it adopted its current name. In 2006, they performed to a growing fanbase at [[Download Festival]] as well as a sold-out concert at the [[London Astoria]]. Their debut studio album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released in 2007 and reached number 4 in the [[UK Albums Chart|Official UK Album Chart]], and has since been certified gold in the UK. Their second, ''[[Common Dreads]]'', was released in 2009 and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 16;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/albums.shtml |title=Radio 1 \u2013 The Official Chart with Reggie Yates \u2013 The Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> while their third, ''[[A Flash Flood of Colour]]'', was released in 2012 and debuted on the chart at number 4. Both have since been certified silver in the UK. The band spent a considerable amount of time supporting the latter release through the [[A Flash Flood of Colour World Tour]], before beginning work on a fourth studio album, ''[[The Mindsweep]]'', which was released in 2015. Their fifth studio album ''[[The Spark (album)|The Spark]]'' was released in 2017. Their sixth album ''[[Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible]]'' was released in April 2020.\n\nEnter Shikari have their own record label, Ambush Reality. However, they have also signed distribution deals with several major labels to help with worldwide distribution. Their eclectic musical style combines influences from rock music genres with those from various [[electronic music]] genres.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Beginnings (1999\u20132006) ===\n\nIn 1999 a band named Hybryd formed, consisting of Rou Reynolds on guitar and vocals, Chris Batten on bass guitar, and Rob Rolfe on drums. They released an EP called ''[[Commit No Nuisance]]'', which featured the tracks \"Perfect Pygmalion\", \"Look Inside\", \"Torch Song\", \"Honesty Box\" and \"Fake\". In 2003, with the addition of guitarist Rory Clewlow, Hybryd became Enter Shikari. The band was named after ''Shikari'', a boat belonging to vocalist Rou Reynolds' uncle. \"Shikari is a [[Hindi]] word for hunter.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Access All Areas.net.au |url=http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |title=Enter Shikari &#124; Artist Interviews |publisher=Access All Areas |accessdate=12 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304025238/http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |archivedate=4 March 2011 }}</ref> After the band's lineup and name change, Reynolds focused his musical efforts on vocals and electronics instead of guitar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enter Shikari: Unplugged & Personal|url=https://headlinermagazine.net/headliners/enter-shikari-unplugged-and-personal.html|website=Headliner Magazine|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2003 and 2004, the band released three demo EPs (''[[Nodding Acquaintance]]'', ''[[Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour EP|Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour]]'' and ''[[Sorry You're Not a Winner EP|Sorry You're Not a Winner]]'') that were available from their gigs and their website, featuring original versions of some songs that were eventually rerecorded for their debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]''. They had another demo EP planned for release in 2005 (no such EP materialized, although recordings surfaced online). For this the first versions of \"Return To Energiser\" and \"Labyrinth\" were recorded. Early versions of \"OK Time for Plan B\" and \"We Can Breathe in Space\" were also recorded around this time but it's unclear if these were destined for the EP. It was at this time that Kerrang! Radio's Alex Baker picked up on the band, and as he didn't have a physical release to play, he streamed \"OK Time For Plan B\" off the band's Myspace page, straight onto the airwaves.\n\nIn August 2006 they released a video of the single \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\" which became the single of the week on the [[iTunes Store]]. Their 1st physical single featured re-recorded versions of \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which had previously been featured on one of the demo EPs. It was released on 30 October 2006. It was limited to 1000 copies of each format and sold out within the first week of release. In mid January 2007, Enter Shikari's first single, \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\", entered the UK singles chart for one week at number 151, on Downloads only (despite its physical formats not being eligible for charts [at the band's request]). This was followed a week later by \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which charted at number 182 on the singles chart (despite its physical formats being ineligible for charts [at the band's request]) and number 146 in the Download Chart. In addition \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\" featured on the [[EA Sports]] video game titles [[NHL 08]] and [[Madden 08]]. Enter Shikari secured a spot on the Gibson/Myspace stage at 2006's [[Download Festival#Download 2006|Download Festival]].\n\nThey also had interviews with popular music press such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Rock Sound]]''. On 4 November 2006, they became only the second unsigned band to ever sell out [[London Astoria]] (the first being [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]]).\n\nThey also made the ''[[NME]]'''s \"New Noise 2007\", a list of the bands it considers most likely to achieve success in the coming year (previous years lists have included the likes of [[Arcade Fire]], [[Hot Chip]] and [[Bloc Party]]).\n\nThe next single released was \"[[Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour]]\", on 5 March 2007. This was the band's second single to be released from their forthcoming debut album. It contained a re-recorded version of the song \"Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour\". It reached 27 in the Official UK chart.\n\nThe band released a compilation album titled ''[[The Zone (Enter Shikari)|The Zone]]'' just before the debut album, this contained various demo tracks and previously released singles.\n\n=== ''Take to the Skies'' (2007\u201308) ===\n{{main|Take to the Skies}}\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released on 19 March 2007 and on 25 March it reached number 4 in the UK Official Album Charts.

So much happened over those two years [since the release of their previous album], globally and in my personal life, so before. I was kind of comfortable. I have a very finely attuned cringe muscle, I don\u2019t like writing about things that have been written about a thousand times.

In 2006, they performed to a growing fanbase at [[Download Festival]] as well as a sold-out concert at the [[London Astoria]]. Their debut studio album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released in 2007 and reached number 4 in the [[UK Albums Chart|Official UK Album Chart]], and has since been certified gold in the UK. Their second, ''[[Common Dreads]]'', was released in 2009 and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 16;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/albums.shtml |title=Radio 1 \u2013 The Official Chart with Reggie Yates \u2013 The Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> while their third, ''[[A Flash Flood of Colour]]'', was released in 2012 and debuted on the chart at number 4. Both have since been certified silver in the UK. The band spent a considerable amount of time supporting the latter release through the [[A Flash Flood of Colour World Tour]], before beginning work on a fourth studio album, ''[[The Mindsweep]]'', which was released in 2015. Their fifth studio album ''[[The Spark (album)|The Spark]]'' was released in 2017. Their sixth album ''[[Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible]]'' was released in April 2020.\n\nEnter Shikari have their own record label, Ambush Reality. However, they have also signed distribution deals with several major labels to help with worldwide distribution. Their eclectic musical style combines influences from rock music genres with those from various [[electronic music]] genres.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Beginnings (1999\u20132006) ===\n\nIn 1999 a band named Hybryd formed, consisting of Rou Reynolds on guitar and vocals, Chris Batten on bass guitar, and Rob Rolfe on drums. They released an EP called ''[[Commit No Nuisance]]'', which featured the tracks \"Perfect Pygmalion\", \"Look Inside\", \"Torch Song\", \"Honesty Box\" and \"Fake\". In 2003, with the addition of guitarist Rory Clewlow, Hybryd became Enter Shikari. The band was named after ''Shikari'', a boat belonging to vocalist Rou Reynolds' uncle. \"Shikari is a [[Hindi]] word for hunter.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Access All Areas.net.au |url=http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |title=Enter Shikari &#124; Artist Interviews |publisher=Access All Areas |accessdate=12 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304025238/http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |archivedate=4 March 2011 }}</ref> After the band's lineup and name change, Reynolds focused his musical efforts on vocals and electronics instead of guitar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enter Shikari: Unplugged & Personal|url=https://headlinermagazine.net/headliners/enter-shikari-unplugged-and-personal.html|website=Headliner Magazine|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2003 and 2004, the band released three demo EPs (''[[Nodding Acquaintance]]'', ''[[Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour EP|Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour]]'' and ''[[Sorry You're Not a Winner EP|Sorry You're Not a Winner]]'') that were available from their gigs and their website, featuring original versions of some songs that were eventually rerecorded for their debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]''. They had another demo EP planned for release in 2005 (no such EP materialized, although recordings surfaced online). For this the first versions of \"Return To Energiser\" and \"Labyrinth\" were recorded. Early versions of \"OK Time for Plan B\" and \"We Can Breathe in Space\" were also recorded around this time but it's unclear if these were destined for the EP. It was at this time that Kerrang! Radio's Alex Baker picked up on the band, and as he didn't have a physical release to play, he streamed \"OK Time For Plan B\" off the band's Myspace page, straight onto the airwaves.\n\nIn August 2006 they released a video of the single \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\" which became the single of the week on the [[iTunes Store]]. Their 1st physical single featured re-recorded versions of \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which had previously been featured on one of the demo EPs. It was released on 30 October 2006. It was limited to 1000 copies of each format and sold out within the first week of release. In mid January 2007, Enter Shikari's first single, \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\", entered the UK singles chart for one week at number 151, on Downloads only (despite its physical formats not being eligible for charts [at the band's request]). This was followed a week later by \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which charted at number 182 on the singles chart (despite its physical formats being ineligible for charts [at the band's request]) and number 146 in the Download Chart. In addition \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\" featured on the [[EA Sports]] video game titles [[NHL 08]] and [[Madden 08]]. Enter Shikari secured a spot on the Gibson/Myspace stage at 2006's [[Download Festival#Download 2006|Download Festival]].\n\nThey also had interviews with popular music press such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Rock Sound]]''. On 4 November 2006, they became only the second unsigned band to ever sell out [[London Astoria]] (the first being [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]]).\n\nThey also made the ''[[NME]]'''s \"New Noise 2007\", a list of the bands it considers most likely to achieve success in the coming year (previous years lists have included the likes of [[Arcade Fire]], [[Hot Chip]] and [[Bloc Party]]).\n\nThe next single released was \"[[Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour]]\", on 5 March 2007. This was the band's second single to be released from their forthcoming debut album. It contained a re-recorded version of the song \"Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour\". It reached 27 in the Official UK chart.\n\nThe band released a compilation album titled ''[[The Zone (Enter Shikari)|The Zone]]'' just before the debut album, this contained various demo tracks and previously released singles.\n\n=== ''Take to the Skies'' (2007\u201308) ===\n{{main|Take to the Skies}}\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released on 19 March 2007 and on 25 March it reached number 4 in the UK Official Album Charts.

So much happened over those two years [since the release of their previous album], globally and in my personal life, so before. I was kind of comfortable.
