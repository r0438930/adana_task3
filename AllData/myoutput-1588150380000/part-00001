It is {{convert|2.7|mi|km}} long and has four lanes. The contract for construction was awarded in 2004 and it opened in December 2008. The freeway consists of two direct access ramps which are convenient for travelers coming to and from Houston. One of these ramps provides southbound travelers from I-45 with direct access to the bypass (flying over I-45 in a three-tier stack configuration), and the other provides travelers with the opportunity to merge onto I-45 northbound without encountering any traffic signals. Motorists coming from Galveston (I-45 northbound) have to encounter a traffic signal at Kobayashi Road before experiencing the uninterrupted flow of the freeway. The freeway bypasses much of the congestion in inner-city Webster, giving easy access to Johnson Space Center.{{cn|date=November 2011}}\n\n==Major junctions==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=<ref name=\"Google distances\"/>|state=TX|county=Harris}}\n{{TXint\n|location=Webster\n|lspan=6\n|mile=0.0\n|road={{jct|state=TX|I|45|dir1=north|city1=Houston}}\n|notes=I-45 exit 24; western terminus; direct access to northbound I-45}}\n{{TXint\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=0.3\n|road=Kobayashi Road<br/>{{jct|state=TX|I|45|dir1=south|city1=Galveston}}\n|notes=Westbound exit; access to southbound I-45 via frontage road}}\n{{TXint\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=1.0\n|road={{jct|state=TX|SH|3}}\n|notes=Eastbound exit and westbound entrance}}\n{{TXint\n|mile=1.9\n|road={{jct|state=TX|FM|270|name1=Egret Bay Boulevard}} / NASA Parkway / El Camino Real\n|notes=Eastbound exit and entrance}}\n{{TXint\n|mile=1.9\n|road={{jct|state=TX|to1=to|SH|3}} / Sarah Deel Drive / NASA Parkway\n|notes=Westbound exit and entrance}}\n{{TXint\n|mile=2.4\n|road={{jct|state=TX|FM|270|name1=Egret Bay Boulevard}} / El Camino Real\n|notes=Westbound exit and entrance.
