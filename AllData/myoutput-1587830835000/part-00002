The objective is to [[Obfuscation|conceal the words]] from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to [[Latin language|Latin]] is a deliberate [[misnomer]]; Pig Latin is simply a form of [[argot]] or [[jargon]] unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.\n\n==Origins and history==\nEarly mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:<ref>{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin? | access-date=2016-01-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204224225/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | archive-date=2016-02-04 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.<br>\n'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. | ''Love's Labour's Lost'', William Shakespeare}}\n\nAn 1866 article describes a \"hog latin\" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin.

'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing,\" although the jargon is dog Latin.\n\n''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: \"They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with.\"\n\nThe modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\".<ref>'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129214016/http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ |date=2016-01-29 }}<br/>The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing \u201cPig Latin Love\u201d. The Subtitle \u201cI-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\u201d indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, \u201c(I love you dearie)\u201d, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn\u2019t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given.  A few months prior in 1934, in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short film]] ''[[Washee Ironee]]'', Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126140403/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s |archive-date=2016-11-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>  [[Ginger Rogers]] sang a verse of [[We're in the Money]] in pig Latin in an elaborate [[Busby Berkeley]] production number in the film [[Gold Diggers of 1933]],  ({{cite video|title=Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin |quote=YouTube}}).

But in different parts of the world, there are different 'dialects' of sorts. Some people may add 'way' or just 'ay' or other endings. Examples are:\n*\"eat\" = \"eatyay\" or \"eatay\"\n*\"omelet\" = \"omeletyay\" or \"omeletay\"\n*\"are\" = \"areyay\" or \"areay\"\n*\"egg\" = \"eggyay\" or \"eggay\"\n*\"explain\" = \"explainyay\"\n*\"always\" = \"alwaysyay\" or \"alwaysay\"\n*\"ends\" = \"endsyay\" or \"endsay\"\n*\"honest\" = \"honestyay\"\n*\"I\"= \"Iyay\"\n\nAn alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:\n*\"every\" = \"eryevay\"\n*\"another\" = \"otheranay\"\n*\"under\" = \"erunday\"\n*\"island\" = \"andislay\"\n*\"elegant\" = \"egantelay\"\n\nSentence structure remains the same as it would in [[English language|English]]. [[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.<!--emma  = emmway\nPlease do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra).

In Cyprus, there was a similar language game that involved the pattern verevereve, varavarava vuruvuruvu, etc; the vowel depends on the vowel that precedes the pattern. \n\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspr\u00e5ket (\"Fig language\" \u2013 see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game \u00a7 List of common language games]]).\n\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Min\u00e4 rakastan sinua\") would result in \"kon\u00e4 mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Serbo-Croatian]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called \"\u0160atra\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atra}}) or \"[[\u0160atrova\u010dki]]\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atrovat\u0361\u0283ki}}) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the slang name for [[marijuana]] (''trava'', meaning \"grass\" \u2014 [[accusative case]] ''travu'') becomes ''vutra''; the slang name for [[cocaine]] (''belo'' \u2014 meaning \"white\") turns to ''lobe'', a [[pistol]] (''pi\u0161tolj'') turns to ''\u0161toljpi'', [[brother|bro]] ([[vocative case]] ''brate'') becomes ''tebra''. In the past few years it has become widely used among teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.\n\nIn [[Spanish language]], [[Jeringonza]] (or Jeringoso) is a language game used in Spain and all over [[Hispanic America]]. It consists of adding the letter ''p'' after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, ''Carlos'' turns into ''C\u00e1par-lopos''. Variants of this language game add other syllables instead of p+vowel, such as adding ''ti'', ''cuti'' or ''chi'' before each syllable (thus giving ''ticar-tilos'' for the previous example).\n\n[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louch\u00e9bem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louch\u00e9bem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : D\u00e9finition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235148/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=live}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larl\u00e9pem largomuche du louch\u00e9bem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienqu\u00e8s''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louch\u00e9bem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en louced\u00e9''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with.\"\n\nThe modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\".<ref>'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129214016/http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ |date=2016-01-29 }}<br/>The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing \u201cPig Latin Love\u201d. The Subtitle \u201cI-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\u201d indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, \u201c(I love you dearie)\u201d, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn\u2019t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too.

But in different parts of the world, there are different 'dialects' of sorts. Some people may add 'way' or just 'ay' or other endings. Examples are:\n*\"eat\" = \"eatyay\" or \"eatay\"\n*\"omelet\" = \"omeletyay\" or \"omeletay\"\n*\"are\" = \"areyay\" or \"areay\"\n*\"egg\" = \"eggyay\" or \"eggay\"\n*\"explain\" = \"explainyay\"\n*\"always\" = \"alwaysyay\" or \"alwaysay\"\n*\"ends\" = \"endsyay\" or \"endsay\"\n*\"honest\" = \"honestyay\"\n*\"I\"= \"Iyay\"\n\nAn alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words.

In Cyprus, there was a similar language game that involved the pattern verevereve, varavarava vuruvuruvu, etc; the vowel depends on the vowel that precedes the pattern. \n\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspr\u00e5ket (\"Fig language\" \u2013 see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game \u00a7 List of common language games]]).\n\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Min\u00e4 rakastan sinua\") would result in \"kon\u00e4 mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Serbo-Croatian]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called \"\u0160atra\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atra}}) or \"[[\u0160atrova\u010dki]]\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atrovat\u0361\u0283ki}}) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the slang name for [[marijuana]] (''trava'', meaning \"grass\" \u2014 [[accusative case]] ''travu'') becomes ''vutra''; the slang name for [[cocaine]] (''belo'' \u2014 meaning \"white\") turns to ''lobe'', a [[pistol]] (''pi\u0161tolj'') turns to ''\u0161toljpi'', [[brother|bro]] ([[vocative case]] ''brate'') becomes ''tebra''. In the past few years it has become widely used among teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.\n\nIn [[Spanish language]], [[Jeringonza]] (or Jeringoso) is a language game used in Spain and all over [[Hispanic America]]. It consists of adding the letter ''p'' after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, ''Carlos'' turns into ''C\u00e1par-lopos''. Variants of this language game add other syllables instead of p+vowel, such as adding ''ti'', ''cuti'' or ''chi'' before each syllable (thus giving ''ticar-tilos'' for the previous example).\n\n[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louch\u00e9bem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louch\u00e9bem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : D\u00e9finition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235148/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=live}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larl\u00e9pem largomuche du louch\u00e9bem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienqu\u00e8s''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louch\u00e9bem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en louced\u00e9''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.
