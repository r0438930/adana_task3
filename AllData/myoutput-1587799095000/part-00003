Eight neighbouring communities are incorporated within its postal district. Established as its own separate parish in 1844 with just a small grouping of homes and farms where the community of [[Old Colwyn]] stands today, Colwyn Bay has expanded to become the second-largest community and business centre in the north of Wales as well as the [[list of urban areas in Wales by population|14th largest]] in the whole of Wales with the urban statistical area\u2014including Old Colwyn, [[Rhos-on-Sea]], and [[Mochdre, Conwy|Mochdre]] and [[Penrhyn Bay]]. having a population of 34,284 at the 2011 census  <ref>https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000408</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:(Pier and Pavillion, Colwyn Bay, Wales) (LOC) (3751644619).jpg|thumb|\"Pier and Pavilion, Colwyn Bay, Wales\", ca. 1890 - 1900.]]\nThe western side of Colwyn Bay, [[Rhos-on-Sea]], includes a number of historic sites associated with St Trillo and [[Ednyfed Fychan]], the 13th century general and councillor to [[Llywelyn the Great]].\n\nThe name 'Colwyn' may be named after 'Collwyn ap Tangno' who was Lord of Eifionnydd, Ardudwy and part of the Ll\u0177n peninsula,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004874860.0001.000/1:14.2?rgn=div2;view=fulltext|title=The history of the parishes of Whiteford, and Holywell:|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512175344/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004874860.0001.000/1:14.2?rgn=div2;view=fulltext|archivedate=12 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> or the River Colwyn in Old Colwyn.\n\n== timothydalton\nGovernment ==\n[[Bay of Colwyn Town Council]] is a statutory body, covering the [[community (Wales)|communities]] in the urban area.

Groes yn Eirias (Welsh:''Cross in Torch'') was once a separate hamlet centred on the Glyn farmhouse (c1640) but the area is now occupied by the Glyn estate and [[Eirias Park]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nAs with the rest of the [[British Isles]], Colwyn Bay experiences a [[maritime climate]] with cool summers and mild winters, and often high winds. The local climate is well known for the prevalence of [[Foehn wind]]s - where winds from the South pass over the nearby mountains and warm and dry on their descent, leading to far higher temperatures than otherwise might be expected; the area held the Welsh high temperature record for February at 18.7&nbsp;\u00b0C from 23 February 2012 to 24 February 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/#?tab=climateExtremes|title=UK climate|first=Met|last=Office|website=www.metoffice.gov.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103004237/https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/#?tab=climateExtremes|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Colwyn Bay 36m asl, 1981-2010 \n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 16.1\n|Feb record high C = 18.7\n|Mar record high C = 21.4\n|Apr record high C = 24.8\n|May record high C = 28.1\n|Jun record high C = 30.3\n|Jul record high C = 33.0\n|Aug record high C = 32.4\n|Sep record high C = 28.3\n|Oct record high C = 27.2\n|Nov record high C = 18.3\n|Dec record high C = 16.4\n|year record high C = 33.0\n|Jan high C = 8.5\n|Feb high C = 8.4\n|Mar high C = 10.3\n|Apr high C = 12.1\n|May high C = 15.2\n|Jun high C = 17.6\n|Jul high C = 19.6\n|Aug high C = 19.4\n|Sep high C = 17.4\n|Oct high C = 14.3\n|Nov high C = 11.1\n|Dec high C = 8.9\n|year high C = 13.6\n|Jan low C = 2.8\n|Feb low C = 2.7\n|Mar low C = 4.1\n|Apr low C = 5.3\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.4\n|Jul low C = 12.5\n|Aug low C = 12.5\n|Sep low C = 10.7\n|Oct low C = 8.1\n|Nov low C = 5.7\n|Dec low C = 3.2\n|year low C = 7.2\n|Jan record low C = -9.9\n|Feb record low C = -7.2\n|Mar record low C = -9.3\n|Apr record low C = -4.2\n|May record low C = -1.7\n|Jun record low C = 2.4\n|Jul record low C = 5.7\n|Aug record low C = 4.0\n|Sep record low C = 0.6\n|Oct record low C = -3.8\n|Nov record low C = -7.3\n|Dec record low C = -10.4\n|year record low C = -10.4\n|Jan precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 53.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 57.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 50.7\n|May precipitation mm = 52.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 56.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 52.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 70.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 96.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 89.8\n|Dec precipitation mm = 90.2\n|year precipitation mm = 808.7\n|Jan sun = 56.2\n|Feb sun = 81.8\n|Mar sun = 115.0\n|Apr sun = 162.8\n|May sun = 209.0\n|Jun sun = 185.6\n|Jul sun = 189.6\n|Aug sun = 174.7\n|Sep sun = 135.2\n|Oct sun = 108.2\n|Nov sun = 59.9\n|Dec sun = 44.1\n|year sun = 1522.0\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/colwyn_bay.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007095626/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/colwyn_bay.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 7 October 2012 | title = Colwyn Bay 1981-2010 averages | accessdate = 24 August 2012 | publisher = [[Met Office]] }}</ref>\n|date=September 2011\n}}\n\n== Demography ==\nPrior to local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974 Colwyn Bay was a [[municipal borough]] with a population of around 25,000, but in 1974 this designation disappeared leaving five separate parishes, known as [[Community (Wales)|communities]] in Wales, of which the one bearing the name Colwyn Bay encompassed just the central part of the overall town and in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] contained just 9,742 people, with the others as follows: [[Mochdre, Conwy|Mochdre]] (1,862), [[Rhos-on-Sea]] (7,110), [[Llansanffraid Glan Conwy|Glan Conwy]] (2,290), [[Old Colwyn]] (7,626) and [[Llysfaen]] (2,652). This gives a total figure for the six communities of 31,382, generally referred to as the population of Colwyn Bay, making it the [[List of urban areas in Wales by population|16th largest urban area in Wales]] and the second largest settlement in [[North Wales]]. Bringing 2011 figures into account that figure is now 33,549.

Established as its own separate parish in 1844 with just a small grouping of homes and farms where the community of [[Old Colwyn]] stands today, Colwyn Bay has expanded to become the second-largest community and business centre in the north of Wales as well as the [[list of urban areas in Wales by population|14th largest]] in the whole of Wales with the urban statistical area\u2014including Old Colwyn, [[Rhos-on-Sea]], and [[Mochdre, Conwy|Mochdre]] and [[Penrhyn Bay]]. having a population of 34,284 at the 2011 census  <ref>https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000408</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:(Pier and Pavillion, Colwyn Bay, Wales) (LOC) (3751644619).jpg|thumb|\"Pier and Pavilion, Colwyn Bay, Wales\", ca. 1890 - 1900.]]\nThe western side of Colwyn Bay, [[Rhos-on-Sea]], includes a number of historic sites associated with St Trillo and [[Ednyfed Fychan]], the 13th century general and councillor to [[Llywelyn the Great]].\n\nThe name 'Colwyn' may be named after 'Collwyn ap Tangno' who was Lord of Eifionnydd, Ardudwy and part of the Ll\u0177n peninsula,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004874860.0001.000/1:14.2?rgn=div2;view=fulltext|title=The history of the parishes of Whiteford, and Holywell:|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512175344/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004874860.0001.000/1:14.2?rgn=div2;view=fulltext|archivedate=12 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> or the River Colwyn in Old Colwyn.\n\n== Government ==\n[[Bay of Colwyn Town Council]] is a statutory body, covering the [[community (Wales)|communities]] in the urban area.

Groes yn Eirias (Welsh:''Cross in Torch'') was once a separate hamlet centred on the Glyn farmhouse (c1640) but the area is now occupied by the Glyn estate and [[Eirias Park]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nAs with the rest of the [[British Isles]], Colwyn Bay experiences a [[maritime climate]] with cool summers and mild winters, and often high winds. The local climate is well known for the prevalence of [[Foehn wind]]s - where winds from the South pass over the nearby mountains and warm and dry on their descent, leading to far higher temperatures than otherwise might be expected; the area held the Welsh high temperature record for February at 18.7&nbsp;\u00b0C from 23 February 2012 to 24 February 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/#?tab=climateExtremes|title=UK climate|first=Met|last=Office|website=www.metoffice.gov.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103004237/https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/#?tab=climateExtremes|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Colwyn Bay 36m asl, 1981-2010 \n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 16.1\n|Feb record high C = 18.7\n|Mar record high C = 21.4\n|Apr record high C = 24.8\n|May record high C = 28.1\n|Jun record high C = 30.3\n|Jul record high C = 33.0\n|Aug record high C = 32.4\n|Sep record high C = 28.3\n|Oct record high C = 27.2\n|Nov record high C = 18.3\n|Dec record high C = 16.4\n|year record high C = 33.0\n|Jan high C = 8.5\n|Feb high C = 8.4\n|Mar high C = 10.3\n|Apr high C = 12.1\n|May high C = 15.2\n|Jun high C = 17.6\n|Jul high C = 19.6\n|Aug high C = 19.4\n|Sep high C = 17.4\n|Oct high C = 14.3\n|Nov high C = 11.1\n|Dec high C = 8.9\n|year high C = 13.6\n|Jan low C = 2.8\n|Feb low C = 2.7\n|Mar low C = 4.1\n|Apr low C = 5.3\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.4\n|Jul low C = 12.5\n|Aug low C = 12.5\n|Sep low C = 10.7\n|Oct low C = 8.1\n|Nov low C = 5.7\n|Dec low C = 3.2\n|year low C = 7.2\n|Jan record low C = -9.9\n|Feb record low C = -7.2\n|Mar record low C = -9.3\n|Apr record low C = -4.2\n|May record low C = -1.7\n|Jun record low C = 2.4\n|Jul record low C = 5.7\n|Aug record low C = 4.0\n|Sep record low C = 0.6\n|Oct record low C = -3.8\n|Nov record low C = -7.3\n|Dec record low C = -10.4\n|year record low C = -10.4\n|Jan precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 53.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 57.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 50.7\n|May precipitation mm = 52.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 56.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 52.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 70.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 96.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 89.8\n|Dec precipitation mm = 90.2\n|year precipitation mm = 808.7\n|Jan sun = 56.2\n|Feb sun = 81.8\n|Mar sun = 115.0\n|Apr sun = 162.8\n|May sun = 209.0\n|Jun sun = 185.6\n|Jul sun = 189.6\n|Aug sun = 174.7\n|Sep sun = 135.2\n|Oct sun = 108.2\n|Nov sun = 59.9\n|Dec sun = 44.1\n|year sun = 1522.0\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/colwyn_bay.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007095626/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/colwyn_bay.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 7 October 2012 | title = Colwyn Bay 1981-2010 averages | accessdate = 24 August 2012 | publisher = [[Met Office]] }}</ref>\n|date=September 2011\n}}\n\n== Demography ==\nPrior to local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974 Colwyn Bay was a [[municipal borough]] with a population of around 25,000, but in 1974 this designation disappeared leaving five separate parishes, known as [[Community (Wales)|communities]] in Wales, of which the one bearing the name Colwyn Bay encompassed just the central part of the overall town and in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] contained just 9,742 people, with the others as follows: [[Mochdre, Conwy|Mochdre]] (1,862), [[Rhos-on-Sea]] (7,110), [[Llansanffraid Glan Conwy|Glan Conwy]] (2,290), [[Old Colwyn]] (7,626) and [[Llysfaen]] (2,652). This gives a total figure for the six communities of 31,382, generally referred to as the population of Colwyn Bay, making it the [[List of urban areas in Wales by population|16th largest urban area in Wales]] and the second largest settlement in [[North Wales]]. Bringing 2011 figures into account that figure is now 33,549.
