Legend says that Goddess Kaali Devi moved here after losing to Lord Siva in the celestial dance contest.\n\nIt was an argument that who is superior, either 'Sivam' (Lord Siva) or Shakthi (Parvathi). In order to resolve thus, they performed a dance program at Chidambaram in front of Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma and other deities.

This \"Oorthuva Taandava\" is one of the posture in the dance. It could not be played by the women folk due to their modesty and shyness. In this Parvathi could not play equally well to this posture and agreed her defeat. She had to go outside the borders of the town in order to contain her haughtiness and to teach a lesson that Sivam and Shakthi are both equally important in our life.\n\n'Thillai Kali' is a deity in anger. This anger was pacified by Brahma by Chanting Veda and also praising her. Because of the penance of Lord Brahma 'Kali' became cool. So that Goddess 'Thillai Amman' in this temple seems with four faces.\n\nThere are two main shrines in this temple. In the first west facing one the goddess is in her benign form called Brahma Chamundeeswari and she has four faces like god Brahma.In the east facing shrine she is in her ferocious form called Thillai Kali.The other important shrines are for goddess Saraswathi in the form called Veena Vidyambigai and for Dakshinamurthy where he has a female form called Kadambavana Dhakshina Rupini.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://temple.dinamalar|title=Thillai Kali|last=|first=|date=|website=Dinamalar Temple|publisher=DINAMALAR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nKali or Durga worship, also known as [[Shaktism]] ,entered into Tamil country from [[Gau\u1e0da (city)|Gauda]] region (present day Bengal) before 7th Century C.E. [[Tantra|Tantric]] rituals were followed during the daily worship in the Kali temples. The situation changed when Cholas were in ascendancy . Cholas embraced Saivism as their religion and the rituals were based on Agamas rather than Tantric tradition. During the reign of Vikrama Chola (1118C.E to 1135 C.E) and his son Kulothunga -II and grandson Rajaraja-II the transition to Saivism was complete and Shaktism was relegated to subordinate role. Shiva the supreme god was also portrayed as the King of Dance (Nataraja) and in the mythology he defeated Kali in the dance competition. The symbolism of the victory of Saivism over Shaktism is unmistakable .\n\nWhen the later Cholas constructed the grand Shiva temple in Chidambaram  it became the center of the town and the Thillai Kali temple location became the outskirts of the town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Origins of Saivam by Dr.A.Padmavathi|last=|first=|publisher=Kumaran Publishers,Chennai|year=2002|isbn=|location=Chennai|pages=Pages 20 to 58}}</ref>\n\nFrom the various inscriptions on temple walls, it appears that the present temple was constructed in the 13th Century C.E by one Kadava Kopperunchingan, a local chieftain.
