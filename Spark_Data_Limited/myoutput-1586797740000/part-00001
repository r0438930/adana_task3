Film criticism began with early film magazines such as ''Katsud\u014d shashinkai'' (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by [[Yasunosuke Gonda]] in 1914, but many early [[film critics]] often focused on chastising the work of studios like [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Tennenshoku Katsud\u014d Shashin|Tenkatsu]] for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from [[kabuki]] and [[shinpa]] such as [[onnagata]]) and for not utilizing what were considered more [[cinematic techniques]] to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the [[Pure Film Movement]], writers in magazines such as ''[[Kinema Record]]'' called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as [[Norimasa Kaeriyama]], went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as ''[[The Glow of Life]]'' (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, [[Harumi Hanayagi]]). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film ''The Captain's Daughter'', [[Masao Inoue (actor)|Masao Inoue]] started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the [[gendaigeki]] and [[scriptwriting]].<ref>See Bernardi.</ref>\n\n===1920s===\nNew studios established around 1920, such as [[Shochiku]] and [[Taikatsu]], aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, [[Thomas Kurihara]] directed films scripted by the novelist [[Junichiro Tanizaki]], who was a strong advocate of film reform.<ref>See Lamarre.</ref> Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of [[Eiz\u014d Tanaka]]. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], whose later works (including ''[[Ugetsu]]''/''Ugetsu Monogatari'') retain a very high reputation.\n\nJapanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of [[movie stars]] and a new style of [[jidaigeki]]. Directors such as [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]] and [[Masahiro Makino]] made [[samurai films]] like ''[[A Diary of Chuji's Travels]]'' and ''[[Roningai]]'' featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes.<ref>{{cite book| last = Thornton| first = S. A.| title = The Japanese Period Film| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-3136-6 }}</ref> Some stars, such as [[Tsumasaburo Bando]], [[Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi]], [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]], [[Takako Irie]] and [[Utaemon Ichikawa]], were inspired by [[Makino Film Productions]] and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], [[Mansaku Itami]] and [[Sadao Yamanaka]] honed their skills. Director [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]] created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece ''[[A Page of Madness]]'', starring Masao Inoue, in 1926.<ref>See Gerow, ''A Page of Madness''.</ref> Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like [[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]], [[Teikine]], and [[Toa Studios]], could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.\n\nWith the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s, there arose so-called [[tendency films]] with left-leaning tendencies. Directors [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]], [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], and [[Tomu Uchida]] were prominent examples. In contrast to these commercially produced [[35mm movie film|35 mm films]], the [[Marxist]] [[Proletarian Film League of Japan]] (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] and [[16 mm film|16mm]]), with more radical intentions.<ref>Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film'', pp. 19\u201347.</ref> Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: ''[[Sakanaya Honda]], [[Jitsuroku Chushingura]], Horaijima, [[Orochi (film)|Orochi]], Maboroshi, [[Kurutta Ippeji]], [[Jujiro]], [[Kurama Tengu: Ky\u014dfu Jidai]]'', and ''Kurama Tengu''.<ref>[[Japanese films of the 1920s]]</ref>\n\nA later version of ''The Captain's Daughter'' was one of the first [[Sound film|talkie]] films. It used the [[Mina Talkie System]]. The Japanese film industry later split into two groups; one retained the Mina Talkie System, while the other used the Iisutofyon Talkie System used to make Tojo Masaki's films.\n\nThe [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 earthquake]], the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's [[humidity]] on flammable and unstable [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:Humanity and Paper Balloons poster.jpg|thumb|Cinema poster for [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s 1937 ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'']]\nUnlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent.<ref>\"[http://filmsound.org/film-sound-history/sound-in-japan.htm The Transition to Sound in Japan]\", Freda Freiberg, Filmsound.org</ref> For instance, [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''An Inn in Tokyo'' (1935), considered a precursor to the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was ''[[Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato]]'' (1930), which used the ''[[Mina Talkie System]]''. Notable talkies of this period include [[Mikio Naruse]]'s ''[[Wife, Be Like A Rose!]]'' (''Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni'', 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' (''Gion no shimai'', 1936); ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936); and ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939); and [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'' (1937).\n\nFilm criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured \"impressionist\" criticism pursued by critics such as [[Tadashi Iijima]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], and [[Matsuo Kishi]] was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genj\u016b Sasa]] who sought an ideological critique of films.<ref name=\"Gerow\">{{cite book|author1=Aaron Gerow|authorlink1=Aaron Gerow|editor1-last=Miyao|editor1-first=Daisuke|editor1-link=Daisuke Miyao|title=The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199731664|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731664.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199731664-e-005|accessdate=27 April 2018|language=en|chapter=Critical Reception: Historical Conceptions of Japanese Film Criticism}}</ref>\n\nThe 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the [[Film Law]], which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing [[propaganda films]] and promoting [[documentary films]] (also called ''bunka eiga'' or \"culture films\"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as [[Fumio Kamei]].<ref>See Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film''.</ref> Realism was in favor; [[film theorist]]s such as [[Taihei Imamura]] and [[Heiichi Sugiyama]] advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]] and [[Tomotaka Tasaka]] produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style.\n\n===1940s===\n\n====Wartime movies====\n[[File:Li_Xianglan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]]]]\n{{further|War film}}\n\nBecause of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.\n\nDuring this period, when Japan was expanding its Empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942 [[Kajiro Yamamoto]]'s film ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]'' or \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.\n\n[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]] was a very popular actress. She rose to international stardom with 22 wartime movies. The [[Manchukuo Film Association]] let her use the Chinese name Li Xianglan so she could represent Chinese roles in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war she used her official Japanese name and starred in an additional 29 movies. She was elected as a member of the [[Japanese parliament]] in the 1970s and served for 18 years.\n\n[[Akira Kurosawa]] made his feature film debut with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]'' in 1943.\n\n====American Occupation====\n[[File:Yoko Sugi and Setsuko Hara in Aoi Sanmyaku.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tadashi Imai]]'s \"[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\" starring [[Y\u014dko Sugi]] and [[Setsuko Hara]] (1949)]]\n\nIn 1945, when Japan was defeated in World War II, the rule of Japan by the SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) began. Movies produced in Japan were managed by GHQ's subordinate organization CIE (Civil Information Educational Section, \u6c11\u9593\u60c5\u5831\u6559\u80b2\u5c40). This management system lasted until 1952, and it was the first time in the Japanese movie world that management and control by a foreign institution was implemented. During the planning and scripting stages it was translated to English, only the movies approved by the CIE were produced. For example, [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s \u201c[[Akatsuki no Dass\u014d]]\u201d (1950) was originally a work depicting a Korean military comfort woman starring [[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]], but with dozens of CIE censorship, it became an original work.<ref>\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b\u53f2\uff11\uff10\uff10\u5e74\u300dp.134 (100 years of Japanese film history)</ref> The completed film was censored a second time by a CCD ([[Civil Censorship Detachment]]). The censorship was also carried out retroactively to past movie works.<ref>\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b\u53f2\uff11\uff10\uff10\u5e74\u300dp.129 (\"100 Years of Japanese Film History\")</ref> Japan was exposed to over a decade's worth of American [[animation]] that were banned under the war-time government.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the occupation policy, the issue of responsibility for war spread to the film industry, and when voices of banning war cooperators in movie production during the war began to be expressed, [[Nagamasa Kawakita]], [[Kanichi Negishi]], [[Shiro Kido]] in 1947, the person who was involved in such high-motion films was exiled. However, as in other genre pursuits, the position of responsibility for war has been dealt with vaguely in the film industry, and the above measures were lifted in 1950.\n\nThe first movie released after the war was \u201cSoyokaze\u201d (\u305d\u3088\u304b\u305c) 1945 by [[Yasushi Sasaki]], and the theme song \u201c[[Ringo no Uta (1946 song)|Ringo no Uta]]\u201d by [[Michiko Namiki]] was a big hit.\n\nIn the production ban list promulgated in 1945 by CIE's David Conde, nationalism, patriotism, suicide and slaughter, brutal violent movies, etc. became prohibited items, making the production of historical drama virtually impossible . As a result, actors who have been using historical drama as their business appeared in contemporary drama. This includes [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]]'s \u201c[[Bannai Tarao]]\u201d (1946), [[Tsumasabur\u014d Band\u014d]]'s \u201c[[Torn Drum]] (\u7834\u308c\u592a\u9f13)\u201d (1949), [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s \u201cThe Child Holding Hands (\u624b\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3050\u5b50\u7b49)\u201d, and [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]]'s \u201cKing (\u738b\u5c06)\u201d.\n\n[[File:Yoshiko Kuga 530406 Scan10007.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Yoshiko Kuga]]]]\n\nIn addition, many propaganda films were produced as democratic courtesy works recommended by SCAP.

This period gave rise to the four great artists of Japanese cinema: [[Masaki Kobayashi]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], and [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]. Each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by America in unique and innovative ways.\n\nThe decade started with [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''Rashomon'' (1950), which won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1951 and the [[Academy Honorary Award|Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1952, and marked the entrance of Japanese cinema onto the world stage.

It also won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.\n\nThe year 1954 saw two of Japan's most influential films released. The first was the [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', which was released in America as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters]]''. Though edited for its Western release, [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]] became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of ''[[kaiju]]'' films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, ''[[Ikiru]]'' was in competition at the [[4th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1955, [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for [[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Part I]] of his [[Samurai Trilogy|''Samurai'' trilogy]] and in 1958 won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''[[Rickshaw Man]]''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed two anti-war dramas: ''[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires On The Plain]]'' (1959), along with ''[[Enjo]]'' (1958), which was adapted from [[Yukio Mishima]]'s novel ''Temple Of The Golden Pavilion''. [[Masaki Kobayashi]] made three films which would collectively become known as ''[[The Human Condition (film trilogy)|The Human Condition Trilogy]]'': ''No Greater Love'' (1959), and ''The Road To Eternity'' (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with ''A Soldier's Prayer''.\n\nKenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including ''The Life of Oharu'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). He won the Silver Bear at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''Ugetsu''. Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. [[Mikio Naruse]] made ''[[Repast (film)|Repast]]'' (1950), ''Late Chrysanthemums'' (1954), ''The Sound of the Mountain'' (1954) and ''Floating Clouds'' (1955). Yasujir\u014d Ozu began directing color films beginning with ''Equinox Flower'' (1958), and later ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' (1959) and ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934), and was shot by ''Rashomon'' and ''Sansho the Bailiff'' cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]].\n\nThe [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] were established in 1950.

A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as ''[[The Hoodlum Soldier]]'' or ''[[Akumyo series|Akumyo]]''.\n\nThe huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Yasujir\u014d Ozu made his final film, ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'', in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama ''[[When a Woman Ascends the Stairs]]'' in 1960; his final film was 1967's ''Scattered Clouds''.\n\nKon Ichikawa captured the watershed [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] in his three-hour documentary ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]]'' (1965). [[Seijun Suzuki]] was fired by [[Nikkatsu]] for \"making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money\" after his surrealist [[Yakuza film|yakuza flick]] ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' (1967).\n\nThe 1960s were the peak years of the ''[[Japanese New Wave]]'' movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. [[Nagisa Oshima]], [[Kaneto Shindo]], [[Masahiro Shinoda]], [[Susumu Hani]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'', ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' and ''[[Death By Hanging]]'', along with Shindo's ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'', Hani's ''[[Kanojo to kare]]'' and Imamura's ''[[The Insect Woman]]'', became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, [[Kazuo Kuroki]], [[Toshio Matsumoto]], and [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. [[Shinsuke Ogawa]] and [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]] became the most important documentarists: \"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\"<ref name=\"Nornes\">{{cite book|last=Nornes|first=Ab\u00e9 Mark|title=The Documentaries of Noriaki Tsuchimoto|chapter=Noriaki Tsuchimoto and the Reverse View Documentary|year=2011|publisher=Zakka Films|pages=2\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTeshigahara's ''[[The Woman in the Dunes (film)|Woman in the Dunes]]'' (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Foreign Language Film [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. Masaki Kobayashi's ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards.

''[[Immortal Love]]'' by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and ''[[Twin Sisters of Kyoto]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Chieko]]'', both by [[Noboru Nakamura]], also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Lost Spring]]'', also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[17th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television.

The resulting [[pink film]] industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the \"[[idol films|idol eiga]]\", films starring young [[Japanese idol|\"idols\"]], who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.\n\n[[File:Nakadai.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tatsuya Nakadai]]]]\n\n[[Toshiya Fujita]] made the revenge film ''[[Lady Snowblood (film)|Lady Snowblood]]'' in 1973. In the same year, [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made the film ''[[Coup d'Etat (1973 film)|Coup d'\u00c9tat]]'', a portrait of [[Ikki Kita]], the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, as well as its avant-garde score by [[Ichiyanagi Sei]], garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.\n\nIn 1976 the [[Hochi Film Award]] was created. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' by [[Kon Ichikawa]]. Nagisa Oshima directed ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving [[Sada Abe]] set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.\n\n[[Kinji Fukasaku]] completed the epic ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' series of yakuza films. [[Yoji Yamada]] introduced the commercially successful [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo|''Tora-San'' series]], while also directing other films, notably the popular ''[[The Yellow Handkerchief (1977 film)|The Yellow Handkerchief]]'', which won the first [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Sh\u014dhei Imamura retreated to [[Documentary film|documentary work]], though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1979 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (1979).\n\n''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' by Akira Kurosawa and ''[[Sandakan No. 8]]'' by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios [[Toho]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]] barely staying in business, [[Shochiku]] supported almost solely by the ''Otoko wa tsurai'' films, and [[Nikkatsu]] declining even further.\n\nOf the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' in 1980. [[Shohei Imamura]] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'' (1983).

[[Shinji S\u014dmai]], an artistically inclined populist director who made films like the youth-focused [[Typhoon Club (film)| Typhoon Club]], and the critically acclaimed Roman porno [[Love Hotel (1985 film)| Love Hotel]] among others. [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[anime]] gained in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. [[Mamoru Oshii]] released his landmark ''[[Angel's Egg]]'' in 1985. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] adapted his [[manga]] series ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind]]'' into a [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1984. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] followed suit by adapting his own manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' into a [[Akira (1988 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1988.\n\n[[Home video]] made possible the creation of a [[direct-to-video]] film industry.\n\n===1990s===\n\nBecause of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex]] in Japan.\n\n[[Takeshi Kitano]] emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993), ''[[Kids Return]]'' (1996) and ''[[Hana-bi]]'' (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Sh\u014dhei Imamura again won the Golden Palm (shared with [[Iran]]ian director [[Abbas Kiarostami]]), this time for ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]'' (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining [[Alf Sj\u00f6berg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Bille August]].\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of ''[[Cure (film)|Cure]]'' (1997).

Former documentary filmmaker [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] launched an acclaimed feature career with ''[[Maborosi]]'' (1996) and ''[[After Life (film)|After Life]]'' (1999).\n\nHayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' (1992)&nbsp;\u2013 which beat ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) as the [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|highest-grossing film in Japan]]&nbsp;\u2013 and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).\n\nSeveral new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' in 1996. [[Satoshi Kon]] directed the award-winning psychological thriller ''[[Perfect Blue]]''. [[Hideaki Anno]] also gained considerable recognition with ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' in 1997.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hayao Miyazaki]]]]\n\nThe number of movies being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Movies based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production.

On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]]. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government&nbsp;\u2013 on both the national and local levels&nbsp;\u2013 must lend aid in order to preserve film media.

Film criticism began with early film magazines such as ''Katsud\u014d shashinkai'' (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by [[Yasunosuke Gonda]] in 1914, but many early [[film critics]] often focused on chastising the work of studios like [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Tennenshoku Katsud\u014d Shashin|Tenkatsu]] for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from [[kabuki]] and [[shinpa]] such as [[onnagata]]) and for not utilizing what were considered more [[cinematic techniques]] to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the [[Pure Film Movement]], writers in magazines such as ''[[Kinema Record]]'' called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as [[Norimasa Kaeriyama]], went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as ''[[The Glow of Life]]'' (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, [[Harumi Hanayagi]]). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film ''The Captain's Daughter'', [[Masao Inoue (actor)|Masao Inoue]] started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the [[gendaigeki]] and [[scriptwriting]].<ref>See Bernardi.</ref>\n\n===1920s===\nNew studios established around 1920, such as [[Shochiku]] and [[Taikatsu]], aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, [[Thomas Kurihara]] directed films scripted by the novelist [[Junichiro Tanizaki]], who was a strong advocate of film reform.<ref>See Lamarre.</ref> Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of [[Eiz\u014d Tanaka]]. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], whose later works (including ''[[Ugetsu]]''/''Ugetsu Monogatari'') retain a very high reputation.\n\nJapanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of [[movie stars]] and a new style of [[jidaigeki]]. Directors such as [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]] and [[Masahiro Makino]] made [[samurai films]] like ''[[A Diary of Chuji's Travels]]'' and ''[[Roningai]]'' featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes.<ref>{{cite book| last = Thornton| first = S. A.| title = The Japanese Period Film| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-3136-6 }}</ref> Some stars, such as [[Tsumasaburo Bando]], [[Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi]], [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]], [[Takako Irie]] and [[Utaemon Ichikawa]], were inspired by [[Makino Film Productions]] and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], [[Mansaku Itami]] and [[Sadao Yamanaka]] honed their skills. Director [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]] created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece ''[[A Page of Madness]]'', starring Masao Inoue, in 1926.<ref>See Gerow, ''A Page of Madness''.</ref> Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like [[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]], [[Teikine]], and [[Toa Studios]], could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.\n\nWith the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s, there arose so-called [[tendency films]] with left-leaning tendencies. Directors [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]], [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], and [[Tomu Uchida]] were prominent examples. In contrast to these commercially produced [[35mm movie film|35 mm films]], the [[Marxist]] [[Proletarian Film League of Japan]] (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] and [[16 mm film|16mm]]), with more radical intentions.<ref>Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film'', pp. 19\u201347.</ref> Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: ''[[Sakanaya Honda]], [[Jitsuroku Chushingura]], Horaijima, [[Orochi (film)|Orochi]], Maboroshi, [[Kurutta Ippeji]], [[Jujiro]], [[Kurama Tengu: Ky\u014dfu Jidai]]'', and ''Kurama Tengu''.<ref>[[Japanese films of the 1920s]]</ref>\n\nA later version of ''The Captain's Daughter'' was one of the first [[Sound film|talkie]] films. It used the [[Mina Talkie System]]. The Japanese film industry later split into two groups; one retained the Mina Talkie System, while the other used the Iisutofyon Talkie System used to make Tojo Masaki's films.\n\nThe [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 earthquake]], the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's [[humidity]] on flammable and unstable [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:Humanity and Paper Balloons poster.jpg|thumb|Cinema poster for [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s 1937 ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'']]\nUnlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent.<ref>\"[http://filmsound.org/film-sound-history/sound-in-japan.htm The Transition to Sound in Japan]\", Freda Freiberg, Filmsound.org</ref> For instance, [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''An Inn in Tokyo'' (1935), considered a precursor to the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was ''[[Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato]]'' (1930), which used the ''[[Mina Talkie System]]''. Notable talkies of this period include [[Mikio Naruse]]'s ''[[Wife, Be Like A Rose!]]'' (''Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni'', 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' (''Gion no shimai'', 1936); ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936); and ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939); and [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'' (1937).\n\nFilm criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured \"impressionist\" criticism pursued by critics such as [[Tadashi Iijima]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], and [[Matsuo Kishi]] was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genj\u016b Sasa]] who sought an ideological critique of films.<ref name=\"Gerow\">{{cite book|author1=Aaron Gerow|authorlink1=Aaron Gerow|editor1-last=Miyao|editor1-first=Daisuke|editor1-link=Daisuke Miyao|title=The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199731664|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731664.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199731664-e-005|accessdate=27 April 2018|language=en|chapter=Critical Reception: Historical Conceptions of Japanese Film Criticism}}</ref>\n\nThe 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the [[Film Law]], which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing [[propaganda films]] and promoting [[documentary films]] (also called ''bunka eiga'' or \"culture films\"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as [[Fumio Kamei]].<ref>See Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film''.</ref> Realism was in favor; [[film theorist]]s such as [[Taihei Imamura]] and [[Heiichi Sugiyama]] advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]] and [[Tomotaka Tasaka]] produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style.\n\n===1940s===\n\n====Wartime movies====\n[[File:Li_Xianglan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]]]]\n{{further|War film}}\n\nBecause of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.\n\nDuring this period, when Japan was expanding its Empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942 [[Kajiro Yamamoto]]'s film ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]'' or \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.\n\n[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]] was a very popular actress. She rose to international stardom with 22 wartime movies. The [[Manchukuo Film Association]] let her use the Chinese name Li Xianglan so she could represent Chinese roles in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war she used her official Japanese name and starred in an additional 29 movies. She was elected as a member of the [[Japanese parliament]] in the 1970s and served for 18 years.\n\n[[Akira Kurosawa]] made his feature film debut with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]'' in 1943.\n\n====American Occupation====\n[[File:Yoko Sugi and Setsuko Hara in Aoi Sanmyaku.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tadashi Imai]]'s \"[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\" starring [[Y\u014dko Sugi]] and [[Setsuko Hara]] (1949)]]\n\nIn 1945, when Japan was defeated in World War II, the rule of Japan by the SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) began. Movies produced in Japan were managed by GHQ's subordinate organization CIE (Civil Information Educational Section, \u6c11\u9593\u60c5\u5831\u6559\u80b2\u5c40). This management system lasted until 1952, and it was the first time in the Japanese movie world that management and control by a foreign institution was implemented. During the planning and scripting stages it was translated to English, only the movies approved by the CIE were produced. For example, [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s \u201c[[Akatsuki no Dass\u014d]]\u201d (1950) was originally a work depicting a Korean military comfort woman starring [[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]], but with dozens of CIE censorship, it became an original work.<ref>\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b\u53f2\uff11\uff10\uff10\u5e74\u300dp.134 (100 years of Japanese film history)</ref> The completed film was censored a second time by a CCD ([[Civil Censorship Detachment]]).

However, as in other genre pursuits, the position of responsibility for war has been dealt with vaguely in the film industry, and the above measures were lifted in 1950.\n\nThe first movie released after the war was \u201cSoyokaze\u201d (\u305d\u3088\u304b\u305c) 1945 by [[Yasushi Sasaki]], and the theme song \u201c[[Ringo no Uta (1946 song)|Ringo no Uta]]\u201d by [[Michiko Namiki]] was a big hit.\n\nIn the production ban list promulgated in 1945 by CIE's David Conde, nationalism, patriotism, suicide and slaughter, brutal violent movies, etc. became prohibited items, making the production of historical drama virtually impossible . As a result, actors who have been using historical drama as their business appeared in contemporary drama. This includes [[Chiez\u014d Kataoka]]'s \u201c[[Bannai Tarao]]\u201d (1946), [[Tsumasabur\u014d Band\u014d]]'s \u201c[[Torn Drum]] (\u7834\u308c\u592a\u9f13)\u201d (1949), [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s \u201cThe Child Holding Hands (\u624b\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3050\u5b50\u7b49)\u201d, and [[Daisuke It\u014d (film director)|Daisuke It\u014d]]'s \u201cKing (\u738b\u5c06)\u201d.\n\n[[File:Yoshiko Kuga 530406 Scan10007.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Yoshiko Kuga]]]]\n\nIn addition, many propaganda films were produced as democratic courtesy works recommended by SCAP. Significant movies among them are, [[Setsuko Hara]] appeared in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s \u201c[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]\u201d (1946), [[K\u014dzabur\u014d Yoshimura]]'s \u201c[[A Ball at the Anjo House]]\u201d (1947), [[Tadashi Imai]]'s \u201c[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\u201d (1949), etc. It gained national popularity as a star symbolizing the beginning of a new era. In [[Yasushi Sasaki]]'s \"[[Hata no Seishun]] (\u306f\u305f\u3061\u306e\u9752\u6625)\" (1946), the first kiss scene of a Japanese movie was filmed.\n\nThe first collaborations between [[Akira Kurosawa]] and actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] were ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' in 1948 and ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' in 1949.

Suzuki Ikuzo's Tonichi Enterprises Company co-produced the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tokyo File 212: Detail View|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=50894|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]}}</ref> ''[[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]]'', a 1953 film by [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]], was the first movie that filmed using [[Eastmancolor]] film, ''Gate of Hell'' was both [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei]]'s first color film and the first Japanese color movie to be released outside Japan, receiving an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1954 for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] by [[Sanzo Wada]] and an Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It also won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.\n\nThe year 1954 saw two of Japan's most influential films released. The first was the [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', which was released in America as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters]]''. Though edited for its Western release, [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]] became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of ''[[kaiju]]'' films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, ''[[Ikiru]]'' was in competition at the [[4th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1955, [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for [[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Part I]] of his [[Samurai Trilogy|''Samurai'' trilogy]] and in 1958 won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''[[Rickshaw Man]]''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed two anti-war dramas: ''[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires On The Plain]]'' (1959), along with ''[[Enjo]]'' (1958), which was adapted from [[Yukio Mishima]]'s novel ''Temple Of The Golden Pavilion''. [[Masaki Kobayashi]] made three films which would collectively become known as ''[[The Human Condition (film trilogy)|The Human Condition Trilogy]]'': ''No Greater Love'' (1959), and ''The Road To Eternity'' (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with ''A Soldier's Prayer''.\n\nKenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including ''The Life of Oharu'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). He won the Silver Bear at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''Ugetsu''. Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. [[Mikio Naruse]] made ''[[Repast (film)|Repast]]'' (1950), ''Late Chrysanthemums'' (1954), ''The Sound of the Mountain'' (1954) and ''Floating Clouds'' (1955). Yasujir\u014d Ozu began directing color films beginning with ''Equinox Flower'' (1958), and later ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' (1959) and ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934), and was shot by ''Rashomon'' and ''Sansho the Bailiff'' cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]].\n\nThe [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] were established in 1950. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[Until We Meet Again (1950 film)|Until We Meet Again]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]].\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Toshiro Mifune 1954 Scan10003 160913.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Toshiro Mifune]] was at the center of many of Kurosawa's films.]]\n\nThe number of films produced, and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/japanesecinemain195060/ ''Japanese Cinema in the 1950s and 1960s'']</ref> Most films were shown in double bills, with one half of the bill being a \"program picture\" or B-movie. A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as ''[[The Hoodlum Soldier]]'' or ''[[Akumyo series|Akumyo]]''.\n\nThe huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Yasujir\u014d Ozu made his final film, ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'', in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama ''[[When a Woman Ascends the Stairs]]'' in 1960; his final film was 1967's ''Scattered Clouds''.\n\nKon Ichikawa captured the watershed [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] in his three-hour documentary ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]]'' (1965). [[Seijun Suzuki]] was fired by [[Nikkatsu]] for \"making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money\" after his surrealist [[Yakuza film|yakuza flick]] ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' (1967).\n\nThe 1960s were the peak years of the ''[[Japanese New Wave]]'' movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. [[Nagisa Oshima]], [[Kaneto Shindo]], [[Masahiro Shinoda]], [[Susumu Hani]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'', ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' and ''[[Death By Hanging]]'', along with Shindo's ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'', Hani's ''[[Kanojo to kare]]'' and Imamura's ''[[The Insect Woman]]'', became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, [[Kazuo Kuroki]], [[Toshio Matsumoto]], and [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. [[Shinsuke Ogawa]] and [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]] became the most important documentarists: \"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\"<ref name=\"Nornes\">{{cite book|last=Nornes|first=Ab\u00e9 Mark|title=The Documentaries of Noriaki Tsuchimoto|chapter=Noriaki Tsuchimoto and the Reverse View Documentary|year=2011|publisher=Zakka Films|pages=2\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTeshigahara's ''[[The Woman in the Dunes (film)|Woman in the Dunes]]'' (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Foreign Language Film [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. Masaki Kobayashi's ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Bushido, Samurai Saga]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]] won the Golden Bear at the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]]. ''[[Immortal Love]]'' by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and ''[[Twin Sisters of Kyoto]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Chieko]]'', both by [[Noboru Nakamura]], also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Lost Spring]]'', also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[17th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television. Total audience declined from 1.2 billion in 1960 to 0.2 billion in 1980.<ref>\n{{cite book|last1=Sato|first1=Tadao|title=Currents in Japanese Cinema|publisher=Kodansha|year=1982|page=244}}</ref>\nFilm companies fought back in various ways, such as the bigger budget films of [[Kadokawa Pictures]], or including increasingly sexual or violent content and language which could not be shown on television. The resulting [[pink film]] industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the \"[[idol films|idol eiga]]\", films starring young [[Japanese idol|\"idols\"]], who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.\n\n[[File:Nakadai.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tatsuya Nakadai]]]]\n\n[[Toshiya Fujita]] made the revenge film ''[[Lady Snowblood (film)|Lady Snowblood]]'' in 1973. In the same year, [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made the film ''[[Coup d'Etat (1973 film)|Coup d'\u00c9tat]]'', a portrait of [[Ikki Kita]], the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, as well as its avant-garde score by [[Ichiyanagi Sei]], garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.\n\nIn 1976 the [[Hochi Film Award]] was created. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' by [[Kon Ichikawa]]. Nagisa Oshima directed ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving [[Sada Abe]] set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.\n\n[[Kinji Fukasaku]] completed the epic ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' series of yakuza films. [[Yoji Yamada]] introduced the commercially successful [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo|''Tora-San'' series]], while also directing other films, notably the popular ''[[The Yellow Handkerchief (1977 film)|The Yellow Handkerchief]]'', which won the first [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Sh\u014dhei Imamura retreated to [[Documentary film|documentary work]], though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1979 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (1979).\n\n''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' by Akira Kurosawa and ''[[Sandakan No. 8]]'' by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios [[Toho]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]] barely staying in business, [[Shochiku]] supported almost solely by the ''Otoko wa tsurai'' films, and [[Nikkatsu]] declining even further.\n\nOf the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' in 1980. [[Shohei Imamura]] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'' (1983). [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made ''[[A Promise (1986 film)|A Promise]]'' (1986), his first film since 1973's ''Coup d'\u00c9tat''.\n\n[[File:1992 Juzo Itami.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Juzo Itami]]]]\n\nNew directors who appeared in the 80s include actor [[Juzo Itami]], who directed his first film, ''[[The Funeral (1984 film)|The Funeral]]'', in 1984, and achieved critical and box office success with ''[[Tampopo]]'' in 1985. [[Shinji S\u014dmai]], an artistically inclined populist director who made films like the youth-focused [[Typhoon Club (film)| Typhoon Club]], and the critically acclaimed Roman porno [[Love Hotel (1985 film)| Love Hotel]] among others. [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[anime]] gained in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. [[Mamoru Oshii]] released his landmark ''[[Angel's Egg]]'' in 1985. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] adapted his [[manga]] series ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind]]'' into a [[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1984. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] followed suit by adapting his own manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' into a [[Akira (1988 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1988.\n\n[[Home video]] made possible the creation of a [[direct-to-video]] film industry.\n\n===1990s===\n\nBecause of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex]] in Japan.\n\n[[Takeshi Kitano]] emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993), ''[[Kids Return]]'' (1996) and ''[[Hana-bi]]'' (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Sh\u014dhei Imamura again won the Golden Palm (shared with [[Iran]]ian director [[Abbas Kiarostami]]), this time for ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]'' (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining [[Alf Sj\u00f6berg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Bille August]].\n\nKiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of ''[[Cure (film)|Cure]]'' (1997). [[Takashi Miike]] launched a prolific career with titles such as ''[[Audition (1999 film)|Audition]]'' (1999), ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Bird People in China]]'' (1998). Former documentary filmmaker [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] launched an acclaimed feature career with ''[[Maborosi]]'' (1996) and ''[[After Life (film)|After Life]]'' (1999).\n\nHayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' (1992)&nbsp;\u2013 which beat ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) as the [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|highest-grossing film in Japan]]&nbsp;\u2013 and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).\n\nSeveral new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' in 1996. [[Satoshi Kon]] directed the award-winning psychological thriller ''[[Perfect Blue]]''. [[Hideaki Anno]] also gained considerable recognition with ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' in 1997.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hayao Miyazaki]]]]\n\nThe number of movies being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Movies based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production. The 1990s and 2000s are considered to be \"Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age\", due to the immense popularity of anime, both within Japan and overseas.<ref name=\"Kehr\">Dave Kehr, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/film-anime-japanese-cinema-s-second-golden-age.html Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2002.</ref>\n\nAlthough not a commercial success, ''[[All About Lily Chou-Chou]]'' directed by [[Shunji Iwai]] was honored at the Berlin, the Yokohama and the Shanghai Film Festivals in 2001. Takeshi Kitano appeared in ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' and directed and starred in ''[[Dolls (2002 film)|Dolls]]'' and ''[[Zatoichi (2003 film)|Zatoichi]]''. Several horror films, ''[[Kairo (film)|Kairo]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Yogen]]'', [[Ju-on|the ''Grudge'' series]] and ''[[One Missed Call (2004 film)|One Missed Call]]'' met with commercial success. In 2004, ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', directed by [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Godzilla. In 2005, director [[Seijun Suzuki]] made his 56th film, ''[[Princess Raccoon]]''. [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] claimed film festival awards around the world with two of his films ''[[Distance (2001 film)|Distance]]'' and ''[[Nobody Knows (2004 film)|Nobody Knows]]''. Female film director [[Naomi Kawase]]'s film ''[[The Mourning Forest]]'' won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. [[Yoji Yamada]], director of the [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]] series, made a trilogy of acclaimed revisionist samurai films, 2002's ''[[Twilight Samurai]]'', followed by ''[[The Hidden Blade]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Love and Honor (2006 film)|Love and Honor]]'' in 2006.\n\nIn anime, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] directed ''[[Spirited Away]]'' in 2001, breaking Japanese box office records and winning several awards\u2014including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] in 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|title=The 75th Academy Awards (2003)|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|url-status=live|accessdate=December 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128072357/http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|archivedate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\u2014followed by ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Ponyo]]'' in 2004 and 2008 respectively. In 2004, Mamoru Oshii released the anime movie ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'' which received critical praise around the world. His 2008 film ''[[The Sky Crawlers]]'' was met with similarly positive international reception. Satoshi Kon also released three quieter, but nonetheless highly successful films: ''[[Millennium Actress]]'', ''[[Tokyo Godfathers]]'', and ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]''. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] released ''[[Steamboy]]'', his first animated project since the 1995 short film compilation ''[[Memories (1995 film)|Memories]]'', in 2004. In collaboration with [[Studio 4C]], American director [[Michael Arias]] released ''[[Tekkon Kinkreet]]'' in 2008, to international acclaim. After several years of directing primarily lower-key live-action films, [[Hideaki Anno]] formed [[Studio Khara|his own production studio]] and revisited his still-popular ''Evangelion'' franchise with the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' tetralogy, a new series of films providing an alternate retelling of the original story.\n\nIn February 2000, the Japan Film Commission Promotion Council was established. On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]]. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government&nbsp;\u2013 on both the national and local levels&nbsp;\u2013 must lend aid in order to preserve film media. The laws were passed on November 30 and came into effect on December 7. In 2003, at a gathering for the Agency of Cultural Affairs, twelve policies were proposed in a written report to allow public-made films to be promoted and shown at the Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art.\n\n===2010s===\n\nFour films have so far received international recognition by being selected to compete in major film festivals: ''[[Caterpillar (2010 film)|Caterpillar]]'' by [[K\u014dji Wakamatsu]] was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]] and won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]], ''[[Outrage (2010 film)|Outrage]]'' by [[Takeshi Kitano]] was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Himizu (film)|Himizu]]'' by [[Sion Sono]] was in competition for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 2011, [[Takashi Miike]]'s ''[[Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai]]'' was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]], the first [[3D film]] ever to screen In Competition at Cannes. The film was co-produced by British independent producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], who had successfully broken Japanese titles such as [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence]]'' and '' [[Taboo (1999 film)|Taboo]]'', [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]'', and Miike's ''[[13 Assassins (2010 film)|13 Assassins]]'' onto the international stage as producer.\n\nIn 2018, [[Hirokazu Kore-Eda]] won the Palme d'Or for his movie ''[[Shoplifters (film)|Shoplifters]]'' at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival|71st Cannes Film Festival]], a festival that also featured [[Ry\u016bsuke Hamaguchi]]'s ''[[Asako I & II]]'' in competition.\n\n==Genres==\n\nGenres of Japanese film include:{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n* '''[[Jidaigeki]]''': period pieces set during the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) or earlier.\n** '''[[Samurai cinema]]''', a subgenre of ''jidaigeki'', also known as ''chambara'' ([[onomatopoeia]] describing the sound of swords clashing).\n* '''[[Japanese horror|Horror]]''': [[horror film]]s such as ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''\n* '''[[Tokusatsu]]'''\n** '''[[Kaiju]]''': [[monster]] films, such as ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''\n* '''[[Pink film]]s''': [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] [[pornographic film]]s.\n* '''[[Yakuza film]]s''': films about [[Yakuza]] mobsters.\n* '''[[Gendaigeki]]''': the opposite of \"jidaigeki\", films set in the present day.\n* '''[[Shomingeki]]''': realistic films about common working people\n* '''[[Anime]]''': [[Animation]].
