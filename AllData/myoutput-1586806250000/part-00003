The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, \"If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful.\" He also expressed his concern for defencemen, \"It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen ... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time ... You've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt.\" At the time of his statement, Devils defencemen [[Paul Martin (ice hockey)|Paul Martin]], [[Johnny Oduya]] and [[Bryce Salvador]] were all out with injuries.<ref name=\"Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid\">{{cite web|last=Gulitti|first=Tom|url=http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid/|title=Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid|publisher=Fire&Ice|accessdate=November 10, 2009|date=November 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113050802/http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid|archivedate=November 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUltimately the suggestion was rejected and the rule stayed in place. Former Maple Leafs' general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] said, \"We had originally approved a rule where the goaltenders couldn't handle the puck behind the net at all.

Some of the things Brodeur talks about in the book are player salaries and contracts, NHL marketing, [[Lou Lamoriello]], and the Devils' new arena in Newark, the [[Prudential Center]]. Brodeur also includes his views on the \"new NHL\" after the lockout, and how it affected his career.<ref name=\"biography\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470838515/|title=Brodeur: Beyond the Crease (Hardcover)|accessdate=December 6, 2006|publisher=Amazon.com|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nBrodeur co-owns a business called La Pizzeria Etc. with former teammate [[Sheldon Souray]].

The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, \"If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful.\" He also expressed his concern for defencemen, \"It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen ... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time ... You've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt.\" At the time of his statement, Devils defencemen [[Paul Martin (ice hockey)|Paul Martin]], [[Johnny Oduya]] and [[Bryce Salvador]] were all out with injuries.<ref name=\"Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid\">{{cite web|last=Gulitti|first=Tom|url=http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid/|title=Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid|publisher=Fire&Ice|accessdate=November 10, 2009|date=November 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113050802/http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid|archivedate=November 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUltimately the suggestion was rejected and the rule stayed in place. Former Maple Leafs' general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] said, \"We had originally approved a rule where the goaltenders couldn't handle the puck behind the net at all.
