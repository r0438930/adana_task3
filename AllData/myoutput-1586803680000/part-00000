Despite this, the door will eventually open ajar as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's|first game]], as well as shooing three miniature animatronics nicknamed 'Freddles' by the FNAF community off the bed before they, once all three are together, summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet and bed unattended for too long, the player will be [[jumpscare]]d, leading to a [[game over]].\n\nAfter beating each night, the player may play a timed minigame titled \"Fun with Plushtrap\" (In Halloween update, Plushtrap is replaced by Nightmare Balloon Boy) in which a plush edition of Springtrap, the central animatronic in ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', must be lured to the top of an \"X\" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player wins, the player will start the next night at 2:00 A.M. Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more challenging as the game progresses. The time bonus does not apply to the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level.\n\nLike previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica and Nightmare Foxy (Nightmare Mangle in Halloween update). Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the \"Nightmare\" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night or called as 20/20/20/20 mode based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] of the animatronics to maximum difficulty. Other unlockables include galleries of the various animatronics and jumpscares, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at the 3D-modelling process for Fredbear and Foxy.<ref name=\"Extras\">{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon| publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene =Extras menu| quote = }}</ref>\n\nAs in most of the previous entries of the series, the story of the game is revealed in interactive [[Retrogaming|Atari-style]] minigame sections between nights. Each of the minigames are set in a time frame corresponding to the five nights, beginning with \"5 days until the party\", up to \"0 days until the party.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game starts with a minigame which shows a child (different from the child in the main gameplay) who is locked in his bedroom with plush toys, which he calls his only friends.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4|developer=Scott Cawthon|publisher=|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Night 1 prologue|date=July 23, 2015|quote='''Boy:''' These are my friends.}}</ref> After the player survives the first night, the boy's Fredbear plush tells him that \"he\" (the boy's older brother) is hiding in the house, before the boy is jumpscared by him, who is wearing a Foxy mask.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 2 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' Now he is hiding again. He won't stop until you find him.}}</ref> After the second night, the boy is abandoned at the pizzeria (implied to be the Fredbear's Family Diner briefly mentioned in the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second]] game), only to be warned by Fredbear's voice that \"he\" is coming and that he must be brave; however, since the boy is afraid of the animatronics and costumed mascots, he ends up bawling. An [[Easter egg (interaction design)|easter egg]] during this scene briefly shows William Afton from the second and [[Five Nights at Freddy's 3|third]] games fitting someone into the Spring Bonnie suit.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 3 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're too late. Hurry the other way and find someone who will help! You know what will happen if he catches you! You can find help if you can get past them.

I hear they come to life at night. And if you die, they hide your body and never tell anyone.}}</ref> The boy sees his plush toys as his only friends and generally eschews interaction with other people in favor of them. Another easter egg in this minigame establishes the time period, via a commercial or TV show named \"''Fredbear and Friends''\" dated 1983. After the fourth night, it is revealed that he was once locked in the building's parts and services room as a prank.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 prologue| quote = '''You:''' Please let me out.

On THREE! One...two...}}</ref> Suddenly, Fredbear, who was in the middle of singing, forcefully closes his mouth, due to the boy's tears activating the spring locks, and crushes the boy's head while the brother and his friends stare in sheer horror, realizing their mistake.\n \nAfter the sixth night, the boy hears his older brother apologizing to him<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Voice:''' Can you hear me?

We're still your friends. Do you still believe that? I'm still here. I will put you back together.}}</ref> The characters then fade out one by one, and the faint sound of a [[electrocardiography|heart monitor]] flatlining can be heard, death of the boy and ending the minigames. Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear.\n\n10 years later, the older brother (most likely Mike Schmidt from the first game) is having nightmares after getting fired from the pizzeria, as many things confirm.\n\nIf the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game states that \"Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now.\"<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Nightmare epilogue}}</ref> Cawthon remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he would not disclose what was in it. He gave only one clue: \"What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together.\"\n\nThroughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.\n\n== Development and release ==\nBeginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter''. The images, featuring the characters from the series, cryptically teased at a release on Halloween.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/28/five-nights-at-freddys-4-release-date/ | title = Five Night\u2019s at Freddy\u2019s 4 teased for Halloween release | first =Brenna | last = Hillier | date = April 28, 2015 | accessdate = May 16, 2015 | work = [[VG247]]|publisher = Videogaming 247 Ltd. }}</ref> A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game took place in the main character's house.

The second is a \"Halloween Edition\" that makes cosmetic changes to Nightmare Bonnie and Nightmare Chica, and introduces nightmare versions of the ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2'''s characters Mangle and The Puppet, (known as Nightmarionne in-game) the former replacing Nightmare Foxy and the latter replacing Nightmare.

Each of the minigames are set in a time frame corresponding to the five nights, beginning with \"5 days until the party\", up to \"0 days until the party.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game starts with a minigame which shows a child(different from the child in the main gameplay) who is locked in his bedroom with plush toys, which he calls his only friends.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4|developer=Scott Cawthon|publisher=|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Night 1 prologue|date=July 23, 2015|quote='''Boy:''' These are my friends.}}</ref> After the player survives the first night, the boy's Fredbear plush tells him that \"he\" (the boy's older brother) is hiding in the house, before the boy is jumpscared by him, who is wearing a Foxy mask.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 2 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' Now he is hiding again. He won't stop until you find him.}}</ref> After the second night, the boy is abandoned at the pizzeria (implied to be the Fredbear's Family Diner briefly mentioned in the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second]] game), only to be warned by Fredbear's voice that \"he\" is coming and that he must be brave; however, since the boy is afraid of the animatronics and costumed mascots, he ends up bawling. An [[Easter egg (interaction design)|easter egg]] during this scene briefly shows William Afton from the second and [[Five Nights at Freddy's 3|third]] games fitting someone into the Spring Bonnie suit.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 3 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're too late. Hurry the other way and find someone who will help! You know what will happen if he catches you! You can find help if you can get past them. You need to be strong.}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third night, the minigame reveals that other children tease the boy, calling him a coward and crybaby,<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 4 prologue| quote = '''Boy 1:''' Aren't you the kid who always hides under the table and cries? Hahaha! No one else is scared! Why are you? Stop being such a baby!}}</ref> and that there are rumors of the animatronics coming to life at night and attempting to murder people.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 4 prologue| quote = '''Girl 2:''' You'd better watch out! I hear they come to life at night. And if you die, they hide your body and never tell anyone.}}</ref> The boy sees his plush toys as his only friends and generally eschews interaction with other people in favor of them. Another easter egg in this minigame establishes the time period, via a commercial or TV show named \"''Fredbear and Friends''\" dated 1983. After the fourth night, it is revealed that he was once locked in the building's parts and services room as a prank.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 prologue| quote = '''You:''' Please let me out. PLEASE! Please let me out...}}</ref> If the fifth night is completed, the boy is shown crying at his birthday party in the pizzeria, with his brother (alongside other bullies) wearing the masks of the animatronics to terrorize the boy.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Your Brother's Friend:''' Wow, your brother is kind of a baby, isn't he? / '''Your Brother:''' It's hilarious.}}</ref> The bullies, deciding to prank the boy, grab him and try to get him close to the Fredbear animatronic's mouth for a \"kiss,\"<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Your Brother:''' Why don't we help him get a closer look!

I don't want to go! / '''Your Brother:''' You heard the little man! He wants to get even closer! Ha ha ha!}}</ref> and end up stuffing the boy's head into the animatronic's mouth.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Your Brother:''' Hey guys, I think the little man said he wants to give Fredbear a big kiss! On THREE! One...two...}}</ref> Suddenly, Fredbear, who was in the middle of singing, forcefully closes his mouth, due to the boy's tears activating the spring locks, and crushes the boy's head while the brother and his friends stare in sheer horror, realizing their mistake.\n \nAfter the sixth night, the boy hears his older brother apologizing to him<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Voice:''' Can you hear me? I don't know if you can hear me. I'm sorry.}}</ref> as Fredbear promises him that no matter how many times he \"breaks,\" he and the others will always be there to \"put him back together\" and will always be his friends.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're broken. We're still your friends. Do you still believe that? I'm still here. I will put you back together.}}</ref> The characters then fade out one by one, and the faint sound of a [[electrocardiography|heart monitor]] flatlining can be heard, death of the boy and ending the minigames. Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear.\n\n\n10 years later, the older brother (Most likely Mike Schmidt from the first game) is having nightmares after getting fired from the pizzeria, as many things confirm.\n\nIf the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game states that \"Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now.\"<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Nightmare epilogue}}</ref> Cawthon remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he would not disclose what was in it. He gave only one clue: \"What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together.\"\n\n\nThroughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.\n\n== Development and release ==\nBeginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter''. The images, featuring the characters from the series, cryptically teased at a release on Halloween.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/28/five-nights-at-freddys-4-release-date/ | title = Five Night\u2019s at Freddy\u2019s 4 teased for Halloween release | first =Brenna | last = Hillier | date = April 28, 2015 | accessdate = May 16, 2015 | work = [[VG247]]|publisher = Videogaming 247 Ltd. }}</ref> A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game took place in the main character's house.

On October 31, 2015, two updates for the game were released. One consists of a set of cheat options, challenge modes, and an altered version of the \"Fun with Plushtrap\" minigame that uses a nightmare version of the character Balloon Boy (from ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'') in place of Plushtrap. The second is a \"Halloween Edition\" that makes cosmetic changes to Nightmare Bonnie and Nightmare Chica, and introduces nightmare versions of the ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2'''s characters Mangle and The Puppet, (known as Nightmarionne in-game) the former replacing Nightmare Foxy and the latter replacing Nightmare. Nightmare Chica's cupcake is also replaced with a [[Jack-o-Lantern]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{VG reception\n| MC = (PC) 51/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys-4 |title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4 for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Corporation]] |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref>\n| Destruct = 4/10<ref name=\"Destruct\"/>\n| PCGUS = 70/100<ref name=\"PCG\">{{cite web|url= http://www.pcgamer.com/five-nights-at-freddys-4-review/|title= Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Review on PC Gamer|publisher= [[PC Gamer]]|date= August 5, 2015|accessdate= August 13, 2015}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"The Escapist\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Gamezebo]]''\n| rev2Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"GZ\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[TouchArcade]]''\n| rev3Score = (iOS) {{rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://toucharcade.com/2015/08/10/five-nights-at-freddys-4-review/ |title='Five Nights At Freddy's 4' Review \u2013 The Latest Freddy Gets The Worst Port Yet |last=Musgrave |first=Shaun |date=August 10, 2015 |website=[[TouchArcade]] |accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\nThe PC version of the game received an aggregate score of 51 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 6 reviews.<ref name= \"MC\"/>\n\n''[[Destructoid]]'' criticized the gameplay as being too confusing, and gave the game a review score of 4 out of 10.<ref name= \"Destruct\"/> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' gave the game a positive review score of 4 out of 5 stars saying that they liked the reworked mechanics, darker and emotional storyline, scary jumpscares, and sad ending but noted the game's bugs and glitches.<ref name= \"The Escapist\">{{cite web|url= http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/14363-Five-Nights-at-Freddy-s-4-Review-Worth-Playing|title= Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Review - Change, Improve, Jumpscare|author= Angelo M.
