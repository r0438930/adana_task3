The \"it\" in this conversation between two persons present is a symbolization of something absent. A symbol has thus substituted the leader of the flock seen in other animals growing out of their [[neoteny|neotenia]]n state. This abstract \"leader\" he calls \"The Grand Subject\" and has been referred to different symbolic powers throughout the ages: spirits, machinery of gods (like the Olympic gods), the monotheistic almighty God, the Proletariate, the Race and, lately, the neoliberal Market.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RAI&ID_NUMPUBLIE=RAI_002&ID_ARTICLE=RAI_002_0009 \u00ab Portrait du grand Sujet \u00bb in ''Raisons politiques'' (Presses de Sc. Po.)]</ref>\n\n== Deconstruction of (neo)liberal civilisation ==\n\n===Postmodernist change of minds===\nIn the book ''L'art de r\u00e9duire les t\u00eates'' (\"The Art of Shrinking Heads\"<ref>http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3340688-the-art-of-shrinking-heads</ref>) Dufour considers the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] change which [[Lyotard]] refers to as \"the end of the Grand Narrative\".\n \nThis new aspect suits [[liberalism]] in an excellent way, being more flexible than the old way of thinking to the everchanging circulation of merchandise, he claims.\n\n===A new religion===\nIn the book ''Le Divin March\u00e9, la r\u00e9volution culturelle lib\u00e9rale'' (\"The Divine Market, the Liberal Cultural Revolution\")<ref>http://www.gallimard.com/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Folio/Folio-essais/Le-Divin-Marche</ref> Dufour tries to point out that we have come under the grip of a new victorious religion: the Divine Market, functioning on a simple but terribly efficient principle which [[Bernard Mandeville]] described in ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1704: it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress. This \"miracle\" is produced by \"[[divine providence]]\", what [[Adam Smith]] was to call \"[[The Invisible Hand]]\".\n\nDufour also wants to point out that the liberal project tends to contradict the concept of \"school\" in Antiquity: Greek \u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae (schol\u0113), Latin [[otium]] = free time, i.e. the time not employed to work or duties. This concept permitted the individual, before entering business life (Latin \"neg-otium\" = time not free), to create a mastering of mind not to be subject to uncontrolled passions, neither his own nor those of others.\n\nWe are thus left to distinguish between two contrary concepts of education: the classical one with self-control and the liberal one  where passions and urges on the loose are permitted. The more this latter educational project triumphs, the more the desymbolized world of drives and urges will protrude, according to Dufour. This world, however, creates a new problem: when no longer control of passions and urges is effected on a symbolic level, it must more and more be effected on a pure corporal level, inwards with pills and outwards with surveillance techniques \u2013 something happening not without implications for the function of democracy in liberal societies.\n\nMore generally this book describes and analyses \u2013 one year before the big [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] \u2013 the potentially destructive effects of (neo)liberalism, not only on the market economy, but also and particularly on other fields of human expression such as [[politics]], use of symbols, [[semiotics]], [[psychology]]... And not to disregard what contains everything: how to handle one's own living.\n\n===A world of \"self love\"===\nIn ''La cit\u00e9 perverse \u2013 lib\u00e9ralisme et pornographie'',<ref>http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-la-cit%C3%A9-perverse-lib%C3%A9ralisme-et-pornographie-de-dany-robert-dufour.html</ref> 2009 (''Perverted Society - Liberalism and Pornography'') Dufour attempts to display that the economical and financial crisis starting in October 2009 has provided us with at least one advantage: it has revealed the perverted mechanisms regulating the function of today's society.\n\nWe live in a world that has made [[selfishness|egoism]] ([[Adam Smith]]'s \"self love\"<ref>Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature & Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol 1 ch 2 \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages\u201d</ref>) its foremost principle. This principle henceforth commands all forms of conduct, whether in the uppermost classes, among juvenile dilinquents or the middle-classes. Destructive for the notions of \"being together\" or \"being your-self\" it urges us to live in a perverted society: [[pornography]], selfishness, contestation of every law whatsoever, acceptance of [[social darwinism]]. It makes [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]] a tool and results in our world becoming [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]]-ish. It extolls henceforth the alliance between [[Adam Smith]] and [[Marquis de Sade]]. \n \nAgainst the old moral order, which summoned everyone to master his passions and urges, Dufour proposes that a new order has substituted the old one and that it is now, on the contrary,  fashionable to display one's passions and urges regardless of any consequences. He analyses today's world as a result of the revolution of western [[metaphysics]] during the century between [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s puritan philosophy and de Sade's porno fixated one (philosophie puritaine \u2013 philosophie \"putaine\").\n\nde Sade had so well demonstrated how a world subject to the principle of absolute egoism would appear that he was to be imprisoned for 27 years and his books to be concealed in the archives of libraries for two centuries. Dufour investigates de Sade's return, first masked, then overtly, during the 20th century and the world which will become the result of this. He also tries to indicate some ways to escape this (a)moral trap.\n\n::These three books might be qualified as a trilogy of criticism of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[anthropology]].\n\n== Reconstruction of a humanistic civilisation ==\n\n===Renaissance 2.0===\n''L'individu qui vient \u2026 apr\u00e8s le lib\u00e9ralisme''<ref>[http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-l-individu-qui-vient-apres-le-liberalisme-de-dany-robert-dufour.html]</ref> (\"The Individual that Appears \u2026 after liberalism\"), published in 2011, is a new step in Dufour's work. He considers that he has sufficiently [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] the liberal anthropology in his previous works and is now to enter a constructive line of work in his research for new possible [[axiom]]s for a real civilizational policy.\n\nHe first states that western civilization, after a century of two forceful turbulences, [[nazism]] and [[stalinism]], now is drawn into today's [[neoliberalism]]. This produces a crisis in a hitherto unseen extension, the nature of which is political, economical, ecological, moral, subjective, esthetical, intellectual \u2026\n\nDufour, however, sees nothing fatal in this third historical dead end during a century. As a philosopher he considers possibilities to resist this latest [[totalitarianism]] which step by step changes and destroys various expressions of human culture.\n\nDufour sees no other solution than resuming things where they have been discontinued by this new religion which he in his previous works has called ''le divin March\u00e9'' (The Divine Market). \nLike all religions a promise makes it function: salvation by continual growth of riches \u2013 a precipitous fleeing ahead leading to global devastation according to Dufour. To avoid such fate he proposes a return to the heart of civilization in order to find the necessary principles for a re-creation. In his opinion our civilization is in possession of the necessary resources for its [[renaissance]].\n\nFor this reason he proposes to map the foundations for that western narrative which has wrecked facing \"The Divine Market\".\nHe proposes to go back to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] and  his public  ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'' which has been called the \"Manifesto of the Renaissance\".\n\nWhat it is all about is the perspective of a new [[Renaissance]], new dynamics like those during the [[Quattrocento]] when knowledge was attained  how to retrieve the fundaments of Greek civilization and, supported by this, how to overcome the grip of obscure  tenets  dominating general thinking. What Dufour proposes then is to retrieve the civilizational process where it was interrupted in order to obtain the individual who dares to think and act by her/himself while giving the same right to [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]]. An individual cured from that egoism that is at present exalted to general law (Adam Smith's ''self love''). An individual well prepared to meet with any type of flock mentality whether in the form of fanatical mass movements or the present tyranny (without a tyrant) of mass consumption.\n\n===Today's civilization - a madness===\nIn ''Le d\u00e9lire occidental'' (Occidental Madness),<ref>http://livre.fnac.com/a7551982/Dany-Robert-Dufour-Le-delire-occidental, 2014</ref> Dufour starts from what [[Descartes]] argued in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'': humans make themselves masters and owners of nature. This marks a turn in human progress that has led to the gradual development of thinking in terms of machinery and productivity and the present boost of technology as supreme value.\n\nIf this occidental madness today causes problems, it is because it has become worldwide: the neoliberal globalization without limitation exploiting everything, including people and environment. A madness which, like all forms of madness, is doomed to crash against reality. On the one hand because its pretentious omnipotence and illimited arrogance inevitably blocks it: our earth is already forcefully reacting to the ongoing vandalization. On the other hand, because this madness in an obvious way changes the three basic spheres of human life, which are ''work, leisure'' and ''love'', by voiding them of all substance.\n*''Work'' is no longer creative, but [[Social alienation|alienating]] and mind-numbing as a result of  a more and more distorted organization of work ([[taylorism]], [[fordism]], [[toyotism]]/[[lean management]]).\n*''Leisure'', which once was working on and realisation of oneself ([[otium]]), is now invaded by [[consumerism]].\n*As to ''love'', it is profoundly reconfigurated in two ways: partly by transforming sensual [[eroticism]] into pornography, partly by unconditionally promising realisation of all forms of fancy. \n \nThis is thoroughly scrutinized in the book. \nYet, all is not lost: a new reason, free from this madness, is conjured up and the contours of it are sketched up.\n\n====Three madnesses \u2026====\nIn his book \"''La situation d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sent me remplit d'espoir'' (The Present Situation Fills Me with Hope), 2016, Dany-Robert Dufour tries to illustrate how the ''Occidental madness'', founded on the \"will to always have more\" (what the Greeks called [[pleonexia]], greed), has resulted in nothing but provoking its contrary strife for purity. Which could be transformed into a new madness of \"fundamentalist\" expression, like for instance [[jihadism]], where the strife for a purity guaranteed by the original union with God, can alter into absolute igominy of spectacular deranged massacres of \"infidels\". This second madness leads in turn to a third madness, that of \"madness of identity\" which can cause civil wars in the search for \"alien elements\" to exterminate.\n\nThat is why the present day philosophical question, according to Dany-Robert Dufour, is about how to get out of these impasses.\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n{{Empty section|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Essays ==\n* ''Le B\u00e9gaiement des ma\u00eetres\u2009: [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]], [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss|L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]'', R\u00e9\u00e9d.

This marks a turn in human progress that has led to the gradual development of thinking in terms of machinery and productivity and the present boost of technology as supreme value.\n\nIf this occidental madness today causes problems, it is because it has become worldwide: the neoliberal globalization without limitation exploiting everything, including people and environment. A madness which, like all forms of madness, is doomed to crash against reality. On the one hand because its pretentious omnipotence and illimited arrogance inevitably blocks it: our earth is already forcefully reacting to the ongoing vandalization. On the other hand, because this madness in an obvious way changes the three basic spheres of human life, which are ''work, leisure'' and ''love'', by voiding them of all substance.\n*''Work'' is no longer creative, but [[Social alienation|alienating]] and mind-numbing as a result of  a more and more distorted organization of work ([[taylorism]], [[fordism]], [[toyotism]]/[[lean management]]).\n*''Leisure'', which once was working on and realisation of oneself ([[otium]]), is now invaded by [[consumerism]].\n*As to ''love'', it is profoundly reconfigurated in two ways: partly by transforming sensual [[eroticism]] into pornography, partly by unconditionally promising realisation of all forms of fancy. \n \nThis is thoroughly scrutinized in the book. \nYet, all is not lost: a new reason, free from this madness, is conjured up and the contours of it are sketched up.\n\n====Three madnesses \u2026====\nIn his book \"''La situation d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sent me remplit d'espoir'' (The Present Situation Fills Me with Hope), 2016, Dany-Robert Dufour tries to illustrate how the ''Occidental madness'', founded on the \"will to always have more\" (what the Greeks called [[pleonexia]], greed), has resulted in nothing but provoking its contrary strife for purity. Which could be transformed into a new madness of \"fundamentalist\" expression, like for instance [[jihadism]], where the strife for a purity guaranteed by the original union with God, can alter into absolute igominy of spectacular deranged massacres of \"infidels\". This second madness leads in turn to a third madness, that of \"madness of identity\" which can cause civil wars in the search for \"alien elements\" to exterminate.\n\nThat is why the present day philosophical question, according to Dany-Robert Dufour, is about how to get out of these impasses.\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n{{Empty section|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Essays ==\n* ''Le B\u00e9gaiement des ma\u00eetres\u2009: [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]], [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss|L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]'', R\u00e9\u00e9d.
