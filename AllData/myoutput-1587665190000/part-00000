He was an articulate champion of the grievances and anger of Upper Canada (Ontario). He played a major role in securing national unity.  His career in active politics faltered after 1865, but he remained a powerful spokesman for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] promoting westward expansion and opposing the policies of Conservative Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\n==Biography==\nGeorge Brown was born in [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]], Scotland, on November 29, 1818. His father, an evangelical Presbyterian, was committed to civil and religious liberty, progress, and laissez-faire economics. He was an enemy of Tory aristocratic privilege, and provided a good education for his son, who brought similar beliefs to the New World.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\n===New York City===\nThe family emigrated to New York in 1837, and began publishing newspapers.<ref name=\"DOCB\">{{ cite DCB |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brown_george_10E.html |title=BROWN, GEORGE |volume=10 |accessdate= September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBrown discovered he appreciated British parliamentarianism more than American republicanism. He visited Canada several times and was invited to move there in 1843 by Presbyterians.\n\n===Toronto===\n[[File:Toronto Globe 2 December, 1845.jpg|thumb|left|350px|December 99, 1845]]\n\nBrown began the Toronto ''Banner'' in 1843. It was a Presbyterian weekly supporting [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk]] principles and political reform. Brown's father raised the money and founded a weekly newspaper, ''The Globe'' in 1844, and later became a daily news source.  Filled with strong editorials on religious and political affairs, ''The Globe'' quickly became the leading Reform newspaper in the [[Province of Canada]].  In 1848, he was appointed to head a [[Royal Commission]] to examine  accusations of official misconduct in [[Kingston Penitentiary|Provincial Penitentiary of the Province of Upper Canada]] at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The \"Brown Report\", which Brown drafted early in 1849, included sufficient evidence of abuse to set in motion the termination of warden Henry Smith.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/> Brown's revelations of poor conditions at the Kingston penitentiary were heavily criticized by [[John A. Macdonald]] and contributed to the tense relationship between the two rival politicians.\n\n===Issues===\nBrown attacked slavery in the United States and in 1850, helped found the [[Anti-Slavery Society|Anti-Slavery Society of Canada]]. This society was founded to end the practice of slavery in [[North America]], and individual members aided former American slaves reach Canada via the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Anti-Slavery Society of Canada |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/anti-slavery-society-of-canada |last=Baker |first=Nathan |date=February 13, 2018 |language=en |access-date=November 27, 2018 }}</ref> As a result, black Canadians enthusiastically supported Brown's political ambitions.\n\nCatholics, however, were another matter. He vehemently ridiculed and denounced the [[Catholic Church]], Jesuits, priests, nunneries, etc.  His newspaper promoted the strident speeches of ex-Catholic priest [[Alessandro Gavazzi]], which incited [[Gavazzi Riots|mob violence in 1853 with nine dead in Montreal.]]<ref>Careless, ''Brown of the Globe'' 1:172-74</ref>\n\nBrown was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1851. He reorganized the [[Clear Grits|Clear Grit]] ([[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]) Party in 1857, supporting, among other things, the [[separation of church and state]], the annexation of [[Rupert's Land]], and a small government. But the most important issue for George Brown was representation by population, where electoral districts would be divided so that each one contained a roughly equal number of electors.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\nFrom the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, the Canadian colonial legislature had been composed of an equal number of members from Canada East (Lower Canada, Quebec) and Canada West (Upper Canada, Ontario, Canada). In 1841, Francophone-dominated Lower Canada had a larger population, and the British colonial administration hoped that the [[Canadiens]] in Lower Canada would be legislatively pacified by a coalition of Loyalists from Lower Canada with the Upper Canadian side.  But during the 1840s and 1850s, as the population of Upper Canada grew larger than the Canadien population of Lower Canada, the opposite became true. Brown believed that the larger population deserved to have more representatives, rather than an equal number from Upper and Lower Canada. Brown's pursuit of this goal of righting what he perceived to be a great wrong to Canada West<ref>{{cite book |first=P.

Macdonald lost the support of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] on a non-confidence vote and his cabinet had to resign. After [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] declined the opportunity, George Brown attempted to form a ministry with [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. At the time, newly appointed ministers had to resign their seats and run in by-elections. When members of Brown's ministry resigned their seats to get re-elected, supporters of Macdonald called for a vote of non-confidence, which passed and thus forced Brown and his government to resign before they had re-taken their seats. Brown was the de facto premier of [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Province of Canada]] in 1858. The short-lived administration was called the Brown-Dorion government, named after the co-premiers George Brown and [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. This episode was termed the \"double shuffle.\"<ref name=\"Careless\">{{cite book|last1=Careless|first1=JMS|title=The Union of the Canadas|url=https://archive.org/details/unionofcanadaoxf00jmsc|url-access=registration|date=1967|publisher=McClelland and Stewart Ltd|location=Toronto}}</ref>\n\n== Confederation ==\n[[Image:George Brown Monument, Queens Park, Toronto, Ontario.jpg|thumb|Monument to George Brown at Queen's Park, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, circa 1910]]\n\nGeorge Brown resigned from the [[Great Coalition|Coalition]] in 1865 because he was not happy with the United States.  Brown thought Canada should pursue free trade, while the conservative government of John A. Macdonald and Alexander Galt thought Canada should increase tariffs.\n\nDuring the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], Brown argued strongly in favour of an appointed [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].

As leader of the provincial [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]], he also ran for a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. His intention was to become [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] but he failed to win election to either chamber. He was widely seen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]] in the [[1867 Canadian federal election|1867 federal election]]. The Liberals were officially leaderless until 1873, but Brown was considered the party's \"elder statesman\" even without a seat in the House of Commons, and was regularly consulted by leading Liberal parliamentarians. Brown was made a senator in 1873.<ref>{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Brown, George (1818-1880)|first=Edward Irving |last=Carlyle}}</ref>\n\n== Post-parliamentary career and death ==\n[[Image:Attempted Assassination of George Brown.jpg|thumb|right|Fatal shooting of George Brown, Toronto]]   Brown fought endless battles with the typographical union from 1843 to 1872.

Macdonald]].\n\n==Biography==\nGeorge Brown was born in [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]], Scotland, on November 29, 1818. His father, an evangelical Presbyterian, was committed to civil and religious liberty, progress, and laissez-faire economics. He was an enemy of Tory aristocratic privilege, and provided a good education for his son, who brought similar beliefs to the New World.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\n===New York City===\nThe family emigrated to New York in 1837, and began publishing newspapers.<ref name=\"DOCB\">{{ cite DCB |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brown_george_10E.html |title=BROWN, GEORGE |volume=10 |accessdate= September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBrown discovered he appreciated British parliamentarianism more than American republicanism. He visited Canada several times and was invited to move there in 1843 by Presbyterians.\n\n===Toronto===\n[[File:Toronto Globe 2 December, 1845.jpg|thumb|left|350px|December 99, 1845]]\n\nBrown began the Toronto ''Banner'' in 1843. It was a Presbyterian weekly supporting [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk]] principles and political reform. Brown's father raised the money and founded a weekly newspaper, ''The Globe'' in 1844, and later became a daily news source.  Filled with strong editorials on religious and political affairs, ''The Globe'' quickly became the leading Reform newspaper in the [[Province of Canada]].  In 1848, he was appointed to head a [[Royal Commission]] to examine  accusations of official misconduct in [[Kingston Penitentiary|Provincial Penitentiary of the Province of Upper Canada]] at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The \"Brown Report\", which Brown drafted early in 1849, included sufficient evidence of abuse to set in motion the termination of warden Henry Smith.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/> Brown's revelations of poor conditions at the Kingston penitentiary were heavily criticized by [[John A. Macdonald]] and contributed to the tense relationship between the two rival politicians.\n\n===Issues===\nBrown attacked slavery in the United States and in 1850, helped found the [[Anti-Slavery Society|Anti-Slavery Society of Canada]]. This society was founded to end the practice of slavery in [[North America]], and individual members aided former American slaves reach Canada via the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Anti-Slavery Society of Canada |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/anti-slavery-society-of-canada |last=Baker |first=Nathan |date=February 13, 2018 |language=en |access-date=November 27, 2018 }}</ref> As a result, black Canadians enthusiastically supported Brown's political ambitions.\n\nCatholics, however, were another matter. He vehemently ridiculed and denounced the [[Catholic Church]], Jesuits, priests, nunneries, etc.  His newspaper promoted the strident speeches of ex-Catholic priest [[Alessandro Gavazzi]], which incited [[Gavazzi Riots|mob violence in 1853 with nine dead in Montreal.]]<ref>Careless, ''Brown of the Globe'' 1:172-74</ref>\n\nBrown was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1851. He reorganized the [[Clear Grits|Clear Grit]] ([[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]) Party in 1857, supporting, among other things, the [[separation of church and state]], the annexation of [[Rupert's Land]], and a small government. But the most important issue for George Brown was representation by population, where electoral districts would be divided so that each one contained a roughly equal number of electors.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\nFrom the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, the Canadian colonial legislature had been composed of an equal number of members from Canada East (Lower Canada, Quebec) and Canada West (Upper Canada, Ontario, Canada). In 1841, Francophone-dominated Lower Canada had a larger population, and the British colonial administration hoped that the [[Canadiens]] in Lower Canada would be legislatively pacified by a coalition of Loyalists from Lower Canada with the Upper Canadian side.  But during the 1840s and 1850s, as the population of Upper Canada grew larger than the Canadien population of Lower Canada, the opposite became true. Brown believed that the larger population deserved to have more representatives, rather than an equal number from Upper and Lower Canada. Brown's pursuit of this goal of righting what he perceived to be a great wrong to Canada West<ref>{{cite book |first=P.

Macdonald lost the support of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] on a non-confidence vote and his cabinet had to resign. After [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] declined the opportunity, George Brown attempted to form a ministry with [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. At the time, newly appointed ministers had to resign their seats and run in by-elections. When members of Brown's ministry resigned their seats to get re-elected, supporters of Macdonald called for a vote of non-confidence, which passed and thus forced Brown and his government to resign before they had re-taken their seats. Brown was the de facto premier of [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Province of Canada]] in 1858. The short-lived administration was called the Brown-Dorion government, named after the co-premiers George Brown and [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]].

Brown thought Canada should pursue free trade, while the conservative government of John A. Macdonald and Alexander Galt thought Canada should increase tariffs.\n\nDuring the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], Brown argued strongly in favour of an appointed [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].  Like many reformers of the time, he saw Upper Houses as inherently conservative in function, serving to protect the interests of the rich, and wished to deny the Senate the legitimacy and power that naturally follows with an electoral mandate.<ref>{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Moore |title=1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal |location=Toronto |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-5519-9483-3 |pp=107\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the Quebec Conference pleased Brown particularly by the prospect for the end of Lower Canadian interference in the affairs of Canada West.   \"Is it not wonderful?\" he wrote to his wife Anne after the Quebec Conference, \"French-Canadianism is entirely extinguished.\"<ref>Brown Papers, George Brown to Anne Brown, October 15, 1864.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |chapter=George Brown and the Mother of Confederation |title=Careless at Work: Selected Canadian historical studies |url={{google books|ezMooPjieAEC|plainurl=yes|page=77}} |publisher=Dundurn |location=Toronto |date=1996 |p=77 |isbn=978-1-4597-1340-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first=J.M.S. |last=Careless |title=George Brown and the Mother of Confederation |publisher=Canadian Historical Association |conference=Report of the Annual Meeting |date=1960 |p=71}}</ref><ref name=Gwyn319>[[#Gwyn2009|Gwyn (2009)]], p. 319</ref>  By this he may have meant either that he was of the view that English-speaking Canada West had emerged triumphant over French Canadians<ref>[[#Waite2001|Waite (2001)]], p. 113</ref> or that Confederation would put an end to French Canadian domination of the affairs of what would become the province of Ontario.<ref name=Gwyn319/>\n\nBrown realized, nevertheless, that satisfaction for Canada West would not be achieved without the support of the French-speaking majority of Canada East.

As leader of the provincial [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]], he also ran for a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. His intention was to become [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] but he failed to win election to either chamber. He was widely seen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]] in the [[1867 Canadian federal election|1867 federal election]]. The Liberals were officially leaderless until 1873, but Brown was considered the party's \"elder statesman\" even without a seat in the House of Commons, and was regularly consulted by leading Liberal parliamentarians. Brown was made a senator in 1873.<ref>{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Brown, George (1818-1880)|first=Edward Irving |last=Carlyle}}</ref>\n\n== Post-parliamentary career and death ==\n[[Image:Attempted Assassination of George Brown.jpg|thumb|right|Fatal shooting of George Brown, Toronto]]   Brown fought endless battles with the typographical union from 1843 to 1872.
