Nevertheless, beginning with a small investment from money saved from menial jobs, he bought into the [[penny arcade]] business. Shortly after, in partnership with [[Adolph Zukor]] and others, he founded the successful but short-lived [[Automatic Vaudeville Company]] which established a chain of arcades across several cities. After the company dissolved in 1904 Loew converted his share of the business into [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]s and over time he turned Loew's Theatres into a leading chain of vaudeville and [[movie theater]]s in the United States.\n\nBy 1905, Marcus Loew was on his own and his success eventually necessitated that he secure a steady flow of product for his theaters. In 1904, he founded the People's Vaudeville Company, a theater chain which showcased one-reel films as well as live variety shows. In 1910, the company had considerably expanded and was renamed Loew's Consolidated Enterprises. His associates included [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Joseph Schenck]], and [[Nicholas Schenck]]. In addition to theaters, Loew and the Schencks expanded the [[Fort George Amusement Park]] in upper Manhattan.\n\n[[Image:1914 MarcusLoew his 42ndSt office NYC.png|thumb|left|Marcus Loew in his office, ca.1914]]\nBy 1913, Loew operated a large number of theaters in New York City including the [[American Music Hall]], Avenue A Theatre, Avenue B Theatre, [[Broadway Theatre (41st Street)|Broadway Theatre]] (41st St.), Circle Theatre, and the Columbia Theatre in Brooklyn. Other Loew-operated theaters were the Delancey St. Theatre, Greeley Sq. Theatre, [[Herald Square Theatre]], Liberty Theatre, Brooklyn, Lincoln Sq.

Loew preferred to remain in New York overseeing the growing chain of Loew's Theatres. Film production had been gravitating toward southern California since 1913. By 1917 he oversaw a number of enterprises: Borough Theatre Co., Empress Amusement Corp., Fort George Amusement Co., Glendive Amusement Corp., Greeley Square Amusement Co., Loew's Consolidated Enterprise, Loew's Theatrical Enterprises, Mascot Amusement Co., Natonia Amusement Co., People's Vaudeville Co.<ref>Directory of directors in the city of New York, 1917-1918</ref> In 1919, Loew reorganized the company under the name Loew's, Inc.<ref>Poor's and Moody's manual, 1921</ref>\n\nIn 1920, Loew purchased [[Metro Pictures|Metro Pictures Corporation]]. A few years later, he acquired a controlling interest in the financially troubled [[Goldwyn Picture Corporation]] which at that point was controlled by theater impresario [[Lee Shubert]]. Goldwyn Pictures owned the \"[[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]]\" trademark and studio property in [[Culver City, California]]. But without its founder [[Samuel Goldwyn]], the Goldwyn studio lacked strong management. With Loew's vice president [[Nicholas Schenck]] needed in New York City to help manage the large [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie theater operations, Loew had to find a qualified executive to take charge of this new [[Los Angeles]] entity.\n\nLoew recalled meeting a film producer named [[Louis B. Mayer]] who had been operating a successful, if modest, studio in east Los Angeles. Mayer had been making low budget melodramas for a number of years, marketing them primarily to women. Since he rented most of his equipment and hired most of his stars on a per-picture basis, Loew wasn't after Mayer's brick and mortar business; he wanted Mayer and his Chief of Production, the former [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] executive, [[Irving Thalberg]]. Nicholas Schenck was dispatched to finalize the deal that ultimately resulted in the formation of Metro-Goldwyn Pictures in April 1924 with Mayer as the studio head and Thalberg chief of production.\n\nMayer's company folded into Metro Goldwyn with two notable additions: Mayer Pictures' contracts with key [[director (film)|director]]s such as [[Fred Niblo]] and [[John M. Stahl]], and up-and-coming actress [[Norma Shearer]], later married to Thalberg. Mayer would eventually be rewarded by having his name added to the company. Loews Inc. would act as MGM's financier and retain controlling interest for decades.\n\nWhile immediately successful, Loew didn't live  to see the powerhouse that MGM was to become. He died three years later in 1927 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 57 at his country home in [[Glen Cove, New York]].
