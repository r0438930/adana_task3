John Mare was a supporter of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary]] cause from the time he came to North Carolina, providing supplies for the state's troops during the war. When [[Albemarle Sound]] was invaded by the British, he contributed £1,000 to the effort to battle their forces.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> In 1780 a ship of which he was part owner, the ''Fair American'', was captured by the British, causing him significant financial loss;<ref name=\"NCReview\"/> among its passengers, who were transported to [[London]], was future [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]] [[Thomas Wynns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000786|title=WYNNS, Thomas - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref>

John Mare married again while in North Carolina, in 1784;<ref name=\"CaldwellRoque1994\"/> his second wife was Marion Boyd Wells, a widow.

John Mare's nephew, son of Mary, was the painter [[William Joseph Williams]].<ref name=\"NCReview\"/>

===Public life===
John Mare served as Edenton's first postmaster beginning in 1786.<ref name=\"answers.com\"/> He also served in numerous other public capacities in [[Chowan County, North Carolina|Chowan County]]; he was county coroner from 1786 to 1788, and also in 1786 became Edenton's town treasurer.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> He was first called to serve on the [[grand jury]] in March 1785.<ref name=\"NCReview\"/> In 1789 he became a town commissioner, and served in both capacities from some years. He became a [[justice of the peace]] in 1787, and held that role until 1799; he often served as an auditor of legal accounts during this time.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/>

In 1787 Governor [[Samuel Johnston]] appointed John Mare to the [[North Carolina Council of State]].  He served three terms on the council,<ref name=\"CaldwellRoque1994\"/> and was renominated yet again in 1789; as Johnston did not take up his reappointment as governor, John Mare was not reappointed at this time.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> In that same year John Mare was chosen to represent Edenton at the convention in which North Carolina ratified the [[United States Constitution]]; he voted for ratification.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/>

John Mare was a Mason,<ref name=\"CaldwellRoque1994\"/> and is known to have attended Masonic meetings in Albany in 1772.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> He later transferred his membership to St. John's Lodge No. 2 (now St. John's Lodge No. 1, A.Y.M.) in New York City before transferring it again, this time to Unanimity Lodge in Edenton, in 1778.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/>  He became master of this lodge in 1779, and for twenty years remained its mainspring.  John Mare is also believed to have assisted in drafting the constitution of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina; he presided over the convention in [[Tarboro, North Carolina|Tarboro]] which revived it in 1787,<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> having been elected with [[Stephen Cabarrus]] to represent Edenton.<ref name=\"NCReview\"/> He was also a prominent member of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church in Chowan County.<ref name=\"CaldwellRoque1994\"/>

==Work==
Not much is known of Mare's training, although his portraits share some of the characteristics found in the work of colonial New York painter [[Thomas McIlworth]].<ref name=\"answers.com\"/>  His earliest surviving portrait, of fewer than a dozen known,<ref name=\"answers.com\"/> is of Henry Livingston, dating to 1760;<ref name=\"answers.com\"/> a painting of Henry's brother Robert, similar in appearance, is unsigned and undated, but presumed to be his work also.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/>  Both are believed to be copies of works by [[John Wollaston (painter)|John Wollaston]],<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> as is Mare's portrait of Henry Lloyd of Boston, dating to around 1767.<ref name=\"CaldwellRoque1994\"/>  In 1766 the Common Council of New York commissioned a portrait of [[George III of Great Britain|George III]].  A 1767 portrait of John Keteltas<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> (in the [[New York Historical Society]] collection) is distinguished by a ''trompe l'oeil'' [[house fly]] on the sitter's cuff, poised as if on the surface of the painting.<ref name=\"answers.com\"/> In 1768, again in Boston, Mare painted John Torrey; he is presumed to have painted Torrey's brother William as well.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> A portrait of Gerard Beekman from 1769 is believed to be by the artist, as is an undated portrait of an unknown member of the Werden-Wilcocks family.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> In 1772, during his return sojourn in Albany, Mare painted [[Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet|John Johnson]],<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/> a portrait which today hangs in [[Johnson Hall]] in [[Johnstown, New York|Johnstown]].<ref name=\"NCReview\"/>

A pastel portrait by Mare in the [[Shelburne Museum]] is also known; it depicts John C. Couvenhoven, and is dated 1774.<ref>[http://www.pastellists.com/Articles/MARE.pdf Biography] at Dictionary of pastellists before 1800</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/record/siris_ari_63070|title=John Couvenhoven (1752–1805), (painting) – Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution|work=si.edu|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> Also dating from that year is a portrait of Dr. Benjamin Youngs Prime, currently in the New York Historical Society collection;<ref name=\"answers.com\"/> these two are the last dated portraits ascribed to Mare, and it appears he stopped painting at this point.<ref name=\"ncpedia.org\"/>

Mare's best-known work today is the portrait of merchant Jeremiah Platt currently in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"CaldwellRoque1994\"/> It is thinly painted; rather than apply [[glaze (painting technique)|glazing]], the artist chose to blend still-wet pigments on the surface of the painting to create texture.<ref name=\"SaundersMiles1987\"/> The portrait is the only one of its kind, three-quarter length, known by the artist's hand; judging by the prominence he gives to the chair on which Platt leans, and the [[damask]] drapery background, it appears that he was unfamiliar with the format and compensated accordingly.<ref name=\"SaundersMiles1987\"/> The portrait suggests knowledge of the work of [[John Singleton Copley]], and is adjudged as Mare's most successful known piece; he is otherwise thought of as an average painter, and his style has been described as \"stiff and awkward\".<ref name=\"CaldwellRoque1994\"/>

'''''12 Inches of Snow''''' is the debut album by Canadian [[reggae]] musician [[Snow (musician)|Snow]], released in 1993.

==Production==
After M.C. Shan discovered Snow through a Canadian DJ Prince Marvin, he began recording songs with Snow in New York in the Basement of his house at 169-05 Union Turnpike Queens NYC with his first Wife at the time Terri Moltke, currently Terri Tucker shopped his tape and live with Snow to several record labels offering a live demonstration of the tape to include Select Records and other Labels. The times were tough for the Moltke's as MC Shan did not receive marketing support from Warner Bros Cold Chillin' Records for his new album \"Play It Again Shan\". During the pregnancy of their second child, Terri Moltke-Tucker took Snow on the train all over Mahattan, N.Y.C. in the winter months of 1992 after, Michael Grier, Edmond Leary (AKIM), MC Shan, Terri Moltke all banged out what they thought was their best work ever. Terri Moltke stood in a coin laundry mat across from a Dunkin Donuts and next to a Seven 7 Eleven 11 store waiting for call backs from labels. Finally the pay phone wars with laundry patrons grew old day after day and Terri asked David Eng the Owner of Bayside Studios stating she could she use his reception service at the studio for call backs from labels for their Artist \"Snow\" whom she labeled as the next big ICON. David asked Terri if he could hear the Artist since he and Steve Salem his business partner just started a Record Label \"Mo Jam Records\" and she arranged a meeting with managers David Kenneth Eng and EZ Steve Salem (Same day signed a Management Deal) in their basement, and who also signed Snow to \"Mo Jam Records\". While awaiting trial for assault with a crowbar fight outside of a Canadian Pub and murder charges eight (8) Months later Snow was acquitted, Shan and Snow began mixing the completed album down at the Bayside Studios. The inspiration for the song [[Informer (song)|Informer]] stemmed from a late night incident across the street from Snow's Allenbury home. Thus, the song described how a detective incorrectly accused Snow of \"stabbing someone down the lane.\" The song also chronicled Snow's incarceration at [[Toronto East Detention Centre]] and prison life.<ref name=\"See 1993\">See: 12 Inches of Snow, VHS (New York: A-Vision, 1993)</ref>

Shan described the album as not \"raw, straight-up\" reggae but more of a hybrid album fusing pop, jazz, reggae, and hip hop resulting in \"mass appeal.\" Indeed, the songs \"Informer,\" \"Runway,\" \"Champion Sound,\" and \"Lonely Monday Morning,\" were [[dancehall]] tracks performed in [[Jamaican Patois]]. Shan recorded \"Drunken Styles,\" another song performed entirely in patois, after Snow and the recording crew celebrated at a nearby tavern in Bayside Queens after a studio session whereas a tipsy Snow performed the entire track free style.<ref name=\"See 1993\"/>

Other songs, such as \"Lady With the Red Dress,\" \"Girl I've Been Hurt,\" \"Uhh in You,\" and \"Hey, Pretty Love,\" mixed love ballads and dance tracks with patois. \"Ease Up,\" \"Creative Child,\" and \"50 Ways (To Flip a Style),\" were hip-hop inspired songs.<ref name=\"See 1993\"/>

===Legal dispute===
While touring as Snow's DJ in December 1994, Marvin Prince abruptly left the tour after discovering Snow \"was receiving more money from management than he was.\" While listed as only the co-writer of the song \"Runway\" on the 12&nbsp;inches of Snow album, Prince claimed to have co-written five songs and co-produced the album with Shan, Eng, and Salem. Furthermore, Prince alleged that Eng and Salem provided \"a draft of a multi-album production and recording agreement\" for both Snow and himself. Unable to understand the contract, Prince allegedly \"sent a copy to his mother to get legal advice from her friend\" and \"never saw the agreement again.\" Moreover, Prince claimed to have entered an \"oral agreement\" with Snow implying that the two would share profits from the album \"fifty-fifty.\" The first agreement, Prince alleged, occurred \"in 1990, when the two men began working together on songs in\" Prince's \"basement\" and he \"allegedly suggested to\" Snow, \"if something comes out of this, let's be partners.\" The second oral agreement, according to Prince, took place in August 1991 while Snow \"auditioned for Shan.\" While Snow frequently referred to Prince as his partner in promotional videos, he claimed to have used the term \"only in the slang sense.\" Prince, moreover, \"admitted that these discussions were not concrete; the parties never organized a formal business plan, nor was plaintiff in New York to advance defendant's career.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13886394386652351580&q=Prince+v.+O%27BRIEN,+256+AD2d+208&hl=en&as_sdt=100000000000002&as_vis=1 |title=Prince v.

'''James P. Conrad''' (born February 12, 1977) is an American retired [[soccer]] player who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]]. During his 13-year MLS career, he was four-time [[MLS Best XI]] and the 2005 [[MLS Defender of the Year Award|MLS Defender of the Year]]. He also earned 27 [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team]] and went to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. After his playing career Conrad has worked in the media industry <ref>{{cite web|last=Laird |first=Sam |url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/19/soccer-youtube-jimmy-conrad-kick-tv/#0nOvi.RJSkqM |title=A Soccer Star's Transition From the Pitch to YouTube |publisher=Mashable |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}</ref> and currently stars on his [[YouTube]] channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJimmyConrad Jimmy Conrad]. He currently serves as the head coach of [[USL League Two]] side [[San Francisco Glens]].

==Career==

===High school and college===
Born in [[Arcadia, California]], Conrad attended [[Temple City High School]] in [[Temple City, California]] and was a four-year letterman in soccer. Conrad played at [[San Diego State University]] in 1994 and 1995, and then transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. While playing for UCLA, he was a member of the 1997 [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA Championship]] team.

===Professional===
Undrafted by MLS, Conrad had an unsuccessful trial with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]].  However, the Galaxy coaching staff recommended he play for one of their affiliated lower division teams.  Consequently, Conrad contacted the now-defunct [[San Diego Flash]] of the [[USL First Division|A-League]] which gave him a contract.  In 1999, [[Brian Quinn (soccer)|Brian Quinn]] became the head coach of the [[San Jose Clash]].  When Quinn began searching for an additional defender and goalkeeper for the Clash, [[Ralf Wilhelms]], head coach of the Flash and a former teammate of Quinn on the [[San Diego Sockers (1974–96)|San Diego Sockers]], recommended Conrad and Flash goalkeeper [[Joe Cannon (soccer)|Joe Cannon]].<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/20060118-9999-lz1s18soccr-1.html Often-overlooked Jimmy Conrad, now with national team, has proved doubters wrong]</ref>  The Clash signed Conrad that year.  He played with the club, later re-branded as the Earthquakes, for four seasons, helping them to the [[MLS Cup]] in 2001. In 2000, he also played for [[Lech Poznań]] in Poland.

In 2003, Conrad was traded to the Wizards for a second-round draft pick, which the 'Quakes used to select [[Arturo Álvarez (footballer, born 1985)|Arturo Alvarez]]. Conrad's stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he helped the Wizards to the [[US Open Cup]] and the MLS Cup Final as the leader of the league's stingiest defense and was named to the league's [[MLS Best XI|Best XI]] and was a finalist for [[MLS Defender of the Year Award]]. He won the award a year later.

Despite rumors of a possible European transfer following the Wizards' disappointing 2006 season, Conrad renewed his contract with the Wizards beginning the 2007 season, and new head coach [[Curt Onalfo]] rewarded him the club captaincy.

Conrad was out of contract after the [[2010 MLS season]] and elected to participate in the [[2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft]]. On December 15, 2010 Conrad was selected by [[Chivas USA]] in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft |title=Wolff goes 1st in Stage 2 Re-Entry Draft, Ángel to LA  |work=www.mlssoccer.com |publisher=Major League Soccer |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219135941/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft |archivedate=19 December 2010 |quote=Wolff's former Kansas City teammate Jimmy Conrad also went in the early going on Wednesday, taken second overall by Chivas USA.

After struggling with injury during the 2011 season, and suffering from side effects of six concussions, Jimmy Conrad announced his retirement from professional soccer on August 18, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ratterree |first=Alicia |url=http://www.thegoatparade.com/2011/8/17/2369285/jimmy-conrad-retires-from-mls |title=Jimmy Conrad Retires from MLS |publisher=The Goat Parade |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>

===International===
Conrad received his first cap for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] on July 7, 2005, in a [[2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] match against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. Less than one year later, Conrad made the U.S. roster for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. In Germany, Conrad came in as a substitute against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the team's 1–1 draw with the eventual champions, and played all ninety minutes against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. On January 20, 2007, Conrad captained the national team for the second time, where the United States hosted an international [[Exhibition game|friendly]] with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. The U.S. won that match 3–1. On February 7, 2007, in an international friendly with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], Conrad was named the [[Man of the Match]]. He scored his first-ever goal for the U.S. in the fifty-second minute of that match. On June 25, 2009, after not having played with the national team in previous qualifying, Conrad was named to the U.S. squad for the upcoming [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usmen.american-soccer-news.com/?p=250|title=Article from American Soccer News|publisher=Usmen.american-soccer-news.com|accessdate=2012-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224183627/http://usmen.american-soccer-news.com/?p=250|archive-date=2012-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The U.S. won that match 3–1. On February 7, 2007, in an international friendly with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], Conrad was named the [[Man of the Match]]. He scored his first-ever goal for the U.S. in the fifty-second minute of that match. On June 25, 2009, after not having played with the national team in previous qualifying, Conrad was named to the U.S. squad for the upcoming [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usmen.american-soccer-news.com/?p=250|title=Article from American Soccer News|publisher=Usmen.american-soccer-news.com|accessdate=2012-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224183627/http://usmen.american-soccer-news.com/?p=250|archive-date=2012-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

'''Structural unemployment''' is a form of [[involuntary unemployment]] caused by a mismatch between the skills that workers in the economy can offer, and the skills demanded of workers by employers (also known as the '''skills gap''').  Structural unemployment is often brought about by [[technological change]]s that make the job skills of many workers obsolete. 

Structural unemployment is one of three categories of unemployment distinguished by [[economics|economists]], the others being [[frictional unemployment]] and [[cyclical unemployment]].

Because it requires either migration or re-training, structural unemployment can be long-term and slow to fix.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5955NE20091006 | work=Reuters | title=Structural unemployment crisis stalking U.S. economy | date=October 6, 2009}}</ref>

== Causes and examples ==
{{further|Technological unemployment|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}

From an individual perspective, structural unemployment can be due to:
* Inability to afford or decision not to pursue further education or [[On-the-job training|job training]].
* Choice of a field of study which did not produce marketable job skills.
* Inability to afford relocation.
* Inability to relocate due to inability to sell a house (for example due to the collapse of a [[real estate bubble]] or of the local economy).
* Decision not to relocate, in order to stay with a spouse, family, friends, etc.<ref>[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr566.pdf Mismatch Unemployment], Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 566, June 2013; accessed 2016-06-17]</ref>

From a larger perspective, there can be a number of reasons for structural unemployment across large numbers of workers:
* Technological [[obsolescence]] makes a specific expertise useless.  For example, demand for manual typesetters disappeared with digitization of printing plate production.
* [[Productivity]] increases reduce the number of workers (with the same or similar skills) needed to satisfy [[demand]].
* New technology significantly increases productivity, but requires a smaller number of higher-skilled workers.  For example, fewer agricultural workers are needed when the work is [[mechanized agriculture|mechanized]]; those that remain must be trained to operate equipment.  Another common example is the use of [[industrial robot]]s to automate manufacturing. A study by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne found in 2013 that almost half of U.S jobs are at risk of automation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A.|date=2017-01-01|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=114|pages=254–280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625}}</ref>
* Competition causes the same jobs to move to a different location, and workers do not or cannot follow.  Examples:
** Manufacturing jobs in the [[United States]] moved from what are now called [[Rust Belt]] cities to lower-cost cities in the South and rural areas.
** [[Globalization]] has caused many manufacturing jobs to move from high-wage to low-wage countries.
** [[Free trade agreement]]s can cause jobs to move as competitive advantage changes.
* Political changes, for example the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].

Large-scale changes in the economy can be particularly challenging.  For example, if a large company is the only employer in a given industry for a certain city, when it closes workers will have no competing company to move to, and the local education system and government will be burdened with many people who need job re-training all at once (possibly at the same time the local economy fails to create new jobs due to decreased overall demand).

Employers may also reject workers for reasons unrelated to skills or geography, so for example structural unemployment can also result from [[discrimination]].

While temporary changes in overall demand for labor cause [[cyclical unemployment]], structural unemployment can be caused by temporary changes in demand from different industries. For example, [[seasonal unemployment]] often affects [[farm worker]]s after harvesting is complete, and workers in [[resort town]]s after the tourist season ends.  The [[dot-com bubble]] caused a temporary spike in demand for information technology workers, which was suddenly reversed in 2000–2001.

Structural unemployment is often associated with workers being unable to shift from industry to industry, but it can also happen within industries as technology changes the nature of work within a given field.<ref>[http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2012/04/the-structure-of-the-structural-unemployment-question.html The structure of the structural unemployment question], Macroblog, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, April 9, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17</ref><ref>[http://burning-glass.com/research/production-skills-gap/ Production Skills Gap], Burning Glass Technologies, Jan. 8, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> This is a driver of skills gaps as technology and globalization \"hollow out\" many middle-skill jobs, positions that traditionally have not required a college degree.<ref>[http://burning-glass.com/research/middle-skills/ Bridge the Gap: Rebuilding America’s Middle Skills], Harvard Business School, Accenture, and Burning Glass Technologies, Nov. 14, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref>

== Relation to other unemployment ==

Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from [[frictional unemployment]], except to say that for any given individual it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to easily abolish this type of unemployment.

[[Seasonal unemployment]] may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment, since it is a type of unemployment that is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction work, migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques.

Structural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent [[cyclical unemployment]]: if an economy suffers from long-lasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, while their skills (including job-searching skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete.<ref>[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150423214253/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/Long-Term-Unemployment.pdf \"Long-Term Unemployment,\"] Rockefeller Foundation, May 2016; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> Problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of [[poverty]]. This means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers.

Some economists posit that the minimum wage is in part to blame for structural unemployment, although structural unemployment does exist even in the absence of a minimum wage. They assert that because the governmentally imposed minimum wage is higher than some individuals' [[marginal revenue product]] in any given job, those individuals remain unemployed because employers legally cannot pay them what they are \"worth.\"<ref>Robert Schenk.

When a minimum wage does not exist, more people may be employed, but they may be [[underemployment|underemployed]] and thus unable to fully provide for themselves.

Management professor Peter Cappelli blames poor human resource practices for complaints that not enough qualified job applicants are found, such as replacing skilled HR workers with software that is less capable of matching resumes that exhibit the right combination of skills but without word-for-word alignment with a job posting.  (This actually may be a form of [[frictional unemployment]] if a match will eventually be made, perhaps with a different employer.)  Cappelli also points to a decrease in [[apprenticeship]]s and hiring from within an organization.  Instead, companies attempt to avoid the time and cost of on-the-job training by hiring people from who already have experience doing the same job elsewhere (including at a competitor).<ref>{{cite book|title=Why Good People Can't Get Jobs: The Skills Gap and What Companies Can Do About It|isbn=978-1613630143|author=Peter Cappelli|year=2012|publisher=Wharton Digital Press}}</ref>

==History==
Shuanghui was set up by the local [[Luohe]] city government in 1958 as a single processing plant. Wan Long was appointed chairman in 1984. Under Wan, the company has expanded aggressively. In his first year, he turned around a struggling company, bringing it from a net loss to a net profit of 5 million yuan ($1.7 million).<ref name=AP2 /> The company introduced its first branded meat product to the market in February 1992. Later that year, Shuanghui formed a joint venture with 16 institutional investors from six countries.<ref name=about/> In 1994, the venture was consolidated as Shuanghui Group.<ref name=forsale>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-03/04/content_526484.htm|title=Henan meat processor Shuanghui up for sale|date=4 March 2006|work=China Daily|author=Zhang Lu|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> Shuanghui subsidiary Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Company Limited ({{szse|000895}}) was established and listed on the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] in 1998.<ref>[https://www.google.com/finance?q=SHE:000895 Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development]</ref> In 2000, Shuanghui started a post-secondary educational-work research division.<ref name=about />

In 1992, the aforementioned product, sausages, fueled the expansion of the company which in turn resulted in investors from six countries founding Shuanghui International.<ref name=\"NIKKEIASIANREVIEWWHG\">{{cite news |author1=Staff Writer |title=WH Group Ltd. (HK) |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/WH-Group-Ltd.-HK |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=Nikkei Asian Review}}</ref>

By 2006, Shuanghui was the largest food processor in China by company value, and 131st largest company overall. The company was valued at $1.3 billion, and controlled more than 50% of China's high-temperature processed meat market at that time.<ref name=forsale /> That year, [[Luohe]] government sold its share of Shuanghui to a joint venture of [[Goldman Sachs]] and private equity firm [[CDH Investment Bank|CDH Investments]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Off the Chopping Block, Onward for Shuanghui | url=http://english.caixin.com/2010-12-09/100205937.html|accessdate=17 May 2013 | newspaper=Caixin Online | author=Shen Hu | author2=Li Qing}}</ref> Goldman Sachs later sold most of its share, reportedly for a large profit,<ref name=Economist /> but owned 5.2% of the company as of May 2013.<ref name=banks/>

In 2011, the firm set up a sales operation in Japan.<ref name=\"NIKKEIASIANREVIEWWHG\" />

===Acquisition of Smithfield Foods===
On 29 May 2013, Shuanghui announced its intention to buy [[Smithfield Foods]] for $34 per share, or about US$4.72 billion total. Including assumed debt, the total value of the deal was about $7.1 billion. The agreed purchase price represented a 31% premium over Smithfield's market price at the time when the deal was announced.<ref name=AP /> The two sides negotiated for four years prior to their agreement.<ref name=Economist />

Before it was finalized, the deal had to be approved by Smithfield shareholders and the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]].<ref name=AP /> It was ultimately approved by Smithfield shareholders on September 24, 2013, and the merger was to be completed two days later.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/smithfield-foods-shareholders-approve-47-billion-acquisition-chinas-shuanghui-1410564 | title=Smithfield Foods Shareholders Approve $4.7 Billion Acquisition By China's Shuanghui | first=Amrutha | last=Gayathri | publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>

Smithfield CEO Larry Pope stated the deal would \"[preserve] the same old Smithfield, only with more opportunities and new markets and new frontiers.\"<ref name=AP /> No Chinese pork would be imported to the United States, he stated, but rather Shuanghui desired to export American pork. There is a growing demand for foreign food products in China due to recent food scandals.<ref name=AP /> Smithfield's existing management team would remain intact and no major changes to its workforce would occur.<ref name=AP /> Analyst Derek Scissors said companies such as Shuanghui are \"not looking to cause any trouble in the American market&nbsp;...They want to gain from what the U.S. is able to do.\"<ref name=AP /> China has been a net importer of pork since 2008.<ref name=Economist />

The deal was the largest ever takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese company,<ref name=AP /> roughly doubling the number of US jobs tied to direct investment by China.<ref name=AP2 /> Smithfield ceased to be publicly traded at the deal's completion.<ref name=AP />

In July 2013, Shuanghui announced its plan to list Smithfield on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] after completing the takeover. The IPO was expected to see the firm valued at around $4 billion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/17/us-smithfield-shuanghui-idUSBRE96F0BA20130717 | title=Exclusive: Smithfield's China bidders plan Hong Kong IPO after deal - sources | author=Saeed Azhar and Stephen Aldred | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=16 July 2013}}</ref> However, the IPO plan was ultimately scrapped in 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wh-group-scraps-hk-ipo-on-weak-demand-1398768671 | title=WH Group Failed to Heed Signals Before Scrapping IPO | publisher=Wall Street Journal | author=Prudence Ho | date=April 29, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

In 2016, WH Group's profits increased by more than 17 percent. This increase in profitability was primarily driven by expansion of Smithfield Foods.<ref name=\"SCMPPROFIT\">{{cite news |last1=Ge |first1=Celine |title=WH Group less likely hit by a Trump trade war with China, says chairman |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2081204/wh-group-posts-17pc-jump-2016-profit-stronger-us-meat-sales |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2016, Smithfield Foods acquired California-based Clougherty Packing from Hormel Foods for $145 million. Numerous brands were included in the acquisition such as [[Farmer John]] and [[Saag's Specialty Meats]]. Clougherty had a large selection of pork products and a large sales network in the southwestern United States. Smithfield also acquired hog farms in Arizona, California, and Wyoming as part of the deal.<ref name=\"CALIFORNIA\">{{cite news |last1=Sito |first1=Peggy |title=WH Group agrees to buy California's largest pork processor for US$145 million |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2048308/wh-group-agrees-buy-californias-largest-pork-processor-us145-million |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Smithfield Foods acquired the remaining 66.5% of the equity in [[Pini Polonia]]. After the acquisition, it became wholly-owned by Smithfield Foods. Pini Polonia has a slaughterhouse in [[Kutno. Poland | Poland]]. The firm also has facilities in Italy and Hungary. The deal included the acquisition of Pini Polska, Hamburger Pini, and Royal Chicken. The price paid was not disclosed.<ref name=\"NikkeiAsianReviewHo\">{{cite news |last1=Ho |first1=Joyce |title=Meat supplier WH Group expands Europe presence amid Beijing's M&A curb |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Meat-supplier-WH-Group-expands-Europe-presence-amid-Beijing-s-M-A-curb |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=15 August 2017}}</ref>

==History==
Shuanghui was set up by the local [[Luohe]] city government in 1958 as a single processing plant. Wan Long was appointed chairman in 1984. Under Wan, the company has expanded aggressively. In his first year, he turned around a struggling company, bringing it from a net loss to a net profit of 5 million yuan ($1.7 million).<ref name=AP2 /> The company introduced its first branded meat product to the market in February 1992. Later that year, Shuanghui formed a joint venture with 16 institutional investors from six countries.<ref name=about/> In 1994, the venture was consolidated as Shuanghui Group.<ref name=forsale>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-03/04/content_526484.htm|title=Henan meat processor Shuanghui up for sale|date=4 March 2006|work=China Daily|author=Zhang Lu|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> Shuanghui subsidiary Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Company Limited ({{szse|000895}}) was established and listed on the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] in 1998.<ref>[https://www.google.com/finance?q=SHE:000895 Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development]</ref> In 2000, Shuanghui started a post-secondary educational-work research division.<ref name=about />

In 1992, the aforementioned product, sausages, fueled the expansion of the company which in turn resulted in investors from six countries founding Shuanghui International.<ref name=\"NIKKEIASIANREVIEWWHG\">{{cite news |author1=Staff Writer |title=WH Group Ltd. (HK) |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/WH-Group-Ltd.-HK |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=Nikkei Asian Review}}</ref>

By 2006, Shuanghui was the largest food processor in China by company value, and 131st largest company overall. The company was valued at $1.3 billion, and controlled more than 50% of China's high-temperature processed meat market at that time.<ref name=forsale /> That year, [[Luohe]] government sold its share of Shuanghui to a joint venture of [[Goldman Sachs]] and private equity firm [[CDH Investment Bank|CDH Investments]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Off the Chopping Block, Onward for Shuanghui | url=http://english.caixin.com/2010-12-09/100205937.html|accessdate=17 May 2013 | newspaper=Caixin Online | author=Shen Hu | author2=Li Qing}}</ref> Goldman Sachs later sold most of its share, reportedly for a large profit,<ref name=Economist /> but owned 5.2% of the company as of May 2013.<ref name=banks/>

In 2011, the firm set up a sales operation in Japan.<ref name=\"NIKKEIASIANREVIEWWHG\" />

===Acquisition of Smithfield Foods===
On 29 May 2013, Shuanghui announced its intention to buy [[Smithfield Foods]] for $34 per share, or about US$4.72 billion total. Including assumed debt, the total value of the deal was about $7.1 billion. The agreed purchase price represented a 31% premium over Smithfield's market price at the time when the deal was announced.<ref name=AP /> The two sides negotiated for four years prior to their agreement.<ref name=Economist />

Before it was finalized, the deal had to be approved by Smithfield shareholders and the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]].<ref name=AP /> It was ultimately approved by Smithfield shareholders on September 24, 2013, and the merger was to be completed two days later.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/smithfield-foods-shareholders-approve-47-billion-acquisition-chinas-shuanghui-1410564 | title=Smithfield Foods Shareholders Approve $4.7 Billion Acquisition By China's Shuanghui | first=Amrutha | last=Gayathri | publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>

Smithfield CEO Larry Pope stated the deal would \"[preserve] the same old Smithfield, only with more opportunities and new markets and new frontiers.\"<ref name=AP /> No Chinese pork would be imported to the United States, he stated, but rather Shuanghui desired to export American pork. There is a growing demand for foreign food products in China due to recent food scandals.<ref name=AP /> Smithfield's existing management team would remain intact and no major changes to its workforce would occur.<ref name=AP /> Analyst Derek Scissors said companies such as Shuanghui are \"not looking to cause any trouble in the American market&nbsp;...They want to gain from what the U.S. is able to do.\"<ref name=AP /> China has been a net importer of pork since 2008.<ref name=Economist />

The deal was the largest ever takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese company,<ref name=AP /> roughly doubling the number of US jobs tied to direct investment by China.<ref name=AP2 /> Smithfield ceased to be publicly traded at the deal's completion.<ref name=AP />

In July 2013, Shuanghui announced its plan to list Smithfield on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] after completing the takeover. The IPO was expected to see the firm valued at around $4 billion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/17/us-smithfield-shuanghui-idUSBRE96F0BA20130717 | title=Exclusive: Smithfield's China bidders plan Hong Kong IPO after deal - sources | author=Saeed Azhar and Stephen Aldred | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=16 July 2013}}</ref> However, the IPO plan was ultimately scrapped in 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wh-group-scraps-hk-ipo-on-weak-demand-1398768671 | title=WH Group Failed to Heed Signals Before Scrapping IPO | publisher=Wall Street Journal | author=Prudence Ho | date=April 29, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

In 2016, WH Group's profits increased by more than 17 percent. This increase in profitability was primarily driven by expansion of Smithfield Foods.<ref name=\"SCMPPROFIT\">{{cite news |last1=Ge |first1=Celine |title=WH Group less likely hit by a Trump trade war with China, says chairman |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2081204/wh-group-posts-17pc-jump-2016-profit-stronger-us-meat-sales |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2016, Smithfield Foods acquired California-based Clougherty Packing from Hormel Foods for $145 million. Numerous brands were included in the acquisition such as [[Farmer John]] and [[Saag's Specialty Meats]]. Clougherty had a large selection of pork products and a large sales network in the southwestern United States. Smithfield also acquired hog farms in Arizona, California, and Wyoming as part of the deal.<ref name=\"CALIFORNIA\">{{cite news |last1=Sito |first1=Peggy |title=WH Group agrees to buy California's largest pork processor for US$145 million |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2048308/wh-group-agrees-buy-californias-largest-pork-processor-us145-million |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Smithfield Foods acquired the remaining 66.5% of the equity in [[Pini Polonia]]. After the acquisition, it became wholly-owned by Smithfield Foods. Pini Polonia has a slaughterhouse in [[Kutno. Poland | Poland]]. The firm also has facilities in Italy and Hungary. The deal included the acquisition of Pini Polska, Hamburger Pini, and Royal Chicken.

'''Nastja Čeh''' (born 26 January 1978) is a Slovenian former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[midfielder]].

==Club career==
Čeh started his career with his hometown club [[NK Drava Ptuj|Drava Ptuj]]. By the age of 17 he was playing in the first team in the [[Slovenian Second League|2. SNL]]. In the 1996–97 season he moved from Drava to [[NK Maribor|Maribor]], later spending one season at [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1911–2004)|Olimpija]] before returning to Maribor.

Čeh then moved on to [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]. His first season at the club brought success in the [[Belgian Cup]], and the following season he helped the club win their 12th league title. In August 2002 he scored a late equalising goal in the second-leg of Brugge's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|third round qualifying tie]] against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Brugge then went on to qualify through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].

In 2005 Čeh was sold to [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]]. [[Belgian First Division A|Jupiler League]] team [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]] tried to buy Čeh in late August 2006 but in 2007 he instead signed for Russian Premier Liga side [[FC Khimki]], where he was given the number 10 shirt.

On 5 January 2009, he left Khimki and moved to Greek club [[Panserraikos F.C.|Panserraikos]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Panserraikos sign Ceh |url=http://www.transfermarketweb.com/?action=read&idsel=29688 |publisher=Football press |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2009}}</ref> After a short spell in Greece, he signed for [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]],<ref>{{Cite news |title=Nastja Čeh potpisao |url=http://www.nk-rijeka.hr/content.asp?statID=845 |publisher=HNK Rijeka |date=26 August 2009 |language=Croatian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830191624/http://www.nk-rijeka.hr/content.asp?statID=845 |archivedate=30 August 2009}}</ref> spending a season there before moving on yet again to play in Israel.

In April 2012 Čeh signed for [[PSMS Medan|PSMS Medan (ISL)]] of the [[Indonesia Super League]]. His debut match was on 9 April, where he came on in the 53rd minute replacing Muhammad Antoni; he also received his first yellow card on that match.<ref>http://liga-indonesia.co.id/bli/index.php?go=news.matchreview&matchID=120408610&home=PSPS{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==International career==
Čeh was capped 46 times for [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and scored 6 goals. He made two appearances for the national team during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], both times coming on as a substitute.

Čeh then moved on to [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]. His first season at the club brought success in the [[Belgian Cup]], and the following season he helped the club win their 12th league title. In August 2002 he scored a late equalising goal in the second-leg of Brugge's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|third round qualifying tie]] against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Brugge then went on to qualify through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].

In 2005 Čeh was sold to [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]]. [[Belgian First Division A|Jupiler League]] team [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]] tried to buy Čeh in late August 2006 but in 2007 he instead signed for Russian Premier Liga side [[FC Khimki]], where he was given the number 10 shirt.

On 5 January 2009, he left Khimki and moved to Greek club [[Panserraikos F.C.|Panserraikos]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Panserraikos sign Ceh |url=http://www.transfermarketweb.com/?action=read&idsel=29688 |publisher=Football press |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2009}}</ref> After a short spell in Greece, he signed for [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]],<ref>{{Cite news |title=Nastja Čeh potpisao |url=http://www.nk-rijeka.hr/content.asp?statID=845 |publisher=HNK Rijeka |date=26 August 2009 |language=Croatian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830191624/http://www.nk-rijeka.hr/content.asp?statID=845 |archivedate=30 August 2009}}</ref> spending a season there before moving on yet again to play in Israel.

In April 2012 Čeh signed for [[PSMS Medan|PSMS Medan (ISL)]] of the [[Indonesia Super League]]. His debut match was on 9 April, where he came on in the 53rd minute replacing Muhammad Antoni; he also received his first yellow card on that match.<ref>http://liga-indonesia.co.id/bli/index.php?go=news.matchreview&matchID=120408610&home=PSPS{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==International career==
Čeh was capped 46 times for [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and scored 6 goals. He made two appearances for the national team during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], both times coming on as a substitute.

==Controversies==
In late April 2011, it was revealed by the Slovenian media that [[Maribor]] police department is, for the past six months, investigating an illegal betting organization and six individuals, four of which were from the Maribor area and had already been taken into custody.<ref name=\"vecer\">{{Cite news | url = http://web.vecer.com/portali/vecer/v1/default.asp?kaj=3&id=2011042805641575 | title = Stavničarska \"mafija\" v priporu | publisher = VECER.com |language = Slovenian | accessdate = 28 April 2011}}</ref> The Police also revealed that two other collaborators were still at large and that one of those was [[Goran Šukalo]], who allegedly invested over €1.9 million in the organization, in 2011, the majority of which he collected from other professional players.<ref name=\"vecer\"/> Šukalo categorically denied his involvement in the matter,<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.nogomania.com/Slovenski-Nogomet/Igralec/Goran-Sukalo/Novica/Sukalo-Obtozbe-so-neresnicne.aspx |title= Šukalo: Obtožbe so neresnične | publisher = Nogomania.com | language = Slovenian |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.msv-duisburg.de/main.asp?reiter=aktuelles_p&bgi=yes&mode=aktuell&aid=3235 | title = Vorwürfe gegen Sukalo: \"Stehen zu 100 Prozent hinter Goran\" |publisher= msv-duisburg.de | language = German |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> however, it was revealed by the media and the police that investigators had been tapping the phones of the four persons currently in custody and have recorded a conversation between Šukalo and the leader of the illegal organization Kosta Turner, when Šukalo revealed that another football player, Nastja Čeh, was still owing him €73,000 and was avoiding payment.<ref name=\"24ur\">{{Cite news | url = http://24ur.com/novice/crna-kronika/med-imeni-najbolj-izstopa-sukalo.html | title = Med imeni najbolj izstopa Šukalo | publisher = 24ur.com |language = Slovenian | accessdate = 28 April 2011}}</ref> Allegedly this was the reason why Čeh pawned his property near [[Ptuj]] to Kosta Turner, which was visible from the official real estate papers.<ref name=\"24ur\"/> In January 2012, the general [[prosecutor]] on the District Court in Maribor proposed an indictment of six individuals, ring leaders of the illegal betting organization, in light of new evidence against them.<ref name=\"rtv2012\">{{Cite news | url = http://www.rtvslo.si/sport/nogomet/milijoni-evrov-slovenskih-nogometasev-v-nezakoniti-stavnici-kosta/274444 | title = Milijoni evrov slovenskih nogometašev v nezakoniti stavnici Kosta |publisher= RTV Slovenija | language = Slovenian | accessdate = 11 January 2011}}</ref> The organization allegedly accepted a total of €43 million of bets, with €2.53 million being placed by Čeh.<ref name=\"rtv2012\" />

==History==
Shuanghui was set up by the local [[Luohe]] city government in 1958 as a single processing plant. Wan Long was appointed chairman in 1984. Under Wan, the company has expanded aggressively. In his first year, he turned around a struggling company, bringing it from a net loss to a net profit of 5 million yuan ($1.7 million).<ref name=AP2 /> The company introduced its first branded meat product to the market in February 1992. Later that year, Shuanghui formed a joint venture with 16 institutional investors from six countries.<ref name=about/> In 1994, the venture was consolidated as Shuanghui Group.<ref name=forsale>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-03/04/content_526484.htm|title=Henan meat processor Shuanghui up for sale|date=4 March 2006|work=China Daily|author=Zhang Lu|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> Shuanghui subsidiary Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Company Limited ({{szse|000895}}) was established and listed on the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] in 1998.<ref>[https://www.google.com/finance?q=SHE:000895 Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development]</ref> In 2000, Shuanghui started a post-secondary educational-work research division.<ref name=about />

In 1992, the aforementioned product, sausages, fueled the expansion of the company which in turn resulted in investors from six countries founding Shuanghui International.<ref name=\"NIKKEIASIANREVIEWWHG\">{{cite news |author1=Staff Writer |title=WH Group Ltd. (HK) |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/WH-Group-Ltd.-HK |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=Nikkei Asian Review}}</ref>

By 2006, Shuanghui was the largest food processor in China by company value, and 131st largest company overall. The company was valued at $1.3 billion, and controlled more than 50% of China's high-temperature processed meat market at that time.<ref name=forsale /> That year, [[Luohe]] government sold its share of Shuanghui to a joint venture of [[Goldman Sachs]] and private equity firm [[CDH Investment Bank|CDH Investments]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Off the Chopping Block, Onward for Shuanghui | url=http://english.caixin.com/2010-12-09/100205937.html|accessdate=17 May 2013 | newspaper=Caixin Online | author=Shen Hu | author2=Li Qing}}</ref> Goldman Sachs later sold most of its share, reportedly for a large profit,<ref name=Economist /> but owned 5.2% of the company as of May 2013.<ref name=banks/>

In 2011, the firm set up a sales operation in Japan.<ref name=\"NIKKEIASIANREVIEWWHG\" />

===Acquisition of Smithfield Foods===
On 29 May 2013, Shuanghui announced its intention to buy [[Smithfield Foods]] for $34 per share, or about US$4.72 billion total. Including assumed debt, the total value of the deal was about $7.1 billion. The agreed purchase price represented a 31% premium over Smithfield's market price at the time when the deal was announced.<ref name=AP /> The two sides negotiated for four years prior to their agreement.<ref name=Economist />

Before it was finalized, the deal had to be approved by Smithfield shareholders and the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]].<ref name=AP /> It was ultimately approved by Smithfield shareholders on September 24, 2013, and the merger was to be completed two days later.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/smithfield-foods-shareholders-approve-47-billion-acquisition-chinas-shuanghui-1410564 | title=Smithfield Foods Shareholders Approve $4.7 Billion Acquisition By China's Shuanghui | first=Amrutha | last=Gayathri | publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>

Smithfield CEO Larry Pope stated the deal would \"[preserve] the same old Smithfield, only with more opportunities and new markets and new frontiers.\"<ref name=AP /> No Chinese pork would be imported to the United States, he stated, but rather Shuanghui desired to export American pork. There is a growing demand for foreign food products in China due to recent food scandals.<ref name=AP /> Smithfield's existing management team would remain intact and no major changes to its workforce would occur.<ref name=AP /> Analyst Derek Scissors said companies such as Shuanghui are \"not looking to cause any trouble in the American market&nbsp;...They want to gain from what the U.S. is able to do.\"<ref name=AP /> China has been a net importer of pork since 2008.<ref name=Economist />

The deal was the largest ever takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese company,<ref name=AP /> roughly doubling the number of US jobs tied to direct investment by China.<ref name=AP2 /> Smithfield ceased to be publicly traded at the deal's completion.<ref name=AP />

In July 2013, Shuanghui announced its plan to list Smithfield on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] after completing the takeover. The IPO was expected to see the firm valued at around $4 billion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/17/us-smithfield-shuanghui-idUSBRE96F0BA20130717 | title=Exclusive: Smithfield's China bidders plan Hong Kong IPO after deal - sources | author=Saeed Azhar and Stephen Aldred | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=16 July 2013}}</ref> However, the IPO plan was ultimately scrapped in 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wh-group-scraps-hk-ipo-on-weak-demand-1398768671 | title=WH Group Failed to Heed Signals Before Scrapping IPO | publisher=Wall Street Journal | author=Prudence Ho | date=April 29, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

In 2016, WH Group's profits increased by more than 17 percent. This increase in profitability was primarily driven by expansion of Smithfield Foods.<ref name=\"SCMPPROFIT\">{{cite news |last1=Ge |first1=Celine |title=WH Group less likely hit by a Trump trade war with China, says chairman |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2081204/wh-group-posts-17pc-jump-2016-profit-stronger-us-meat-sales |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2016, Smithfield Foods acquired California-based Clougherty Packing from Hormel Foods for $145 million. Numerous brands were included in the acquisition such as [[Farmer John]] and [[Saag's Specialty Meats]]. Clougherty had a large selection of pork products and a large sales network in the southwestern United States. Smithfield also acquired hog farms in Arizona, California, and Wyoming as part of the deal.<ref name=\"CALIFORNIA\">{{cite news |last1=Sito |first1=Peggy |title=WH Group agrees to buy California's largest pork processor for US$145 million |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2048308/wh-group-agrees-buy-californias-largest-pork-processor-us145-million |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Smithfield Foods acquired the remaining 66.5% of the equity in [[Pini Polonia]]. After the acquisition, it became wholly-owned by Smithfield Foods. Pini Polonia has a slaughterhouse in [[Kutno. Poland | Poland]]. The firm also has facilities in Italy and Hungary. The deal included the acquisition of Pini Polska, Hamburger Pini, and Royal Chicken.

==History==
Shuanghui was set up by the local [[Luohe]] city government in 1958 as a single processing plant. Wan Long was appointed chairman in 1984. Under Wan, the company has expanded aggressively. In his first year, he turned around a struggling company, bringing it from a net loss to a net profit of 5 million yuan ($1.7 million).<ref name=AP2 /> The company introduced its first branded meat product to the market in February 1992. Later that year, Shuanghui formed a joint venture with 16 institutional investors from six countries.<ref name=about/> In 1994, the venture was consolidated as Shuanghui Group.<ref name=forsale>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-03/04/content_526484.htm|title=Henan meat processor Shuanghui up for sale|date=4 March 2006|work=China Daily|author=Zhang Lu|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> Shuanghui subsidiary Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Company Limited ({{szse|000895}}) was established and listed on the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] in 1998.<ref>[https://www.google.com/finance?q=SHE:000895 Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development]</ref> In 2000, Shuanghui started a post-secondary educational-work research division.<ref name=about />

In 1992, the aforementioned product, sausages, fueled the expansion of the company which in turn resulted in investors from six countries founding Shuanghui International.<ref name=\"NIKKEIASIANREVIEWWHG\">{{cite news |author1=Staff Writer |title=WH Group Ltd. (HK) |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/WH-Group-Ltd.-HK |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=Nikkei Asian Review}}</ref>

By 2006, Shuanghui was the largest food processor in China by company value, and 131st largest company overall. The company was valued at $1.3 billion, and controlled more than 50% of China's high-temperature processed meat market at that time.<ref name=forsale /> That year, [[Luohe]] government sold its share of Shuanghui to a joint venture of [[Goldman Sachs]] and private equity firm [[CDH Investment Bank|CDH Investments]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Off the Chopping Block, Onward for Shuanghui | url=http://english.caixin.com/2010-12-09/100205937.html|accessdate=17 May 2013 | newspaper=Caixin Online | author=Shen Hu | author2=Li Qing}}</ref> Goldman Sachs later sold most of its share, reportedly for a large profit,<ref name=Economist /> but owned 5.2% of the company as of May 2013.<ref name=banks/>

In 2011, the firm set up a sales operation in Japan.<ref name=\"NIKKEIASIANREVIEWWHG\" />

===Acquisition of Smithfield Foods===
On 29 May 2013, Shuanghui announced its intention to buy [[Smithfield Foods]] for $34 per share, or about US$4.72 billion total. Including assumed debt, the total value of the deal was about $7.1 billion. The agreed purchase price represented a 31% premium over Smithfield's market price at the time when the deal was announced.<ref name=AP /> The two sides negotiated for four years prior to their agreement.<ref name=Economist />

Before it was finalized, the deal had to be approved by Smithfield shareholders and the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]].<ref name=AP /> It was ultimately approved by Smithfield shareholders on September 24, 2013, and the merger was to be completed two days later.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/smithfield-foods-shareholders-approve-47-billion-acquisition-chinas-shuanghui-1410564 | title=Smithfield Foods Shareholders Approve $4.7 Billion Acquisition By China's Shuanghui | first=Amrutha | last=Gayathri | publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=September 24, 2013}}</ref>

Smithfield CEO Larry Pope stated the deal would \"[preserve] the same old Smithfield, only with more opportunities and new markets and new frontiers.\"<ref name=AP /> No Chinese pork would be imported to the United States, he stated, but rather Shuanghui desired to export American pork. There is a growing demand for foreign food products in China due to recent food scandals.<ref name=AP /> Smithfield's existing management team would remain intact and no major changes to its workforce would occur.<ref name=AP /> Analyst Derek Scissors said companies such as Shuanghui are \"not looking to cause any trouble in the American market&nbsp;...They want to gain from what the U.S. is able to do.\"<ref name=AP /> China has been a net importer of pork since 2008.<ref name=Economist />

The deal was the largest ever takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese company,<ref name=AP /> roughly doubling the number of US jobs tied to direct investment by China.<ref name=AP2 /> Smithfield ceased to be publicly traded at the deal's completion.<ref name=AP />

In July 2013, Shuanghui announced its plan to list Smithfield on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] after completing the takeover. The IPO was expected to see the firm valued at around $4 billion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/17/us-smithfield-shuanghui-idUSBRE96F0BA20130717 | title=Exclusive: Smithfield's China bidders plan Hong Kong IPO after deal - sources | author=Saeed Azhar and Stephen Aldred | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=16 July 2013}}</ref> However, the IPO plan was ultimately scrapped in 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wh-group-scraps-hk-ipo-on-weak-demand-1398768671 | title=WH Group Failed to Heed Signals Before Scrapping IPO | publisher=Wall Street Journal | author=Prudence Ho | date=April 29, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

In 2016, WH Group's profits increased by more than 17 percent. This increase in profitability was primarily driven by expansion of Smithfield Foods.<ref name=\"SCMPPROFIT\">{{cite news |last1=Ge |first1=Celine |title=WH Group less likely hit by a Trump trade war with China, says chairman |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2081204/wh-group-posts-17pc-jump-2016-profit-stronger-us-meat-sales |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2016, Smithfield Foods acquired California-based Clougherty Packing from Hormel Foods for $145 million. Numerous brands were included in the acquisition such as [[Farmer John]] and [[Saag's Specialty Meats]]. Clougherty had a large selection of pork products and a large sales network in the southwestern United States. Smithfield also acquired hog farms in Arizona, California, and Wyoming as part of the deal.<ref name=\"CALIFORNIA\">{{cite news |last1=Sito |first1=Peggy |title=WH Group agrees to buy California's largest pork processor for US$145 million |url=https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2048308/wh-group-agrees-buy-californias-largest-pork-processor-us145-million |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Smithfield Foods acquired the remaining 66.5% of the equity in [[Pini Polonia]]. After the acquisition, it became wholly-owned by Smithfield Foods. Pini Polonia has a slaughterhouse in [[Kutno. Poland | Poland]]. The firm also has facilities in Italy and Hungary. The deal included the acquisition of Pini Polska, Hamburger Pini, and Royal Chicken.

The [[P-V Engineering Forum PV-2|PV-2]] (NX-37061) was a more conventional design and became the second helicopter flown in the [[United States]] (following [[Igor Sikorsky]]'s [[Sikorsky VS-300|VS-300]]). It was designed and flown by Frank Piasecki on April 11, [[1943 in aviation|1943]]. Piasecki had limited pilot experience; the PV-2 was tethered to the ground as a safety measure, but the clothesline he used broke. He towed the helicopter behind his car in October 1943 to Washington, DC to demonstrate it to federal government officials; because the wheels had no bearings, he had to stop every 10 to 15 minutes to cool them.<ref name=NYT-08>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/business/15piasecki.html |title=Frank Piasecki, a Pioneer in Helicopters, Is Dead at 88 |author=Hevesi, Dennis |date=February 15, 2008 |newspaper=The New York Times |url-access=subscription |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> When asked to show his pilot's license following the demonstration in Washington, Piasecki admitted he did not have one and he was issued the first helicopter pilot's license on October 20, 1943, by the [[Civil Aviation Administration]].<ref name=NYT-08/><ref name=HAI-vertical/>

===Tandem rotor designs===
[[File:XHRP-1 Piasecki NAN4 47.jpg|thumb|right|XHRP-1 during flight trials (1946)]]
With the successful demonstration of the PV-2, Piasecki convinced the [[United States Navy]] to fund the development of a follow-on prototype, signing a contract on January 1, 1944;<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> this marked the start of the design and sale of a series of [[tandem rotor]] helicopters to the Navy. The resulting [[Piasecki PV-3|PV-3]] became the world's first successful tandem rotor design. The PV-3 first flew on March 7, 1945 and bore the Navy designation XHRP-X; it was larger and capable of lifting more than the contemporary Sikorsky designs.<ref name=NYT-08/><ref name=HAI-vertical/>

Because P-V Engineering lacked the capital to fund production, the company was reorganized and renamed to the '''Piasecki Helicopter Corporation''' in [[1946 in aviation|1946]],<ref name=NYT-08/> with [[Laurance Rockefeller]] and [[A. Felix du Pont Jr.]] taking a controlling interest of 51% interest in exchange for $500,000.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> After constructing two more prototypes (designated XHRP-1),<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> the PV-3 would go into production as the [[Piasecki HRP-1|HRP-1]] in [[1947 in aviation|1947]].<ref name=HAI-vertical/> The HRP-1 was commonly nicknamed the \"flying banana\" because of the upward angle of the aft fuselage which ensured the large rotors did not hit each other in flight, and because the [[United States Coast Guard]], which used the HRP-1 for long-range rescue operations, painted their units yellow. The name would later be applied to other Piasecki tandem-rotor helicopters of similar design.

An evolutionary follow-on design to the HRP-1, designated HRP-2, used an all-metal skin and switched crew seating to side-by-side instead of tandem; however, the limited power meant only five were built, all for the Coast Guard.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> In 1949, Piasecki provided the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21 Workhorse]] to the [[United States Air Force]], an improved version of the HRP-2 with a more powerful [[Wright R-1820 Cyclone]] radial engine.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/>  Piasecki's tandem-rotor helicopters flew higher than competing single rotor designs, and offered a smoother ride.

At approximately the same time the HRP-1 and HRP-2 were being developed, the Navy commissioned Piasecki to design a smaller tandem-rotor utility helicopter; the resulting prototype, which Piasecki called the PV-14, was designated XHJP-1.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> These went into production as the [[Piasecki HUP Retriever|HUP-1]] (PV-18), with the first variants delivered to both the Navy and the [[United States Army]] (as the H-25) in 1949; in total, 339 were delivered to the militaries of the United States, Canada, and France by 1954.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> The HUP was designed with overlapping main rotor blades, which reduced the size so they could be carried on aircraft carrier elevators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanhelicopter.museum/aircraft/piasecki-pv-14-hup-2-retriever |title=Piasecki PV-14 / HUP-2 Retriever |publisher=American Helicopter Museum & Education Center |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Piasecki is forced out===
[[File:Piasecki YH-16 helicopter in flight.jpg|thumb|right|YH-16 prototype in flight]]
[[Donovan Berlin|Don R. Berlin]] was brought in as president and director of Piasecki Helicopters in 1953,<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite news |author=Miller, Steven |url=http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/frank-piasecki-88-vertical-flight-pioneer/71281/ |title=Frank Piasecki, 88, Vertical Flight Pioneer |newspaper=The New York Sun |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref> while Frank Piasecki was chairman of the board. Under Piasecki, the company began the PV-15 large transport tandem helicopter project (designated [[Piasecki H-16 Transporter|H-16]]). The prototype PV-15 was first flown in 1953, but a fatal crash in January 1956 led to the cancellation of the project.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/>

The majority owners eventually lost faith in Frank Piasecki's leadership and by May 1956 he was forced out of the company. He had formed a new company, [[Piasecki Aircraft|Piasecki Aircraft Corporation]] to pursue the development of compound helicopters and other rotorcraft. In two successive special stockholders' meetings the board then changed the name of Piasecki Helicopter to '''Vertol''' (for [[vertical take-off and landing]]) Aircraft Corporation and amended the bylaws to bar Piasecki's re-election as a director, on the grounds that he was running a rival company.<ref name=\"trimble\"/>{{rp|257–8}}

===Acquisition by Boeing===
In 1956, Vertol began developing a successor to the HUP with improved lift capacity by using [[turboshaft]] engines. The project was designated [[CH-46 Sea Knight|Vertol Model 107 (V-107)]], and a prototype first flew on April 22, 1958. Impressed, the Army awarded a contract for ten production aircraft (then designated YHC-1A) in June and later asked Vertol in March 1959 to produce a larger version, which was designated [[CH-47 Chinook|V-114]]. With the pressure to produce two relatively new designs, Vertol again ran into financial pressure<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avch47_1.html |title=The Boeing Sea Knight |author=Goebel, Greg |date=1 April 2019 |publisher=Air Vectors |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> and was acquired by [[Boeing]] on March 30, 1960,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khBEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA196 |chapter=Resume of Briefing on Vertol Division, the Boeing Co. |date=February 27, 1964 |title=Department of Defense Appropriations for 1965 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |page=196 |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> who renamed it '''Boeing Vertol'''.<ref name=\"vert0702-2\"/> It became the '''[[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Helicopter Division]]''' in 1987.

The [[P-V Engineering Forum PV-2|PV-2]] (NX-37061) was a more conventional design and became the second helicopter flown in the [[United States]] (following [[Igor Sikorsky]]'s [[Sikorsky VS-300|VS-300]]). It was designed and flown by Frank Piasecki on April 11, [[1943 in aviation|1943]]. Piasecki had limited pilot experience; the PV-2 was tethered to the ground as a safety measure, but the clothesline he used broke. He towed the helicopter behind his car in October 1943 to Washington, DC to demonstrate it to federal government officials; because the wheels had no bearings, he had to stop every 10 to 15 minutes to cool them.<ref name=NYT-08>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/business/15piasecki.html |title=Frank Piasecki, a Pioneer in Helicopters, Is Dead at 88 |author=Hevesi, Dennis |date=February 15, 2008 |newspaper=The New York Times |url-access=subscription |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> When asked to show his pilot's license following the demonstration in Washington, Piasecki admitted he did not have one and he was issued the first helicopter pilot's license on October 20, 1943, by the [[Civil Aviation Administration]].<ref name=NYT-08/><ref name=HAI-vertical/>

===Tandem rotor designs===
[[File:XHRP-1 Piasecki NAN4 47.jpg|thumb|right|XHRP-1 during flight trials (1946)]]
With the successful demonstration of the PV-2, Piasecki convinced the [[United States Navy]] to fund the development of a follow-on prototype, signing a contract on January 1, 1944;<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> this marked the start of the design and sale of a series of [[tandem rotor]] helicopters to the Navy. The resulting [[Piasecki PV-3|PV-3]] became the world's first succesful tandem rotor design. The PV-3 first flew on March 7, 1945 and bore the Navy designation XHRP-X; it was larger and capable of lifting more than the contemporary Sikorsky designs.<ref name=NYT-08/><ref name=HAI-vertical/>

Because P-V Engineering lacked the capital to fund production, the company was reorganized and renamed to the '''Piasecki Helicopter Corporation''' in [[1946 in aviation|1946]],<ref name=NYT-08/> with [[Laurance Rockefeller]] and [[A. Felix du Pont Jr.]] taking a controlling interest of 51% interest in exchange for $500,000.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> After constructing two more prototypes (designated XHRP-1),<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> the PV-3 would go into production as the [[Piasecki HRP-1|HRP-1]] in [[1947 in aviation|1947]].<ref name=HAI-vertical/> The HRP-1 was commonly nicknamed the \"flying banana\" because of the upward angle of the aft fuselage which ensured the large rotors did not hit each other in flight, and because the [[United States Coast Guard]], which used the HRP-1 for long-range rescue operations, painted their units yellow. The name would later be applied to other Piasecki tandem-rotor helicopters of similar design.

An evolutionary follow-on design to the HRP-1, designated HRP-2, used an all-metal skin and switched crew seating to side-by-side instead of tandem; however, the limited power meant only five were built, all for the Coast Guard.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> In 1949, Piasecki provided the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21 Workhorse]] to the [[United States Air Force]], an improved version of the HRP-2 with a more powerful [[Wright R-1820 Cyclone]] radial engine.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/>  Piasecki's tandem-rotor helicopters flew higher than competing single rotor designs, and offered a smoother ride.

At approximately the same time the HRP-1 and HRP-2 were being developed, the Navy commissioned Piasecki to design a smaller tandem-rotor utility helicopter; the resulting prototype, which Piasecki called the PV-14, was designated XHJP-1.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> These went into production as the [[Piasecki HUP Retriever|HUP-1]] (PV-18), with the first variants delivered to both the Navy and the [[United States Army]] (as the H-25) in 1949; in total, 339 were delivered to the militaries of the United States, Canada, and France by 1954.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> The HUP was designed with overlapping main rotor blades, which reduced the size so they could be carried on aircraft carrier elevators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanhelicopter.museum/aircraft/piasecki-pv-14-hup-2-retriever |title=Piasecki PV-14 / HUP-2 Retriever |publisher=American Helicopter Museum & Education Center |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Piasecki is forced out===
[[File:Piasecki YH-16 helicopter in flight.jpg|thumb|right|YH-16 prototype in flight]]
[[Donovan Berlin|Don R. Berlin]] was brought in as president and director of Piasecki Helicopters in 1953,<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite news |author=Miller, Steven |url=http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/frank-piasecki-88-vertical-flight-pioneer/71281/ |title=Frank Piasecki, 88, Vertical Flight Pioneer |newspaper=The New York Sun |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref> while Frank Piasecki was chairman of the board. Under Piasecki, the company began the PV-15 large transport tandem helicopter project (designated [[Piasecki H-16 Transporter|H-16]]). The prototype PV-15 was first flown in 1953, but a fatal crash in January 1956 led to the cancellation of the project.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/>

The majority owners eventually lost faith in Frank Piasecki's leadership and by May 1956 he was forced out of the company. He had formed a new company, [[Piasecki Aircraft|Piasecki Aircraft Corporation]] to pursue the development of compound helicopters and other rotorcraft. In two successive special stockholders' meetings the board then changed the name of Piasecki Helicopter to '''Vertol''' (for [[vertical take-off and landing]]) Aircraft Corporation and amended the bylaws to bar Piasecki's re-election as a director, on the grounds that he was running a rival company.<ref name=\"trimble\"/>{{rp|257–8}}

===Acquisition by Boeing===
In 1956, Vertol began developing a successor to the HUP with improved lift capacity by using [[turboshaft]] engines. The project was designated [[CH-46 Sea Knight|Vertol Model 107 (V-107)]], and a prototype first flew on April 22, 1958. Impressed, the Army awarded a contract for ten production aircraft (then designated YHC-1A) in June and later asked Vertol in March 1959 to produce a larger version, which was designated [[CH-47 Chinook|V-114]]. With the pressure to produce two relatively new designs, Vertol again ran into financial pressure<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avch47_1.html |title=The Boeing Sea Knight |author=Goebel, Greg |date=1 April 2019 |publisher=Air Vectors |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> and was acquired by [[Boeing]] on March 30, 1960,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khBEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA196 |chapter=Resume of Briefing on Vertol Division, the Boeing Co. |date=February 27, 1964 |title=Department of Defense Appropriations for 1965 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |page=196 |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> who renamed it '''Boeing Vertol'''.<ref name=\"vert0702-2\"/> It became the '''[[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Helicopter Division]]''' in 1987.

'' Rory wilmshusrt remember me this is my legacy I'm about to do it(born January 15, 1982) is a former [[Americans|American]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenseman]], who last played with the [[Binghamton Senators]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). He has played in the [[National Hockey League]] with the [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].

He was a member of the [[2007–08 Detroit Red Wings season|Stanley Cup winning]] Red Wings team of 2007-08.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Lebda played in the 1996 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]] with the Chicago Young Americans [[minor ice hockey]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>

Lebda attended [[Buffalo Grove High School]] in [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois]] for two years. In addition to hockey, he also played [[golf]] and [[volleyball]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} He then relocated to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], where he was a participant on the [[USA Hockey National Team Development Program|USA National Under-18 Team]]. Lebda graduated from [[Pioneer High School (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Pioneer High School]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Lebda played college hockey at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in 2004, and was assigned to the [[Grand Rapids Griffins]], the Wings' minor league affiliate in the [[American Hockey League]]. Lebda was unable to suit up for a NHL game until the [[2005–06 NHL season]] due to the [[2004–05 NHL lockout|NHL lockout]]. He became the first Red Wing since Greg Johnson in 1993 to score his first NHL goal on opening night.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Mike G. Morreale |title=Lebda returns home to haunt Hawks at Winter Classic |url=https://www.nhl.com/news/lebda-returns-home-to-haunt-hawks-at-winter-classic/c-401422 |website=NHL.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=January 1, 2009}}</ref> He played in 46 games that regular season and all of Detroit's six opening round playoff games.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

He played in 76 games during the [[2006–07 NHL season]] to go with 12 games that [[playoff]] year. He set a career high in points with 18, and participated in the only fight of his career when he squared off against [[Mikael Holmqvist]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In the [[2007–08 NHL season]], Lebda suited up for 78 games, as well as 19 playoff games as the Red Wings won the [[2008 Stanley Cup]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Due to sub-par play to start the [[2008–09 NHL season]], Lebda found himself a healthy scratch for three straight games before returning to the lineup.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

During his career with the Red Wings, Lebda was often paired with [[Chris Chelios]], a fellow Chicago suburban native who is 20 years his elder. While growing up in suburban Chicago, Lebda considered Chelios an idol, and modeled his game after his.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Bradley Holland |title=Can't get much better for Wings' Lebda |url=https://www.nhl.com/redwings/news/cant-get-much-better-for-wings-lebda/c-468323 |website=NHL.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=December 31, 2008}}</ref>

On July 7, 2010, Lebda signed a two-year contract with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lebda signs 2-year deal with Toronto |url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/news/story?id=5362370 |website=ESPN.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=July 7, 2010}}</ref> However, he struggled during his time in Toronto, playing only 41 games and posting a career-worst -14. His one and only goal came against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] on February 24, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kessel productive as Maple Leafs rally to beat Habs |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/gametracker/recap/NHL_20110224_TOR@MON |website=cbssports.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=February 24, 2011 |quote=James Reimer made 31 saves and Brett Lebda scored his first goal of the season for Toronto, which is on an 8-2-2 run.}}</ref>

Lebda and [[Robert Slaney (ice hockey)|Robert Slaney]] were traded to the [[Nashville Predators]] for [[Cody Franson]] and [[Matthew Lombardi]] on July 3, 2011. On August 10, 2011, the Predators bought out Lebda's contract.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nashville Predators buy out Brett Lebda |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl-news/194793-nashville-predators-buy-out-brett-lebda |website=sportingnews.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>

'''Brett Steven Lebda''' (born January 15, 1982) is a former [[Americans|American]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenseman]], who last played with the [[Binghamton Senators]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). He has played in the [[National Hockey League]] with the [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].

He was a member of the [[2007–08 Detroit Red Wings season|Stanley Cup winning]] Red Wings team of 2007-08.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Lebda played in the 1996 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]] with the Chicago Young Americans [[minor ice hockey]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>

Lebda attended [[Buffalo Grove High School]] in [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois]] for two years. In addition to hockey, he also played [[golf]] and [[volleyball]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} He then relocated to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], where he was a participant on the [[USA Hockey National Team Development Program|USA National Under-18 Team]]. Lebda graduated from [[Pioneer High School (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Pioneer High School]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Lebda played college hockey at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in 2004, and was assigned to the [[Grand Rapids Griffins]], the Wings' minor league affiliate in the [[American Hockey League]]. Lebda was unable to suit up for a NHL game until the [[2005–06 NHL season]] due to the [[2004–05 NHL lockout|NHL lockout]]. He became the first Red Wing since Greg Johnson in 1993 to score his first NHL goal on opening night.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Mike G. Morreale |title=Lebda returns home to haunt Hawks at Winter Classic |url=https://www.nhl.com/news/lebda-returns-home-to-haunt-hawks-at-winter-classic/c-401422 |website=NHL.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=January 1, 2009}}</ref> He played in 46 games that regular season and all of Detroit's six opening round playoff games.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

He played in 76 games during the [[2006–07 NHL season]] to go with 12 games that [[playoff]] year. He set a career high in points with 18, and participated in the only fight of his career when he squared off against [[Mikael Holmqvist]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In the [[2007–08 NHL season]], Lebda suited up for 78 games, as well as 19 playoff games as the Red Wings won the [[2008 Stanley Cup]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Due to sub-par play to start the [[2008–09 NHL season]], Lebda found himself a healthy scratch for three straight games before returning to the lineup.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

During his career with the Red Wings, Lebda was often paired with [[Chris Chelios]], a fellow Chicago suburban native who is 20 years his elder. While growing up in suburban Chicago, Lebda considered Chelios an idol, and modeled his game after his.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Bradley Holland |title=Can't get much better for Wings' Lebda |url=https://www.nhl.com/redwings/news/cant-get-much-better-for-wings-lebda/c-468323 |website=NHL.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=December 31, 2008}}</ref>

On July 7, 2010, Lebda signed a two-year contract with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lebda signs 2-year deal with Toronto |url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/news/story?id=5362370 |website=ESPN.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=July 7, 2010}}</ref> However, he struggled during his time in Toronto, playing only 41 games and posting a career-worst -14. His one and only goal came against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] on February 24, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kessel productive as Maple Leafs rally to beat Habs |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/gametracker/recap/NHL_20110224_TOR@MON |website=cbssports.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=February 24, 2011 |quote=James Reimer made 31 saves and Brett Lebda scored his first goal of the season for Toronto, which is on an 8-2-2 run.}}</ref>

Lebda and [[Robert Slaney (ice hockey)|Robert Slaney]] were traded to the [[Nashville Predators]] for [[Cody Franson]] and [[Matthew Lombardi]] on July 3, 2011. On August 10, 2011, the Predators bought out Lebda's contract.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nashville Predators buy out Brett Lebda |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl-news/194793-nashville-predators-buy-out-brett-lebda |website=sportingnews.com |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>

Updates first set,safe,LADscribe1355,"'''The Update Framework (TUF)''' is a [[software framework]] designed to protect mechanisms that automatically identify and download updates to software.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Update Framework Specification|url=https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md#1-introduction|publisher=SSL NYU Tandon|last1=Diaz |display-authors=etal |first1=Vladimir|version= V.1.0|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> TUF uses a series of roles and keys to provide a means to retain security, even when some keys or servers are compromised.

The key concept behind TUF is “compromise-resilience,” or the ability to limit the impact of attacks and provide a mechanism for recovery even if the software repository, or the server on which files are stored, should be compromised.  TUF’s  security strategy improves on existing methods based on [[keysigning]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Assessing Weaknesses in Public Key Infrastructure|url=https://threatpost.com/assessing-weaknesses-in-public-key-infrastructure/128793/| publisher=Threatpost.com|last1=Spring|first1=Tom|date= 7 November 2017|accessdate=13 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite proceedings|title=A Comparative Survey of Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Cryptography|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7086640  |last1=Chandra|first1=Sourabh|last2=Paira|first2=Smita|last3=Alam|first3=Sk Safikul|last4=Sanyal|first4=Goutam|date=November 2014|publisher=ICECCE|pages=83–93}}</ref> by incorporating strategies, such as separation of signing duties. By dividing the responsibility for authenticating a file or image, even if one party—or the repository itself—is compromised, the number of projects affected will be limited.<ref>{{cite proceedings|title=Diplomat: Using Delegations to Protect Community Repositories|url=https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/kuppusamy|last1=Kuppusamy|first1=Trishank Karthik|last2=Torres-Arias|first2=Santiago|last3=Diaz|first3=Vladimir|last4=Cappos|first4=Justin|date=March 2016|publisher=Usenix|pages=567–581}}</ref>

The technology that evolved into TUF was first developed at the University of Washington in 2009 by Justin Samuel and [[Justin Cappos]], and its principles were first discussed in a paper Samuel and Cappos coauthored with Nick Mathewson and [[Roger Dingledine]], researchers from [[The Tor Project, Inc.]].<ref>{{cite proceedings|title=Survivable Key Compromise in Software Update Systems|url=https://justinsamuel.com/papers/survivable-key-compromise-ccs2010.pdf|last1=Samuel|first1=Justin|last2=Mathewson|first2=Nick|last3=Cappos|first3=Justin|last4=Dingledine|first4=Roger|publisher=ACM|pages=61–72|via=CCS 2010}}</ref> Since 2011, TUF has been based at [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering]], where Cappos, working with a team of graduate students and developers, continues to supervise its development and integration initiatives.

TUF is [[open-source software]], which means all relevant source code can be accessed free of charge at the project’s repository on [https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf GitHub].

The key concept behind TUF is “compromise-resilience,” or the ability to limit the impact of attacks and provide a mechanism for recovery even if the software repository, or the server on which files are stored, should be compromised.  TUF’s  security strategy improves on existing methods based on [[keysigning]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Assessing Weaknesses in Public Key Infrastructure|url=https://threatpost.com/assessing-weaknesses-in-public-key-infrastructure/128793/| publisher=Threatpost.com|last1=Spring|first1=Tom|date= 7 November 2017|accessdate=13 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite proceedings|title=A Comparative Survey of Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Cryptography|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7086640  |last1=Chandra|first1=Sourabh|last2=Paira|first2=Smita|last3=Alam|first3=Sk Safikul|last4=Sanyal|first4=Goutam|date=November 2014|publisher=ICECCE|pages=83–93}}</ref> by incorporating strategies, such as separation of signing duties.

The technology that evolved into TUF was first developed at the University of Washington in 2009 by Justin Samuel and [[Justin Cappos]], and its principles were first discussed in a paper Samuel and Cappos coauthored with Nick Mathewson and [[Roger Dingledine]], researchers from [[The Tor Project, Inc.]].<ref>{{cite proceedings|title=Survivable Key Compromise in Software Update Systems|url=https://justinsamuel.com/papers/survivable-key-compromise-ccs2010.pdf|last1=Samuel|first1=Justin|last2=Mathewson|first2=Nick|last3=Cappos|first3=Justin|last4=Dingledine|first4=Roger|publisher=ACM|pages=61–72|via=CCS 2010}}</ref> Since 2011, TUF has been based at [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering]], where Cappos, working with a team of graduate students and developers, continues to supervise its development and integration initiatives.

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />

== Reproduction ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. 

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quarters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />

== Reproduction ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. 

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>.

''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />

== Reproduction ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. 

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quarters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />.

'''Martin Newell''' (born 4 March 1953) is an English [[singer-songwriter]], poet, [[columnist]], and author who leads the Cleaners from Venus, a [[guitar pop]] band with [[Jangle pop|jangly]], upbeat arrangements. He is also regarded as a significant figure in the history of [[cassette culture]] and [[DIY music]]. His most popular work is ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'' (1993), produced by [[Andy Partridge]] of [[XTC]].

==Musical career==

===1973–1979===
In the summer of 1973, a 20-year-old Newell joined the glam-rock band '''Plod''' as their lead singer, replacing founder member and lead singer [[Steve Travis]] (Greenfield). Plod was signed to London-based indie label Banjul Records in early 1975, and quickly began recording tracks for an album. However, contractual irregularities and financial problems at the label prevented the album from being finished or released,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and the band broke up within a few months of being signed. In 2003, one track from the sessions (\"Neo City\") was released on a 70s glam-rock compilation CD titled ''[[Velvet Tinmine]]''. This track was credited to ''The'' Plod, and remains the only officially issued work by the band.

Newell then joined '''Gypp''', a pop-oriented progressive rock band, as lead singer. Gypp also played abroad and became popular in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia area thanks to their live performances. Gypp issued one 3-song 7-inch EP in 1978, but their music was out of step with the punk-oriented trends of the UK music scene at the time and the EP received a negative review in the ''[[New Musical Express]].''  Demoralised, Newell left the band. By his own account, he then became a \"musical recluse\", staying in the studio and creating new songs but not playing live gigs for many years.

===1979–1992===
In the late seventies, Newell led a four-piece rock combo called '''The Stray Trolleys'''. They recorded material in 1979 and 1980, but it was not released until after the band had broken up.

In the meantime, Newell issued his first solo single (\"Young Jobless\" b/w \"Sylvie in Toytown\") on vinyl in 1980. By the end of 1980, he was collaborating with Lawrence \"Lol\" Elliot as '''The Cleaners from Venus''', a band that mostly released their work on cassettes outside the traditional music distribution channels.

By 1983, The Cleaners from Venus had evolved into a band with a floating line-up that featured Newell as its only constant. The band still primarily issued material on cassette, got signed to the West German independent label Modell Records for one vinyl album (''Under Wartime Conditions'') and ultimately to the German leg of [[RCA]] Records which released two albums (''Going to England'', ''Town and Country'').

[[Giles Smith]] joined Newell as the only other official member of Cleaners From Venus between 1986 and 1988, and in 1987, Newell returned to performing live under The Cleaners of<!-- Is \"of\" deliberate here, or just a typo for \"from\"? --> Venus banner. As well, while regularly releasing Cleaners From Venus material on cassette, through the 1980s Newell also occasionally released cassette singles and albums under his own name. On these solo releases he was usually the only musician.

In spring 1988 Newell and Nelson (Peter Nice) formed the [[Musical_ensemble#Two_parts|duo]] '''The Brotherhood of Lizards''', self-releasing the [[Mini-LP|mini-album]] ''The Brotherhood of Lizards'' that same year, followed by the album ''Lizardland'' released on [[Independent record label|independent label]] Deltic Records in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Martin |title=Lizard Tails -- Martin Looks Back |url=http://www.stevedix.de/newell/overview.html |website=Martin Newell's website |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> To support the album the duo embarked on a [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] promotional tour, cycling over 1000 miles across southern England between October 1989 and February 1990 to make local radio appearances and and do local newspaper interviews, while also [[Street performance|busking]] and performing gigs. The uniqueness of this \"green tour\" caught the attention of the [[Media of the United Kingdom|mainstream media]] with the duo making half a dozen televison appearances, and interviews with them appeared in the [[NME]], [[Melody Maker]], [[The Guardian]], [[The Independent]], [[The Mail on Sunday]] and [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]. On completion of the tour Nelson was recruited as the replacement bass player for the band [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]] and the Brotherhood of Lizards disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Martin |title=Martin Newell's Illustrated Tour Diaries |url=http://www.stevedix.de/newell/lizarddiaries.html |website=Martin Newell's website |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Frometa |first1=RJ |title=Captured Tracks Releases Reissue Of Brotherhood of Lizards “Lizardland” TODAY |url=https://ventsmagazine.com/2016/08/19/captured-tracks-releases-reissue-brotherhood-lizards-lizardland-today/ |website=Vents Magazine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===1993–present===
In 1993, Newell began working primarily as a solo artist with more conventional production values. His first non-cassette solo album, ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'', was produced by [[XTC]]'s [[Andy Partridge]], and was a critical success.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Commercially, it remains his most popular and successful album.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  It was followed by three more albums (''The Off White Album'', produced by [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]], ''The Spirit Cage'' and ''Radio Autumn Attic'') and an EP (''Songs from the Station Hotel'') that continued to explore the same subject matter as ''Englishman'', including the charms of rural or small-town English life and portraits of characters and scenes.

Newell has also made live appearances with The Cleaners from Venus and The Stray Trolleys in the 1990s and beyond, and has issued several post-1993 live recordings with these bands. However, studio releases credited to these groups post-1993 are actually all CD reissues of pre-1993 material previously released only on cassette. In addition, Gypp played reunion gigs in 1996, and live Gypp material – as well as Gypp demos recorded in the late 1970s – have now been officially issued on CD.

In 2004 Newell released an album of light jazz songs, ''The Light Programme''. The album was not particularly successful commercially but his next album ''A Summer Tamarind'' returned to his usual style and was much more warmly received.

In late 2005 the British singer [[Richard Shelton (actor)|Richard Shelton]] released a jazz vocal album called ''Top Cat'' with five Newell compositions. Newell's songs have also been recorded by Miki Huber, The Jennifers, Kerry Getz, [[R. Stevie Moore]] and [[Alphaville (group)|Alphaville]].

==Literary career==
Newell is better known to some as a poet and author; he has released several volumes of poetry (often in collaboration with [[James Dodds]]) and a memoir, ''This Little Ziggy'', about his youth and his days in Plod. In 2007 he released a volume of reminiscences, anecdotes and historical information about his beloved Wivenhoe. He is also a weekly contributor of poetry to ''[[The Sunday Express]],'' He now writes a weekly column for the East Anglian Daily Times (for which he won columnist of the year in the EDF/ East of England Media Awards in January 2010), performs annually at the [[Essex Book Festival]] and occasionally  issues spoken word recordings of his poems.

'''Martin Newell''' (born 4 March 1953) is an English [[singer-songwriter]], poet, [[columnist]], and author who leads the Cleaners from Venus, a [[guitar pop]] band with [[Jangle pop|jangly]], upbeat arrangements. He is also regarded as a significant figure in the history of [[cassette culture]] and [[DIY music]]. His most popular work is ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'' (1993), produced by [[Andy Partridge]] of [[XTC]].

==Musical career==

===1973–1979===
In the summer of 1973, a 20-year-old Newell joined the glam-rock band '''Plod''' as their lead singer, replacing founder member and lead singer [[Steve Travis]] (Greenfield). Plod was signed to London-based indie label Banjul Records in early 1975, and quickly began recording tracks for an album. However, contractual irregularities and financial problems at the label prevented the album from being finished or released,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and the band broke up within a few months of being signed. In 2003, one track from the sessions (\"Neo City\") was released on a 70s glam-rock compilation CD titled ''[[Velvet Tinmine]]''. This track was credited to ''The'' Plod, and remains the only officially issued work by the band.

Newell then joined '''Gypp''', a pop-oriented progressive rock band, as lead singer. Gypp also played abroad and became popular in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia area thanks to their live performances. Gypp issued one 3-song 7-inch EP in 1978, but their music was out of step with the punk-oriented trends of the UK music scene at the time and the EP received a negative review in the ''[[New Musical Express]].''  Demoralised, Newell left the band. By his own account, he then became a \"musical recluse\", staying in the studio and creating new songs but not playing live gigs for many years.

===1979–1992===
In the late seventies, Newell led a four-piece rock combo called '''The Stray Trolleys'''. They recorded material in 1979 and 1980, but it was not released until after the band had broken up.

In the meantime, Newell issued his first solo single (\"Young Jobless\" b/w \"Sylvie in Toytown\") on vinyl in 1980. By the end of 1980, he was collaborating with Lawrence \"Lol\" Elliot as '''The Cleaners from Venus''', a band that mostly released their work on cassettes outside the traditional music distribution channels.

By 1983, The Cleaners from Venus had evolved into a band with a floating line-up that featured Newell as its only constant. The band still primarily issued material on cassette, got signed to the West German independent label Modell Records for one vinyl album (''Under Wartime Conditions'') and ultimately to the German leg of [[RCA]] Records which released two albums (''Going to England'', ''Town and Country'').

[[Giles Smith]] joined Newell as the only other official member of Cleaners From Venus between 1986 and 1988, and in 1987, Newell returned to performing live under The Cleaners of<!-- Is \"of\" deliberate here, or just a typo for \"from\"? --> Venus banner. As well, while regularly releasing Cleaners From Venus material on cassette, through the 1980s Newell also occasionally released cassette singles and albums under his own name. On these solo releases he was usually the only musician.

In spring 1988 Newell and Nelson (Peter Nice) formed the [[Musical_ensemble#Two_parts|duo]] '''The Brotherhood of Lizards''', self-releasing the [[Mini-LP|mini-album]] ''The Brotherhood of Lizards'' that same year, followed by the album ''Lizardland'' released on [[Independent record label|independent label]] Deltic Records in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Martin |title=Lizard Tails -- Martin Looks Back |url=http://www.stevedix.de/newell/overview.html |website=Martin Newell's website |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> To support the album the duo embarked on a [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] promotional tour, cycling over 1000 miles across southern England between October 1989 and February 1990 to make local radio appearances and and do local newspaper interviews, while also [[Street performance|busking]] and performing gigs. The uniqueness of this \"green tour\" caught the attention of the [[Media of the United Kingdom|mainstream media]] with the duo making half a dozen televison appearances, and interviews with them appearing in the [[NME]], [[Melody Maker]], [[The Guardian]], [[The Independent]], [[The Mail on Sunday]] and [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]. On completion of the tour Nelson was recruited as the replacement bass player for the band [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]] and the Brotherhood of Lizards disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Martin |title=Martin Newell's Illustrated Tour Diaries |url=http://www.stevedix.de/newell/lizarddiaries.html |website=Martin Newell's website |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Frometa |first1=RJ |title=Captured Tracks Releases Reissue Of Brotherhood of Lizards “Lizardland” TODAY |url=https://ventsmagazine.com/2016/08/19/captured-tracks-releases-reissue-brotherhood-lizards-lizardland-today/ |website=Vents Magazine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===1993–present===
In 1993, Newell began working primarily as a solo artist with more conventional production values. His first non-cassette solo album, ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'', was produced by [[XTC]]'s [[Andy Partridge]], and was a critical success.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Commercially, it remains his most popular and successful album.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  It was followed by three more albums (''The Off White Album'', produced by [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]], ''The Spirit Cage'' and ''Radio Autumn Attic'') and an EP (''Songs from the Station Hotel'') that continued to explore the same subject matter as ''Englishman'', including the charms of rural or small-town English life and portraits of characters and scenes.

Newell has also made live appearances with The Cleaners from Venus and The Stray Trolleys in the 1990s and beyond, and has issued several post-1993 live recordings with these bands. However, studio releases credited to these groups post-1993 are actually all CD reissues of pre-1993 material previously released only on cassette. In addition, Gypp played reunion gigs in 1996, and live Gypp material – as well as Gypp demos recorded in the late 1970s – have now been officially issued on CD.

In 2004 Newell released an album of light jazz songs, ''The Light Programme''. The album was not particularly successful commercially but his next album ''A Summer Tamarind'' returned to his usual style and was much more warmly received.

In late 2005 the British singer [[Richard Shelton (actor)|Richard Shelton]] released a jazz vocal album called ''Top Cat'' with five Newell compositions. Newell's songs have also been recorded by Miki Huber, The Jennifers, Kerry Getz, [[R. Stevie Moore]] and [[Alphaville (group)|Alphaville]].

==Literary career==
Newell is better known to some as a poet and author; he has released several volumes of poetry (often in collaboration with [[James Dodds]]) and a memoir, ''This Little Ziggy'', about his youth and his days in Plod. In 2007 he released a volume of reminiscences, anecdotes and historical information about his beloved Wivenhoe. He is also a weekly contributor of poetry to ''[[The Sunday Express]],'' He now writes a weekly column for the East Anglian Daily Times (for which he won columnist of the year in the EDF/ East of England Media Awards in January 2010), performs annually at the [[Essex Book Festival]] and occasionally  issues spoken word recordings of his poems.

'''David \"Dave\" Cornthwaite''' is an [[English people|English]] [[adventurer]], [[writer]] and filmmaker. He is best known for his Expedition1000 project, a plan to undertake 25 separate journeys of 1000 miles or more, each using a different form of non-motorised transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/blog/2014/07/23/meet-a-traveller-dave-cornthwaite-record-breaking-adventurer-and-overland-traveller/|title=Meet a traveller: Dave Cornthwaite, record-breaking adventurer and overland traveller|author=Lonely Planet|work=lonelyplanet.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"e1000\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.davecornthwaite.com/journeys/4578966999 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030022705/http://www.davecornthwaite.com/journeys/4578966999 |archive-date=30 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Cornthwaite was born in England and attended [http://www.dukeofkentschool.org.uk/ Duke of Kent School] in Surrey and then [[Stamford School]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. After finishing his high school education, he travelled to [[Uganda]] as a volunteer in a [[gap year]] teaching scheme organised by Africa & Asia Venture. Cornthwaite called this \"his first taste of adventure\".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==BoardFree==
In May and June 2006, Cornthwaite skateboarded along Britain's [[Land's End to John o'Groats|End-to-end]] route from [[John O'Groats]] to [[Lands End]], a distance of {{convert|1442|km|mi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/4788111.stm |title=UK &#124; Wales &#124; South West Wales &#124; Skateboarder's Down Under attempt |publisher=BBC News |date=13 August 2006 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref> The journey took 34 days. Three rest days were required when Cornthwaite developed severe [[blisters]]. On 2 June 2006, Cornthwaite completed the journey, becoming the first person to do so on a skateboard.

==Expedition1000==
Expedition1000 is Cornthwaite's 12-year career project to make twenty-five journeys of {{convert|1000|mi|km}} or more, each using a different form of non-motorised transport.<ref name=\"e1000\" />
 
From 3 to 16 April 2011, Cornthwaite and Sebastian Terry journeyed {{convert|1400|mi|km}}  from [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] by [[tandem bicycle]]. Neither had previously ridden a tandem bike.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maptia.com/davecornthwaite/stories/vancouver-to-vegas-by-tandem|title=Vancouver to Vegas by Tandem|author=|work=Maptia.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.davecornthwaite.com/tandem/4579328172 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030043659/http://www.davecornthwaite.com/tandem/4579328172 |archive-date=30 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 19 June 2011, Cornthwaite began a {{convert|2340|mi|km|adj=on}}, [[Guinness World Record]]-setting journey down the [[Mississippi River]] from source to sea on a [[Stand up paddle surfing|stand up paddleboard]]. The journey started at Elk Lake, just south of [[Lake Itasca]], in [[Minnesota]]. The descent of the Mississippi River took 68 days including passage through falls, dams and locks. [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Hurricane Lee]] caused Cornthwaite to leave the water for a time, lengthening the trip to a total of 82 days. Cornthwaite carried all of his provisions by securing them in waterproof bags strapped to the deck of his paddleboard. Cornthwaite's speed depended on that of the [[current (stream)|current]]. The greatest distance covered in one day was {{convert|77|mi|km}}, just upstream of St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/08/dave-cornthwaite-paddleboarding-mississippi-river_n_952846.html|title=Dave Cornthwaite Paddleboards Down Mississippi River, Gets into Record Books|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

In March 2012, in a fifth adventure for Expedition1000, Cornthwaite and a crew of ten sailed from [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Mexico]], to [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The {{convert|3156|mi|km|adj=on}} journey took 17 days. During this time, Cornthwaite and Emily Penn (the program director of Pangaea Explorations) conducted a series of workshops on topics ranging from ocean science to social media to diagnosis of personal happiness and purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.active-traveller.com/people/interview-dave-cornthwaite|title=Active-Traveller – Interview: Dave Cornthwaite|author=Mike Walker|work=Active-Traveller|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

During August and September 2012, Cornthwaite swam {{convert|1001|mi|km}} down the [[Missouri River]], from [[Chamberlain, South Dakota]] towards [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. He had a support crew of six but pulled his provisions along behind him on a raft. The swim raised funds for CoppaFeel!, a breast cancer awareness organization.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swimming 1,000 Miles down the Missouri River|url=https://www.gapyear.com/features/188357/swimming-1000-miles-down-the-missouri-river|website=Gapyear.com|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>

==Other expeditions==
In April 2010, Cornthwaite and Sebastian Terry became the first people to cross [[Lake Geneva]] on stand up paddleboards. They made the {{convert|87|km|mi|adj=on|order=flip}} journey in less than two days. Cornthwaite produced a documentary [[DVD]] of the expedition entitled ''Lake Geneva Crossing''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wideworldmag.com/features/great-big-paddle-across-lake-geneva |accessdate=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119220147/http://www.wideworldmag.com/features/great-big-paddle-across-lake-geneva |archivedate=19 January 2011 }}</ref>

In June 2010, Cornthwaite and [[Sarah Outen]] paddled {{convert|150|mi|km}} from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to beneath the [[Tower Bridge]] in [[London]]. The five-day journey, which finished on 8 June 2010, [[World Oceans Day]], was a celebration of Britain's inland waterways.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bristol.indymedia.org.uk/article/690165?show_preferences=true |title=network23 &#124; a network for free sites |publisher=Bristol.indymedia.org.uk |accessdate=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112110321/https://bristol.indymedia.org.uk/article/690165?show_preferences=true |archive-date=12 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Writing==
Cornthwaite writes about his journeys in a personal [[blog]], in [[freelance]] magazine contributions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensfitness.co.uk/exercise/sports/6631/adventure_holidays_on_a_budget.html |title=Adventure holidays on a budget &#124; Men's Fitness UK |publisher=Mensfitness.co.uk |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref> and books.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cornthwaite|first=Dave|title=Board Free|year=2008|publisher=Portico|isbn=978-1-906032-19-7|pages=279}}</ref>

'''David \"Dave\" Cornthwaite''' is an [[English people|English]] [[adventurer]], [[writer]] and filmmaker. He is best known for his Expedition1000 project, a plan to undertake 25 separate journeys of 1000 miles or more, each using a different form of non-motorised transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/blog/2014/07/23/meet-a-traveller-dave-cornthwaite-record-breaking-adventurer-and-overland-traveller/|title=Meet a traveller: Dave Cornthwaite, record-breaking adventurer and overland traveller|author=Lonely Planet|work=lonelyplanet.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"e1000\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.davecornthwaite.com/journeys/4578966999 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030022705/http://www.davecornthwaite.com/journeys/4578966999 |archive-date=30 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Cornthwaite was born in England and attended [http://www.dukeofkentschool.org.uk/ Duke of Kent School] in Surrey and then [[Stamford School]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. After finishing his high school education, he travelled to [[Uganda]] as a volunteer in a [[gap year]] teaching scheme organised by Africa & Asia Venture. Cornthwaite called this \"his first taste of adventure\".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==BoardFree==
In May and June 2006, Cornthwaite skateboarded along Britain's [[Land's End to John o'Groats|End-to-end]] route from [[John O'Groats]] to [[Lands End]], a distance of {{convert|1442|km|mi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/4788111.stm |title=UK &#124; Wales &#124; South West Wales &#124; Skateboarder's Down Under attempt |publisher=BBC News |date=13 August 2006 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref> The journey took 34 days. Three rest days were required when Cornthwaite developed severe [[blisters]]. On 2 June 2006, Cornthwaite completed the journey, becoming the first person to do so on a skateboard. This journey and another in [[Australia]]<ref>Gibson J.

==Expedition1000==
Expedition1000 is Cornthwaite's 12-year career project to make twenty-five journeys of {{convert|1000|mi|km}} or more, each using a different form of non-motorised transport.<ref name=\"e1000\" />
 
From 3 to 16 April 2011, Cornthwaite and Sebastian Terry journeyed {{convert|1400|mi|km}}  from [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] by [[tandem bicycle]]. Neither had previously ridden a tandem bike.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maptia.com/davecornthwaite/stories/vancouver-to-vegas-by-tandem|title=Vancouver to Vegas by Tandem|author=|work=Maptia.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.davecornthwaite.com/tandem/4579328172 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030043659/http://www.davecornthwaite.com/tandem/4579328172 |archive-date=30 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 19 June 2011, Cornthwaite began a {{convert|2340|mi|km|adj=on}}, [[Guinness World Record]]-setting journey down the [[Mississippi River]] from source to sea on a [[Stand up paddle surfing|stand up paddleboard]]. The journey started at Elk Lake, just south of [[Lake Itasca]], in [[Minnesota]]. The descent of the Mississippi River took 68 days including passage through falls, dams and locks. [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Hurricane Lee]] caused Cornthwaite to leave the water for a time, lengthening the trip to a total of 82 days. Cornthwaite carried all of his provisions by securing them in waterproof bags strapped to the deck of his paddleboard. Cornthwaite's speed depended on that of the [[current (stream)|current]]. The greatest distance covered in one day was {{convert|77|mi|km}}, just upstream of St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/08/dave-cornthwaite-paddleboarding-mississippi-river_n_952846.html|title=Dave Cornthwaite Paddleboards Down Mississippi River, Gets into Record Books|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

In March 2012, in a fifth adventure for Expedition1000, Cornthwaite and a crew of ten sailed from [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Mexico]], to [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The {{convert|3156|mi|km|adj=on}} journey took 17 days. During this time, Cornthwaite and Emily Penn (the program director of Pangaea Explorations) conducted a series of workshops on topics ranging from ocean science to social media to diagnosis of personal happiness and purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.active-traveller.com/people/interview-dave-cornthwaite|title=Active-Traveller – Interview: Dave Cornthwaite|author=Mike Walker|work=Active-Traveller|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>

During August and September 2012, Cornthwaite swam {{convert|1001|mi|km}} down the [[Missouri River]], from [[Chamberlain, South Dakota]] towards [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. He had a support crew of six but pulled his provisions along behind him on a raft. The swim raised funds for CoppaFeel!, a breast cancer awareness organization.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swimming 1,000 Miles down the Missouri River|url=https://www.gapyear.com/features/188357/swimming-1000-miles-down-the-missouri-river|website=Gapyear.com|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>

==Other expeditions==
In April 2010, Cornthwaite and Sebastian Terry became the first people to cross [[Lake Geneva]] on stand up paddleboards. They made the {{convert|87|km|mi|adj=on|order=flip}} journey in less than two days. Cornthwaite produced a documentary [[DVD]] of the expedition entitled ''Lake Geneva Crossing''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wideworldmag.com/features/great-big-paddle-across-lake-geneva |accessdate=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119220147/http://www.wideworldmag.com/features/great-big-paddle-across-lake-geneva |archivedate=19 January 2011 }}</ref>

In June 2010, Cornthwaite and [[Sarah Outen]] paddled {{convert|150|mi|km}} from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to beneath the [[Tower Bridge]] in [[London]]. The five-day journey, which finished on 8 June 2010, [[World Oceans Day]], was a celebration of Britain's inland waterways.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bristol.indymedia.org.uk/article/690165?show_preferences=true |title=network23 &#124; a network for free sites |publisher=Bristol.indymedia.org.uk |accessdate=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112110321/https://bristol.indymedia.org.uk/article/690165?show_preferences=true |archive-date=12 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

'''University of Guam''' ({{lang-ch|Unibetsedåt Guåhan}}) ('''U.O.G.''') is a public [[land-grant university]] in [[Mangilao, Guam]]. It is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] and offers thirty-four degree programs at the undergraduate level and eleven  master's level programs. Of the university's 3,387 students, 94% are of [[Asian people|Asian]]-[[Pacific Islander]] ethnicity and nearly 72% are full-time (fall 2012 figures). A full-time faculty of about 180 supports the university's mission of \"Ina, Diskubre, Setbe\"&mdash; which translates to \"To Enlighten, to Discover, to Serve.\"

== History ==
University of Guam was founded in 1952 as a two-year teacher-training school known as the '''Territorial College of Guam''', established by Governor [[Carlton Skinner]].<ref name=sfgate>{{cite web| last = Fagan| first = Kevin| authorlink = | title = Carlton Skinner -- broke racial barriers in Navy| publisher = San Francisco Chronicle| date = 29 August 2004| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F08%2F29%2FBAG858GD2T1.DTL&type=printable| doi = | accessdate =  5 May 2009}}</ref>  In 1960, the college moved to the present campus in the central district of [[Mangilao, Guam|Mangilao]]. In 1965, the college was accredited as a four-year, degree granting institution. By 1968, enrollment had reached 1,800 students while staff and faculty totaled more than 130. It was designated as a [[land grant institution]] by the [[United States Congress]] in 1972.

'''University of Guam''' ({{lang-ch|Unibetsedåt Guåhan}}) ('''U.O.G.''') is a public [[land-grant university]] in [[Mangilao, Guam]]. It is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] and offers thirty-four degree programs at the undergraduate level and eleven  master's level programs. Of the university's 3,387 students, 94% are of [[Asian people|Asian]]-[[Pacific Islander]] ethnicity and nearly 72% are full-time (fall 2012 figures). A full-time faculty of about 180 supports the university's mission of \"Ina, Diskubre, Setbe\"&mdash; which translates to \"To Enlighten, to Discover, to Serve.\"

== History ==
University of Guam was founded in 1952 as a two-year teacher-training school known as the '''Territorial College of Guam''', established by Governor [[Carlton Skinner]].<ref name=sfgate>{{cite web| last = Fagan| first = Kevin| authorlink = | title = Carlton Skinner -- broke racial barriers in Navy| publisher = San Francisco Chronicle| date = 29 August 2004| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F08%2F29%2FBAG858GD2T1.DTL&type=printable| doi = | accessdate =  5 May 2009}}</ref>  In 1960, the college moved to the present campus in the central district of [[Mangilao, Guam|Mangilao]]. In 1965, the college was accredited as a four-year, degree granting institution. By 1968, enrollment had reached 1,800 students while staff and faculty totaled more than 130. It was designated as a [[land grant institution]] by the [[United States Congress]] in 1972.

''Killa Season'' garnered a positive reception but [[Music journalism|music critics]] were mixed toward Cam's choices in production and lyrical content compared to ''[[Purple Haze (album)|Purple Haze]]''. Peter Relic of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' found criticism in the album's production and soul samples and Cam's insults towards [[Jay-Z]] but still found it entertaining with its wordplay, saying that \"''Killa Season'' proves Cam'ron can still bring heady verbiage and heat, but it's doubtful Jay-Z is losing much sleep.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> While also finding the production decent, Brian Sims of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' praised the album's skits and hooks and Cam's delivery for bringing light to creative imagery, saying that \"As an industry veteran, Cam deserves a lot of credit for not using his album to address petty squabbles or provide some pseudo-intellectual autobiography.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/> [[AllMusic]] editor David Jeffries said that the album was in need of a rewrite on some tracks but still found it enjoyable with memorable hooks and for showing a vulnerable side in Cam, concluding that \"''Killa Season'' would have benefited from trimming and better planning, but those things are extremely rare in the world of Dipset. Taking that into account, the album is exceptional and a good enough excuse for two more years of mouthing off and starting trouble.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/>

Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews praised the album for continuing ''Purple Haze''{{'}}s formula with tight wordplay and loose soul sample production, despite containing tracks that were Dipset holdovers, concluding that, \"Nonetheless Cam fans should be happy with ''Killa Season'', an album which continues his recent trend of solid (if somewhat unspectacular) solo CD's.\"<ref name=\"RR\"/> Jayson Greene of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' found some of Cam's lyrics humorous at times, but found the production and guest artists lacking in variety in terms of go-to names, concluding with \"Instead, ''Killa Season'' is a retreat, an album to satisfy the converted but one that will keep his mythical status confined to the 12-mile radius of his Manhattan home.\"<ref name=\"Stylus\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' writer Ryan Dombal felt the album was a disappointment compared to ''Purple Haze'', finding the production lacking in energy and in need of more humorous songs (\"I.B.S.\") then aggressive diss tracks (\"You Gotta Love It\"). Dombal also pointed out that the limited edition of the album contained a DVD that reveals Cam'ron's battle with Jay-Z was all for publicity, concluding that, \"If this underwhelming offering is any indication, such blind self-reference has considerably slowed down Cam'ron's once-unstoppable Dipset Movement.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>

== Discovery ==
This species was first discovered by Edith Marion Patch in 1914.<ref name=\"Global Biodiversity Information Facility - Aphis spiraecola (Patch, 1914)\" /> Patch discovered that ''A. pomi'' would feed and develop on Spiraea and ''A. spiraecola'' would feed and develop on Malus which confirmed that Aphids were a highly variable species.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Halbert|first=Susan E|last2=Voegtlin|first2=David J|date=1992|title=Morphological Differentiation Between Aphis Spiraecola and Aphis Pomi (Homoptera: Aphididae)|url=|journal=The Great Lakes Entomologist|volume=25|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Patch, Edith M.

== Anatomy ==
This species of aphid can range from a bright greenish-yellow color to an apple green, hence their common name. They have a dark-brown head and thorax, and a yellowish-green abdomen with dusky lateral patches on each segment with a membranous and pale dorsum.<ref name=\":0\" /> They are often confused with ''Aphis pomi'' (apple aphid) due to overlapping host plants that they aggregate to; However, they are also morphologically different as ''A. pomi''  have marginal tubercles on their lower abdomen while ''A. spiraecola'' do not.<ref name=\":1\" />

== Reproduction ==
''A. spiraecola'' is an holocyclic species, meaning that they undergo sexual reproduction during part of its life cycle and reproduces entirely parthenogenetically over most of its geographical range.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Where it is holocyclic and produces sexual morphs, the primary hosts are Spiraea or Citrus.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://influentialpoints.com/Gallery/Aphis_spiraecola_spirea_aphid.htm|title=Aphis spiraecola (Spirea aphid) identification, images, ecology, control|website=influentialpoints.com|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>

== Diet ==
''Aphis spiraecola'' is found on over 65 plant genera including economically important crops like citrus, cacao, ''papaya anona, Malus sp., Pirus sp., Prunus sp.'' etc. Except the ''Lavandula sp.'' and ''Paliurus spina-christi'', all the host plants are evergreen and ''Aphis spiraecola'' is found on these two host plants mostly during the plants flowering time.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Blackman, R. L. (Roger L.), 1941-|title=Aphids on the world's crops : an identification guide|date=1984|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-90426-0|oclc=1053979324}}</ref> This species is polyphagous, meaning it can feed on a variety of different foods allowing it to survive in a plethora of environments. They typically  feed on young buds/flowers, shoots and leaves of host plants.<ref name=\":0\" /> If introduced to a new place, the odds of it surviving and reproducing are very good, barring cold climates as mentioned previously. Primary (winter) hosts are ''Spiraea spp.'' and ''Citrus spp.'' with numerous secondary host plants, in well over 20 families, particularly in the ''Caprifoliaceae, Compositae, Rosaceae, Rubiaceae'' and ''Rutaceae'' families. This aphid has been found to have a preference for woody plants of a shrubby growth habit with citrus and apples being the most important/affected crop hosts.<ref name=\":0\" />

== Distribution ==
''A. spiraecola'' is globally distributed among temperate and tropical regions, including Asia, Africa, North America, Europe, and Oceanic regions with the exception of cold regions. This species is thought to have originated in the Far East, dating back to at least 1907 in North America, Australia in 1926, New Zealand in 1931, the Mediterranean in 1939, Africa in 196, and Israel in 1970.<ref name=\"Global Biodiversity Information Facility - Aphis spiraecola (Patch, 1914)\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Today, ''A. spiraecola'' is found all over the world , whether they are native or introduced to the area, and have been found to be invasive almost everywhere they reside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/6221#todistribution|title=Aphis spiraecola (Spirea aphid) Distribution|last=|first=|date=2019|website=CABI|series=Distribution/Distribution Table|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> There are many possibilities and risks of introducing this species to new geographic areas. One of which is the movement of fruits or ornamental plants which can transport this organism to a new geographic area, and since it has the ability to feed on almost any food source, it can easily survive and reproduce in almost any environment, thus introducing them to a new area where they can survive.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />

== Environmental Impact ==
''A. spiraecola'' is a pest of citrus, apples and ornamentals.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> They also transmit a large portion of plant viruses which can cause entire crop yields to be at risk of being affected. Therefore ''A. spiraecola'' poses a significant negative impact on crop production and possibly economic loss, however they don't seem to impact much else in terms of human/animal health, aquaculture, native fauna/flora, tourism, trade, transportation, or the environment/biodiversity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/6221#toimpactSummary|title=Aphis spiraecola (Spirea aphid): Impact Summary|last=|first=|date=2019|website=CABI|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gómez-Marco|first=F|last2=Tena|first2=A|last3=Jaques|first3=J|last4=García|first4=A|date=2016|title=Early arrival of predators controls Aphis spiraecola colonies in citrus clementines.|journal=Journal of Pest Science|volume=89|pages=69–79|doi=10.1007/s10340-015-0668-9}}</ref>

== Prevention and Control ==
Despite being native in certain terrestrial regions, this species can be severely detrimental to crops in a variety of regions, making them invasive virtually everywhere they inhabit. Many predators prey on ''A. spiraecola'' colonies but this doesn't result in ample population control.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Insecticides are recommended for pest control on citrus crop hosts affected by ''A. spiraecola.''

'''James P. Conrad''' (born February 12, 1977) is an American retired [[soccer]] player who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]]. During his 13-year MLS career, he was four-time [[MLS Best XI]] and the 2005 [[MLS Defender of the Year Award|MLS Defender of the Year]]. He also earned 27 [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team]] and went to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. After his playing career Conrad has worked in the media industry <ref>{{cite web|last=Laird |first=Sam |url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/19/soccer-youtube-jimmy-conrad-kick-tv/#0nOvi.RJSkqM |title=A Soccer Star's Transition From the Pitch to YouTube |publisher=Mashable |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}</ref> and currently stars on his [[YouTube]] channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJimmyConrad Jimmy Conrad]. He currently serves as the head coach of [[USL League Two]] side [[San Francisco Glens]].

==Career==

===High school and college===
Born in [[Arcadia, California]], Conrad attended [[Temple City High School]] in [[Temple City, California]] and was a four-year letterman in soccer. Conrad played at [[San Diego State University]] in 1994 and 1995, and then transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. While playing for UCLA, he was a member of the 1997 [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|NCAA Championship]] team.

===Professional===
Undrafted by MLS, Conrad had an unsuccessful trial with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]].  However, the Galaxy coaching staff recommended he play for one of their affiliated lower division teams.  Consequently, Conrad contacted the now-defunct [[San Diego Flash]] of the [[USL First Division|A-League]] which gave him a contract.  In 1999, [[Brian Quinn (soccer)|Brian Quinn]] became the head coach of the [[San Jose Clash]].  When Quinn began searching for an additional defender and goalkeeper for the Clash, [[Ralf Wilhelms]], head coach of the Flash and a former teammate of Quinn on the [[San Diego Sockers (1974–96)|San Diego Sockers]], recommended Conrad and Flash goalkeeper [[Joe Cannon (soccer)|Joe Cannon]].<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/20060118-9999-lz1s18soccr-1.html Often-overlooked Jimmy Conrad, now with national team, has proved doubters wrong]</ref>  The Clash signed Conrad that year.  He played with the club, later re-branded as the Earthquakes, for four seasons, helping them to the [[MLS Cup]] in 2001. In 2000, he also played for [[Lech Poznań]] in Poland.

In 2003, Conrad was traded to the Wizards for a second-round draft pick, which the 'Quakes used to select [[Arturo Álvarez (footballer, born 1985)|Arturo Alvarez]]. Conrad's stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he helped the Wizards to the [[US Open Cup]] and the MLS Cup Final as the leader of the league's stingiest defense and was named to the league's [[MLS Best XI|Best XI]] and was a finalist for [[MLS Defender of the Year Award]]. He won the award a year later.

Despite rumors of a possible European transfer following the Wizards' disappointing 2006 season, Conrad renewed his contract with the Wizards beginning the 2007 season, and new head coach [[Curt Onalfo]] rewarded him the club captaincy.

Conrad was out of contract after the [[2010 MLS season]] and elected to participate in the [[2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft]]. On December 15, 2010 Conrad was selected by [[Chivas USA]] in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft |title=Wolff goes 1st in Stage 2 Re-Entry Draft, Ángel to LA  |work=www.mlssoccer.com |publisher=Major League Soccer |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219135941/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft |archivedate=19 December 2010 |quote=Wolff's former Kansas City teammate Jimmy Conrad also went in the early going on Wednesday, taken second overall by Chivas USA.

After struggling with injury during the 2011 season, and suffering from side effects of six concussions, Jimmy Conrad announced his retirement from professional soccer on August 18, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ratterree |first=Alicia |url=http://www.thegoatparade.com/2011/8/17/2369285/jimmy-conrad-retires-from-mls |title=Jimmy Conrad Retires from MLS |publisher=The Goat Parade |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>

===International===
Conrad received his first cap for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] on July 7, 2005, in a [[2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] match against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. Less than one year later, Conrad made the U.S. roster for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. In Germany, Conrad came in as a substitute against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the team's 1–1 draw with the eventual champions, and played all ninety minutes against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. On January 20, 2007, Conrad captained the national team for the second time, where the United States hosted an international [[Exhibition game|friendly]] with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. The U.S. won that match 3–1. On February 7, 2007, in an international friendly with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], Conrad was named the [[Man of the Match]]. He scored his first-ever goal for the U.S. in the fifty-second minute of that match. On June 25, 2009, after not having played with the national team in previous qualifying, Conrad was named to the U.S. squad for the upcoming [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usmen.american-soccer-news.com/?p=250|title=Article from American Soccer News|publisher=Usmen.american-soccer-news.com|accessdate=2012-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224183627/http://usmen.american-soccer-news.com/?p=250|archive-date=2012-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

'''''Murder Love''''' is [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[reggae]] musician [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]’s second album. While his preceding album (''[[12 Inches of Snow]]'') featured a wide array of musical genres fusing [[hip-hop]], [[Pop music|pop]], and reggae, ''Murder Love'' was recorded in [[Jamaica]] and primarily featured [[Dancehall reggae|dancehall]] tracks.  A number of songs featured dancehall legends [[Ninjaman]], [[Half Pint]], White Mice, and [[Nadine Sutherland]], and [[Junior Reid]] produced and appeared on the track \"[[Si Wi Dem Nuh Know We]]\". While not producing a hit in the United States, the track \"[[Sexy Girl (Song)|Sexy Girl]]\" reached number one in Japan (becoming the 6th biggest hit of 1995) and the [[Anything for You (Snow song)|\"Anything for You\"]] remix became the top-selling single of 1995 in Jamaica.<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\">See Patricia Meschino, ''Reggae Roots'' Vol. 13:3 (1995).</ref><ref name=\"allmusic.com\">For U.S. charting see: {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=snow-p26072/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}</ref><ref>Jamaican sales and charting data for \"Anything For You\" can be found in Kevin O'Brien Chang and Wayne Chen, ''Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican music'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1998) 211.</ref><ref>For charting in Japan, see: http://www.j-wave.co.jp/original/tokiohot100/cgi-bin/top100.cgi</ref> Ultimately, ''Murder Love'' reached number one the U.S. Reggae charts and \"Si We Dem Nuh Know We\" was nominated for a [[Juno Awards of 1996|Juno]] for best reggae recording. Due to his criminal record, Snow was unable to enter the United States and promote the album.<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\"/><ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/>

== Production ==
In 1993, Snow began touring Jamaica, performing at such venues as the [[University of the West Indies]], Topline, and the Jaguar Lounge in Halfway Tree. While performing at Sun Splash ’93, he befriended Ninjaman and the two began collaborating. As Snow put it, \"we just clicked, so now we always hang out. Everyday when I'm in [[Jamaica]] I hang with him. When he's doing a track, he'll always invite me to come on it with him.\" In addition to working with Ninjaman, Snow began recording with one of the artists that influenced his interest in reggae, Junior Reid, who went on to produce the track that also featured Snow and Ninjaman, \"Si We Dem Nuh Know We.\"<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\"/> Junior Reid also performed as guest vocalist on \"Yesterday.\" Ninjaman also appeared as a guest vocalist on \"Bad Men.\" Nadine Sutherland performed on the first single, \"Anything For You\", and Half-Pint performs on \"Rivertown\" and joins White Mice on \"Time.\" The album featured several producers, including Junior Reid (\"Si We Dem Nuh Know We\"), Onree Gill (\"Bad Men,\" \"Rivertown,\" \"Babylon,\" \"Time,\" \"Dream,\" \"If You Like the Sound,\" and \"Let’s Get it on\"), [[MC Shan]] (\"Yesterday\" and \"Sexy Girl\") and Herby Azor ([[Anything for You (Snow song)|\"Anything for You\"]] and \"Things to Say\").<ref>For credits,see: {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=snow-p26072/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}</ref>

Ultimately, Snow spent eight months in Jamaica recording the album, and his recording crew, including [[M.C. Shan]], [[Hurby Azor]], and Michael Warner, flew to Jamaica to contribute to the album. Snow professed: \"The experience of being in Jamaica definitely shaped the album. When I'm working, I don't listen to other music, for fear of stealing something unconsciously. But down there, you can't get away from music, it's all around you.\" He also observed, \"The forward thing in dancehall reggae now is being positive, not singing all the time about gun talk and women. More than the beats, that had an influence in how the songs came out. Because I was going in that direction, it came together naturally.\"<ref>Lenny Stoute, \"Snow melting away from gangsta talk on new disc Rapper says he's seen the folly of his ways,\" ''Toronto Star'', 16 February 1995, B#</ref>
The name ''Murder Love'' materialized after Snow visited [[Ireland]] during his European tour in 1994. As he explained in 1995, \"It's about the IRA ([[Irish Republican Army]]).  They're killing people they should be loving. I'm saying to Catholics and Protestants, they should be loving because they're one people. I always write words that are hard to understand. You've got to listen. It could mean something different to you, and if it means something different to you that's good. But that's what it means to me.\" Thus, ''The Mail and Globe'' described the track as the \"sinisterly named title track, which has a deceptively lovely chorus.\" <ref>Elizabeth Renzetti, \"White on Black: The Rap on Rap,\" The Globe and Mail, 11 March 1995, 1.</ref>

Upon release, ''Murder Love'' met with mixed reviews. Patricia Meschino of ''Reggae Report'' praised \"Dream\" as one of the albums \"most satisfying cuts.\"  She observed, \"Here Snow reminisces about his days in [[Toronto]]'s Allenbury housing project, where he first became acquainted with Reggae through the friendships formed with the many [[Jamaicans]] who had moved into his area\" and \"goes on to describe imagined evenings spent at [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]'s Godfather's nightclub and sessions with the Stone Love sound system.\"<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\"/> Heidi Seigmund of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"comparisons to rapper [[Vanilla Ice]] were inevitable in '93\" but, \"aside from being white artists working in black-music genres, the similarities end there.\" She went on to observe that \"unlike Ice, Snow really is a skilled performer and an exceptional dancehall talent. That's evident on songs like \"Anything for You,\" a buoyant duet with Nadine Sutherland, \"Things to Say\"—a [[Bob Marley]] tribute sampling [[Bill Withers]]' \"[[Use Me (Bill Withers song)|Use Me]]\"—and \"Rivertown,\" a look at a Jamaican ghetto through the eyes of its young residents.\"<ref>Heidi Sigmund, \"Snow Shows Off Dance Talent on ‘Love,’\" Review of ''Murder Love'', ''Los Angeles Times'', 15 April 1995, 8.</ref>

Chuck Eddy of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' found ''Murder Love'' somewhat indecipherable and a departure from ''12 Inches of Snow'', writing \"slow make out mush replaces the debut’s Algerian-rai/dancehall mix with some lighthearted Marvin Gaye liquid funk,\" and \"like most reggae toasters, Snow seems to have learned to rap by studying [[Dick Van Dyke]]’s ‘hum-diddle-diddle-did-die-hum-diddl-eye’ chimney sweep scat in [[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]. So I can’t guarantee I got the plots of these poems completely right.\"<ref>Chuck Eddy, Review of ''Murder Love'', ''Spin'', April 1995,  201</ref>

While not producing a hit in the United States, the track \"[[Sexy Girl (Song)|Sexy Girl]]\" reached number one in Japan (becoming the 6th biggest hit of 1995) and the [[Anything for You (Snow song)|\"Anything for You\"]] remix became the top-selling single of 1995 in Jamaica.<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\">See Patricia Meschino, ''Reggae Roots'' Vol. 13:3 (1995).</ref><ref name=\"allmusic.com\">For U.S. charting see: {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=snow-p26072/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}</ref><ref>Jamaican sales and charting data for \"Anything For You\" can be found in Kevin O'Brien Chang and Wayne Chen, ''Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican music'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1998) 211.</ref><ref>For charting in Japan, see: http://www.j-wave.co.jp/original/tokiohot100/cgi-bin/top100.cgi</ref> Ultimately, ''Murder Love'' reached number one the U.S. Reggae charts and \"Si We Dem Nuh Know We\" was nominated for a [[Juno Awards of 1996|Juno]] for best reggae recording. Due to his criminal record, Snow was unable to enter the United States and promote the album.<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\"/><ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/>

== Production ==
In 1993, Snow began touring Jamaica, performing at such venues as the [[University of the West Indies]], Topline, and the Jaguar Lounge in Halfway Tree. While performing at Sun Splash ’93, he befriended Ninjaman and the two began collaborating. As Snow put it, \"we just clicked, so now we always hang out. Everyday when I'm in [[Jamaica]] I hang with him. When he's doing a track, he'll always invite me to come on it with him.\" In addition to working with Ninjaman, Snow began recording with one of the artists that influenced his interest in reggae, Junior Reid, who went on to produce the track that also featured Snow and Ninjaman, \"Si We Dem Nuh Know We.\"<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\"/> Junior Reid also performed as guest vocalist on \"Yesterday.\" Ninjaman also appeared as a guest vocalist on \"Bad Men.\" Nadine Sutherland performed on the first single, \"Anything For You\", and Half-Pint performs on \"Rivertown\" and joins White Mice on \"Time.\" The album featured several producers, including Junior Reid (\"Si We Dem Nuh Know We\"), Onree Gill (\"Bad Men,\" \"Rivertown,\" \"Babylon,\" \"Time,\" \"Dream,\" \"If You Like the Sound,\" and \"Let’s Get it on\"), [[MC Shan]] (\"Yesterday\" and \"Sexy Girl\") and Herby Azor ([[Anything for You (Snow song)|\"Anything for You\"]] and \"Things to Say\").<ref>For credits,see: {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=snow-p26072/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}</ref>

Ultimately, Snow spent eight months in Jamaica recording the album, and his recording crew, including [[M.C. Shan]], [[Hurby Azor]], and Michael Warner, flew to Jamaica to contribute to the album. Snow professed: \"The experience of being in Jamaica definitely shaped the album. When I'm working, I don't listen to other music, for fear of stealing something unconsciously. But down there, you can't get away from music, it's all around you.\" He also observed, \"The forward thing in dancehall reggae now is being positive, not singing all the time about gun talk and women. More than the beats, that had an influence in how the songs came out. Because I was going in that direction, it came together naturally.\"<ref>Lenny Stoute, \"Snow melting away from gangsta talk on new disc Rapper says he's seen the folly of his ways,\" ''Toronto Star'', 16 February 1995, B#</ref>
The name ''Murder Love'' materialized after Snow visited [[Ireland]] during his European tour in 1994. As he explained in 1995, \"It's about the IRA ([[Irish Republican Army]]).  They're killing people they should be loving. I'm saying to Catholics and Protestants, they should be loving because they're one people. I always write words that are hard to understand. You've got to listen. It could mean something different to you, and if it means something different to you that's good. But that's what it means to me.\" Thus, ''The Mail and Globe'' described the track as the \"sinisterly named title track, which has a deceptively lovely chorus.\" <ref>Elizabeth Renzetti, \"White on Black: The Rap on Rap,\" The Globe and Mail, 11 March 1995, 1.</ref>

Upon release, ''Murder Love'' met with mixed reviews. Patricia Meschino of ''Reggae Report'' praised \"Dream\" as one of the albums \"most satisfying cuts.\"  She observed, \"Here Snow reminisces about his days in [[Toronto]]'s Allenbury housing project, where he first became acquainted with Reggae through the friendships formed with the many [[Jamaicans]] who had moved into his area\" and \"goes on to describe imagined evenings spent at [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]'s Godfather's nightclub and sessions with the Stone Love sound system.\"<ref name=\"See Patricia Meschino 1995\"/> Heidi Seigmund of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"comparisons to rapper [[Vanilla Ice]] were inevitable in '93\" but, \"aside from being white artists working in black-music genres, the similarities end there.\" She went on to observe that \"unlike Ice, Snow really is a skilled performer and an exceptional dancehall talent. That's evident on songs like \"Anything for You,\" a buoyant duet with Nadine Sutherland, \"Things to Say\"—a [[Bob Marley]] tribute sampling [[Bill Withers]]' \"[[Use Me (Bill Withers song)|Use Me]]\"—and \"Rivertown,\" a look at a Jamaican ghetto through the eyes of its young residents.\"<ref>Heidi Sigmund, \"Snow Shows Off Dance Talent on ‘Love,’\" Review of ''Murder Love'', ''Los Angeles Times'', 15 April 1995, 8.</ref>

Chuck Eddy of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' found ''Murder Love'' somewhat indecipherable and a departure from ''12 Inches of Snow'', writing \"slow make out mush replaces the debut’s Algerian-rai/dancehall mix with some lighthearted Marvin Gaye liquid funk,\" and \"like most reggae toasters, Snow seems to have learned to rap by studying [[Dick Van Dyke]]’s ‘hum-diddle-diddle-did-die-hum-diddl-eye’ chimney sweep scat in [[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]. So I can’t guarantee I got the plots of these poems completely right.\"<ref>Chuck Eddy, Review of ''Murder Love'', ''Spin'', April 1995,  201</ref>

The track between Barmer, forming part of the then [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur princely State]], and Shadi Palli in [[Sindh]], on which the current Thar Link Express runs, was opened in December 1900 to run the '''''Sind Mail''''', which ran between Bombay and Karachi through Munabao, via [[Ahmedabad]] - [[Palanpur]] - [[Marwar]] - [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]] - [[Jodhpur]] - [[Luni Junction railway station|Lun]] - [[Barmer, Rajasthan|Barmer]] - [[Munabao]] -  [[Khokhrapar]] - [[Mirpur Khas]] - [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]. During [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], the rail track was bombed and destroyed by the Pakistani fighter jets, and the Mumbai-Karachi train ended.<ref name=IndTr/><ref name=hindu1>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/how-to-get-to-pakistan/article18438690.ece How to get to Pakistan], ''[[The Hindu]]'', 12 May 2017</ref><ref name=irfca1>{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-inter.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Geography : International|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref><ref name=irfca1/>

On 28 June 1976, India and Pakistan signed the rail communication agreement, to normalise the relations between two nations after signing the [[Simla Agreement]] (2 July 1972) few months after the end of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], when the bilateral relations had soured after the [[Indian Army]] had succeeded in [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberating Bangladesh]]. The renewable rail communication agreement was again extended by both nations from 19 January 2016 to 18 January 2019. This agreement forms the basis of running Thar Link Express, as well as the [[Samjhauta Express]]. The [[Delhi–Lahore Bus]] and [[Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Bus]] are based on a separated agreement.

The Thar Link Express is a continuation of the previous ''[[Sind Mail]]'', when it was revived after a period of 41 years on 18 February 2006. Indian network, on which this train runs, was converted to [[broad gauge]] long ago. In 2005, Pakistan also converted the line from [[metre gauge]] to broad gauge. This enabled both the nations to sign a MoU to reopen the rail link. This was not possible earlier because there would be a change of gauge in between, either at Hyderabad or Mirpur Khas. Prior to 1965, the last Pakistani station was [[Khokhropar railway station]], about 10 kilometers from the border. When the new service began in 2006, Pakistan constructed a new station, called [[Zero Point railway station]], a few hundred meter from the border, where immigration and customs checks are carried out now. Opposite this, six kilometers apart, [[Munabao railway station]] is located on the Indian side of the border in [[Barmer district]] of [[Rajasthan]], where Indian immigration and customs checks are carried out.<ref name=IndTr/><ref name=hindu1/><ref name=irfca1/>

The Thar Express is a continuation of the previous ''[[Sind Mail]]'' which was revived after a period of 41 years on 18 February 2006. The Thar Express travels along the [[Hyderabad–Khokhrapar Branch Line]] which was built in 1892 as the ''Hyderabad–Jodhpur Railway'' and was originally constructed as a {{RailGauge|1676mm}} [[broad gauge]] railway line. In 1901, the section was converted to {{RailGauge|1000mm}} [[metre gauge]] where it joined the second section between Shadipalli and [[Luni Junction railway station|Luni]] and on wards to [[Jodhpur]].<ref name=name>[https://archive.org/stream/BombayBarodaAndCentralIndiaRailwaySystem/Bombay_Baroda_And_Central_India_Railway_System#page/n196/mode/2up  \" Administration Report on the Railways in India – corrected up to 31st March 1918\"; Superintendent of Government  Printing,  Calcutta;  page 188]; Retrieved 6 Feb 2016</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history3.html|title = IR History: Part III (1900-1947)| publisher=IRFCA | accessdate = 30 April 2014}}</ref> In February 2006, the entire Hyderabad–Khokhrapar line was re-converted again back to the original 1676&nbsp;mm broad gauge line.

The track between Barmer, forming part of the then [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur princely State]], and Shadi Palli in [[Sindh]], on which the current Thar Link Express runs, was opened in December 1900 to run the '''''Sind Mail''''', which ran between Bombay and Karachi through Munabao, via [[Ahmedabad]] - [[Palanpur]] - [[Marwar]] - [[Pali]] - [[Jodhpur]] - [[Luni Junction railway station|Lun]] - [[Barmer, Rajasthan|Barmer]] - [[Munabao]] -  [[Khokhrapar]] - [[Mirpur Khas]] - [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]. During [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], the rail track was bombed and destroyed by the Pakistani fighter jets, and the Mumbai-Karachi train ended.<ref name=IndTr/><ref name=hindu1>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/how-to-get-to-pakistan/article18438690.ece How to get to Pakistan], ''[[The Hindu]]'', 12 May 2017</ref>.<ref name=irfca1>{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-inter.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Geography : International|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref> <ref name=irfca1/>

== History and funding ==
The purpose of launching MBN and its networks was to counter perceived anti-American bias promoted by the leading Arab and international television networks and the effect these channels were having on Arab public opinion regarding the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/pushing-back-russian-disinformation-arab-countries|title=Pushing Back on Russian Disinformation in Arab Countries {{!}} USC Center on Public Diplomacy|website=www.uscpublicdiplomacy.org|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> MBN and its networks are intended to serve as an alternative to these channels by presenting the news in a more balanced and objective manner in an effort to improve the image of the United States in the Arab world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-image-war/|title=The Image War|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/theprotojournalist/2014/08/06/337781755/hearts-minds-tweets-battling-terrorism-online|title=Hearts, Minds, Tweets: Battling Terrorism Online|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>

[[Norman Pattiz]], founder and chairman of mass-media company [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]], was the driving force behind the launch of Radio Sawa in 2002, a USAGM-administered Arabic-language radio network which broadcasts a mix of music and news.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720223228/http://people.forbes.com/profile/norman-j-pattiz/86314|title=Norman J. Pattiz Profile – Forbes.com|date=2011-07-20|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>  Pattiz served as a board member of the then BBG, currently the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the U.S. independent federal agency that oversees all foreign non-military radio and TV broadcasts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728174441/http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/108hrg/95841.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2010-07-28|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>

The idea to launch Alhurra in 2004 stemmed from the success of Radio Sawa in reaching young audiences in the Middle East.  Pattiz believed that Arab audiences’ views of the United States were being negatively influenced by existing Arab news networks’ focus on coverage of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He envisioned that by presenting a wider range of perspectives on these conflicts and other U.S. policies, as well as coverage of a broader variety of regional and global issues of interest to Arab audiences, a U.S.-funded satellite TV channel could help improve America's image in the region.  In pursuit of Pattiz's vision, the Bush administration requested appropriations for the channel from Congress, and obtained $62 million in funding for the channel's first year of operation (including start-up costs). In the fall of 2003, construction began to renovate an existing TV station in Springfield, VA into a modern broadcast facility for the new channel. Construction was completed less than six months later, and Alhurra's first broadcast aired February 14, 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-image-war/|title=The Image War|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>

In the restructuring and relaunch of Alhurra TV, the station has increased its newscasts from 4 to 12 hours each day delivered by an all-new lineup of news anchors and news programs, and incorporated live broadcasts from new studios near [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and [[Dubai]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thearabweekly.com/relaunched-alhurra-tv-challenge-extremists-conspiracy-theorists|title=Relaunched Alhurra TV to challenge extremists, conspiracy theorists {{!}} AW staff|website=AW|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1399901/media|title=US-backed Alhurra TV relaunches amid new Iran sanctions|date=2018-11-06|website=Arab News|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> Alhurra also has introduced news segments on issues related to North Africa and taking a deeper dive into news stories from the U.S.  New programs include “Debatable,” a weekly show presented by Ibrahim Issa, that discusses in depth critical analysis of political Islam; “Word of Truth,” a weekly show presented by Joumana Haddad, that provides a platform for silenced intellectual voices to share ideas marginalized in Arab countries; “Free Islam,” presented by Islam al-Buhairi, exploring enlightenment values and adapting them and incorporating them into “free, moderate Islam” as part of daily life;  “Sam and Ammar,” a weekly show hosted by two liberal intellectuals who share their unfiltered and cutting edge views on current affairs and spotlight Washington's political and economic decisions that impact the MENA region; “Investigative Reports,” a weekly show that aims to conduct deep investigative reports from an all-new investigative news unit; “The Talk is Syrian,” a weekly show that examines the ongoing conflict in Syria; “Decision’s Capital,” a weekly show analyzing US foreign policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usagm.gov/2018/11/03/a-new-and-revitalized-alhurra-tv-launches-across-the-middle-east/|title=A new and revitalized Alhurra TV launches across the Middle East|website=USAGM|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />

== Reproduction ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R.

The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>.

''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77–86.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  

== Habitat Threats ==
There are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. 



These changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.


Another adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities’ limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.    

== Economic Importance ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are one of the most popular tropical fishes with divers and aquarists <ref name=\":7\" />. However, ornate butterflyfish are nearly impossible to successfully keep in captivity because they are obligate corallivores <ref name=\":7\" />.

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        

''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    

== Behavior ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. 
<br />

== Reproduction ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R.

The '''Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora do Pilar}}) is an 18th-century [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church located in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. It includes a cemetery, constructed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] parallel to the nave of the church. The interior of the church has an extensive set of azulejo tiles in the [[rococo]] style. The historian [[Carlos Ott]] dated them to the late 18th century, and stated that they appear to be the work of the Juncal workshop in Portugal. The stonework of the church is in lioz stone, imported from Lisbon at great expense.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/><ref name=\"t\"/>

The church closed in 1994 after heavy rains caused the collapse of a wall of the church; additionally, the [[cemetery]] was used by residents for waste disposal. A restoration project began in 2011, which included the removal of 2,500 tons of garbage from the cemetery. The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar reopened in 2015.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/>

==Location==
[[Image:Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Pilar Nave 2018-0227.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of nave and chancel.]]

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar is located in the Comércio district, in the historic lower city (''cidade baixa'') of Salvador. It was constructed at the base of a large slope below the Carmo district of the higher city. Its location at the base of the slope, which is largely unstabilized, has continually put the church at risk of damage caused by landslides.<ref name=\"co1\"/><ref name=\"t\"/>

==History==

The Brotherhood of Our Lady of Pilar (''Irmandade do Pilar'') was established in Salvador in 1718. Construction of its church began in 1756 on an undeveloped slope of land beyond the lower city, or ''cidade baixa'', or Salvador. The cemetery was completed in 1799 on a higher level of terrain than the church building in the Neoclassical style. The church, its internal patio with a fountain, and cemetery at a higher level formed an architectural complex unique to the city of Salvador.<ref name=\"ipac\"/>

Salvador was geographically divided into ten parishes, or ''freguesias,'' in the 19th century, uniting the functions of the state and church. The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar became the focal point of the  ''freguesia'' of Santíssimo Sacramento do Pilar; residents were baptized, married, elected local officials, and were buried at the church. Pilar, as one of the commercial areas of the lower city, was home to both wealthy Portuguese merchants and enslaved and freed Afro-Brazilians; the latter worked in domestic labor, as fisherman, and as street vendors.<ref name=\"w\"/>

A fire occurred in December of 1829 that damaged the dressing room (''camirim'') of the chancel and a tribune of the church. It also damaged many sculptures of saints, including the Lord of the Good Way (''Senhor do Bom Caminho'') and the statue of Our Lady of Pilar, the patron saint of the church. The fire also damage or completely melted sacred treasures of the church, including lamps, silver candlesticks, and the tabernacle. These were the work of [[Joaquim Alberto da Conceição e Matos]]. A landslide off the slope occurred on July 9, 1843. The consistory of the church was built above the cemetery, and was carried away in the landslide killing Father João Nepomuceno Moreira de Pinho, resident of the consistory.

==Structure==
[[Image:Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Pilar Cemetery 2018-0132.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of cemetery.]]

The façade of Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar, other than its monumental pediment, doors, and windows, are in ''lioz'' limestone imported from Lisbon. The monument pediment in the Rococo style was added later. The church interior consists of a [[nave]], altar, [[sacristy]], [[tribunes]] that open to the inner courtyard, a former sacristy, and other smaller rooms. The painting on the ceiling of the nave is the work of [[José Teófilo de Jesus]], completed in 1837. The master woodcarver [[Joaquim Francisco de Matos]] completed ''talha'' work on four altars of the nave, six tribunes, two pulpits, the carvings of the choir, and carvings of the baptismal font. The works were contracted in 1838 and completed in the following year; they were ultimately gilded in 1848.<ref name=\"ba\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/>

The church is home to numerous works of art, including statues, painting, and metalwork. The statue of the Lord of the Good Way (''Senhor do Bom Caminho'') is the work of Manuel Inácio da Costa.<ref name=\"t\"/>

===Sacristy===

The sacristy of the Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar is richly furnished and decorated. A large sacristy cabinet spans the length of the north wall of the room. Six richly painted panels are above the cabinet; they are the work of [[José Joaquim da Rocha]] (1737-1807) and completed in 1796. An ornate stone [[lavabo]] is on the south wall. The sacristy has [[azulejo]] tiles similar to those of the nave and halls.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"peq\"/>

==Fountain==

A fountain dedicated to Saint Lucia is located in the interior churchyard at the base of the slope. The fountain is believed to have healing powers, especially for ocular problems. An annual festival dedicated to [[Saint Lucia]] takes place in September, and includes a Mass followed by a procession of the image of Saint Lucia throughout the Comercio district.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/>

==Cemetery==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar was the first Catholic church in Salvador to build an annexed cemetery. The large [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] structure, designed by José de Anchieta Mesquita, was constructed in 1799. An exterior cemetery was an innovation of the period; burials within the church proper caused both sanitary problems and the spread of infectious diseases to parishioners. Other churches in Salvador followed the practice of the construction of an external cemetery in the 19th century.<ref name=\"t\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/>

Residents on the slope between the church and the upper Carmo district used the [[cemetery]] for waste disposal as early as the 19th century. The quantity of garbage caused the collapse of interior walls of the cemetery and cut off access to graves by the 20th century. The restoration project of 2011 saw the removal of 2,500 tons of garbage from the cemetery and restored access to the tombs and interior altar.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/>

==Protected status==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1938. The church is part of the [[Historic Center (Salvador)|Historic Center of Salvador]] [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"ipac\"/>

==Access==

The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar is open to the public and may be visited.

'''''Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)''''' is the second compilation album by the English rock band [[the Rolling Stones]], released in September 1969 by [[Decca Records]] in the UK and [[London Records]]/[[ABKCO Records]] in the US.

== Background ==
According to Bruce Eder of [[AllMusic]], the album resulted from \"three coinciding events – the need to acknowledge the death of band co-founder [[Brian Jones]] (whose epitaph graces the inside cover) in July of 1969; the need to get '[[Honky Tonk Women]],' then a huge hit single, onto an LP; and to fill the ten-month gap since the release of ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' and get an album with built-in appeal into stores ahead of the Stones' first American tour in three years.\"<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|date=n.d.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/through-the-past-darkly-big-hits-vol-2-mw0000191644|title=Through the Past, Darkly: Big Hits, Vol. 2|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

== Songs ==
Because the Stones' [[Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)|first ''Big Hits'' compilation]] had been released in separate formats, with the ''[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]''-era material appearing only on its UK edition, the American edition of ''Big Hits Vol. 2'' included hit singles from the ''Aftermath'' period.

The British track listing included the more obscure \"[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]\", from The Rolling Stones' [[The Rolling Stones (EP)|self-titled]] 1964 debut [[Extended play|EP]] and \"[[Sittin' on a Fence]]\", an ''Aftermath'' outtake originally released in 1967 on the US-compiled ''[[Flowers (The Rolling Stones album)|Flowers]]'' album. In addition to those songs, many tracks, notably single-only releases, were collected for the first time on a UK Rolling Stones album: \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\", \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\", \"[[We Love You]]\", \"[[Dandelion (song)|Dandelion]]\", and \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\".

== Title and packaging ==
{{unreferenced-section}}
The name of the album is a play on a line from the [[Authorized King James Version|KJV]] translation of [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 13: \"For now we see [[through a glass, darkly (phrase)|through a glass, darkly]], but then face to face...\", but it is more likely the Stones intended a homage to [[Ingmar Bergman]] and his 1961 film ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]''.

The LP was packaged in in a six-sided die-cut [[gatefold LP|gatefold sleeve]], featuring an epitaph for Jones: \"With this you see, remember me and bear me in your mind. Let all the world say what they may, speak of me as you find.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Old Gods Almost Dead: The 40-Year Odyssey of the Rolling Stones|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=2001|publisher=Crown|isbn=0767909569|page=316}}</ref>

== Release ==
Released on 12 September 1969,<ref name=\"Paytress\">{{cite book|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=Rolling Stones: Off The Record|year=2009|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=0857121138|chapter=Good Times, Bad Times}}</ref> both versions of ''Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)'' proved to be popular releases, reaching #2 in the UK and US with enduring sales.

In August 2002 the US edition of ''Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)'' was reissued in a new remastered CD and [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] [[digipak]] by [[ABKCO Records]].

The British version was again made available to the public as part of a limited edition vinyl box set, titled ''The Rolling Stones 1964–1969'', in November 2010. It was also re-released digitally at the same time.

It was released in 2011 by [[Universal Music Enterprises]] in a Japanese only SHM-[[Super Audio CD|SACD]] version. For Record Store Day 2019 ABKCO Records released the record on orange vinyl, with a gatefold cover in the octagonal-shape of the original issue.

'''''Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)''''' is the second compilation album by the English rock band [[the Rolling Stones]], released in September 1969 by [[Decca Records]] in the UK and [[London Records]]/[[ABKCO Records]] in the US.

== Background ==
According to Bruce Eder of [[AllMusic]], the album resulted from \"three coinciding events – the need to acknowledge the death of band co-founder [[Brian Jones]] (whose epitaph graces the inside cover) in July of 1969; the need to get '[[Honky Tonk Women]],' then a huge hit single, onto an LP; and to fill the ten-month gap since the release of ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' and get an album with built-in appeal into stores ahead of the Stones' first American tour in three years.\"<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|date=n.d.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/through-the-past-darkly-big-hits-vol-2-mw0000191644|title=Through the Past, Darkly: Big Hits, Vol. 2|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

== Songs ==
Because the Stones' [[Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)|first ''Big Hits'' compilation]] had been released in separate formats, with the ''[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]''-era material appearing only on its UK edition, the American edition of ''Big Hits Vol. 2'' included hit singles from the ''Aftermath'' period.

The British track listing included the more obscure \"[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]\", from The Rolling Stones' [[The Rolling Stones (EP)|self-titled]] 1964 debut [[Extended play|EP]] and \"[[Sittin' on a Fence]]\", an ''Aftermath'' outtake originally released in 1967 on the US-compiled ''[[Flowers (The Rolling Stones album)|Flowers]]'' album. In addition to those songs, many tracks, notably single-only releases, were collected for the first time on a UK Rolling Stones album: \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\", \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\", \"[[We Love You]]\", \"[[Dandelion (song)|Dandelion]]\", and \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\".

== Title and packaging ==
{{unreferenced-section}}
The name of the album is a play on a line from the [[Authorized King James Version|KJV]] translation of [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 13: \"For now we see [[through a glass, darkly (phrase)|through a glass, darkly]], but then face to face...\", but it is more likely the Stones intended a homage to [[Ingmar Bergman]] and his 1961 film ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]''.

The LP was packaged in in a six-sided die-cut [[gatefold LP|gatefold sleeve]], featuring an epitaph for Jones: \"With this you see, remember me and bear me in your mind. Let all the world say what they may, speak of me as you find.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Old Gods Almost Dead: The 40-Year Odyssey of the Rolling Stones|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=2001|publisher=Crown|isbn=0767909569|page=316}}</ref>

== Release ==
Released on 12 September 1969,<ref name=\"Paytress\">{{cite book|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=Rolling Stones: Off The Record|year=2009|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=0857121138|chapter=Good Times, Bad Times}}</ref> both versions of ''Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)'' proved to be popular releases, reaching #2 in the UK and US with enduring sales.

In August 2002 the US edition of ''Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)'' was reissued in a new remastered CD and [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] [[digipak]] by [[ABKCO Records]].

The British version was again made available to the public as part of a limited edition vinyl box set, titled ''The Rolling Stones 1964–1969'', in November 2010. It was also re-released digitally at the same time.

It was released in 2011 by [[Universal Music Enterprises]] in a Japanese only SHM-[[Super Audio CD|SACD]] version. For Record Store Day 2019 ABKCO Records released the record on orange vinyl, with a gatefold cover in the octagonal-shape of the original issue.
