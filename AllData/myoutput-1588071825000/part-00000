The ROC lost its status as [[UN Resolution 2758|representing \"China\" in the United Nations]] in 1971.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|History of the Republic of China}}\n\nIn 1912, the [[Xuantong Emperor]] abdicated as a result of the [[Xinhai Revolution]], and the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] was established in [[Nanjing]] by revolutionaries under [[Sun Yat-sen]]. At the same time, the [[Beiyang Government]], led by [[Yuan Shikai]], a former Qing Dynasty General, existed in [[Beijing]], whose legitimacy was challenged by the Nanjing government under the [[Kuomintang]], or the Chinese Nationalist Party.\n\nFrom 1912 to 1949, China was scarred by [[Warlord era|Warlords]], the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Throughout this turbulent period, various short-lived governments have existed in China. These include Yuan Shikai's Beiyang Government (1912\u20131928), the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] established by the [[Communist Party of China]] (1931\u20131937),<ref>Lyman P. Van Slyke, ''The Chinese Communist movement: a report of the United States War Department, July 1945'', Stanford University Press, 1968, p. 44</ref> the [[Fujian People's Government]] (1933\u20131934), the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] (1932\u20131945), and [[Wang Jingwei]]'s [[Reorganized National Government of China|Japanese sponsored puppet state]] (1940\u20131945).\n\nAs the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, the Chinese communist [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]], led by [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao Zedong]], took control of [[Mainland China]]. The [[Taiwan|Republic of China]], led by [[Chiang Kai-shek|President Chiang Kai-Shek]], retreated the [[government of the Republic of China]] to [[Taiwan island|Taiwan]].\n\nThough fighting continued for the next several years, by the time of the [[Korean War]] the lines of control were sharply drawn: the Communist-led People's Republic of China government in Beijing controlled most of mainland China, while the Kuomintang-led [[Republic of China]] government, now in [[Taipei]], controlled the [[island of Taiwan]], some surrounding islands, and a number of islands off the coast of [[Fujian]]. This stalemate was enforced with the assistance of the [[United States]] government that began deterring an invasion of Taiwan after the start of the Korean War.\n\nFor many years, both governments contended to be the sole legitimate government of China. With the fighting largely over, the major battleground became diplomatic. Before the 1970s, the Republic of China was still recognized by many countries and the United Nations as the sole legitimate government of \"China\", which claimed sovereignty over both mainland China and Taiwan. The Republic of China had been a founding member of the [[United Nations]] and was one of the five permanent members of the Security Council until 1971, when they were expelled from the UN and China's representation was replaced by the People's Republic of China (PRC) via [[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758]]. Before the 1970s, few foreign governments recognised the People's Republic of China. The first governments to recognise it as the government of \"China\" were [[Soviet bloc]] countries, members of the [[non-aligned movement]], and the [[United Kingdom]] (1950). The catalyst to change came in 1971, when the [[United Nations General Assembly]] [[China and the United Nations|expelled]] representatives of Chiang Kai-shek by refusing to recognise their accreditations as representatives of China. Recognition for the People's Republic of China soon followed from most other governments, including the United States. The Republic of China continued to compete with the People's Republic of China (PRC) to be recognised as the legitimate government of China.\n\nSince the 1990s, however, a rising movement for formal recognition of Taiwanese independence has made the political status of Taiwan the dominant issue, replacing the debate about the legitimate government of China. A view in Taiwan is that the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are both [[sovereignty|sovereign]], thus forming \"two Chinas\", or \"one China, one Taiwan\". Former Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian adamantly supported this status quo, and accordingly largely abandoned the campaign for the Republic of China to be recognised as the sole legitimate government of China. Under President Chen, the ROC government was campaigning for the Republic of China to join the United Nations as representative of its effective territory\u2014Taiwan and nearby islands\u2014only.

While the PRC finds the \"Two Chinas\" unpalatable, it considers an independent Republic of Taiwan to be an even worse alternative.
