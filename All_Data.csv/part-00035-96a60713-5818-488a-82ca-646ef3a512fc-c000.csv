'''Anthony Michaels-Moore''' (born 8 April 1957) is an English [[opera]]tic [[baritone]] and the first British winner of the Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition (Philadelphia, 1985). <ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/08/arts/all-53-finalists-named-opera-contest-winners.html \"All 53 Finalists Named Opera Contest Winners\"] from the ''NY Times'', Published: 8 October 1985</ref> Michaels-Moore has since performed in many of the world's major opera houses across Europe, the Americas, and Asia. He has distinguished himself as a specialist in Verdi and Puccini roles, most renowned for his portrayals of Falstaff, Nabucco, Rigoletto, Simon Boccanegra, Iago in ''Otello'', Germont in ''La traviata'', Sharpless in ''Madama Butterfly'', and Scarpia in ''Tosca''.  In addition to the standard repertoire, he has sung and recorded the baritone roles of some of the less-known 19th Century Italian operas, as well as the popular [[English art song]] cycles by [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] and [[Vaughan Williams]]. <ref>[http://www.opusarte.com/details/OACD9014D#.UhjxBOCsNiA] Retrieved 6 February 2018.</ref>

Michaels-Moore currently lives in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].<ref>[http://www.santafenewmexican.com/opinion/el_mitote/article_bef60658-64fe-5466-bde8-ca22c3b40561.html \"El Mitote, April 7, 2013\", ''The Santa Fe New Mexican''], 7 April 2013.  Retrieved 24 August 2013.</ref>

==Biography==

===Early years===
Michaels-Moore was born in [[Essex]].  Between 1975 and 1978, he was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the British Army's [[Royal Tank Regiment]] <ref>[http://www.operatoday.com/content/2009/05/anthony_michael.php Ann Ozorio, \"Anthony Michaels-Moore — From the Army to the World Stage\" in ''Opera Today'', 18 May 2009] online at operatoday.com, retrieved 23 November 2009</ref> while studying music and history at [[Newcastle University]] upon Tyne, and, after a year at Fenham [[teacher training college]], he became a [[primary school]] teacher.  From 1981 onward he studied singing privately, became a member of the chorus at the English Bach Festival from 1982 to 1984. He attended the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] from 1984 to 1985, earning a MMus/MA in Opera. In 1985 Michaels-Moore was named the first British winner of the Luciano Pavarotti Competition and sang the roles of Messenger (''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'') for [[Opera North]] and Scarpia in ''[[Tosca]]'' for Scottish Opera Go Round.<ref>{{cite book| last = Adam| first = Nicky (ed)| year = 1993| title = Who's Who in British Opera| publisher = Scolar Press| location = Aldershot| isbn = 0-85967-894-6| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinbritish0000adam}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/jun/07/artsfeatures.classicalmusicandopera\" Verdi's Warrior: Anthony Michaels-Moore\" ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London), 7 June 2002]</ref>

===Subsequent career===
His career has been centered on the Italian repertoire, starting with lyric roles, but now focused on the great Verdi baritone roles. A review of his 2009 performances of ''[[Rigoletto]]'' with [[English National Opera]] noted his ability to be both \"gloriously lyrical and terrifyingly baleful at the same time\", combining beautiful Italianate legato with \"monstrous power\".<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article6844522.ece Richard Morrison, \"''Rigoletto'' at the London Coliseum\", ''[[The Times]]'' (London), 23 September 2009] Retrieved from timesonline.co.uk on 23 November 2009.</ref> Another reviewer of that production opined that \"he is [Britain's] leading Verdi baritone\".<ref>Mark Pullinger, [http://opera-britannia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=92:rigoletto-english-national-opera-21st-september-2009&catid=8&Itemid=16  \"''Rigoletto'': English National Opera, 21st September 2009\"], on Opera Britannia.com, 22 September 2009.  The author notes: \"The main reason for going to see this run of performances though is for Anthony Michaels-Moore's portrayal of Rigoletto. His appearances in the UK are all too rare and questions should be asked why we don't see him here more frequently as he is, in my opinion, our leading Verdi baritone\". Retrieved 23 November 2009.</ref> Performances in Canada as Rigoletto (\"performing with amazing presence, his dark voice suited the character perfectly… brought a remarkable breadth of expression to the role\") and in Europe as Scarpia (\"he is obsequiously, sadistically, loathsomely mellifluous\") as well as Falstaff in 2010 have also drawn high praise.<ref>[http://www.cami.com/?webid=2166 Extracts from reviews appearing on the artist's North American representative at CAMI.com] Retrieved 15 November 2010.</ref>

Michaels-Moore made his debut at London's [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden in 1987 and has subsequently appeared in many productions there including ''La Bohème'', ''Pagliacci'', ''The Barber of Seville'', ''The Marriage of Figaro'' (1998), ''Andrea Chénier'' (1998), ''Tosca'' (2000), ''Macbeth'' (1997 & 2002), ''Falstaff'' (2003), ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' (2004), ''La traviata'' (2006), ''Il trovatore'' (2007), ''L’elisir d'amore'' (2009), and ''Madama Butterfly'' (2011). He has also appeared with all the other major British companies: English and [[Welsh National Opera]]s, Opera North, [[Scottish Opera]] and [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]].<ref>[http://www.anthonymichaelsmoore.com/#about Artist's personal website, on anthony-michaels-moore.com] Retrieved 15 November 2010.</ref>

In Europe he has appeared at major houses such as the [[Vienna State Opera]], [[La Scala]], [[Milan]], the [[Opéra National de Paris]], [[Munich]]'s [[Bayerische Staatsoper]], the [[Berlin State Opera|Staatsoper]] and [[Deutsche Oper Berlin|Deutsche Oper]] in Berlin, [[Barcelona]]'s [[Liceu]], [[La Monnaie]] in [[Brussels]], the [[Grand Théâtre de Genève]], [[Madrid]]'s [[Teatro Real]], [[Zurich Opera House]] (''Falstaff'', ''Otello''), [[Oper Köln]] (''Tosca'', ''La Forza del Destino''), and [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]] (''Curlew River'').

In North America Michaels-Moore has appeared at all of the major houses and some of the regional ones including New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]], the [[San Francisco Opera]], the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] (''Attila''), [[Pittsburgh Opera]] (''Otello''), [[Opera Colorado]], [[Florida Grand Opera]], [[Los Angeles Opera]] (''Billy Budd''), [[Lyric Opera of Kansas City]] (''La traviata''), [[Opera Philadelphia]] (''Cold Mountain''),<ref>[https://www.operaphila.org/about/news-press/pressroom/2016/cold-mountain-news-release/ \"Press Release from Opera Philadelphia: ''Cold Mountain'' makes East Coast Premiere February 5-14, 2016 at the Academy of Music\"] Retrieved 11 January 2016.</ref> and [[Opéra de Montréal]] (''Rigoletto'').<ref>[https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/musique/296976/musique-classique-rigoletto-et-le-canadien-pacifique \"Classical - Rigoletto and Canadian Pacific\" from Le Devoir, 27 September 2010.]</ref>

In the US, Michaels-Moore has a particularly strong relationship with the [[Santa Fe Opera]]; in their summer festivals he has appeared in classic Verdi parts such as Simon Boccanegra (2004), Falstaff (2008), and Germont ''pere'' (2009). Anthony has also appeared at the festival in less familiar roles and new works; singing the title role in Mozart's ''The Impresario'' and the Emperor in Stravinsky's ''The Nightingale'' in 2014, and creating the role of Robert Crosbie in the world premiere of [[Paul Moravec]]'s  ''[[The Letter (opera)|The Letter]]'' in 2009, as well as the roles of Father Monroe and Pangle in the world premiere of ''[[Cold Mountain (opera)|Cold Mountain]]'' in 2015.

'''Anthony Michaels-Moore''' (born 8 April 1957) is an English [[opera]]tic [[baritone]] and the first British winner of the Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition (Philadelphia, 1985). <ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/08/arts/all-53-finalists-named-opera-contest-winners.html \"All 53 Finalists Named Opera Contest Winners\"] from the ''NY Times'', Published: 8 October 1985</ref>  Anthony has since performed in many of the world's major opera houses across Europe, the Americas, and Asia. He has distinguished himself as a specialist in Verdi and Puccini roles, most renowned for his portrayals of Falstaff, Nabucco, Rigoletto, Simon Boccanegra, Iago in ''Otello'', Germont in ''La traviata'', Sharpless in ''Madama Butterfly'', and Scarpia in ''Tosca''.  In addition to the standard repertoire, he has sung and recorded the baritone roles of some of the less-known 19th Century Italian operas, as well as the popular [[English art song]] cycles by [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] and [[Vaughan Williams]]. <ref>[http://www.opusarte.com/details/OACD9014D#.UhjxBOCsNiA] Retrieved 6 February 2018.</ref>

==Biography==

===Early years===
Michaels-Moore was born in [[Essex]].  Between 1975 and 1978, he was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the British Army's [[Royal Tank Regiment]] <ref>[http://www.operatoday.com/content/2009/05/anthony_michael.php Ann Ozorio, \"Anthony Michaels-Moore — From the Army to the World Stage\" in ''Opera Today'', 18 May 2009] online at operatoday.com, retrieved 23 November 2009</ref> while studying music and history at [[Newcastle University]] upon Tyne, and, after a year at Fenham [[teacher training college]], he became a [[primary school]] teacher.  From 1981 onward he studied singing privately, became a member of the chorus  at the English Bach Festival from 1982-4. He attended the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] from 1984–85, earning a MMus/MA in Opera. In 1985 Anthony was named the first British winner of the Luciano Pavarotti Competition and sang the roles of Messenger (''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'') for [[Opera North]] and Scarpia in ''[[Tosca]]'' for Scottish Opera Go Round.<ref>{{cite book| last = Adam| first = Nicky (ed)| year = 1993| title = Who's Who in British Opera| publisher = Scolar Press| location = Aldershot| isbn = 0-85967-894-6| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinbritish0000adam}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/jun/07/artsfeatures.classicalmusicandopera\" Verdi's Warrior: Anthony Michaels-Moore\" ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London), 7 June 2002]</ref>

===Subsequent career===
His career has been centered on the Italian repertoire, starting with lyric roles, but now focused on the great Verdi baritone roles. A review of his 2009 performances of ''[[Rigoletto]]'' with [[English National Opera]] noted his ability to be both \"gloriously lyrical and terrifyingly baleful at the same time\", combining beautiful Italianate legato with \"monstrous power\".<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article6844522.ece Richard Morrison, \"''Rigoletto'' at the London Coliseum\", ''[[The Times]]'' (London), 23 September 2009] Retrieved from timesonline.co.uk on 23 November 2009.</ref> Another reviewer of that production opined that \"he is [Britain's] leading Verdi baritone\".<ref>Mark Pullinger, [http://opera-britannia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=92:rigoletto-english-national-opera-21st-september-2009&catid=8&Itemid=16  \"''Rigoletto'': English National Opera, 21st September 2009\"], on Opera Britannia.com,  22 September 2009.  The author notes: \"The main reason for going to see this run of performances though is for Anthony Michaels-Moore's portrayal of Rigoletto. His appearances in the UK are all too rare and questions should be asked why we don't see him here more frequently as he is, in my opinion, our leading Verdi baritone\". Retrieved 23 November 2009.</ref> Performances in Canada as Rigoletto (\"performing with amazing presence, his dark voice suited the character perfectly… brought a remarkable breadth of expression to the role\") and in Europe as Scarpia (\"he is obsequiously, sadistically, loathsomely mellifluous\") as well as Falstaff in 2010 have also drawn high praise.<ref>[http://www.cami.com/?webid=2166 Extracts from reviews appearing on the artist's North American representative at CAMI.com] Retrieved 15 November 2010.</ref>

Michaels-Moore made his debut at London's [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden in 1987 and has subsequently appeared in many productions there including ''La Bohème'', ''Pagliacci'', ''The Barber of Seville'', ''The Marriage of Figaro'' (1998), ''Andrea Chénier'' (1998), ''Tosca'' (2000), ''Macbeth'' (1997 & 2002), ''Falstaff'' (2003), ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' (2004), ''La traviata'' (2006), ''Il trovatore'' (2007), ''L’elisir d'amore'' (2009), and ''Madama Butterfly'' (2011). He has also appeared with all the other major British companies: English and [[Welsh National Opera]]s, Opera North, [[Scottish Opera]] and [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]].<ref>[http://www.anthonymichaelsmoore.com/#about Artist's personal website, on anthony-michaels-moore.com] Retrieved 15 November 2010.</ref>

In Europe he has appeared at major houses such as the [[Vienna State Opera]], [[La Scala]], [[Milan]], the [[Opéra National de Paris]], [[Munich]]'s [[Bayerische Staatsoper]], the [[Berlin State Opera|Staatsoper]] and [[Deutsche Oper Berlin|Deutsche Oper]] in Berlin, [[Barcelona]]'s [[Liceu]], [[La Monnaie]] in [[Brussels]], the [[Grand Théâtre de Genève]], [[Madrid]]'s [[Teatro Real]], [[Zurich Opera House]] (''Falstaff'', ''Otello''), [[Oper Köln]] (''Tosca'', ''La Forza del Destino''), and [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]] (''Curlew River'').

In North America Anthony has appeared at all of the major houses and some of the regional ones including New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]], the [[San Francisco Opera]], the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] (''Attila''), [[Pittsburgh Opera]] (''Otello''), [[Opera Colorado]], [[Florida Grand Opera]], [[Los Angeles Opera]] (''Billy Budd''), [[Lyric Opera of Kansas City]] (''La traviata''), [[Opera Philadelphia]] (''Cold Mountain''),<ref>[https://www.operaphila.org/about/news-press/pressroom/2016/cold-mountain-news-release/ \"Press Release from Opera Philadelphia: ''Cold Mountain'' makes East Coast Premiere February 5-14, 2016 at the Academy of Music\"] Retrieved 11 January 2016.</ref> and [[Opéra de Montréal]] (''Rigoletto'').<ref>[https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/musique/296976/musique-classique-rigoletto-et-le-canadien-pacifique \"Classical - Rigoletto and Canadian Pacific\" from Le Devoir, 27 September 2010.]</ref>

In the USA, Michaels-Moore has a particularly strong relationship with the [[Santa Fe Opera]]; in their summer festivals he has appeared in classic Verdi parts such as Simon Boccanegra (2004), Falstaff (2008), and Germont ''pere'' (2009). Anthony has also appeared at the festival in less familiar roles and new works; singing the title role in Mozart's ''The Impresario'' and the Emperor in Stravinsky's ''The Nightingale'' in 2014, and creating the role of Robert Crosbie in the world premiere of [[Paul Moravec]]'s  ''[[The Letter (opera)|The Letter]]'' in 2009, as well as the roles of Father Monroe and Pangle in the world premiere of ''[[Cold Mountain (opera)|Cold Mountain]]'' in 2015. Anthony's 2009 appearances as Robert Crosbie in  ''[[The Letter (opera)|The Letter]]'' brought him particular critical approval.<ref>Craig Smith, [http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Review--Santa-Fe-Opera--Letter--premiere-evokes-true-tale-s-dar \"''The Letter'' evokes dark charm of a true tale\"], ''The Santa Fe New Mexican'', 26 July 2009 on santafenewmexican.com.

Regarding the doubts, Cody Jones said, \"We love it when people claim it's fake because it makes the shots seem even more ridiculously impossible; and we get more publicity and hits on YouTube so we love the mystery of knowing whether it's real or fake.\"<ref name=\"TAMU\" /> Tyler Toney and the Cotton twins have explained that it takes multiple attempts when filming before successfully converting the final shots.<ref name=\"CBS News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trick-b-ball-shots-turn-youtube-sensation/|title=Trick B-Ball Shots Turn YouTube Sensation|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=September 28, 2009|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref>

Regarding the doubts, Cody Jones said, \"We love it when people claim it's fake because it makes the shots seem even more ridiculously impossible; and we get more publicity and hits on YouTube so we love the mystery of knowing whether it's real or fake.\"<ref name=\"TAMU\" /> Tyler Toney and the Cotton twins have explained that it takes multiple attempts when filming before successfully converting the final shots.<ref name=\"CBS News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trick-b-ball-shots-turn-youtube-sensation/|title=Trick B-Ball Shots Turn YouTube Sensation|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=September 28, 2009|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref>

In early 2010 Phoenix Games re-released some of their Games rebranded as \"Simulations\" to German PC audiences.

Do to the populatity of their games on the Internet and the sometimes small prints, some games are selling for a good ammount of money.

"Deleted a duplicate \"the\".",safe,Ira Leviton,"'''Joseph E. LeDoux''' (born December 7, 1949) is an American [[neuroscientist]] whose research is primarily focused on survival circuits, including their impacts on [[emotion]]s such as [[fear]] and [[anxiety]].<ref>\"I'm not studying emotion. I'm studying the function of survival circuits. Survival circuits contribute to emotions but are not emotion circuits.\" LeDoux as quoted in: {{cite web |last=Emory |first=Margaret |date=June 6, 2018 |title=On Fear, Emotions, and Memory: An Interview with Dr. Joseph LeDoux |url=https://brainworldmagazine.com/on-fear-emotions-and-memory-an-interview-with-dr-joseph-ledoux/ |website=brainworldmagazine.com |accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref> LeDoux is the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science at [[New York University]], and director of the Emotional Brain Institute, a collaboration between NYU and New York State with research sites at NYU and the [[Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research]] in Orangeburg, New York. He is also the lead singer and songwriter in the band [[The Amygdaloids]].

== Research and theories ==

===Work on threat response, anxiety, and emotions===
As explained in his 1996 book, ''The Emotional Brain'',<ref>LeDoux JE (1996) The Emotional Brain. New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref> LeDoux developed an interest in the topic of emotion through his doctoral work with Michael Gazzaniga on split-brain patients in the mid-1970s.<ref>Gazzaniga MS, LeDoux JE (1978) The Integrated Mind. New York: Plenum.</ref> Because techniques for studying the human brain were limited at the time, he turned to studies of rodents where the brain could be studied in detail. He chose to focus on a simple behavioral model, Pavlovian fear conditioning. This procedure allowed him to follow the flow of information about a stimulus through the brain as it comes to control behavioral responses by way of sensory pathways to the amygdala, and gave rise to the notion of two sensory roads to the amygdala, with the \"low road\" being a quick and dirty subcortical pathway for rapid activity behavioral responses to threats and the \"high road\" providing slower but highly processed cortical information.<ref>LeDoux JE (1994) Emotion, memory and the brain. Sci Am 270:50-57.</ref> His work has shed light on how the brain detects and responds to threats, and how memories about such experiences are formed and stored through cellular, synaptic and molecular changes in the amygdala.<ref>LeDoux JE (2002) Synaptic Self: How our brains become who we are. New York: Viking; LeDoux JE (2000) Emotion circuits in the brain. Annu Rev Neurosci 23:155-184; Rodrigues SM, Schafe GE, LeDoux JE (2004) Molecular mechanisms underlying emotional learning and memory in the lateral amygdala. Neuron 44:75-91; Johansen JP, Cain CK, Ostroff LE, LeDoux JE (2011) Molecular mechanisms of fear learning and memory. Cell 147:509-524.</ref> A long-standing collaboration with NYU colleague Elizabeth Phelps has shown the validity of the rodent work for understanding threat processing in the human brain.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.09.025 |pmid=16242399 |title=Contributions of the Amygdala to Emotion Processing: From Animal Models to Human Behavior |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=175–187 |year=2005 |last1=Phelps |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Ledoux |first2=Joseph E. }}</ref>

LeDoux's work on amygdala processing of threats has helped understand exaggerated responses to threats in anxiety disorders in humans.<ref>LeDoux JE (2002) Synaptic Self: How our brains become who we are. New York: Viking; LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety. New York: Viking.</ref> For example, studies with Maria Morgan in the 1990s implicated the medial prefrontal cortex in the extinction of responses to threats<ref>Morgan MA, Romanski LM, LeDoux JE (1993) Extinction of emotional learning: contribution of medial prefrontal cortex. Neurosci Lett 163:109-113; Morgan MA, LeDoux JE (1995) Differential contribution of dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex to the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear in rats. Behav Neurosci 109:681-688; Sotres-Bayon F, Bush DE, LeDoux JE (2004) [http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/11/5/525.full Emotional perseveration: an update on prefrontal-amygdala interactions in fear extinction]. Learn Mem 11:525-535.</ref> and paved the way for understanding how exposure therapy reduces threat reactions in people with anxiety by way of interactions between the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.<ref>LeDoux JE (1996) The Emotional Brain. New York: Simon and Schuster; LeDoux JE (2002) Synaptic Self: How our brains become who we are. New York: Viking; LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety. New York: Viking; Shin, L.M., S.L. Rauch, R.K. Pitman. \"Amygdala, Medial Prefrontal Cortex, and Hippocampal Function in PTSD.\" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences (2006) 1071:67–79; Mathew, S.J., R.B. Price, and D.S. Charney. \"Recent Advances in the Neurobiology of Anxiety Disorders: Implications for Novel Therapeutics.\" American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C, Seminars in Medical Genetics (2008) 148C:89–98.</ref> Work conducted with Karim Nader and Glenn Schafe triggered a wave of interest in the topic of memory reconsolidation,<ref>Nader K, Schafe GE, LeDoux JE (2000) Fear memories require protein synthesis in the amygdala for reconsolidation after retrieval. Nature 406:722-726</ref> a process by which memories become labile and subject to change after being retrieved.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.003 |pmid=15450162 |title=Rites of Passage of the Engram |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=93–100 |year=2004 |last1=Dudai |first1=Yadin |last2=Eisenberg |first2=Mark }}</ref> This led to the idea that trauma-related cues might be weakened in humans by blocking reconsolidation. Studies with Marie Mofils, Daniela Schiller and Phelps showed that extinction conducted shortly after triggering reconsolidation is considerably more effective in reducing the threat value of stimuli than conventional extinction,<ref>Monfils MH, Cowansage KK, Klann E, LeDoux JE (2009) Extinction-reconsolidation boundaries: key to persistent attenuation of fear memories.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110:20040-20045.</ref> a finding that has proven useful in reducing drug relapse in humans.<ref>Xue YX, Luo YX, Wu P, Shi HS, Xue LF, Chen C, Zhu WL, Ding ZB, Bao YP, Shi J, Epstein DH, Shaham Y, Lu L (2012) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695463/ A memory retrieval-extinction procedure to prevent drug craving and relapse]. Science 336:241-245.</ref>

===Difference between threat response and emotions===
In 2012 LeDoux emphasized the value, when discussing brain functions in animals, of using terms that are not derived from human subjective experience.<ref>LeDoux J (2012) [http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(12)00129-8 Rethinking the emotional brain]. Neuron 73:653-676.</ref> The common practice of calling brain circuits that detect and respond to threats \"fear circuits\" implies that these circuits are responsible for feelings of fear. LeDoux has argued that so-called Pavlovian fear conditioning should be renamed Pavlovian threat conditioning to avoid the implication that \"fear\" is being acquired in rats or humans.<ref>LeDoux JE (2014) [http://www.pnas.org/content/111/8/2871.full Coming to terms with fear]. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 111:2871-2878.</ref>

In 2015 he emphasised the notion of survival functions mediated by survival circuits, the purpose of which is to keep organisms alive (rather than to make emotions). For example, defensive survival circuits exist to detect and respond to threats, and can be present in all organisms. However, only organisms that can be conscious of their own brain's activities can feel fear. Fear is a conscious experience and occurs the same way as any other kind of conscious experience: via cortical circuits that allow attention to certain forms of brain activity. He argues the only differences between an emotional and non-emotion state of consciousness are the underlying neural ingredients that contribute to the state.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) [http://www.cns.nyu.edu/home/ledoux/pdf/daed_LeDoux_2015.pdf Feelings: What are they and how does the brain make them?] Daedalus 144.</ref> These ideas and their implications for understanding the neural foundations of pathological fear and anxiety are explained in his 2015 book, Anxious.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety. New York: Viking.</ref> In this he says \"Fear and anxiety are not biologically wired... They are the consequence of the cognitive processing of nonemotional ingredients.\"<ref>ANxiety, 2015, Chapter 9, p232</ref>

In 2018 he further said that the [[amygdala]] may release hormones due to a trigger (such as an innate reaction to seeing a snake), but \"then we elaborate it through cognitive and conscious processes\". He differentiated between the defence system, which has evolved over time, and emotions such as fear and [[anxiety]]. He points out that even simple organisms such as bacteria move in response to threats; \"It's in the brain to allow an organism, whether it be a bacterium or a human, to detect and respond to danger.&nbsp;... It's not in the brain to create feelings like fear and [[anxiety]].\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://brainworldmagazine.com/on-fear-emotions-and-memory-an-interview-with-dr-joseph-ledoux/2/ | title=On Fear, Emotions, and Memory: An Interview with Dr. Joseph LeDoux » Page 2 of 2 » Brain World| date=2018-06-07}}</ref> [[Lisa Feldman Barrett]] takes a similar view.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

== Awards and professional recognition ==
LeDoux has received a number of awards, including the [[Karl Spencer Lashley Award]] from the [[American Philosophical Society]], the Fyssen International Prize in Cognitive Science, Jean Louis Signoret Prize of the IPSEN Foundation, the Santiago Grisolia Prize, the [[American Psychological Association]] Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and the American Psychological Association [[Donald O. Hebb]] Award.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[New York Academy of Sciences]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], a William James Fellow of the [[Association for Psychological Science]], and a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

== Books and other public outreach ==
In addition to numerous publications in scholarly journals, LeDoux has written:
* ''The Integrated Mind'' (with Michael Gazzaniga, Plenum, 1978)
* ''The Emotional Brain'' (Simon and Schuster, 1998)
* ''Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are'' (Viking, 2002)
* ''Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety'' (Viking, 2015)
* ''The Deep History of Ourselves: The Four-Billion-Year Story of How We Got Conscious Brains'' (Viking, 2019)

He has also edited several volumes, including ''Mind and Brain: Dialogues in Cognitive Neuroscience'' (with William Hirst, Cambridge University Press, 1986), ''The Self: From Soul to Brain'' (with Jacek Debiec and Henry Moss, Annals of the New York Academy of Science, 2003), and ''Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Basic Science and Clinical Practice'' (with Peter Shiromani and Terrence Keane, Humana Press, 2009).

He has also contributed to ''[[The New York Times]]'' Opinionator column on anxiety and to the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', and has conducted numerous television, radio, online, and print interviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/events.htm |title=LeDoux Lab: News/Events/Press |website=www.cns.nyu.edu |accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref> LeDoux has also collaborated with filmmaker Alexis Gambis on a project called \"My Mind's Eye\" on the ''[[Scientific American]]'' website in which interviews with esteemed scientists and philosophers (including [[Eric Kandel]], [[Michael Gazzaniga]], [[Ned Block]]) are framed within the context of his music (see {{slink||Music}} below).{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

== Early life and education ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}
Joseph LeDoux was born on December 7, 1949, in the Cajun Prairie town of [[Eunice, Louisiana]], to Joseph E. \"Boo\" LeDoux, a traveling rodeo performer (bull rider) and butcher, and Priscilla Buller LeDoux. He attended St. Edmund's Elementary School and Eunice High School, graduating in 1967. LeDoux attended [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] where he majored in Business Administration and minored in Psychology. In 1972 he began work on a Masters of Science in Marketing from LSU. During this time, his interest in psychology grew and he volunteered in the laboratory of Robert Thompson, who introduced him to brain research.

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}
In the fall of 1974 LeDoux began a PhD program at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], and completed his degree in 1977. In 1978, LeDoux joined the Department of Neurology at [[Cornell Medical School]] as a postdoctoral fellow and remained there through the rank of associate professor until 1989. During most of his time at Cornell, he worked in the Neurobiology Laboratory where he received technical training in state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques and began the research program on the brain mechanism of emotional memory that he has pursued ever since. In 1989 he joined the newly formed Center for Neural Science at NYU as an associate professor. In 1991 he was promoted to full professor, and in 1996 he became the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science. In 2005, he was named university professor, the highest honor for a faculty member at NYU.

== Personal life ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}
In 1971 LeDoux married LSU classmate Diana Steen. They divorced amicably in 1978. Since 1982 he has been married to art critic Nancy Princenthal. Currently they reside in the Williamsburg area of [[Brooklyn]]. They have two children, Jacob S. LeDoux (died 2005) and Milo E. LeDoux. Milo is a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied classics, and is now pursuing a career in law.

== Music ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}
Cajun/zydeco, country, R&B, rock, and their fusion into \"[[swamp pop]]\", were influences in LeDoux's childhood. In high school, he was a disc jockey at the local radio station, KEUN, and the rhythm guitarist of two bands: the Deadbeats and the Countdowns. Although he remained an avid music fan in later life, he did not actively play guitar for many years. In 2004, LeDoux and NYU Biology Professor [[Tyler Volk]] began performing as a cover band for small parties around NYU, and in 2006 they formed The Amygdaloids. The original band also included [[Daniela Schiller]], (then an NYU postdoctoral fellow), and graduate student Nina Curley. The band's lyrics, mostly written by LeDoux, are based on neuroscientific, psychological, and philosophical themes, and offer scholarly insights into the role of mind and brain in daily life. Their inaugural CD, Heavy Mental, was released in 2007. On their second CD, Theory of My Mind, LeDoux and Grammy winner Rosanne Cash sing \"Crime of Passion\" and \"Mind over Matter\", both written by LeDoux. In 2012, the band released All in Our Minds, an EP in which all songs had \"mind\" in their title. Anxious, a companion to LeDoux's book with the same title, was released in 2015 and explores some of the same scientific themes as the book, but through song. The band's unique focus on original songs about mind and brain has landed them considerable press. They play regularly in New York City, and have also performed in Washington DC, San Antonio TX, Indianapolis IN, Lafayette LA, and Montreal. LeDoux and Amygdaloids' bassist Colin Dempsey perform as an acoustic duo called So We Are.

== Research and theories ==

===Work on threat response, anxiety, and emotions===
As explained in his 1996 book, ''The Emotional Brain'',<ref>LeDoux JE (1996) The Emotional Brain. New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref> LeDoux developed an interest in the topic of emotion through his doctoral work with Michael Gazzaniga on split-brain patients in the mid-1970s.<ref>Gazzaniga MS, LeDoux JE (1978) The Integrated Mind. New York: Plenum.</ref> Because techniques for studying the human brain were limited at the time, he turned to studies of rodents where the brain could be studied in detail. He chose to focus on a simple behavioral model, Pavlovian fear conditioning. This procedure allowed him to follow the flow of information about a stimulus through the brain as it comes to control behavioral responses by way of sensory pathways to the amygdala, and gave rise to the notion of two sensory roads to the amygdala, with the \"low road\" being a quick and dirty subcortical pathway for rapid activity behavioral responses to threats and the \"high road\" providing slower but highly processed cortical information.<ref>LeDoux JE (1994) Emotion, memory and the brain. Sci Am 270:50-57.</ref> His work has shed light on how the brain detects and responds to threats, and how memories about such experiences are formed and stored through cellular, synaptic and molecular changes in the amygdala.<ref>LeDoux JE (2002) Synaptic Self: How our brains become who we are. New York: Viking; LeDoux JE (2000) Emotion circuits in the brain. Annu Rev Neurosci 23:155-184; Rodrigues SM, Schafe GE, LeDoux JE (2004) Molecular mechanisms underlying emotional learning and memory in the lateral amygdala. Neuron 44:75-91; Johansen JP, Cain CK, Ostroff LE, LeDoux JE (2011) Molecular mechanisms of fear learning and memory. Cell 147:509-524.</ref> A long-standing collaboration with NYU colleague Elizabeth Phelps has shown the validity of the rodent work for understanding threat processing in the human brain.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.09.025 |pmid=16242399 |title=Contributions of the Amygdala to Emotion Processing: From Animal Models to Human Behavior |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=175–187 |year=2005 |last1=Phelps |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Ledoux |first2=Joseph E. }}</ref>

LeDoux's work on amygdala processing of threats has helped understand exaggerated responses to threats in anxiety disorders in humans.<ref>LeDoux JE (2002) Synaptic Self: How our brains become who we are. New York: Viking; LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety. New York: Viking.</ref> For example, studies with Maria Morgan in the 1990s implicated the medial prefrontal cortex in the extinction of responses to threats<ref>Morgan MA, Romanski LM, LeDoux JE (1993) Extinction of emotional learning: contribution of medial prefrontal cortex. Neurosci Lett 163:109-113; Morgan MA, LeDoux JE (1995) Differential contribution of dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex to the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear in rats.

Learn Mem 11:525-535.</ref> and paved the way for understanding how exposure therapy reduces threat reactions in people with anxiety by way of interactions between the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.<ref>LeDoux JE (1996) The Emotional Brain.

Charney. \"Recent Advances in the Neurobiology of Anxiety Disorders: Implications for Novel Therapeutics.\" American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C, Seminars in Medical Genetics (2008) 148C:89–98.</ref> Work conducted with Karim Nader and Glenn Schafe triggered a wave of interest in the topic of memory reconsolidation,<ref>Nader K, Schafe GE, LeDoux JE (2000) Fear memories require protein synthesis in the amygdala for reconsolidation after retrieval. Nature 406:722-726</ref> a process by which memories become labile and subject to change after being retrieved.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.003 |pmid=15450162 |title=Rites of Passage of the Engram |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=93–100 |year=2004 |last1=Dudai |first1=Yadin |last2=Eisenberg |first2=Mark }}</ref> This led to the idea that trauma-related cues might be weakened in humans by blocking reconsolidation. Studies with Marie Mofils, Daniela Schiller and Phelps showed that extinction conducted shortly after triggering reconsolidation is considerably more effective in reducing the threat value of stimuli than conventional extinction,<ref>Monfils MH, Cowansage KK, Klann E, LeDoux JE (2009) Extinction-reconsolidation boundaries: key to persistent attenuation of fear memories.

Science 336:241-245.</ref>

===Difference between threat response and emotions===
In 2012 LeDoux emphasized the value, when discussing brain functions in animals, of using terms that are not derived from human subjective experience.<ref>LeDoux J (2012) [http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(12)00129-8 Rethinking the emotional brain]. Neuron 73:653-676.</ref> The common practice of calling brain circuits that detect and respond to threats \"fear circuits\" implies that these circuits are responsible for feelings of fear. LeDoux has argued that so-called Pavlovian fear conditioning should be renamed Pavlovian threat conditioning to avoid the implication that \"fear\" is being acquired in rats or humans.<ref>LeDoux JE (2014) [http://www.pnas.org/content/111/8/2871.full Coming to terms with fear]. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 111:2871-2878.</ref>

In 2015 he emphasised the notion of survival functions mediated by survival circuits, the purpose of which is to keep organisms alive (rather than to make emotions). For example, defensive survival circuits exist to detect and respond to threats, and can be present in all organisms. However, only organisms that can be conscious of their own brain's activities can feel fear. Fear is a conscious experience and occurs the same way as any other kind of conscious experience: via cortical circuits that allow attention to certain forms of brain activity. He argues the only differences between an emotional and non-emotion state of consciousness are the underlying neural ingredients that contribute to the state.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) [http://www.cns.nyu.edu/home/ledoux/pdf/daed_LeDoux_2015.pdf Feelings: What are they and how does the brain make them?] Daedalus 144.</ref> These ideas and their implications for understanding the neural foundations of pathological fear and anxiety are explained in his 2015 book, Anxious.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety. New York: Viking.</ref> In this he says \"Fear and anxiety are not biologically wired... They are the consequence of the cognitive processing of nonemotional ingredients.\"<ref>ANxiety, 2015, Chapter 9, p232</ref>

In 2018 he further said that the [[amygdala]] may release hormones due to a trigger (such as an innate reaction to seeing a snake), but \"then we elaborate it through cognitive and conscious processes\". He differentiated between the defence system, which has evolved over time, and emotions such as fear and [[anxiety]]. He points out that even simple organisms such as bacteria move in response to threats; \"It's in the brain to allow an organism, whether it be a bacterium or a human, to detect and respond to danger.&nbsp;... It's not in the brain to create feelings like fear and [[anxiety]].\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://brainworldmagazine.com/on-fear-emotions-and-memory-an-interview-with-dr-joseph-ledoux/2/ | title=On Fear, Emotions, and Memory: An Interview with Dr. Joseph LeDoux » Page 2 of 2 » Brain World| date=2018-06-07}}</ref> [[Lisa Feldman Barrett]] takes a similar view.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

{{Campaignbox Goguryeo-Sui Wars}}
{{Military history of Goguryeo}}

The '''Goguryeo–Sui War''' were a series of invasions launched by the [[Sui dynasty]] of [[China]] against [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], between AD 598 and AD 614. It resulted in the defeat of the Sui and was one of the pivotal factors in the collapse of the dynasty, which led to its overthrow by the [[Tang dynasty]] in AD 618.

==Background==
The [[Sui dynasty]] united [[China]] in AD 589, defeating the [[Chen dynasty]] and ending the division of the country that spanned almost 300 years. After the unification of China, Sui asserted its position as an overlord of neighbouring countries. However, in [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], [[Pyeongwon of Goguryeo|Pyeongwon]] and his successor [[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] insisted on maintaining an equal relationship with the Sui dynasty.

[[Emperor Wen of Sui|Wendi]] of Sui was displeased with the challenge from Goguryeo, which continued small scale raiding into Sui's northern border. Wendi sent diplomatic papers in 596 after Sui envoys spotted Goguryeo diplomats in the [[yurt]] of the Eastern Turk [[Khanate]], demanding Goguryeo cancel any military alliance with the Turks, stop the annual raiding of Sui border regions, and acknowledge Sui as their overlord. After receiving this message, [[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] launched a joint preemptive [[Battle of Linyuguan|invasion]] with the [[Malgal]] against the Chinese along the border in present-day [[Hebei]] province; It was the following year, 597.

==Course of the war==

===First Invasion of 598===
[[File:598 Goguryeo-Sui war.png|thumb|350px|1st Goguryeo-Sui War, 598]]
Wendi ordered his fifth and youngest son, [[Yang Liang]] (assisted by the co-prime minister [[Gao Jiong]]), and Admiral Zhou Luohou (周羅睺), to invade and conquer Goguryeo with an army and navy totaling 300,000, mostly composed of horse archers.

Yang Liang's army faced the early rainy season when it reached Goguryeo. The unseasonably heavy rain made the army's progress almost impossible and hampered the transport of provisions. Constant attacks by Goguryeo forces and illness inflicted heavy casualties. Coming to the conclusion that the army could not achieve the objective on its own, Yang decided to combine with Zhou's naval fleet and proceed.

Zhou's navy also came across their own challenges, contending with rough seas, losing many ships despite staying close to the coastline. Whenever they anchored, Goguryeo detachments were present to attack the Sui sailors, and Sui fleet suffered a devastating loss.

===Second Invasion of 612===
[[File:612 Sui-Goguryeo war.png|thumb|350px|2nd Goguryeo-Sui War, 612]]
====Preparations====
[[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Yangdi]], when he won the throne in 604, built the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] connecting the north and south of China. The south, economic base of China, and the north, political base of China, were connected by the canal, allowing transportation of troops for the massive military campaign.<ref>{{cite web |title=China's Grand Canal |author=John M. Jackson |url=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jojacks2/words/grandcanal.htm |accessdate=2004-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040412021950/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jojacks2/words/grandcanal.htm |archivedate=2004-04-12 }}</ref>

After the construction of the canal, Yangdi ordered the enlisting of soldiers in 611. He instructed them to gather in present-day [[Beijing]]. The force gathered by year's end was one of the greatest in civilization according to the ''[[Book of Sui]]'', which states that 1,133,000 troops were mobilized and that the support troops multiple times that number. The army began to depart in early 612, and due to its size, it took 40 days for all of them to depart. The long line of soldiers stretched for about 300 kilometers. The strength and losses may have been deflated by later Chinese historians.

====Campaign in Manchuria====
[[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] gave up the buffer zone that he had acquired after the war of 598, as the area was not suitable to face such a vast army. The Goguryeo troops retreated behind what is now known as the [[Liao River]]. A fortunate event for Goguryeo was that the river melted much sooner than usual. By the time [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Yangdi]] arrived, the ice had all melted. Undaunted, Yangdi ordered the construction of three bridges across the river. The bridges however, were too short to reach the opposite bank in another fortunate turn of events for the defenders, and Goguryeo's attack successfully held off the first assault. After the extension of the bridges however, the Sui forces succeeded in crossing the river, and the army surrounded the fortresses of Goguryeo.

Yangdi ordered his generals before the campaigns not to make individual decisions regarding the movement of troops, but to report to him to receive instruction. This order hampered Sui strategy throughout the campaign. During the strategically important campaign against [[Yodong fortress]], the general commanding the siege had to send a messenger to the emperor for the approval of the surrender. By the time the messenger returned, Goguryeo's troops were again ready to defend the fortress. Exploiting this flaw in the Sui system, Yodong and other castles of Goguryeo continued to hold on. By June, five months after the start of the campaign, not a single castle, fortress, or citadel has fallen to Sui. Yangdi felt that a fundamental change in strategy was needed to seize control of Korea.

====Campaign against Pyongyang====
The new strategy was to keep the fortresses of Goguryeo in [[Manchuria]] at bay, while sending a contingent of army and navy to take [[Pyongyang]], Goguryeo's capital. An army contingent, allegedly with a strength of 305,000, and a naval fleet of some 120,000 were dispatched.

====Naval assault====
The Sui navy reached the bay of the [[Daedong River]] before the army. Seeing that the Sui army had not arrived yet, Go Geonmu, commander of the defence army of Goguryeo at Pyeongyang and brother of King Yeongyang, sent what few troops remained in the capital to engage the Sui navy in battle. After an engagement, feigning defeat, Goguryeo troops retreated into the city. The Sui naval commander, [[Lai Huni]], considering this was a chance to add to his merit, led a host of more than 40,000 to lay assault against Pyeongyang.

When the Sui soldiers reached one of the outer castles, however, they found the wall empty and the gate open. Upon entering the castle, Lai, considering the engagement in the outskirts a decisive move of Goguryeo that failed, looted and destroyed the art and fortune of the outer castle.

Once the looting of the castle started, the death-defying corps of Goguryeo, consisting of 500 troops, ambushed the Sui troops. Confused and disoriented, Lai ran to the fleet at the sea, his legion reduced to mere thousands. Disheartened by his failure.

====Sui army's campaign====
The army contingent, led by generals [[Yu Zhongwen]] and [[Yuwen Shu]], had their own problems. While the supply could be transported safely within China, once it reached Goguryeo territory, there was a danger of ambush by Goguryeo forces. Yangdi solved the problem by instructing each soldiers to carry food for himself, which greatly increased each soldier's burden. Many resorted to discarding the food. By the time it had reached the [[Yalu River]], the army's shortage of provisions was acute.

Yeongyang decided to assess the strength of the Sui army by ordering his Commander Field Marshal [[Eulji Mundeok]] to fake a surrender and peace negotiation terms with the Sui generals. Generals Wu and Yuwen had their own secret order from Yangdi to seize Yeongyang or Eulji Mundeok if they should fall into their hands. However, the generals' advisers, notably the Assistant Director of the Right of the Department of State Affairs, [[Liu Shilong]] (劉士龍), convinced them it would be unwise to arrest negotiators from the opposing camp. They ultimately let Eulji return to Goguryeo and Yu Zhongwen later regretted his decision, attempting to lure Eulji Mundeok back. He sent a message that he wished to discuss things further but Eulji Mundeok, aware of Wu's intentions, did not comply.

The two generals argued about the next course of action, with Yu Zhongwen arguing strongly that Eulji Mundeok should be pursued. They did agree that the Goguryeo capital should be captured. Accordingly, the Sui troops began advancing south towards [[Pyeongyang]]. Eulji Mundeok maneuvered the Goguryeo troops so that they engaged the Sui army seven times a day, each time faking defeat and retreat. The strategy would draw the Sui army deeper south with the perception of victory. The Sui army eventually advanced to about 20&nbsp;km from Pyeongyang. Yu Zhongwen later recognized that his advancing troops were suffering from exhaustion, and that fortifications of Pyeongyang made for an impossible campaign.

Yu was caught in a dilemma and could not decide on advance or retreat. Eulji Mundeok sent him for the occasion a poem:
<blockquote> Your divine plans have plumbed the heavens; Your subtle reckoning has spanned the earth. You win every battle, your military merit is great. Why then not be content and stop the war?<ref name=cummings>{{cite book |title=Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History |url=https://archive.org/details/koreasplaceinsun00bruc |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-393-04011-1 |date=March 1997 |publisher=W W Norton & Co Inc |edition=1st  |first=Bruce |last=Cumings}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=yKN_q-TqYYgC&printsec=frontcover updated 2005 version with Google preview]).</ref></blockquote> When no response came, Eulji sent a representative. The plan now was to offer Emperor Yeongyang to Yangdi escort to submission if the Sui army would withdraw. Seizing this opportunity to retreat, Yu withdrew his troops towards Sui.

====Battle of Salsu River====
{{Main article|Battle of Salsu}}

When Sui army had reached [[Battle of Salsu|Salsu]] (thought to be present-day [[Chongchon River]]), Goguryeo charged the remaining Sui army. Eulji Mundeok defended fortresses against the Sui army and navy for several months and destroyed the Sui troops while retreating into Goguryeo territory. An attack at Salsu (Chongchon River) inflicted massive casualties on the Sui forces. When the Sui army had reached Salsu, Eulji Mundeok's force slaughtering them. The historical text records that Sui soldiers had to run almost 200 kilometers that day to escape death. The Battle of Salsu contributed to the massive overall casualty figure for Sui during the campaign. Emperor Yang crossed the Liao River to attack Goguryeo, initially, with 305,000 men. Only 2,800 returned.<ref name=ZZTJ181>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[s:zh:資治通鑑/卷181|vol. 181]].</ref><ref name=SGSG20>''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', vol. 20 {{cite web |url=http://147.46.181.118/IMAGE/SNUG0020.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182732/http://147.46.181.118/IMAGE/SNUG0020.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}.</ref>

===Third Invasion of 613===
Yangdi invaded Liaodong again the following year (613), but was again obliged to retreat without success. While Yangdi was away, [[Yang Xuangan]], the son of Yangdi's prime minister [[Yang Su]], fomented rebellion against Yangdi. Fearing attack from two fronts, Yangdi was forced to retreat and use his army to put down Yang Xuangan's rebellion.

===Fourth Invasion of 614===
After crushing the revolt, Yangdi invaded [[Goguryeo]] again in 614. Though he managed to breach Goguryeo's first line of defence without capturing the frontier fortress, he could not advance far beyond Liao River due to Goguryeo's constant attacks and obstruction to his supply lines. Yeongyang, seeing a chance to end these exhausting wars, offered peace and returned Yang Xuangan's associate Husi Zheng (斛斯政), who had fled to Goguryeo after Yang Xuangan's rebellion, to Sui. Perceiving the little success in Goguryeo and the increasing internal discontent in China, Yangdi accepted Yeongyang's offer of peace and withdrew Sui troops from Goguryeo's territory. However, the king of Goguryeo never showed up to swear allegiance, infuriating Emperor Yang, who had to be dissuaded with difficulty from launching another invasion against Goguryeo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whiting|first1=Marvin C.|title=Imperial Chinese Military History: 8000 BC-1912 AD|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595221349|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJQiAz3qTCgC&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=9 November 2016|language=en|quote=The King of Koguryo offered to submit and the Chinese army straggled home thinking they had won. The Korean king, however, failed to show up to swear allegiance. A furious Yangdi was dissuaded from a fourth invasion only with difficulty.}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The losses that Sui suffered, both in terms of lives and resources and consequently the trust the people had in the Sui state, contributed to the fall of the Sui Dynasty. Peasants, farmers, soldiers, aristocrats, and landlords rose up against the emperor along with many of the dynasty's military officers. Yangdi moved the capital to the south in [[Yangzhou]], but the revolts were too widespread. [[Yuwen Shu|Yuwen Shu's]] son, [[Yuwen Huaji]], became a powerful Sui general who led a successful coup against Yangdi and personally murdered him. This would complete the [[transition from Sui to Tang]], as the Duke of Tang was able to proclaim himself emperor of [[Tang Dynasty|a new dynasty]].

{{Military history of Goguryeo}}

The '''Goguryeo–Sui War''' were a series of invasions launched by the [[Sui dynasty]] of [[China]] against [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], between AD 598 and AD 614. It resulted in the defeat of the Sui and was one of the pivotal factors in the collapse of the dynasty, which led to its overthrow by the [[Tang dynasty]] in AD 618.

==Background==
The [[Sui dynasty]] united [[China]] in AD 589, defeating the [[Chen dynasty]] and ending the division of the country that spanned almost 300 years. After the unification of China, Sui asserted its position as an overlord of neighbouring countries. However, in [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], [[Pyeongwon of Goguryeo|Pyeongwon]] and his successor [[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] insisted on maintaining an equal relationship with the Sui dynasty.

[[Emperor Wen of Sui|Wendi]] of Sui was displeased with the challenge from Goguryeo, which continued small scale raiding into Sui's northern border. Wendi sent diplomatic papers in 596 after Sui envoys spotted Goguryeo diplomats in the [[yurt]] of the Eastern Turk [[Khanate]], demanding Goguryeo cancel any military alliance with the Turks, stop the annual raiding of Sui border regions, and acknowledge Sui as their overlord. After receiving this message, [[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] launched a joint preemptive [[Battle of Linyuguan|invasion]] with the [[Malgal]] against the Chinese along the border in present-day [[Hebei]] province; It was the following year, 597.

==Course of the war==

===First Invasion of 598===
[[File:598 Goguryeo-Sui war.png|thumb|350px|1st Goguryeo-Sui War, 598]]
Wendi ordered his fifth and youngest son, [[Yang Liang]] (assisted by the co-prime minister [[Gao Jiong]]), and Admiral Zhou Luohou (周羅睺), to invade and conquer Goguryeo with an army and navy totaling 300,000, mostly composed of horse archers.

Yang Liang's army faced the early rainy season when it reached Goguryeo. The unseasonably heavy rain made the army's progress almost impossible and hampered the transport of provisions. Constant attacks by Goguryeo forces and illness inflicted heavy casualties. Coming to the conclusion that the army could not achieve the objective on its own, Yang decided to combine with Zhou's naval fleet and proceed.

Zhou's navy also came across their own challenges, contending with rough seas, losing many ships despite staying close to the coastline. Whenever they anchored, Goguryeo detachments were present to attack the Sui sailors, and Sui fleet suffered a devastating loss.

===Second Invasion of 612===
[[File:612 Sui-Goguryeo war.png|thumb|350px|2nd Goguryeo-Sui War, 612]]
====Preparations====
[[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Yangdi]], when he won the throne in 604, built the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] connecting the north and south of China. The south, economic base of China, and the north, political base of China, were connected by the canal, allowing transportation of troops for the massive military campaign.<ref>{{cite web |title=China's Grand Canal |author=John M. Jackson |url=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jojacks2/words/grandcanal.htm |accessdate=2004-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040412021950/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jojacks2/words/grandcanal.htm |archivedate=2004-04-12 }}</ref>

After the construction of the canal, Yangdi ordered the enlisting of soldiers in 611. He instructed them to gather in present-day [[Beijing]]. The force gathered by year's end was one of the greatest in civilization according to the ''[[Book of Sui]]'', which states that 1,133,000 troops were mobilized and that the support troops multiple times that number. The army began to depart in early 612, and due to its size, it took 40 days for all of them to depart. The long line of soldiers stretched for about 300 kilometers. The strength and losses may have been deflated by later Chinese historians.

====Campaign in Manchuria====
[[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] gave up the buffer zone that he had acquired after the war of 598, as the area was not suitable to face such a vast army. The Goguryeo troops retreated behind what is now known as the [[Liao River]]. A fortunate event for Goguryeo was that the river melted much sooner than usual. By the time [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Yangdi]] arrived, the ice had all melted. Undaunted, Yangdi ordered the construction of three bridges across the river. The bridges however, were too short to reach the opposite bank in another fortunate turn of events for the defenders, and Goguryeo's attack successfully held off the first assault. After the extension of the bridges however, the Sui forces succeeded in crossing the river, and the army surrounded the fortresses of Goguryeo.

Yangdi ordered his generals before the campaigns not to make individual decisions regarding the movement of troops, but to report to him to receive instruction. This order hampered Sui strategy throughout the campaign. During the strategically important campaign against [[Yodong fortress]], the general commanding the siege had to send a messenger to the emperor for the approval of the surrender. By the time the messenger returned, Goguryeo's troops were again ready to defend the fortress. Exploiting this flaw in the Sui system, Yodong and other castles of Goguryeo continued to hold on. By June, five months after the start of the campaign, not a single castle, fortress, or citadel has fallen to Sui. Yangdi felt that a fundamental change in strategy was needed to seize control of Korea.

====Campaign against Pyongyang====
The new strategy was to keep the fortresses of Goguryeo in [[Manchuria]] at bay, while sending a contingent of army and navy to take [[Pyongyang]], Goguryeo's capital. An army contingent, allegedly with a strength of 305,000, and a naval fleet of some 120,000 were dispatched.

====Naval assault====
The Sui navy reached the bay of the [[Daedong River]] before the army. Seeing that the Sui army had not arrived yet, Go Geonmu, commander of the defence army of Goguryeo at Pyeongyang and brother of King Yeongyang, sent what few troops remained in the capital to engage the Sui navy in battle. After an engagement, feigning defeat, Goguryeo troops retreated into the city. The Sui naval commander, [[Lai Huni]], considering this was a chance to add to his merit, led a host of more than 40,000 to lay assault against Pyeongyang.

When the Sui soldiers reached one of the outer castles, however, they found the wall empty and the gate open. Upon entering the castle, Lai, considering the engagement in the outskirts a decisive move of Goguryeo that failed, looted and destroyed the art and fortune of the outer castle.

Once the looting of the castle started, the death-defying corps of Goguryeo, consisting of 500 troops, ambushed the Sui troops. Confused and disoriented, Lai ran to the fleet at the sea, his legion reduced to mere thousands. Disheartened by his failure.

====Sui army's campaign====
The army contingent, led by generals [[Yu Zhongwen]] and [[Yuwen Shu]], had their own problems. While the supply could be transported safely within China, once it reached Goguryeo territory, there was a danger of ambush by Goguryeo forces. Yangdi solved the problem by instructing each soldiers to carry food for himself, which greatly increased each soldier's burden. Many resorted to discarding the food. By the time it had reached the [[Yalu River]], the army's shortage of provisions was acute.

Yeongyang decided to assess the strength of the Sui army by ordering his Commander Field Marshal [[Eulji Mundeok]] to fake a surrender and peace negotiation terms with the Sui generals. Generals Wu and Yuwen had their own secret order from Yangdi to seize Yeongyang or Eulji Mundeok if they should fall into their hands. However, the generals' advisers, notably the Assistant Director of the Right of the Department of State Affairs, [[Liu Shilong]] (劉士龍), convinced them it would be unwise to arrest negotiators from the opposing camp. They ultimately let Eulji return to Goguryeo and Yu Zhongwen later regretted his decision, attempting to lure Eulji Mundeok back. He sent a message that he wished to discuss things further but Eulji Mundeok, aware of Wu's intentions, did not comply.

The two generals argued about the next course of action, with Yu Zhongwen arguing strongly that Eulji Mundeok should be pursued. They did agree that the Goguryeo capital should be captured. Accordingly, the Sui troops began advancing south towards [[Pyeongyang]]. Eulji Mundeok maneuvered the Goguryeo troops so that they engaged the Sui army seven times a day, each time faking defeat and retreat. The strategy would draw the Sui army deeper south with the perception of victory. The Sui army eventually advanced to about 20&nbsp;km from Pyeongyang. Yu Zhongwen later recognized that his advancing troops were suffering from exhaustion, and that fortifications of Pyeongyang made for an impossible campaign.

Yu was caught in a dilemma and could not decide on advance or retreat. Eulji Mundeok sent him for the occasion a poem:
<blockquote> Your divine plans have plumbed the heavens; Your subtle reckoning has spanned the earth. You win every battle, your military merit is great. Why then not be content and stop the war?<ref name=cummings>{{cite book |title=Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History |url=https://archive.org/details/koreasplaceinsun00bruc |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-393-04011-1 |date=March 1997 |publisher=W W Norton & Co Inc |edition=1st  |first=Bruce |last=Cumings}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=yKN_q-TqYYgC&printsec=frontcover updated 2005 version with Google preview]).</ref></blockquote> When no response came, Eulji sent a representative. The plan now was to offer Emperor Yeongyang to Yangdi escort to submission if the Sui army would withdraw. Seizing this opportunity to retreat, Yu withdrew his troops towards Sui.

====Battle of Salsu River====
{{Main article|Battle of Salsu}}

When Sui army had reached [[Battle of Salsu|Salsu]] (thought to be present-day [[Chongchon River]]), Goguryeo charged the remaining Sui army. Eulji Mundeok defended fortresses against the Sui army and navy for several months and destroyed the Sui troops while retreating into Goguryeo territory. An attack at Salsu (Chongchon River) inflicted massive casualties on the Sui forces. When the Sui army had reached Salsu, Eulji Mundeok's force slaughtering them. The historical text records that Sui soldiers had to run almost 200 kilometers that day to escape death. The Battle of Salsu contributed to the massive overall casualty figure for Sui during the campaign. Emperor Yang crossed the Liao River to attack Goguryeo, initially, with 305,000 men. Only 2,800 returned.<ref name=ZZTJ181>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[s:zh:資治通鑑/卷181|vol. 181]].</ref><ref name=SGSG20>''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', vol. 20 {{cite web |url=http://147.46.181.118/IMAGE/SNUG0020.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182732/http://147.46.181.118/IMAGE/SNUG0020.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}.</ref>

===Third Invasion of 613===
Yangdi invaded Liaodong again the following year (613), but was again obliged to retreat without success. While Yangdi was away, [[Yang Xuangan]], the son of Yangdi's prime minister [[Yang Su]], fomented rebellion against Yangdi. Fearing attack from two fronts, Yangdi was forced to retreat and use his army to put down Yang Xuangan's rebellion.

===Fourth Invasion of 614===
After crushing the revolt, Yangdi invaded [[Goguryeo]] again in 614. Though he managed to breach Goguryeo's first line of defence without capturing the frontier fortress, he could not advance far beyond Liao River due to Goguryeo's constant attacks and obstruction to his supply lines. Yeongyang, seeing a chance to end these exhausting wars, offered peace and returned Yang Xuangan's associate Husi Zheng (斛斯政), who had fled to Goguryeo after Yang Xuangan's rebellion, to Sui. Perceiving the little success in Goguryeo and the increasing internal discontent in China, Yangdi accepted Yeongyang's offer of peace and withdrew Sui troops from Goguryeo's territory. However, the king of Goguryeo never showed up to swear allegiance, infuriating Emperor Yang, who had to be dissuaded with difficulty from launching another invasion against Goguryeo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whiting|first1=Marvin C.|title=Imperial Chinese Military History: 8000 BC-1912 AD|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595221349|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJQiAz3qTCgC&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=9 November 2016|language=en|quote=The King of Koguryo offered to submit and the Chinese army straggled home thinking they had won. The Korean king, however, failed to show up to swear allegiance. A furious Yangdi was dissuaded from a fourth invasion only with difficulty.}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The losses that Sui suffered, both in terms of lives and resources and consequently the trust the people had in the Sui state, contributed to the fall of the Sui Dynasty. Peasants, farmers, soldiers, aristocrats, and landlords rose up against the emperor along with many of the dynasty's military officers. Yangdi moved the capital to the south in [[Yangzhou]], but the revolts were too widespread. [[Yuwen Shu|Yuwen Shu's]] son, [[Yuwen Huaji]], became a powerful Sui general who led a successful coup against Yangdi and personally murdered him. This would complete the [[transition from Sui to Tang]], as the Duke of Tang was able to proclaim himself emperor of [[Tang Dynasty|a new dynasty]].

In 2015, Ludia released an updated version of the game titled ''[[Jurassic World: The Game]]'', to coincide with the release of the film ''[[Jurassic World]]''.

== Gameplay ==
''Jurassic Park Builder'' is a [[freemium]] game<ref name=Apps/> consisting of two-dimensional landscape renderings and three-dimensional creatures.<ref name=En/> The player's objective is to build and maintain a [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] theme park.<ref name=GZ/> The player begins the game with a basic home base, while expansion of the park is done by clearing land.<ref name=En/> To create dinosaurs, the player must clear away trees and rocks to locate prehistoric mosquitos, which are trapped in [[amber]] and contain dinosaur DNA. In a laboratory, the player then attempts to unlock the DNA from the mosquito. If the player is successful, then a dinosaur egg is created.<ref name=GZ/> Amber is sometimes discovered when the player clears land for park expansion.<ref name=Apps/>

Basic mission objectives are given to the player by characters from the first two films:<ref name=Slide/><ref name=GZ/> [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Alan Grant|Alan Grant]], [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond]], [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Ian Malcolm]], and [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Kelly Curtis|Kelly Curtis]]. [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Henry Wu|Dr. Henry Wu]], a park scientist, also appears in the game, which features no characters from the film ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''. Mission objectives include constructing roads and feeding creatures in the park. Completing missions ultimately gives the player the ability to create new buildings and conduct research for cloning new dinosaurs.<ref name=GI/> Buildings include hotels and theme park attractions,<ref name=En/> including tour vehicles that travel along a path determined by the player.<ref name=GZ/>

Revenue is earned through the buildings and dinosaurs that are located in the park.<ref name=Apps/><ref name=Slide/> Revenue is collected in regular intervals, and the player can earn more money by feeding the dinosaurs to level them up.<ref name=Slide/> Although the dinosaurs do not require food to survive, feeding the animals will level them up, resulting in higher profits for the player.<ref name=Slide/><ref name=Apps/> Carnivorous and herbivorous creatures require their own supply of food, which must be managed by the player to avoid running out. The player can choose to pay real money to purchase [[Virtual economy|in-game currency]], as well as supplies such as dinosaur food.<ref name=En/> Various aspects of the game take time to progress, including the hatching of dinosaur eggs, the clearing of forest land, and shipments of food from the mainland. The player can pay real currency to speed up these parts of the game.<ref name=Slide/>

In a [[minigame]] titled \"Red Zone\", the player must tap on a specific dinosaur to prevent it from escaping its enclosure.<ref name=Slide/> In addition to breakouts, the player is occasionally given the option to respond to other emergencies such as storms. Responding to emergencies earns the player additional in-game currency.<ref name=GZ/>

Aside from Jurassic Park on [[Isla Nublar]], the game features two additional parks that the player can create: Aquatic Park, located on a [[seabed]], featuring extinct aquatic animals; and Glacier Park, located in [[Patagonia]], featuring extinct animals from the {{w|Cenozoic}} era along with some [[Mesozoic]] [[crocodilians]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.games.com/game/ludia/jurassic-park-builder | title = Game description from Games.com | publisher = games.com}}</ref>

Ben Hanson of ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game three and a half stars out of five.

Rob Rich of 148Apps.com gave the game four stars out of five and wrote, \"''Jurassic Park Builder'' is not ''Operation Genesis'' for mobile devices, but it is like playing a simplified freemium version of it.

In February 2020, Ludia announced that it would end support for the game, which would no longer be playable as of March 30, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jurassic Park Builder: Game closure |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/jurassic-park-builder/jurassic-park-builder-game-closure/2745898668832367/ |website=Facebook |archiveurl=http://archive.is/0Godt |archivedate=February 7, 2020 |date=February 6, 2020}}</ref>

In 2015, Ludia released an updated version of the game titled ''[[Jurassic World: The Game]]'', to coincide with the release of the film ''[[Jurassic World]]''.

== Gameplay ==
''Jurassic Park Builder'' is a [[freemium]] game<ref name=Apps/> consisting of two-dimensional landscape renderings and three-dimensional creatures.<ref name=En/> The player's objective is to build and maintain a [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] theme park.<ref name=GZ/> The player begins the game with a basic home base, while expansion of the park is done by clearing land.<ref name=En/> To create dinosaurs, the player must clear away trees and rocks to locate prehistoric mosquitos, which are trapped in [[amber]] and contain dinosaur DNA. In a laboratory, the player then attempts to unlock the DNA from the mosquito. If the player is successful, then a dinosaur egg is created.<ref name=GZ/> Amber is sometimes discovered when the player clears land for park expansion.<ref name=Apps/>

Basic mission objectives are given to the player by characters from the first two films:<ref name=Slide/><ref name=GZ/> [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Alan Grant|Alan Grant]], [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond]], [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Ian Malcolm]], and [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Kelly Curtis|Kelly Curtis]]. [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Henry Wu|Dr. Henry Wu]], a park scientist, also appears in the game, which features no characters from the film ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''. Mission objectives include constructing roads and feeding creatures in the park. Completing missions ultimately gives the player the ability to create new buildings and conduct research for cloning new dinosaurs.<ref name=GI/> Buildings include hotels and theme park attractions,<ref name=En/> including tour vehicles that travel along a path determined by the player.<ref name=GZ/>

Revenue is earned through the buildings and dinosaurs that are located in the park.<ref name=Apps/><ref name=Slide/> Revenue is collected in regular intervals, and the player can earn more money by feeding the dinosaurs to level them up.<ref name=Slide/> Although the dinosaurs do not require food to survive, feeding the animals will level them up, resulting in higher profits for the player.<ref name=Slide/><ref name=Apps/> Carnivorous and herbivorous creatures require their own supply of food, which must be managed by the player to avoid running out. The player can choose to pay real money to purchase [[Virtual economy|in-game currency]], as well as supplies such as dinosaur food.<ref name=En/> Various aspects of the game take time to progress, including the hatching of dinosaur eggs, the clearing of forest land, and shipments of food from the mainland. The player can pay real currency to speed up these parts of the game.<ref name=Slide/>

In a [[minigame]] titled \"Red Zone\", the player must tap on a specific dinosaur to prevent it from escaping its enclosure.<ref name=Slide/> In addition to breakouts, the player is occasionally given the option to respond to other emergencies such as storms. Responding to emergencies earns the player additional in-game currency.<ref name=GZ/>

Aside from Jurassic Park on [[Isla Nublar]], the game features two additional parks that the player can create: Aquatic Park, located on a [[seabed]], featuring extinct aquatic animals; and Glacier Park, located in [[Patagonia]], featuring extinct animals from the {{w|Cenozoic}} era along with some [[Mesozoic]] [[crocodilians]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.games.com/game/ludia/jurassic-park-builder | title = Game description from Games.com | publisher = games.com}}</ref>

Ben Hanson of ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game three and a half stars out of five.

Gabriel Mourey was born 23 September 1865 in [[Marseille]], the son of Louis-Félix Mourey, a druggist, and Amélie-Madeleine Roche-Latilla.<ref name=\"Base Léonore\">[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH204/PG/FRDAFAN84_O19800035v0947820.htm Dossier cote LH 19800035/561/63905], Archives nationales de France.</ref>

He began his career as a poet at the age of seventeen with the collection ''Voix éparses'' (1883) published in the Librairie des bibliophiles by Jules Rouam (Paris).<ref>[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb30989135p Notice du Catalogue général de la BnF], online.</ref> In March 1884, he launched ''Mireille, revue des poètes marseillais'', with Raoul Russel, which had eight deliveries.

For the Parisian publisher Camille Dalou, he published his first translation from English, the ''Poésies complètes de [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'' (1889) with a preface by [[Joséphin Péladan]]; He subsequently translated poems by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. From then on, the poet approached the [[Symbolism (art)|symbolist trend]] and became friend with [[Claude Debussy]], and met in [[Edmond Bailly]]'s ''Librairie de l'art indépendant'', the \"master of the dream\" [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], of whom he attended the \"Tuesdays of the Rue de Rome\".<ref>Read the memories of Mourey about this in ''Chez les Symbolistes'', text appeared in ''Les Nouvelles littéraires'', 20 June 1936 — [http://livrenblog.blogspot.fr/2009/11/gabriel-mourey-chez-les-symbolistes.html online] sur ''Livres en blog''.</ref> The following year, he published his first essay of art criticism, ''Les Arts de la vie et le règne de la laideur'' at {{ill|Paul Ollendorff|fr}}, a rather reactionary essay that denounced [[impressionism]], the realistic or naturalist drifts of painting, and which was more on the side of [[William Morris]], the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and [[John Ruskin]], and in which he affirmed that \"it is the spirit of anarchism that reigns in France in the artistic movement... a need for destruction, a sort of delirium that wants to abolish everything that exists.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lesartsdelavieet00mour ''Les arts de la vie et Le règne de la laideur''], 2nd edition (1899), online on ''archive.org''.</ref> Mourey was much more open during the following decades; he was commissioned by the Ministry of Fine Arts from 1895 onwards, and served as a link between the emerging English, Italian, Russian and Parisian [[decorative arts]], and then saluted the advent of the [[Art Nouveau]] style. He wrote for catalogs of the [[Siegfried Bing|Bing gallery]] and the [[Julius Meier-Graefe|Maison moderne]], defended [[Albert Besnard]], {{ill|Felix Borchardt|fr}}, [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Edmond Aman-Jean]], [[Edgar Chahine]], etc.

Basically, this versatile writer was a promoter in the hexagon of the Pre-Raphaelites and the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement. Erecting the latter as a model, with a tendency to idealize his supposed success, Mourey argued for an art with a social vocation [...]. As a number of his contemporaries, and as an art for all, his ideas found one of their extensions in 1904–1905 in the ephemeral magazine ''Les Arts de la vie,'' which he created and directed [at Larousse]. He thus evoked this \"bankruptcy of modern decorative art\" in France, for a production he considered to be elitist, not having been able to show a real agreement between artists and manufacturers, unlike, according to him, the English or German achievements ''.<ref>[https://inha.revues.org/6114 « Gabriel Mourey, La Faillite de l’art décoratif moderne, 1904 »] by Jérémie Cerman, in ''L’Art social de la Révolution à la Grande Guerre.

Between 1888 and 1905, he held a correspondence with [[Jean Lorrain]]<ref>[http://www.septentrion.com/fr/livre/?GCOI=27574100736600 ''Jean Lorrain. Lettres inédites à Gabriel Mourey et à quelques autres (1888-1905)''], notice critique du catalogue des Presses du Septentrion.</ref> in which the two men sometimes showed an appalling cruelty to their contemporaries.

From 1891, he wanted to become a playwright with ''Lawn-tennis'', a [[one-act play]] created at the [[Théâtre Antoine]], and then in 1893 he wrote with [[Paul Adam (French novelist)|Paul Adam]] ''Automne'', a three-act drama, which was banned by censorship on 3 February, and which gave rise to a stormy session in the Chamber of Deputies on 6 March 1893 with the intervention of [[Maurice Barrès]]: The latter, deputy of [[Nancy (France)|
Nancy]], then opposed the interior minister [[Charles Dupuy]], who asked to remove from the text everything that recalled the {{ill|fusillade du Brûlé|fr}} at [[La Ricamarie]]: in 1869, in the coalfield of Saint-Etienne, where the troops fired on the strikers.

With [[Armand Dayot]] he drew attention to the 18th-century [[English art|English school of painting]], then partly forgotten.

In 1900, he founded the ''Société nouvelle de peintres et de sculpteurs'' (\"New Society of Painters and Sculptors\") with French, German and English artists, which he presided until 1907; The Paris headquarters was located at [[Georges Petit]]'s gallery.<ref name=\"Base Léonore\"/>

In 1913, he was made chevalier of the [[Légion d'honneur]], under the patronage of [[Charles Plumet]].<ref name=\"Base Léonore\"/>

After the war, he became inspector of national museums.

During his career as a critic, Gabriel Mourey wrote for many newspapers, such as ''[[Gil Blas]]'', ''[[Le Journal]]'' (1911), ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'', the ''{{ill|Revue encyclopédique|fr}}'', ''[[L'Illustration]]'', the ''[[Revue de Paris]]''...

'''Tony Oladipo Allen''' (born 1940 in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]) is a Nigerian drummer, composer and songwriter who currently{{when|date=February 2020}} lives and works in Paris, France. His career and life story have been documented in his 2013 autobiography ''Tony Allen: Master Drummer of Afrobeat'', co-written with author/musician Michael E. Veal, who previously wrote a comprehensive biography of [[Fela Kuti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/Tony-Allen/|work=[[Duke University Press]]|title=Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>

As drummer and musical director of Fela Anikulapo Kuti's band Africa '70 from 1968 to 1979, Allen was one of the primary co-founders of the genre of [[Afrobeat]] music. Fela once stated that, \"without Tony Allen, there would be no Afrobeat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/tony-allen-the-veteran-afrobeat-drummer-is-shaking-his-sticks-as-hard-and-as-brilliantly-as-ever-770993.html|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Tony Allen: The veteran Afrobeat drummer is shaking his sticks as hard and as brilliantly as ever|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|date=18 January 2008|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref> He has also been described by [[Brian Eno]] as \"perhaps the greatest drummer who has ever lived.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=27798|publisher=www.allaboutjazz.com|title=Steve Reid: Staying in the Rhythms|first=Ian|last=Patterson|date=24 December 2007|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref>

==Early career==
A self-taught musician, Allen began playing a drum kit at the age of 18, while working as an engineer for a Nigerian radio station. Allen was influenced by music his father listened to [[Jùjú music|Jùjú]], a popular [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] music from the 1940s, but also American jazz, and the growing [[highlife]] scene in Nigeria and Ghana. Allen worked hard to develop a unique voice on the drums, feverishly studying LPs and magazine articles by [[Max Roach]] and [[Art Blakey]], but also revolutionary Ghanaian drummer [[Guy Warren]] (later known as [[Kofi Ghanaba]] – who developed a highly sought-after sound that mixed tribal Ghanaian drumming with bop – working with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Max Roach]]).

Allen was hired by [[Victor Olaiya|\"Sir\" Victor Olaiya]] to play [[claves]] with his highlife band, the Cool Cats. Allen was able to fill the drum set chair when the former Cool Cats drummer left the band. Allen later played with Agu Norris and the Heatwaves, the Nigerian Messengers, and the Melody Makers.

==Fela and Africa '70==
In 1964, [[Fela Kuti]] invited Allen to audition for a jazz-highlife band he was forming. Kuti and Allen had played together as sidemen in the Lagos circuit. Fela complimented Allen's unique sound: \"How come you are the only guy in Nigeria who plays like this – jazz and highlife?\" Thus Allen became an original member of Kuti's \"Koola Lobitos\" highlife-jazz band.

In 1969, following a turbulent and educational trip to the United States, Fela and the newly renamed Africa '70 band developed a new militant African sound, mixing the heavy groove and universal appeal of soul with jazz, highlife, and the [[polyrhythm]]ic template of Yoruba conventions. Allen developed a novel style to complement Fela's new African groove that blended these disparate genres.

Allen recounts how he and Fela wrote in 1970: \"Fela used to write out the parts for all the musicians in the band (Africa '70). I was the only one who originated the music I played. Fela would ask what type of rhythm I wanted to play.… You can tell a good drummer because we… have four limbs… and they are… playing different things… the patterns don't just come from Yoruba… [but] other parts of Nigeria and Africa.\"<ref>Graeme Ewens, ''Africa O-Ye!'', 1991.</ref>

Allen recorded more than 30 albums with Fela and Africa '70. But by the late 1970s, dissension was growing in the ranks of Africa '70. Arguments over royalties/pay and recognition grew in intensity. As inventor of the rhythms that underpinned Afrobeat and musical director, Allen felt especially slighted. Fela stood his ground, stating that he would get the royalties for his songs. Fela did support Allen's three solo recordings: ''Jealousy'' ('75), ''Progress'' ('77), ''No Accommodation For Lagos'' ('79), but by 1979, Allen chose to leave Africa '70, taking many members with him. \"'What makes me decide it's time to go? It's … everything...and (his) carelessness...like he doesn't care, like he doesn't know ...he doesn't feel he's done anything (wrong). And with all the parasites around too.... there were 71 people on tour by now and only 30 working in the band....you got to ask why. Those guys were sapping Fela of his Force, of his Music.' So Tony moved on, once again in search of his own sound.\"

==Afrobeat to Afrofunk==
Allen formed his own group, recording ''No Discrimination'' in 1980, and performing in Lagos until emigrating to London in 1984. Later moving to Paris, Allen recorded with [[King Sunny Adé]], [[Ray Lema]] and [[Manu Dibango]]. Allen recorded ''N.E.P.A.'' in 1985.

Post-Fela, Allen developed a hybrid sound, deconstructing and fusing Afrobeat with [[electronica]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[R&B]], and [[Hip hop music|rap]]. Allen refers to this synthesis as ''afrofunk''.

Allen returned with a much anticipated new project for his 13th release. Recorded live in Lagos, with a full-sized Afrobeat band, ''Lagos No Shaking'' (Lagos is OK) signified Allen's return to roots Afrobeat after forays into avant-garde electronica hybrids. ''Lagos No Shaking'' was released on 13 June 2006.

==Current work==
In 2002, Allen appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Red Hot and Riot]]'' in tribute to [[Fela Kuti]]. Allen appeared alongside [[Res (singer)|Res]], [[Ray Lema]], [[Baaba Maal]], [[Positive Black Soul]] and [[Archie Shepp]] on a track entitled \"No Agreement.\"

Allen played drums throughout the 2003 album ''Love Trap'' by [[Susheela Raman]] and has also performed with her live.

In 2004 Allen recorded with French electronic artist [[Sébastien Tellier]] on the album ''[[Politics (Sébastien Tellier album)|Politics]]'' including the hit song \"[[La Ritournelle]]\".

In 2006, Allen joined with [[Damon Albarn]], [[Paul Simonon]], and [[Simon Tong]] as drummer for [[The Good, the Bad & the Queen]].

Allen plays drums on two tracks on the 2007 album ''5:55'' by [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]: \"5:55\" and \"Night-Time Intermission\", backed by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] and [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].

He also made an appearance playing the drums in the video for \"[[Once Upon a Time (Air song)|Once Upon a Time]]\" by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] in late 2007.

He has been a featured artist on [[Zap Mama]]'s albums ''Supermoon'' (2007) and ''ReCreation'' (2009), adding his voice to the tracks \"1000 Ways\" and \"African Diamond.\"
Allen also contributed drums on \"People Dansa\", an afrobeat rhythm-fuelled track on the second album of the Brazilian singer Flavia Coelho, released in 2014.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNHZTAXLp5U \"FLAVIA COELHO - Les Musiciens du 2e Album 'Mundo Meu'\".]</ref>

His album entitled ''Secret Agent'' was released in June 2009 by [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit]].<ref>[http://musicfeeds.com.au/music/tony-allen/ Tony Allen – Feature – Musicfeeds.com.au]. Retrieved 15 March 2009.</ref>

Allen has influenced a range of artists across a number of genres. In the single \"[[Music Is My Radar]]\" (2000) [[Blur (band)|Blur]] pay homage to him, and the song ends with [[Damon Albarn]] repeating the phrase \"Tony Allen got me dancing.\"<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2153.html Damon Albarn and Paul Simonon – Features – Music, ''Time Out'' London<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120232959/http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2153.html |date=20 November 2006 }}</ref>

Allen has collaborated with Albarn and [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] in a project called [[Rocket Juice and The Moon]] with an album released in 2012. Albarn collaborated with him again for the single \"Go Back\" in 2014, that is part of the album ''Film of Life'', released in October. 

Allen replaced [[Vladislav Delay]] as drummer for the [[Moritz Von Oswald]] Trio and appeared on their album ''Sounding Lines''.

In 2017, he released ''A Tribute to Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers'', a four-song [[Extended play|EP]] on [[Blue Note Records]] featuring a reworked [[Afrobeat]] version of [[Art Blakey]]'s \"[[Moanin' (song)|Moanin']]\".

In 2017, Allen collaborated with Malian singer [[Oumou Sangaré]] for the track \"Yere faga\" from her album ''Mogoya''.

In 2018, Allen recorded E.P. ''Tomorrow Comes The Harvest'' with [[Techno]] DJ [[Jeff Mills]].

In 2019, filmmaker Opiyo Okeyo released the documentary film ''Birth of Afrobeat'' about Allen's life in music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://afropop.org/articles/25th-new-york-african-film-festival-launches|title=25th New York African Film Festival Launches|website=[[Afropop Worldwide]]|last=Eyre|first=Banning|date=2018-05-17|accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.okayafrica.com/shorts-program-naija-stories-25th-new-york-african-film-festival-2017|title=The Nigerian Shorts Program at This Year's New York African Film Festival Challenges the Nollywood Status Quo|website=[[OkayAfrica]]|date=2018-05-21|accessdate=2019-06-21}}</ref> The film screened at [[American Black Film Festival]] and won the [[21st Century Fox]] Global Inclusion Award for Emerging Voices at the [[BlackStar Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gravitasventures.com/blackstar-qualifying-award-winners|title=BlackStar Qualifying Award Winners|work=[[Gravitas Ventures]]|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/06/american-black-film-festival-the-black-godfather-spike-lee-abff-hbo-short-film-competition-1202628311|title=American Black Film Festival To Feature ‘The Black Godfather’, Spike Lee, HBO Short Film Finalists And More|work=[[Deadline_Hollywood|Deadline]]|last=Ramos|first=Dino-Ray|date=June 6, 2019|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref>

'''Tony Oladipo Allen''' (born 1940 in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]) is a Nigerian drummer, composer and songwriter who currently{{when|date=February 2020}} lives and works in Paris, France. His career and life story have been documented in his 2013 autobiography ''Tony Allen: Master Drummer of Afrobeat'', co-written with author/musician Michael E. Veal, who previously wrote a comprehensive biography of [[Fela Kuti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/Tony-Allen/|work=[[Duke University Press]]|title=Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>

As drummer and musical director of Fela Anikulapo Kuti's band Africa '70 from 1968 to 1979, Allen was one of the primary co-founders of the genre of [[Afrobeat]] music. Fela once stated that, \"without Tony Allen, there would be no Afrobeat.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/tony-allen-the-veteran-afrobeat-drummer-is-shaking-his-sticks-as-hard-and-as-brilliantly-as-ever-770993.html|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Tony Allen: The veteran Afrobeat drummer is shaking his sticks as hard and as brilliantly as ever|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|date=18 January 2008|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref> He has also been described by [[Brian Eno]] as \"perhaps the greatest drummer who has ever lived.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=27798|publisher=www.allaboutjazz.com|title=Steve Reid: Staying in the Rhythms|first=Ian|last=Patterson|date=24 December 2007|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref>

==Early career==
A self-taught musician, Allen began playing a drum kit at the age of 18, while working as an engineer for a Nigerian radio station. Allen was influenced by music his father listened to [[Jùjú music|Jùjú]], a popular [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] music from the 1940s, but also American jazz, and the growing [[highlife]] scene in Nigeria and Ghana. Allen worked hard to develop a unique voice on the drums, feverishly studying LPs and magazine articles by [[Max Roach]] and [[Art Blakey]], but also revolutionary Ghanaian drummer [[Guy Warren]] (later known as [[Kofi Ghanaba]] – who developed a highly sought-after sound that mixed tribal Ghanaian drumming with bop – working with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Max Roach]]).

Allen was hired by [[Victor Olaiya|\"Sir\" Victor Olaiya]] to play [[claves]] with his highlife band, the Cool Cats. Allen was able to fill the drum set chair when the former Cool Cats drummer left the band. Allen later played with Agu Norris and the Heatwaves, the Nigerian Messengers, and the Melody Makers.

==Fela and Africa '70==
In 1964, [[Fela Kuti]] invited Allen to audition for a jazz-highlife band he was forming. Kuti and Allen had played together as sidemen in the Lagos circuit. Fela complimented Allen's unique sound: \"How come you are the only guy in Nigeria who plays like this – jazz and highlife?\" Thus Allen became an original member of Kuti's \"Koola Lobitos\" highlife-jazz band.

In 1969, following a turbulent and educational trip to the United States, Fela and the newly renamed Africa '70 band developed a new militant African sound, mixing the heavy groove and universal appeal of soul with jazz, highlife, and the [[polyrhythm]]ic template of Yoruba conventions. Allen developed a novel style to complement Fela's new African groove that blended these disparate genres.

Allen recounts how he and Fela wrote in 1970: \"Fela used to write out the parts for all the musicians in the band (Africa '70). I was the only one who originated the music I played. Fela would ask what type of rhythm I wanted to play.… You can tell a good drummer because we… have four limbs… and they are… playing different things… the patterns don't just come from Yoruba… [but] other parts of Nigeria and Africa.\"<ref>Graeme Ewens, ''Africa O-Ye!'', 1991.</ref>

Allen recorded more than 30 albums with Fela and Africa '70. But by the late 1970s, dissension was growing in the ranks of Africa '70. Arguments over royalties/pay and recognition grew in intensity. As inventor of the rhythms that underpinned Afrobeat and musical director, Allen felt especially slighted. Fela stood his ground, stating that he would get the royalties for his songs. Fela did support Allen's three solo recordings: ''Jealousy'' ('75), ''Progress'' ('77), ''No Accommodation For Lagos'' ('79), but by 1979, Allen chose to leave Africa '70, taking many members with him. \"'What makes me decide it's time to go? It's … everything...and (his) carelessness...like he doesn't care, like he doesn't know ...he doesn't feel he's done anything (wrong). And with all the parasites around too.... there were 71 people on tour by now and only 30 working in the band....you got to ask why. Those guys were sapping Fela of his Force, of his Music.' So Tony moved on, once again in search of his own sound.\"

==Afrobeat to Afrofunk==
Allen formed his own group, recording ''No Discrimination'' in 1980, and performing in Lagos until emigrating to London in 1984. Later moving to Paris, Allen recorded with [[King Sunny Adé]], [[Ray Lema]] and [[Manu Dibango]]. Allen recorded ''N.E.P.A.'' in 1985.

Post-Fela, Allen developed a hybrid sound, deconstructing and fusing Afrobeat with [[electronica]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[R&B]], and [[Hip hop music|rap]]. Allen refers to this synthesis as ''afrofunk''.

Allen returned with a much anticipated new project for his 13th release. Recorded live in Lagos, with a full-sized Afrobeat band, ''Lagos No Shaking'' (Lagos is OK) signified Allen's return to roots Afrobeat after forays into avant-garde electronica hybrids. ''Lagos No Shaking'' was released on 13 June 2006.

==Current work==
In 2002, Allen appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Red Hot and Riot]]'' in tribute to [[Fela Kuti]]. Allen appeared alongside [[Res (singer)|Res]], [[Ray Lema]], [[Baaba Maal]], [[Positive Black Soul]] and [[Archie Shepp]] on a track entitled \"No Agreement.\"

He also made an appearance playing the drums in the video for \"[[Once Upon a Time (Air song)|Once Upon a Time]]\" by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] in late 2007.

He has been a featured artist on [[Zap Mama]]'s albums ''Supermoon'' (2007) and ''ReCreation'' (2009), adding his voice to the tracks \"1000 Ways\" and \"African Diamond.\"
Allen also contributed drums on \"People Dansa\", an afrobeat rhythm-fuelled track on the second album of the Brazilian singer Flavia Coelho, released in 2014.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNHZTAXLp5U \"FLAVIA COELHO - Les Musiciens du 2e Album 'Mundo Meu'\".]</ref>

His album entitled ''Secret Agent'' was released in June 2009 by [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit]].<ref>[http://musicfeeds.com.au/music/tony-allen/ Tony Allen – Feature – Musicfeeds.com.au]. Retrieved 15 March 2009.</ref>

Allen has influenced a range of artists across a number of genres. In the single \"[[Music Is My Radar]]\" (2000) [[Blur (band)|Blur]] pay homage to him, and the song ends with [[Damon Albarn]] repeating the phrase \"Tony Allen got me dancing.\"<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2153.html Damon Albarn and Paul Simonon – Features – Music, ''Time Out'' London<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120232959/http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2153.html |date=20 November 2006 }}</ref>

Allen has collaborated with Albarn and [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] in a project called [[Rocket Juice and The Moon]] with an album released in 2012. Albarn collaborated with him again for the single \"Go Back\" in 2014, that is part of the album ''Film of Life'', released in October. 

Allen replaced [[Vladislav Delay]] as drummer for the [[Moritz Von Oswald]] Trio and appeared on their album ''Sounding Lines''.

In 2017, he released ''A Tribute to Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers'', a four-song [[Extended play|EP]] on [[Blue Note Records]] featuring a reworked [[Afrobeat]] version of [[Art Blakey]]'s \"[[Moanin' (song)|Moanin']]\".

In 2017, Allen collaborated with Malian singer [[Oumou Sangaré]] for the track \"Yere faga\" from her album ''Mogoya''.

In its broadest definition Greenville encompasses the area south of the [[West Side, Jersey City|West Side Branch]] of [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] and north of the [[Curries Woods|city line]] with [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], between the [[Upper New York Bay]] and the [[Newark Bay]], and corresponds to the postal area [[zip code]] 07305. 

The central core of Greenville (between [[Bergen Point Plank Road|Garfield Avenue]] and [[West Side Avenue (HBLR station)|West Side Avenue]]) is primarily residential, mostly one and two-family homes and lowrise apartment buildings. Principal corridors include [[Martin Luther King Drive (Hudson County)|MLK Drive]], [[Old Bergen Road]] and [[Danforth Avenue (Hudson County)|Danforth Avenue]]. This part of Greenville is home to the [[Afro-American Historical and Cultural Society Museum]] at the Greenville Branch of the Jersey City Public Library,<ref>[http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/docs/afroam.shtml Afro-American Historical Society Museum]</ref> Greenville Hospital, [[Henry Snyder High School]], and [[New Jersey City University]] all located on the district's main thoroughfare, [[County Route 501 (New Jersey)|Kennedy Boulevard]]. The [[Bayview – New York Bay Cemetery]] is a prominent landmark. The part of Greenville at the city line is known as [[Curries Woods]]. Greenville Hospital closed in 2008<ref>http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2012/08/jersey_city_medical_center_wil_1.html</ref> was renovated and is now part of [[Barnabas Health]] which operates [[Jersey City Medical Center]].

East of [[New Jersey Turnpike]] [[Newark Bay Bridge|Newark Bay]] Extension ([[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|Interstate 78]]) lie the [[Greenville Yard]], an intermodal facility,<ref>[http://www.panynj.gov/.../seaport/.../Regional_rail.html NY Harbor Intermodal Facilities]</ref> [[Port Jersey]], [[Port Liberté, Jersey City|Port Liberté]], (a [[gated community|gated residential community]]), and the Caven Point Section of [[Liberty State Park]]. Slightly further inland and parallel to the route of the Turnpike, was that of the [[Morris Canal]] until abandoned in the 1920s. A small (filled-in) portion of the canal still exists in [[Country Village, Jersey City|Country Village]],<ref>[http://jerseycityonline.com/morris_canal.htm Morris Canal in Jersey City]</ref> a neighborhood near [[Droyer's Point]] and the [[West Side, Jersey City|West Side]]. The [[Jackson Hill, Jersey City|Claremont Section]] straddles Greenville and [[Bergen-Lafayette, Jersey City|Bergen-Lafayette]].

Besides nearby [[Liberty State Park]] other parks include [[Curries Woods|Mercer Park]], Bayside, Columbia, and Fricchione. Cochrane Athletic Field is located near the Hudson Waterfront. Audubon Park is a city square.

==History==

===Minkakwa, Kewan, and Pamrapo===
What became Greenville was the territory of the [[Hackensack (Native Americans)|Hackensack]] and [[Raritan (Native Americans)|Raritan]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]s at the time of European contact in the 17th century. They called the area on [[Bergen Neck]]  ''[[Minkakwa]]'' (alternatively spelled ''Minelque'' and ''Minackqua'') meaning ''a place of good crossing''. This is likely so because it was the most convenient pass between the two bays on either side of the neck. Interpreted as ''place where the coves meet'', in this case where they are closest to each, it describes a spot advantageous for [[portage]].<ref>http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa&cc=moa&sid=95e3f6e828e116b80d4cccd93c806bc1&view=text&rgn=main&idno=AFJ8379.0001.001 page 50</ref> First settled by [[New Netherlander]]s in 1647.<ref>{{cite journal

the Caven Point settlement on the west shore of the [[Upper New York Bay]] between [[Pamrapo]] and [[Communipaw]] was part of [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]], which, upon receiving its municipal charter in 1661 was renamed [[Bergen, New Netherland|Bergen]].

===Bergen, Greenville, Jersey===
[[File:GreenvilleJC1872map.tiff|thumb|Greenville in 1872, one year before consolidation]]
During the British and early American colonial era the area was part of [[Bergen Township, New Jersey (pre-1862)|Bergen Township]]. The 19th century [[Jersey City and Bergen Point Plank Road]] (today's Garfield Avenue) ran through Greenville (from [[Paulus Hook]] to [[Bergen Point]]). Greenville became part of the newly formed Hudson County in 1840. The town grew as a fashionable suburb of New York City.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/05/13/98556154.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=High Fares In Jersey.; Steps Taken By The Residents Of Greenville To Remedy Them | date=May 13, 1881}}</ref>[[Greenville Township, New Jersey|Greenville Township]] was incorporated as a [[township (New Jersey)|township]] by an Act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] on April 14, 1863, from portions of [[Bergen Town, New Jersey|Bergen Town]].<ref name=Story>\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968\", John P.

===20th century===
Greenville was settled by many working class Irish Catholic families, as well as other ethnic groups. The neighborhood's demographics changed dramatically starting in the 1950s, sixties and seventies, with the decline of factories and collapse of the independent railroad lines. Today, the area east of Kennedy Boulevard is mostly African American, while the area west of Kennedy Boulevard is more diverse with a sizeable Filipino population. Greenville also has a sizeable Hispanic and Egyptian population while many of the older Irish residents still remain in the neighborhood.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In its broadest definition Greenville encompasses the area south of the [[West Side, Jersey City|West Side Branch]] of [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] and north of the [[Curries Woods|city line]] with [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], between the [[Upper New York Bay]] and the [[Newark Bay]], and corresponds to the postal area [[zip code]] 07305. 

The central core of Greenville (between [[Bergen Point Plank Road|Garfield Avenue]] and [[West Side Avenue (HBLR station)|West Side Avenue]]) is primarily residential, mostly one and two-family homes and lowrise apartment buildings. Principal corridors include [[Martin Luther King Drive (Hudson County)|MLK Drive]], [[Old Bergen Road]] and [[Danforth Avenue (Hudson County)|Danforth Avenue]]. This part of Greenville is home to the [[Afro-American Historical and Cultural Society Museum]] at the Greenville Branch of the Jersey City Public Library,<ref>[http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/docs/afroam.shtml Afro-American Historical Society Museum]</ref> Greenville Hospital, [[Henry Snyder High School]], and [[New Jersey City University]] all located on the district's main thoroughfare, [[County Route 501 (New Jersey)|Kennedy Boulevard]]. The [[Bayview – New York Bay Cemetery]] is a prominent landmark. The part of Greenville at the city line is known as [[Curries Woods]]. Greenville Hospital closed in 2008<ref>http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2012/08/jersey_city_medical_center_wil_1.html</ref> was renovated and is now part of [[Barnabas Health]] which operates [[Jersey City Medical Center]].

East of [[New Jersey Turnpike]] [[Newark Bay Bridge|Newark Bay]] Extension ([[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|Interstate 78]]) lie the [[Greenville Yard]], an intermodal facility,<ref>[http://www.panynj.gov/.../seaport/.../Regional_rail.html NY Harbor Intermodal Facilities]</ref> [[Port Jersey]], [[Port Liberté, Jersey City|Port Liberté]], (a [[gated community|gated residential community]]), and the Caven Point Section of [[Liberty State Park]]. Slightly further inland and parallel to the route of the Turnpike, was that of the [[Morris Canal]] until abandoned in the 1920s. A small (filled-in) portion of the canal still exists in [[Country Village, Jersey City|Country Village]],<ref>[http://jerseycityonline.com/morris_canal.htm Morris Canal in Jersey City]</ref> a neighborhood near [[Droyer's Point]] and the [[West Side, Jersey City|West Side]]. The [[Jackson Hill, Jersey City|Claremont Section]] straddles Greenville and [[Bergen-Lafayette, Jersey City|Bergen-Lafayette]].

Besides nearby [[Liberty State Park]] other parks include [[Curries Woods|Mercer Park]], Bayside, Columbia, and Fricchione. Cochrane Athletic Field is located near the Hudson Waterfront. Audubon Park is a city square.

==History==

===Minkakwa, Kewan, and Pamrapo===
What became Greenville was the territory of the [[Hackensack (Native Americans)|Hackensack]] and [[Raritan (Native Americans)|Raritan]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]s at the time of European contact in the 17th century. They called the area on [[Bergen Neck]]  ''[[Minkakwa]]'' (alternatively spelled ''Minelque'' and ''Minackqua'') meaning ''a place of good crossing''. This is likely so because it was the most convenient pass between the two bays on either side of the neck. Interpreted as ''place where the coves meet'', in this case where they are closest to each, it describes a spot advantageous for [[portage]].<ref>http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa&cc=moa&sid=95e3f6e828e116b80d4cccd93c806bc1&view=text&rgn=main&idno=AFJ8379.0001.001 page 50</ref> First settled by [[New Netherlander]]s in 1647.<ref>{{cite journal

== Description of the cipher ==
The Simon block cipher is a balanced [[Feistel cipher]] with an ''n''-bit word, and therefore the block length is 2''n''.  The key length is a multiple of ''n'' by 2, 3, or 4, which is the value ''m''.  Therefore, a Simon cipher implementation is denoted as Simon2''n''/''nm''.  For example, Simon64/128 refers to the cipher operating on a 64-bit plaintext block (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;32) that uses a 128-bit key.<ref name=eprintSimon /> The block component of the cipher is uniform between the Simon implementations; however, the key generation logic is dependent on the implementation of 2, 3 or 4 keys.

Simon supports the following combinations of block sizes, key sizes and number of rounds:<ref name=eprintSimon>{{cite conference|title=The Simon and Speck Families Of Lightweight Block Ciphers |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/404.pdf |work=ePrint|accessdate=2016-06-16}}</ref>

=== Description of the key schedule ===
Let <math> S^{j}</math> notate a left [[circular shift]] by <math>j</math> bits.

The key schedule is mathematically described as 

<math>
 k_{i+m} = \\left\\{
\\begin{array}{ll}
         c\\oplus\\left(z_j\\right)_i\\oplus k_i \\oplus\\left(I\\oplus S^{-1}\\right)\\left(S^{-3}k_{i+1}\\right),&m=2\\\\
         c\\oplus\\left(z_j\\right)_i\\oplus k_i \\oplus\\left(I\\oplus S^{-1}\\right)\\left(S^{-3}k_{i+2}\\right),&m=3\\\\
         c\\oplus\\left(z_j\\right)_i\\oplus k_i \\oplus\\left(I\\oplus S^{-1}\\right)\\left(S^{-3}k_{i+3}\\oplus k_{i+1}\\right),&m=4\\\\
\\end{array}\\right.
</math>



The key schedule structure may or may not be balanced.  The key word count of <math>m</math> is used to determine the structure of the key expansion, resulting in a total bit width of  <math>m*n</math>.  The key word expansion consists of a right shift, XOR and a constant sequence, <math>z_x</math>.  The <math>z_x</math> bit operates on the lowest bit of the key word once per round<ref name=ieeeSimonTool />.

==== Description of the constant sequence ====

The constant sequence,  <math>z_x </math>, is created by a Linear Feedback Shift Register ([[LFSR]]).  The logical sequence of bit constants is set by the value of the key and block sizes.   The LFSR is created by a 5-bit field.  The constant bit operates on a key block once per round on the lowest bit in order to add non-key-dependent entropy to the key schedule. The LFSR has different logic for each  <math>z_x</math> sequence; however, the initial condition is the same for encryption.  The initial condition of the LFSR for decryption varies on the round.

== Cryptanalysis ==

The designers claim that Simon, though a \"lightweight\" cipher, is designed to have the full security possible for each block and key size, against standard [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen-plaintext (CPA)]] and [[Chosen-ciphertext attack|chosen-ciphertext (CCA)]] attacks.  Resistance against [[related-key attack]]s was also stated as a goal, though a less crucial one as attacks in that model are not relevant for typical use cases.<ref name=\"design_notes_jan2018\">{{Cite web

As of 2018, no successful attack on full-round Simon of any variant is known.  Due to interest in Simon and Speck, about 70 cryptanalysis papers have been published on them.<ref name=\"design_notes_jan2018\"/>{{rp|10}}  As is typical for [[Block_cipher#Iterated_block_ciphers|iterated ciphers]], reduced-round variants have been successfully attacked.  The best published attacks on Simon in the standard attack model (CPA/CCA with unknown key) are [[differential cryptanalysis]] attacks; these make it through about 70–75% of the rounds of most variants, though these best attacks are only marginally faster than [[Brute-force attacks|brute-force]].<ref name=\"linear_hull\">{{Cite web

Simon has been criticized for having too small a security margin, i.e. too few rounds between the best attacks and the full cipher, in comparison to more conservative ciphers such as [[Salsa20#ChaCha_variant|ChaCha20]].<ref>{{cite tweet

}}</ref>
Ciphers with small security margins are more likely to be broken by future advances in [[cryptanalysis]].  Simon's design team counters that there is a real-world cost to unnecessarily large security margins, especially on lightweight devices, that cryptanalysis during the design phase allowed the number of rounds to be set appropriately, and that they targeted AES's security margin.<ref name=\"design_notes_jan2018\"/>{{rp|17}}

Simon includes a round counter in the [[key schedule]].  The designers state this was included to block [[Slide_attack|slide]] and [[rotational cryptanalysis]] attacks.<ref name=\"design_notes_jan2018\"/>{{rp|16}}  Still, rotational-XOR cryptanalysis has been used to find [[Distinguishing_attack|distinguishers]] against reduced-round versions of related ciphers like Speck.<ref name=\"liu2017_rotational\">{{cite web

One of the authors has said that his research was resource-constrained and that rotational-XOR distinguishers on more rounds are probably possible. The designers also state that Simon was not designed to resist known-key distinguishing attacks (which do not directly compromise the confidentiality of ciphers).<ref name=Beaulieu2013/>{{rp|8}}

The designers state that NSA cryptanalysis found the algorithms to have no weaknesses, and security commensurate with their key lengths.<ref name=\"Beaulieu2015\"/>{{rp|2}}  The design team says that their cryptanalysis included linear and differential cryptanalysis using standard techniques such as Matsui's algorithm and SAT/SMT solvers, though a full list of techniques used is not given.<ref name=design_notes_jan2018/>{{rp|10}}  Simon's designers have been criticized for not providing more details on NSA cryptanalysis of the ciphers.<ref name=\"ashur_linux-crypto\"/>

== Standardization efforts and controversies ==

Initial attempts to standardise Simon and Speck failed to meet [[International Organization for Standardization]] super-majority required by the process and the ciphers were not adopted.<ref>[https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-crypto/msg33291.html Insights an reasons why Speck and Simon have been rejected from ISO standardization]</ref><ref name=\"ashur_linux-crypto\">{{cite web
 |title=[PATCH v2 0/5] crypto: Speck support

 |last=Ashur
 |url=https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-crypto/msg33291.html
}}</ref> Expert delegates to the ISO from several countries including Germany, Japan and Israel opposed the efforts by the NSA to standardise the Simon and [[Speck (cipher)|Speck]] ciphers, citing concerns that the NSA is pushing for their standardisation with knowledge of exploitable weaknesses in the ciphers. The position was based on partial evidence of weaknesses in the ciphers, lack of clear need for standardisation of the new ciphers, and the NSA's previous involvement in the creation and promotion of the backdoored [[Dual_EC_DRBG]] cryptographic algorithm.<ref>{{cite news|title=Distrustful U.S. allies force spy agency to back down in encryption fight|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-standards-insight/distrustful-u-s-allies-force-spy-agency-to-back-down-in-encryption-fight-idUSKCN1BW0GV|newspaper=Reuters|date=2017-09-21}}</ref>

In response to concerns, the NSA stated that more than 70 security analysis papers from some of the world's leading cryptographers support NSA's conclusion that the algorithms are secure and NSA affirmed that it is not aware of any cryptanalytic techniques that would allow them or anyone else to exploit Simon or Speck.

After initial attempts to standardise the ciphers failed, the ISO standardised Simon and Speck in other working groups. As of October 2018, the Simon and Speck ciphers have been standardized by ISO as a part of the RFID air interface standard, International Standard ISO/29167-21 (for Simon) and International Standard ISO/29167-22 (for Speck), making them available for use by commercial entities.

For example, Simon64/128 refers to the cipher operating on a 64-bit plaintext block (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;32) that uses a 128-bit key.<ref name=eprintSimon /> The block component of the cipher is uniform between the Simon implementations; however, the key generation logic is dependent on the implementation of 2, 3 or 4 keys.

Simon supports the following combinations of block sizes, key sizes and number of rounds:<ref name=eprintSimon>{{cite conference|title=The Simon and Speck Families Of Lightweight Block Ciphers |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/404.pdf |work=ePrint|accessdate=2016-06-16}}</ref>

=== Description of the key schedule ===
Let <math> S^{j}</math> notate a left [[circular shift]] by <math>j</math> bits.

The key schedule is mathematically described as 

<math>
 k_{i+m} = \\left\\{
\\begin{array}{ll}
         c\\oplus\\left(z_j\\right)_i\\oplus k_i \\oplus\\left(I\\oplus S^{-1}\\right)\\left(S^{-3}k_{i+1}\\right),&m=2\\\\
         c\\oplus\\left(z_j\\right)_i\\oplus k_i \\oplus\\left(I\\oplus S^{-1}\\right)\\left(S^{-3}k_{i+2}\\right),&m=3\\\\
         c\\oplus\\left(z_j\\right)_i\\oplus k_i \\oplus\\left(I\\oplus S^{-1}\\right)\\left(S^{-3}k_{i+3}\\oplus k_{i+1}\\right),&m=4\\\\
\\end{array}\\right.
</math>



The key schedule structure may or may not be balanced.  The key word count of <math>m</math> is used to determine the structure of the key expansion, resulting in a total bit width of  <math>m*n</math>.  The key word expansion consists of a right shift, XOR and a constant sequence, <math>z_x</math>.  The <math>z_x</math> bit operates on the lowest bit of the key word once per round<ref name=ieeeSimonTool />.

==== Description of the constant sequence ====

The constant sequence,  <math>z_x </math>, is created by a Linear Feedback Shift Register ([[LFSR]]).  The logical sequence of bit constants is set by the value of the key and block sizes.   The LFSR is created by a 5-bit field.  The constant bit operates on a key block once per round on the lowest bit in order to add non-key-dependent entropy to the key schedule. The LFSR has different logic for each  <math>z_x</math> sequence; however, the initial condition is the same for encryption.  The initial condition of the LFSR for decryption varies on the round.

== Cryptanalysis ==

The designers claim that Simon, though a \"lightweight\" cipher, is designed to have the full security possible for each block and key size, against standard [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen-plaintext (CPA)]] and [[Chosen-ciphertext attack|chosen-ciphertext (CCA)]] attacks.  Resistance against [[related-key attack]]s was also stated as a goal, though a less crucial one as attacks in that model are not relevant for typical use cases.<ref name=\"design_notes_jan2018\">{{Cite web

As of 2018, no successful attack on full-round Simon of any variant is known.  Due to interest in Simon and Speck, about 70 cryptanalysis papers have been published on them.<ref name=\"design_notes_jan2018\"/>{{rp|10}}  As is typical for [[Block_cipher#Iterated_block_ciphers|iterated ciphers]], reduced-round variants have been successfully attacked.  The best published attacks on Simon in the standard attack model (CPA/CCA with unknown key) are [[differential cryptanalysis]] attacks; these make it through about 70–75% of the rounds of most variants, though these best attacks are only marginally faster than [[Brute-force attacks|brute-force]].<ref name=\"linear_hull\">{{Cite web

Simon has been criticized for having too small a security margin, i.e. too few rounds between the best attacks and the full cipher, in comparison to more conservative ciphers such as [[Salsa20#ChaCha_variant|ChaCha20]].<ref>{{cite tweet

}}</ref>
Ciphers with small security margins are more likely to be broken by future advances in [[cryptanalysis]].  Simon's design team counters that there is a real-world cost to unnecessarily large security margins, especially on lightweight devices, that cryptanalysis during the design phase allowed the number of rounds to be set appropriately, and that they targeted AES's security margin.<ref name=\"design_notes_jan2018\"/>{{rp|17}}

Simon includes a round counter in the [[key schedule]].  The designers state this was included to block [[Slide_attack|slide]] and [[rotational cryptanalysis]] attacks.<ref name=\"design_notes_jan2018\"/>{{rp|16}}  Still, rotational-XOR cryptanalysis has been used to find [[Distinguishing_attack|distinguishers]] against reduced-round versions of related ciphers like Speck.<ref name=\"liu2017_rotational\">{{cite web

}}</ref> Though the authors don't describe standard key-recovery attacks based on their distinguishers, their best distinguishers on Simon32 and Simon48 in the known-key distinguishing attack model for certain [[weak key]] classes make it through slightly more rounds than the best differential distinguishers.  One of the authors has said that his research was resource-constrained and that rotational-XOR distinguishers on more rounds are probably possible. The designers also state that Simon was not designed to resist known-key distinguishing attacks (which do not directly compromise the confidentiality of ciphers).<ref name=Beaulieu2013/>{{rp|8}}

The designers state that NSA cryptanalysis found the algorithms to have no weaknesses, and security commensurate with their key lengths.<ref name=\"Beaulieu2015\"/>{{rp|2}}  The design team says that their cryptanalysis included linear and differential cryptanalysis using standard techniques such as Matsui's algorithm and SAT/SMT solvers, though a full list of techniques used is not given.<ref name=design_notes_jan2018/>{{rp|10}}  Simon's designers have been criticized for not providing more details on NSA cryptanalysis of the ciphers.<ref name=\"ashur_linux-crypto\"/>

The NSA has approved Simon128/256 and Speck128/256 for use in U.S. National Security Systems, though AES-256 is still recommended for non-constrained applications.<ref name=\"Algorithms-IA-Needs-2016\">{{cite web

== Standardization efforts and controversies ==

Initial attempts to standardise Simon and Speck failed to meet [[International Organization for Standardization]] super-majority required by the process and the ciphers were not adopted.<ref>[https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-crypto/msg33291.html Insights an reasons why Speck and Simon have been rejected from ISO standardization]</ref><ref name=\"ashur_linux-crypto\">{{cite web
 |title=[PATCH v2 0/5] crypto: Speck support
 |first=Tomer
 |last=Ashur
 |url=https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-crypto/msg33291.html
}}</ref> Expert delegates to the ISO from several countries including Germany, Japan and Israel opposed the efforts by the NSA to standardise the Simon and [[Speck (cipher)|Speck]] ciphers, citing concerns that the NSA is pushing for their standardisation with knowledge of exploitable weaknesses in the ciphers. The position was based on partial evidence of weaknesses in the ciphers, lack of clear need for standardisation of the new ciphers, and the NSA's previous involvement in the creation and promotion of the backdoored [[Dual_EC_DRBG]] cryptographic algorithm.<ref>{{cite news|title=Distrustful U.S. allies force spy agency to back down in encryption fight|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-standards-insight/distrustful-u-s-allies-force-spy-agency-to-back-down-in-encryption-fight-idUSKCN1BW0GV|newspaper=Reuters|date=2017-09-21}}</ref>

In response to concerns, the NSA stated that more than 70 security analysis papers from some of the world's leading cryptographers support NSA's conclusion that the algorithms are secure and NSA affirmed that it is not aware of any cryptanalytic techniques that would allow them or anyone else to exploit Simon or Speck.

After initial attempts to standardise the ciphers failed, the ISO standardised Simon and Speck in other working groups. As of October 2018, the Simon and Speck ciphers have been standardized by ISO as a part of the RFID air interface standard, International Standard ISO/29167-21 (for Simon) and International Standard ISO/29167-22 (for Speck), making them available for use by commercial entities.

'''''Raabta''''' ({{translation|Connection}}) is a 2017 Indian [[Hindi-language]] [[Action film|action]] [[romance film]] directed by [[Dinesh Vijan]] in his directorial debut and co-produced by Vijan, [[Homi Adajania]], [[Bhushan Kumar]]. It stars [[Kriti Sanon]] and [[Sushant Singh Rajput]], with [[Jim Sarbh]], [[Rajkumar Yadav]] and [[Varun Sharma]] in supporting roles. The story is based on the concept of [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] [[star-crossed lovers]]. ''Raabta'' released on 9 June 2017 at a budget of {{INR|450 million}}. It underperformed at the box office, grossing {{INR|398 million}} worldwide, and was termed a \"disaster\" by [[Box Office India]].

==Plot==
Shiv Kakkar ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) is a young man from [[Amritsar]] who gets a lucrative opportunity to work in [[Budapest]] for a job as a banker, and lives with his friend, Radha ([[Varun Sharma]]). Shiv is shown to have been a fun-loving womanizer back home and continues this behaviour in Budapest. Saira Singh ([[Kriti Sanon]]), a young woman, is haunted by mysterious nightmares of drowning to death. She lives by herself in Budapest and works as a chocolatier. Shiv happens to stumble upon Saira's shop while on a date with a woman, but finds himself deeply attracted to Saira. Though she initially rejects his advances, she eventually succumbs and sleeps with Shiv, revealing the next day that she actually has a boyfriend and what happened with Shiv was a mistake. Unwilling to let go of their connection, Shiv interrupts Saira's date with her boyfriend Manav ([[Vikas Verma]]) and shows her that she would rather be with him than with her boyfriend. Manav breaks up with her, and Shiv and Saira start spending time together, growing close. One night, they go to a club with Radha, where they happen to meet an eccentric psychic who knows about Saira's nightmares and tells her that the events of her previous life will repeat themselves, and only she can fix them. Saira tearfully reveals to Shiv that she has a fear of water because her parents drowned after a car accident when she was two years old.

While trying to test their love a final time, Shiv and Saira make a pact. Shiv flirts with multiple women, but Saira finds herself strongly drawn to a young businessman Zakir \"Zack\" Merchant ([[Jim Sarbh]]). Shiv reveals he has to leave for a business trip for a week and he and Saira decide to see how they feel after a week's separation. If they still feel strongly about each other, they will start considering marriage. During Shiv's absence, Saira gets to know Zakir better and confides in him about her nightmares. During one of their dinners, Zakir drugs Saira and kidnaps her.

Saira wakes up and finds herself trapped in Zakir's isolated mansion on an island off the coast. She demands him to let her go, but he refuses, saying that he spent his whole life looking for her. He explains that he was madly in love with her in a previous life but his love remained unrequited. He refuses to let go of her again. When she does not believe him, he shows her a collection of uncannily accurate paintings he made of her at various ages and says she will find the explanation for her nightmares. Thinking he is crazy, she attempts to escape but ends up falling into the ocean, which triggers the memories of her previous life.

Three hundred years ago, Saira was warrior princess Saiba. She had a childhood best friend Kabir ([[Jim Sarbh]]), a fellow warrior from her tribe who was in love with her. Their kingdom was threatened by the Muraakis, led by a wise, old Rajput ruler Muwwaqqil ([[Rajkummar Rao]]). Qaabir is severely wounded by the fierce warrior Jilaan ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]), who gives Qaabir an ultimatum to surrender. Saiba challenges Jilaan, and they find themselves attracted to each other. Saiba accepts defeat, surrendering the kingdom to the Muraakis and herself to Jilaan. Qaabir attempts to take Saiba back, but she reveals that she and Jilaan are in love. On their wedding night, a [[comet]] falls and Muwwaqqil realizes that this will be a fateful night. Qaabir ambushes Jilaan and Saiba, and murders Jilaan by wounding him and throws him in the ocean. Saiba jumps into the ocean to save him, but to no avail. Heartbroken on seeing Jilaan die, Saiba who is also heartbroken decides to drown too. On seeing Saiba dead, Qaabir slits his own throat, killing himself. Muwwaqqil forebodes that these events will repeat.

However, this time, when Shiv shows up, Saira decides to fight back against Zakir. When their previous lives' events repeat, Zakir throwing Shiv into the ocean, Shiv drags Zakir down with him and Zakir dies. Saira jumps into the water and is able to save Shiv.

The film ends with Shiv humorously telling their children to not to believe Saira if she tells them any far-fetched stories about reincarnation, implying that he is still oblivious to the events of their previous lives.

===Casting===

=== Controversy ===
''Raabta'' makers received a legal notice over plagiarism from ''[[Magadheera]]'' [[Film producer|producer]] [[Allu Aravind]]. ''Raabta'' producers offered to show Arvind the film.

==Critical reception==
[[Bollywood Hungama]] rated it 3.5/5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/raabta/critic-review/|title=Raabta Review - Bollywood Hungama|first=Bollywood|last=Hungama|website=Bollywood Hungama|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref> [[The Times of India]] rated it 3.5/5, writing \"If sparks flew more organically, it would have been easier to make a connection with this epic tale of love.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/raabta/movie-review/59039834.cms|title=Raabta Review {2.5/5}: If sparks flew more organically, it would have been easier to make a connection with this epic tale of love|website=The Times of India|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref> [[Koimoi]] rated it 2/5, writing \"Raabta is a confused film that never establishes a firm balance between its crossover love stories.\" Shubhra Gupta from [[The Indian Express]] rated it 1.5/5, writing \"Some questions arise after Raabta has been seen, chief amongst which is one that comes up every time Bollywood tries, and fails, to do a cracking romance. Why is Bollywood incapable of pulling off a full-length film with a pair of lovers connecting, pulling apart, coming together?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/raabta-movie-review-sushant-singh-rajput-kriti-sanon-star-rating-4694804/|title=Raabta movie review: Sushant Singh Rajput, Kriti Sanon film is a rom con|date=9 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref> [[India Today]] rated it 1/5, calling it \"A comet-crossed romance which never hits the target.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.indiatoday.in/story/raabta-movie-review-sushant-singh-rajput-kriti-sanon/1/974830.html|title=Raabta movie review: A comet-crossed romance which never hits the target|website=m.indiatoday.in|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref>

Critic [[Rajeev Masand]] gave the movie one out of five, stating, \"This is a movie so singularly pointless, you have to wonder how the writers and the director tricked the financiers into thinking there was a story here worth telling, and why the actors preferred going to shoot every morning instead of sleeping longer hours. This is the kind of film that film critics must endure so you don’t have to. Even [[Denzel Washington]] couldn't save this film. I’m going with one out of five.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rajeevmasand.com/reviews/our-films/raabish/ |title=Raabish! |publisher=Rajeev Masand|date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

'''''Raabta''''' ({{translation|Connection}}) is a 2017 Indian [[Hindi-language]] [[Action film|action]] [[romance film]] directed by [[Dinesh Vijan]] in his directorial debut and co-produced by Vijan, [[Homi Adajania]], [[Bhushan Kumar]]. It stars [[Kriti Sanon]] and [[Sushant Singh Rajput]], with [[Jim Sarbh]], [[Rajkumar Yadav]] and [[Varun Sharma]] in supporting roles. The story is based on the concept of [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] [[star-crossed lovers]]. ''Raabta'' released on 9 June 2017 at a budget of {{INR|450 million}}. It underperformed at the box office, grossing {{INR|398 million}} worldwide, and was termed a \"disaster\" by [[Box Office India]].

==Plot==
Shiv Kakkar ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) is a young man from [[Amritsar]] who gets a lucrative opportunity to work in [[Budapest]] for a job as a banker, and lives with his friend, Radha ([[Varun Sharma]]). Shiv is shown to have been a fun-loving womanizer back home and continues this behaviour in Budapest. Saira Singh ([[Kriti Sanon]]), a young woman, is haunted by mysterious nightmares of drowning to death. She lives by herself in Budapest and works as a chocolatier. Shiv happens to stumble upon Saira's shop while on a date with a woman, but finds himself deeply attracted to Saira. Though she initially rejects his advances, she eventually succumbs and sleeps with Shiv, revealing the next day that she actually has a boyfriend and what happened with Shiv was a mistake. Unwilling to let go of their connection, Shiv interrupts Saira's date with her boyfriend Manav ([[Vikas Verma]]) and shows her that she would rather be with him than with her boyfriend. Manav breaks up with her, and Shiv and Saira start spending time together, growing close. One night, they go to a club with Radha, where they happen to meet an eccentric psychic who knows about Saira's nightmares and tells her that the events of her previous life will repeat themselves, and only she can fix them. Saira tearfully reveals to Shiv that she has a fear of water because her parents drowned after a car accident when she was two years old.

While trying to test their love a final time, Shiv and Saira make a pact. Shiv flirts with multiple women, but Saira finds herself strongly drawn to a young businessman Zakir \"Zack\" Merchant ([[Jim Sarbh]]). Shiv reveals he has to leave for a business trip for a week and he and Saira decide to see how they feel after a week's separation. If they still feel strongly about each other, they will start considering marriage. During Shiv's absence, Saira gets to know Zakir better and confides in him about her nightmares. During one of their dinners, Zakir drugs Saira and kidnaps her.

Saira wakes up and finds herself trapped in Zakir's isolated mansion on an island off the coast. She demands him to let her go, but he refuses, saying that he spent his whole life looking for her. He explains that he was madly in love with her in a previous life but his love remained unrequited. He refuses to let go of her again. When she does not believe him, he shows her a collection of uncannily accurate paintings he made of her at various ages and says she will find the explanation for her nightmares. Thinking he is crazy, she attempts to escape but ends up falling into the ocean, which triggers the memories of her previous life.

Three hundred years ago, Saira was warrior princess Saiba. She had a childhood best friend Kabir ([[Jim Sarbh]]), a fellow warrior from her tribe who was in love with her. Their kingdom was threatened by the Muraakis, led by a wise, old Rajput ruler Muwwaqqil ([[Rajkummar Rao]]). Qaabir is severely wounded by the fierce warrior Jilaan ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]), who gives Qaabir an ultimatum to surrender. Saiba challenges Jilaan, and they find themselves attracted to each other. Saiba accepts defeat, surrendering the kingdom to the Muraakis and herself to Jilaan. Qaabir attempts to take Saiba back, but she reveals that she and Jilaan are in love. On their wedding night, a [[comet]] falls and Muwwaqqil realizes that this will be a fateful night. Qaabir ambushes Jilaan and Saiba, and murders Jilaan by wounding him and throws him in the ocean. Saiba jumps into the ocean to save him, but to no avail. Heartbroken on seeing Jilaan die, Saiba who is also heartbroken decides to drown too. On seeing Saiba dead, Qaabir slits his own throat, killing himself. Muwwaqqil forebodes that these events will repeat.

However, this time, when Shiv shows up, Saira decides to fight back against Zakir. When their previous lives' events repeat, Zakir throwing Shiv into the ocean, Shiv drags Zakir down with him and Zakir dies. Saira jumps into the water and is able to save Shiv.

The film ends with Shiv humorously telling their children to not to believe Saira if she tells them any far-fetched stories about reincarnation, implying that he is still oblivious to the events of their previous lives.

''Raabta'' makers received a legal notice over plagiarism from ''[[Magadheera]]'' [[Film producer|producer]] [[Allu Aravind]]. ''Raabta'' producers offered to show Arvind the film.

Why is Bollywood incapable of pulling off a full-length film with a pair of lovers connecting, pulling apart, coming together?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/raabta-movie-review-sushant-singh-rajput-kriti-sanon-star-rating-4694804/|title=Raabta movie review: Sushant Singh Rajput, Kriti Sanon film is a rom con|date=9 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref> [[India Today]] rated it 1/5, calling it \"A comet-crossed romance which never hits the target.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.indiatoday.in/story/raabta-movie-review-sushant-singh-rajput-kriti-sanon/1/974830.html|title=Raabta movie review: A comet-crossed romance which never hits the target|website=m.indiatoday.in|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref>

Critic [[Rajeev Masand]] gave the movie one out of five, stating, \"This is a movie so singularly pointless, you have to wonder how the writers and the director tricked the financiers into thinking there was a story here worth telling, and why the actors preferred going to shoot every morning instead of sleeping longer hours. This is the kind of film that film critics must endure so you don’t have to. Even [[Denzel Washington]] couldn't save this film. I’m going with one out of five.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rajeevmasand.com/reviews/our-films/raabish/ |title=Raabish! |publisher=Rajeev Masand|date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

'''Dr. No''' is the nickname given to a suspected American [[serial killer]] thought to be responsible for the murders of at least nine women and girls in [[Ohio]], between 1981 and 2004. As victims, he chose prostitutes working in parking lots and truck stops located alongside [[Interstate 71|I-71]]. In addition, there are suspicions that he committed three similar killings in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Illinois]] and [[Pennsylvania]], committed between 1986 and 1988.

== Murders ==

[[File:Buckskin Girl.jpg|thumb|[[forensic facial reconstruction|Forensic rendering]] of Marcia King, nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl,\" who remained unidentified between 1981 and 2018.]]

Three of the victims worked at \"Union 76\" truck stop in [[Austintown, Ohio|Austintown]], east of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and west of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], which is the largest in the state, making the investigation suspect that the killer is a truck driver. Most of them were found without their underwear and shoes. The killings began in 1981, when the corpse of a young woman was found in [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami County]] on April 24th. After a forensic examination, it was determined that the woman died from strangulation, having received a head injury beforehand. At the time of her discovery, no personal belongings or documents were found on the deceased, making her identification difficult. She was nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl\", from a tasseled bucksin poncho she was when found. In 2018, the victim was finally identified as [[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas/story?id=54417156|title=Body of 'Buckskin Girl' found in Ohio in 1981 identified as Arkansas woman. 12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/cold-case-homicide-victim-identified-after-37-years/1116096993/|title=Cold case homicide victim identified after 37 years. Apr 12, 2018}}</ref>

The next victim was 25-year-old Marcia Matthews, whose body was found by a trucker one mile away from the Union 76 truck stop. She had died from a traumatic brain injury, sustained after a beating with a blunt object. On July 20, 1986, the body of 23-year-old prostitute Shirley Dean Taylor was discovered, who was also beaten and strangled before death. Before her disappearance, she was seen at Union 76, where, according to witness reports, she went to meet a regular client nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whose identity was never established. Her body was discovered a few miles from the place of disappearance, with her underwear and shoes missing. In December 1986, 18-year-old prostitute April Barnett also went missing from the Union 76 truck stop, with her body found only a few days later 70 miles from Austintown. Like the previous cases, the victim was beaten and died from strangulation, with some of her clothes missing as well. A few days after, 28-year-old prostitute Jill Allen was found murdered in Illinois, near the [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. Despite the fact that she had been found in another state, she was also included as a victim, as her killer had the exact same [[modus operandi]]. Allen had also been beaten and asphyxiated, with strangulation marks found on her body. Her shoes, bra and underwear were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/05/mysterious-dr-no-may-have-been-serial-killer-responsible-for-rash-of-1980s-murders/|title=Mysterious “Dr. No” May Have Been Serial Killer Responsible for Rash of 1980s Murders. May 24, 2017}}</ref>

The next victim of the serial killer was 27-year-old Anne-Marie Patterson, who went missing on February 7, 1987, from Union 76. Her semi-decomposed body was found 40 days later, 250 miles away from Austintown, near [[Cincinnati]]. A week before the disappearance, Patterson had been arrested by police. At the police station, she gave information about a murder suspect and described his car. During the investigation, law enforcement agencies discovered that Patterson had made an appointment via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] with the client, nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whom she characterized extremely negatively, and then disappeared. In connection with this, the police and later the media coined the nickname for the unidentified criminal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/04/01/I-71-murder-victim-talked-with-police-before-disappearing/6359544251600/|title=I-71 murder victim talked with police before disappearing.

On August 10 that same year, another victim's body was found in [[Englewood, Ohio|Englewood]]. The victim's jeans and underwear were lowered to the ankles, while the upper part of the clothes were missing. According to the nature of grass depressions and tire tracks located at the scene, forensic experts determined that the killer threw the victim's corpse out of his car. An autopsy revealed that the victim was a young woman, aged 20-25, and had died from strangulation. Despite the abundance of tattoos on her body, as well as jewelry the offender had not stolen, she remained unidentified until 2010. The victim was identified as Paula Beverly Davis, 21, of [[Kansas City, Kansas]], after relatives recognized her tattoos pictured on her unidentified persons listing in the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Missing Person Case Closed after 22 Years Thanks to Justice Department & ABC Television |url=https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/missing-person-case-closed-after-22-years-thanks-justice-department-abc-television |website=www.justice.gov |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] archives |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en |date=25 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"lasting\">{{cite news |last1=Lowe |first1=Peggy |title=Sister's Disappearance Had Lasting Effect On Kansas City Family |url=https://www.kcur.org/post/sisters-disappearance-had-lasting-effect-kansas-city-family#stream/0 |accessdate=13 April 2020 |work=www.kcur.org |date=8 September 2015 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"big sister\">{{cite news |last1=Lowe |first1=Peggy |title=Kansas City Women Find Missing Big Sister — 22 Years Later |url=https://www.kcur.org/post/kansas-city-women-find-missing-big-sister-22-years-later#stream/0 |accessdate=13 April 2020 |work=www.kcur.org |date=8 September 2015 |language=en}}</ref> On November 22, the body of 19-year-old Lamonica Cole was discovered at a truck stop in [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania]]. Despite the fact that the truck stop was located on another interstate, Cole was included in the list of potential victims, because she had died from strangulation, was a native of Ohio and some of her things had been recovered, while others not. During the investigation, Lamonica's pimp, 24-year-old Derrick Mims, told police that the alleged killer with whom Cole left on the day of her disappearance was travelling in a blue lorry with white stripes.

According to investigators, another murder was committed on March 29, 1988, this time in New York. The murder was 31-year-old Terri Roark, whose body was found on one of the bridges passing through the [[Mohawk River]]. The medical examiner found that the woman died from a traumatic brain injury that occurred during a beating with a blunt object several hours before the discovery of her body. Some of Roark's clothing, including underwear and shoes, were never found, on the basis of which she was included in the list potential victims of Dr. No. On April 19, 1990, the corpse of another female was found near a truck stop on the I-70. Most of her clothes were missing, but this time, her panties remained. An autopsy concluded that she had died from a traumatic brain injury resulting from a beating, and had had sexual intercourse 12-24 hours before her death. With these conclusions, the investigators suggested that the victim was a prostitute and had fallen victim to the serial killer. Despite multiple attempts to identify her, she remained unidentified (with the placeholder name \"Jane Doe 2\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HkFHPBAgLiMJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/body-trail-prompts-fear-of-serial-killer---1991-dispatch-investigation+&cd=3&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru|title=Body trail prompts fear of serial killer.

== Investigation ==
During the course of the investigation, the police interviewed hundreds of prostitutes, pimps, service station employees and truck drivers, in an attempt to find witnesses and identify the offender.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19910315&id=goQcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8mMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5900,7506894&hl=en|title=Investigators of 10 killings to meet.

===Suspects===
In April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards. Alvin Wilson was tested for any involvement, but no evidence proving his guilt could be found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-04-23-9104230376-story.html|title=LAKE MAN A SUSPECT IN SERIAL MURDERS OHIO INVESTIGATORS COMING TO SEARCH TRUCKS.

In June 1994, a 36-year-old trucker from Ohio, James Robert Cruz, Jr., was convicted in the March 1993 murder of 17-year-old Dawn Marie Birnbaum in [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]], whose dumped body was found along the [[Interstate 80|I-80]]. The girl's body was discovered a few days after her death. Since most of her clothes were missing, Cruz was considered a possible suspect in the Ohio killings.

In 1995, 28-year-old Sean Patrick Goble, a trucker from [[North Carolina]], who had admitted to killing two prostitutes in [[Tennessee]] in April of that year, was among the suspects for the murder of a North Carolina woman in early 1995. In accordance with his occupation, Goble traveled to a several dozen states across the country, where cases of disappearances and murders of prostitutes along interstate highways were recorded. Following his arrest, Goble was investigated for murders in at least 10 states. Nevertheless, he was cleared of suspicion when it came to being the elusive \"Dr. No\", since at the time of the first murder in 1981, he was still in high school, and in the mid-1980s, when the majority of the killings took place, he was serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was stationed outside Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950617/06170345.htm|title=DETECTIVES CREDIT LUCK IN HIGHWAY KILLINGS CASE.

In November 2005, on the basis of [[DNA profiling]], authorities arrested 46-year-old Dellmus Charles Colvin, a truck driver who killed five prostitutes in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]. Colvin later admitted to killing at least two others in [[New Jersey]], but vehemently denied any involvement in the Dr. No murders during the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2011/03/truck_driver_convicted_of_kil.html|title=Truck driver convicted of killing six prostitutes in Ohio to face charges in slaying of N.J. woman 24 years ago.

In early 2019, 49-year-old Samuel Legg was arrested in [[Arizona]]. Using DNA profiling, law enforcement agencies were able to prove his guilt in the four murders in Ohio and Illinois, the first of which he committed at age 20 in 1989. His initial arrested was thanks due to a match for an unsolved 1997 rape of a minor in [[Medina County, Ohio]], where he was extradited to stand trial. In the fall of 1990, Legg was already in the police's sights, as he was a suspect in the murder of his stepdaughter, 14-year-old Angela Hicks, in [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]], but as there wasn't enough evidence, he wasn't charged. Although the likelihood of him being \"Dr. No\" is questionable, since Legg was a teenager in the mid-1980s, it has been suggested that he could be responsible for some of the murders. If this theory is true, it links to another theory which proposes that the serial murders were the doing of several different individuals.<ref>[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uYyZljc1cnoJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/arizona-man-charged-in-1992-slaying-linked-by-dna-to-ohio-truck-stop-killings+&cd=15&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru Arizona man charged in 1992 slaying linked by DNA to Ohio truck-stop killings.

'''Dr. No''' is the nickname given to a suspected American [[serial killer]] thought to be responsible for the murders of at least nine women and girls in [[Ohio]], between 1981 and 2004. As victims, he chose prostitutes working in parking lots and truck stops located alongside [[Interstate 71|I-71]]. In addition, there are suspicions that he committed three similar killings in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Illinois]] and [[Pennsylvania]], committed between 1986 and 1988.

== Murders ==

[[File:Buckskin Girl.jpg|thumb|[[forensic facial reconstruction|Forensic rendering]] of Marcia King, nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl,\" who remained unidentified between 1981 and 2018.]]

Three of the victims worked at \"Union 76\" truck stop in [[Austintown, Ohio|Austintown]], east of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and west of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], which is the largest in the state, making the investigation suspect that the killer is a truck driver. Most of them were found without their underwear and shoes. The killings began in 1981, when the corpse of a young woman was found in [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami County]] on April 24th. After a forensic examination, it was determined that the woman died from strangulation, having received a head injury beforehand. At the time of her discovery, no personal belongings or documents were found on the deceased, making her identification difficult. She was nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl\", from a tasseled bucksin poncho she was when found. In 2018, the victim was finally identified as [[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas/story?id=54417156|title=Body of 'Buckskin Girl' found in Ohio in 1981 identified as Arkansas woman. 12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/cold-case-homicide-victim-identified-after-37-years/1116096993/|title=Cold case homicide victim identified after 37 years.

The next victim was 25-year-old Marcia Matthews, whose body was found by a trucker one mile away from the Union 76 truck stop. She had died from a traumatic brain injury, sustained after a beating with a blunt object. On July 20, 1986, the body of 23-year-old prostitute Shirley Dean Taylor was discovered, who was also beaten and strangled before death. Before her disappearance, she was seen at Union 76, where, according to witness reports, she went to meet a regular client nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whose identity was never established. Her body was discovered a few miles from the place of disappearance, with her underwear and shoes missing. In December 1986, 18-year-old prostitute April Barnett also went missing from the Union 76 truck stop, with her body found only a few days later 70 miles from Austintown. Like the previous cases, the victim was beaten and died from strangulation, with some of her clothes missing as well. A few days after, 28-year-old prostitute Jill Allen was found murdered in Illinois, near the [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. Despite the fact that she had been found in another state, she was also included as a victim, as her killer had the exact same [[modus operandi]]. Allen had also been beaten and asphyxiated, with strangulation marks found on her body. Her shoes, bra and underwear were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/05/mysterious-dr-no-may-have-been-serial-killer-responsible-for-rash-of-1980s-murders/|title=Mysterious “Dr. No” May Have Been Serial Killer Responsible for Rash of 1980s Murders. May 24, 2017}}</ref>

The next victim of the serial killer was 27-year-old Anne-Marie Patterson, who went missing on February 7, 1987, from Union 76. Her semi-decomposed body was found 40 days later, 250 miles away from Austintown, near [[Cincinnati]]. A week before the disappearance, Patterson had been arrested by police. At the police station, she gave information about a murder suspect and described his car. During the investigation, law enforcement agencies discovered that Patterson had made an appointment via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] with the client, nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whom she characterized extremely negatively, and then disappeared. In connection with this, the police and later the media coined the nickname for the unidentified criminal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/04/01/I-71-murder-victim-talked-with-police-before-disappearing/6359544251600/|title=I-71 murder victim talked with police before disappearing.

On August 10 that same year, another victim's body was found in [[Englewood, Ohio|Englewood]]. The victim's jeans and underwear were lowered to the ankles, while the upper part of the clothes were missing. According to the nature of grass depressions and tire tracks located at the scene, forensic experts determined that the killer threw the victim's corpse out of his car. An autopsy revealed that the victim was a young woman, aged 20-25, and had died from strangulation. Despite the abundance of tattoos on her body, as well as jewelry the offender had not stolen, she remained unidentified until 2010. The victim was identified as Paula Beverly Davis, 21, of [[Kansas City, Kansas]], after relatives recognized her tattoos pictured on her unidentified persons listing in the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Missing Person Case Closed after 22 Years Thanks to Justice Department & ABC Television |url=https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/missing-person-case-closed-after-22-years-thanks-justice-department-abc-television |website=www.justice.gov |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] archives |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en |date=25 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"lasting\">{{cite news |last1=Lowe |first1=Peggy |title=Sister's Disappearance Had Lasting Effect On Kansas City Family |url=https://www.kcur.org/post/sisters-disappearance-had-lasting-effect-kansas-city-family#stream/0 |accessdate=13 April 2020 |work=www.kcur.org |date=8 September 2015 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"big sister\">{{cite news |last1=Lowe |first1=Peggy |title=Kansas City Women Find Missing Big Sister — 22 Years Later |url=https://www.kcur.org/post/kansas-city-women-find-missing-big-sister-22-years-later#stream/0 |accessdate=13 April 2020 |work=www.kcur.org |date=8 September 2015 |language=en}}</ref> On November 22, the body of 19-year-old Lamonica Cole was discovered at a truck stop in [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania]]. Despite the fact that the truck stop was located on another interstate, Cole was included in the list of potential victims, because she had died from strangulation, was a native of Ohio and some of her things had been recovered, while others not. During the investigation, Lamonica's pimp, 24-year-old Derrick Mims, told police that the alleged killer with whom Cole left on the day of her disappearance was travelling in a blue lorry with white stripes.

According to investigators, another murder was committed on March 29, 1988, this time in New York. The murder was 31-year-old Terri Roark, whose body was found on one of the bridges passing through the [[Mohawk River]]. The medical examiner found that the woman died from a traumatic brain injury that occurred during a beating with a blunt object several hours before the discovery of her body. Some of Roark's clothing, including underwear and shoes, were never found, on the basis of which she was included in the list potential victims of Dr. No. On April 19, 1990, the corpse of another female was found near a truck stop on the I-70. Most of her clothes were missing, but this time, her panties remained. An autopsy concluded that she had died from a traumatic brain injury resulting from a beating, and had had sexual intercourse 12-24 hours before her death. With these conclusions, the investigators suggested that the victim was a prostitute and had fallen victim to the serial killer. Despite multiple attempts to identify her, she remained unidentified (with the placeholder name \"Jane Doe 2\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HkFHPBAgLiMJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/body-trail-prompts-fear-of-serial-killer---1991-dispatch-investigation+&cd=3&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru|title=Body trail prompts fear of serial killer.

== Investigation ==
During the course of the investigation, the police interviewed hundreds of prostitutes, pimps, service station employees and truck drivers, in an attempt to find witnesses and identify the offender.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19910315&id=goQcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8mMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5900,7506894&hl=en|title=Investigators of 10 killings to meet.

Widely regarded as one of Australian football's finest centre half-backs, despite suffering numerous injuries, Knights was recognized for his contribution to the game when he was among the inaugural inductees into the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]] in 1996<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/players/tabid/856/default.aspx Players in the Australian Football Hall of Fame]</ref> and later in the Hawthorn Team of the Century.<ref>[http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/team%20of%20the%20century/tabid/4819/default.aspx Hawthorn Team of the Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223123516/http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/team%20of%20the%20century/tabid/4819/default.aspx |date=23 February 2011 }}</ref>

== Playing career ==
Knights was raised on a dairy farm in [[Longwarry]], where he played for the local football club and attended school in neighbouring [[Drouin, Victoria|Drouin]].<ref name=\"knightsfarewell\">{{cite news|first=Hannah|last=Driscoll|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/hawthorn-legend-peter-knights-prepares-for-vic-country-final-farewell/news-story/3d93377b409bd146e4c143889699853d|title=Hawthorn legend Peter Knights prepares for Vic Country final farewell|publisher=The Weekly Times|date=8 July 2016}}</ref> In his first two seasons at {{AFL Haw}}, Knights would get a taxi to training, then on the weekends would be driven to games by his parents. To make it easier for him to play without having to make long commutes to and from home, Knights was billeted with a family in Melbourne and finished his education at [[Camberwell High School]].<ref name=\"knightsfarewell\"/> He was in his own words a \"quiet and shy\" country kid when he arrived at Hawthorn, and it would be champion rover [[Peter Crimmins]] who helped Knights settle in at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-10-07/crimmos-cup|date=7 October 2016|title=Crimmo's Cup - The story behind the Hawks' 1976 triumph and the famous photo|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au|first=Ashley|last=Browne}}</ref> He became easily identifiable on the field with his blond hair and his ability to frequently take spectacular high [[Mark (Australian football)|marks]]. He was also a great exponent of the drop kick and the torpedo punt kick.

After playing only five games in his debut season, Knights established himself in the first team in 1970. The following year he did so well in that position that he was chosen for Victoria, winning the Simpson Medal for the best on ground in the match against [[Western Australia Australian rules football team|Western Australia]] in Perth. However, he missed out on Hawthorn's [[1971 VFL Grand Final|1971 premiership]] success due to a knee injury.

Knights was moved briefly to full-forward in 1972 after a serious knee injury to [[Peter Hudson]] forced Hawthorn to experiment in the position before finally settling on [[Michael Moncrieff]]. He actually finished as Hawthorn's leading goal-kicking with 46 goals, but was moved back to defence before the season was over. After injury problems restricted his 1973 season, for the next three years Knights was rated the best centre half-back in the game. In 1975, Knights finally had the chance to participate in the first of four Grand Finals. [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] were too good on the day, winning their first-ever Premiership. Knights was Hawthorn's best player on the day, and capped off a fine personal year by winning the club Best and Fairest award.

Knights' stellar form continued into 1976 before he suffered a broken [[collarbone]] early in the match against {{AFL Foo}} in Round 14, which ruled him out for the next seven matches.<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Allsop|title=Footy Flashbacks: Round 14|date=22 June 2016|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-06-22/footy-flashbacks-round-14}}</ref> Despite this, Knights still managed to come second in the [[1976 Brownlow Medal]] count, polling an astonishing 45 votes to finish three votes behind Essendon's [[Graham Moss]]. He shrugged off that disappointment to be one of Hawthorn's best players in the [[1976 VFL Grand Final]] triumph, later joining some of his teammates at [[Peter Crimmins]]' bedside.

From 1977 onwards Knights was frequently rested up forward to reduce the risk of injuries, but still did enough great work at centre half-back to finish one vote behind [[Malcolm Blight]] in the [[1978 Brownlow Medal]] count. He would shrug off the disappointment of finishing runner-up in the Brownlow by starring in the [[1978 VFL Grand Final]]. After being knocked out while playing in defence, Knights was moved forward in the last quarter, where he took a series of fine marks and kicked two goals to help secure Hawthorn's fourth Premiership. During his stellar 1978 season Knights also claimed his second Simpson Medal with a dominant display for Victoria against WA in Perth.

The litany of injuries that Knights had suffered through his career began to catch up with him, and from 1979 to 1981, he played in only 26 out of a possible 66 games. Amid rumours of retirement, Knights rebounded to play impressive football in his final years. In 1983, he booted six goals in the Qualifying Final to guide Hawthorn to a thrilling four-point win against [[Fitzroy Lions|Fitzroy]], and was again among the best players on the field as the Hawks crushed {{AFL Ess}} in the [[1983 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]]. 
Knights reached the 250-game milestone the following season against {{AFL StK}}, gathering 23 possessions and kicking two goals,<ref>{{cite web|title=The best 250th in Hawthorn history?|date=30 May 2016|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-05-30/the-best-250th-in-hawthorn-history|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au}}</ref> but a knee injury restricted him to just three further games. In 1985, Knights showed traces of brilliant form – kicking nine goals against {{AFL Car}} in Round 10. The Preliminary Final against {{AFL Foo}} would turn out to be his final VFL game. He had just four disposals, and was dropped for the Grand Final, a surprising decision for some people, given his reputation as a performer on the VFL's biggest stage. Yet again, Knights would bounce back from the disappointment to finish his career in a semblance of style, kicking a bag of goals to help Hawthorn defeat Carlton in the reserves Grand Final.

== Coaching career ==
Although Knights enjoyed spectacular success on the field, it was a different story as a coach. However, it should also be remembered that he was in charge of teams that were either relatively new and inexperienced (Brisbane), or undergoing restructuring (Hawthorn).

In 1986, the VFL decided to expand and include one team each from [[Western Australia]] and [[Queensland]]. The [[Brisbane Bears]], based on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[South East Queensland]], recruited Knights as their inaugural coach, despite his lack of coaching experience. The club won their first game, and although expectations of the new side were low, it was considered a significant achievement that the team was able to avoid finishing last in their first season.

Despite this, the Bears' results in 1988 and 1989 failed to improve, with the club suffering regular thrashings. Besides the substandard quality of the training and playing facilities, lack of assistance from the VFL, and squad disharmony, Knights also had limited control over team selection; part way through the [[1988 VFL season]], he wanted star signing [[Warwick Capper]] dropped from the senior team due to poor form, but was overruled by club president [[Paul Cronin]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Pierik|publisher=The Age|date=6 May 2014|title=Warwick Capper's life with bad-news Bears|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/warwick-cappers-life-with-badnews-bears-20140506-zr5hn.html}}</ref> Knights was dismissed as coach with seven games remaining in the 1989 season<ref>[https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=hJsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aZEDAAAAIBAJ&dq=peter-knights%20sacked&pg=6691%2C6848905 Shock and tears at golden boy's demise]</ref> and replaced with team [[psychologist]], [[Paul Feltham]]. Knights was considered to have been unlucky, as ineffective club management and poor relationships amongst his underperforming players seen as major contributing factors in the club's performance.

After a brief coaching stint at Tasmanian club [[Devonport Football Club|Devonport]] from 1990 to 1993,<ref>http://www.devonportfc.com.au/history/listOnePositionType?positiontype=Senior%20Coach</ref> Knights returned to Hawthorn as senior coach for the 1994 AFL season. He managed to lead the team into the finals series, but were knocked out by {{AFL NM}} in the first final. The following year the team finished second last, however, and Knights was again sacked.

In 2009, Knights was appointed senior representative coach of the [[Victorian Country Football League]] and held the position until 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hawthorn great Peter Knights to call it a day|date=29 April 2016|first=Hannah|last=Driscoll|publisher=The Weekly Times|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/hawthorn-great-peter-knights-to-call-it-a-day/news-story/6215bc33e92cd6766ea78986ff3af82d}}</ref>

Besides the substandard quality of the training and playing facilities, lack of assistance from the VFL, and squad disharmony, Knights also had limited control over team selection; part way through the [[1988 VFL season]], he wanted star signing [[Warwick Capper]] dropped from the senior team due to poor form, but was overruled by club president [[Paul Cronin]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Pierik|publisher=The Age|date=6 May 2014|title=Warwick Capper's life with bad-news Bears|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/warwick-cappers-life-with-badnews-bears-20140506-zr5hn.html}}</ref> Knights was dismissed as coach with seven games remaining in the 1989 season<ref>[https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=hJsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aZEDAAAAIBAJ&dq=peter-knights%20sacked&pg=6691%2C6848905 Shock and tears at golden boy's demise]</ref> and replaced with team [[psychologist]], [[Paul Feltham]]. Knights was considered to have been unlucky, as ineffective club management and poor relationships amongst his underperforming players seen as major contributing factors in the club's performance.

After a brief coaching stint at Tasmanian club [[Devonport Football Club|Devonport]] from 1990 to 1993,<ref>http://www.devonportfc.com.au/history/listOnePositionType?positiontype=Senior%20Coach</ref> Knights returned to Hawthorn as senior coach for the 1994 AFL season. He managed to lead the team into the finals series, but were knocked out by {{AFL NM}} in the first final. The following year the team finished second last, however, and Knights was again sacked.

In 2009, Knights was appointed senior representative coach of the [[Victorian Country Football League]] and held the position until 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hawthorn great Peter Knights to call it a day|date=29 April 2016|first=Hannah|last=Driscoll|publisher=The Weekly Times|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/hawthorn-great-peter-knights-to-call-it-a-day/news-story/6215bc33e92cd6766ea78986ff3af82d}}</ref>

'''''All Things Considered''''' ('''''ATC''''') is the flagship news program on the American network [[National Public Radio]] (NPR). It was the first news program on NPR, premiering on May 3, 1971.

A weekend version of ''ATC'', ''Weekend All Things Considered'', airs on Saturdays and Sundays.

==Background==
''ATC'' programming combines news, analysis, commentary, interviews, and special features broadcast live daily from 4:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time (3 to 5 pm Central Time) (20:00 to 22:00 [[UTC]]), and is re-fed with updates until 10 p.m. ET (9 p.m. CT) or 7 p.m. PT (02:00 UTC). Broadcasts run about 105 minutes with local content interspersed in between to complete two hours. In 2005, ''ATC'' aired on over 560 radio stations and reached an audience of approximately 12 million listeners each weekday, making it the third most listened to radio program in the United States after ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' and ''[[Morning Edition]]''.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In September 2010, ''All Things Considered'' had an [[AQH Share|average quarter-hour audience]] of 1.8 million.<ref name=shepard>{{cite web |first=Alicia C. |last=Shepard |date=17 September 2010 |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/09/15/129883401/harry-shearer-post |title=Harry Shearer and NPR: The Big Uneasy |department=NPR Ombudsman |website=[[NPR]]}}</ref> ''ATC'' is co-hosted by [[Audie Cornish]], [[Ari Shapiro]], and [[Mary Louise Kelly]], regularly by turns.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|last2=Pedersen|first2=Erik|title='All Things Considered': NPR Taps Mary Louise Kelly As Co-Host; Kelly McEvers Stepping Down|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/all-things-considered-npr-mary-louise-kelly-co-host-kelly-mcevers-robert-siegel-1202229086/|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=Deadline|date=18 December 2017}}</ref>

The first broadcast of ''ATC'' was fed to about 90 [[radio station]]s on May 3, 1971, with host [[Robert Conley (reporter)|Robert Conley]]. During the first week, these stations were not allowed to broadcast the feed \"live\" but could record it for later broadcast. The first story was about the march on [[Washington, D.C.]] and the growing anti-[[Vietnam War protests]] taking place there.<ref>{{cite web |title=30th Anniversary Celebration of All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/atc30/timeline/1971.html |website=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2001}}</ref> NPR chose to place its inaugural daily newscast at the afternoon commute timeslot instead of the morning because many of its affiliates at that time did not sign on for the day until mid-morning or afterward.<ref>{{cite book |title=Conflicting Communication Interests in America: the case of National Public Radio |first=Tom |last=McCourt |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Praeger |date=1999 |page=45 |isbn=}}</ref> It was not until 1979, by which time most affiliates had expanded their broadcast days to begin at 6 a.m. or earlier, that NPR premiered ''[[Morning Edition]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

'''''Weekend All Things Considered''''' (''WATC'') is a one-hour version of the show that premiered in 1977,<ref>{{cite web |title=About Weekend ATC |url=http://www.wlrh.org/Schedule/programdetail.asp?ProgramID=34 |website=[[WLRH]] public radio |date=2000 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref> with host Robert Conley, and is broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays at 5 p.m. ET. Michel Martin now hosts the program. Former hosts also include [[Guy Raz]]. Raz left to be the host of the ''[[TED Radio Hour]]''. On February 13, 2013, NPR announced that it was relocating production of ''WATC'' to NPR West.<ref>{{cite press release |title=NPR Relocates 'Weekend All Things Considered' to NPR West |url=https://www.npr.org/about/press/2013/021313.WATCNPRWest.html |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=13 February 2013}}</ref> Production returned to Washington, DC in 2015.

''ATC'' was excluded from the NPR deal with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] so as not to compete with local stations airing the show.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lynette |last=Clemetson |title=All Things Considered, NPR's Growing Clout Alarms Member Stations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/30/arts/all-things-considered-npr-s-growing-clout-alarms-member-stations.html |quote=NPR has a contract to program two Sirius channels, NPR Talk and NPR Now.

''We will respond to the will of the system,'' he said. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 August 2004}}</ref>

To coordinate the choice of interview partners in cultural coverage between ''ATC'' and other NPR shows (as of 2010: ''Morning Edition'', the weekend editions, ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', and ''[[Tell Me More]]''), NPR set up a \"[[wikt:dibs|dibs]] list\" system around 2005, whereby the first show to declare interest in a particular guest can \"reserve\" that person.<ref name=shepard/>

On March 23, 2020, ''ATC'' launched '''''The National Conversation''''', a live [[call-in show]] addressing listener questions about the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]]. The program airs from 9-10 p.m. ET on weeknights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing 'The National Conversation With All Things Considered' |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/819186570/introducing-the-national-conversation-with-all-things-considered |website=NPR.org |language=en}}</ref>

==Format==
The format is less rigid than that of ''Morning Edition'', with a wider array of type and length of stories. The length of stories tends to be greater than ''Morning Edition'', with some stories lasting for almost 23 minutes. Certain types of personal interest stories are almost always covered within this limit; those relating to hard news or entertainment tend to last the standard three-and-a-half to four minutes.

The program begins with the familiar [[Don Voegeli]] theme song<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/asc/features/atc_theme/ |title=ATC Theme: The Story |website=[[All Songs Considered]] |accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref> under a one-minute billboard of the stories to be covered during the hour. Then the standard five-minute NPR newscast is delivered from one minute to six minutes past the hour. The newscast offers a cutaway after three minutes (at four minutes past the hour), allowing stations to cover the last 2.5 minutes with evening rush-hour news and traffic reports. For those stations that run the newscast untouched, a 30-second music bed follows instead.

The first, or \"A\" segment, begins at :06:30 after the hour. It features important news stories, although not necessarily the most important news stories of the day. Often it is here that the most significant interviews or developing stories are placed. Segment A runs 11:29 in duration, and closes out at :18 after with a two-minute station break.

At :20:35 past the hour, ''ATC'' picks back up with Segment B. This segment, which runs 8:24, features more news and analysis, and often contains lighter stories and commentary. Segment B breaks for the half-hour at :29 past. The program goes into a one-minute local break.

At the bottom of the hour, ''ATC'' resumes with a \"host return\". In the 30-second return, the host or hosts discuss what's coming up in the remaining half-hour and intro the news. This is immediately followed by a 3:30 newscast which ends at :34 after the hour, followed by a one-minute local break.

Segment C kicks off at :35:35 past the hour, and runs 8:24. Long feature stories are heard here, or as many as three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well. Segment D occurs immediately after Segment C at :44 past the hour, and runs for four minutes. Segment D is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment. Segment D ends at :48 after the hour, and another two-minute break ensues. Occasionally, the show will \"break format\" and place a long, 12-minute story in Segments C and D without a local cutaway.

Segment E starts at :50 after, and concludes the hour. The segment runs 8:09. Unlike ''Morning Edition'', there is no set format for this segment, although usually the second hour will contain an arts, culture, or lighter news story in this segment. Other times, hard news otherwise not fitting in the program may be placed here.

Stations receive a preliminary rundown before each broadcast (usually a few minutes before 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern) denoting the timing and placement of stories so they can schedule local content as appropriate. This rundown is updated as stories change until the feed ends at 10 p.m. ET. As with ''Morning Edition'', two hours of content are scheduled for each program. After 6 p.m. Eastern, the feed repeats the earlier hours for the Midwest and West Coast, although information is updated through the evening as appropriate.

==Awards==
Major awards won by the show include the Ohio State Award, the [[Peabody Award]], the Overseas Press Club Award, the [[DuPont Awards|DuPont Award]], the American Women in Radio and Television Award, and the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award|Robert F. Kennedy Award]]. In 1993, the show was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]], the first<ref>{{cite web |title=30th Anniversary Celebration of All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/atc30/timeline/1993.html |website=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2001 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref> public radio program to be given that honor.

In 2017, the first broadcast episode (from 1971) of ''All Things Considered'' was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].  Recordings in the collection are considered \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-029/ | title=National Recording Registry Picks Are \"Over the Rainbow\" | work=Library of Congress | date=March 29, 2016 | accessdate=March 29, 2016}}</ref>

==International broadcasts==
[[ABC NewsRadio]] in [[Australia]] broadcasts a continuous hour of selected segments from each day's program between 12:00 and 13:00 [[Time in Australia|Australian Eastern Standard Time]] Monday to Friday. Segments A to D are edited together omitting local NPR news inserts.

[[NPR Berlin]] in [[Germany]] aired in the local German timeslot, live from the U.S.

Then the standard five-minute NPR newscast is delivered from one minute to six minutes past the hour. The newscast offers a cutaway after three minutes (at four minutes past the hour), allowing stations to cover the last 2.5 minutes with evening rush-hour news and traffic reports. For those stations that run the newscast untouched, a 30-second music bed follows instead.

The first, or \"A\" segment, begins at :06:30 after the hour. It features important news stories, although not necessarily the most important news stories of the day. Often it is here that the most significant interviews or developing stories are placed. Segment A runs 11:29 in duration, and closes out at :18 after with a two-minute station break.

At :20:35 past the hour, ''ATC'' picks back up with Segment B. This segment, which runs 8:24, features more news and analysis, and often contains lighter stories and commentary. Segment B breaks for the half-hour at :29 past. The program goes into a one-minute local break.

At the bottom of the hour, ''ATC'' resumes with a \"host return\". In the 30-second return, the host or hosts discuss what's coming up in the remaining half-hour and intro the news. This is immediately followed by a 3:30 newscast which ends at :34 after the hour, followed by a one-minute local break.

Segment C kicks off at :35:35 past the hour, and runs 8:24. Long feature stories are heard here, or as many as three shorter stories or commentaries may be heard as well. Segment D occurs immediately after Segment C at :44 past the hour, and runs for four minutes. Segment D is a designated cutaway for stations to run local commentary or features in lieu of the national segment. Segment D ends at :48 after the hour, and another two-minute break ensues. Occasionally, the show will \"break format\" and place a long, 12-minute story in Segments C and D without a local cutaway.

Segment E starts at :50 after, and concludes the hour. The segment runs 8:09. Unlike ''Morning Edition'', there is no set format for this segment, although usually the second hour will contain an arts, culture, or lighter news story in this segment. Other times, hard news otherwise not fitting in the program may be placed here.

Stations receive a preliminary rundown before each broadcast (usually a few minutes before 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern) denoting the timing and placement of stories so they can schedule local content as appropriate. This rundown is updated as stories change until the feed ends at 10 p.m. ET. As with ''Morning Edition'', two hours of content are scheduled for each program. After 6 p.m. Eastern, the feed repeats the earlier hours for the Midwest and West Coast, although information is updated through the evening as appropriate.

==Awards==
Major awards won by the show include the Ohio State Award, the [[Peabody Award]], the Overseas Press Club Award, the [[DuPont Awards|DuPont Award]], the American Women in Radio and Television Award, and the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award|Robert F. Kennedy Award]]. In 1993, the show was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]], the first<ref>{{cite web |title=30th Anniversary Celebration of All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/atc30/timeline/1993.html |website=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2001 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref> public radio program to be given that honor.

In 2017, the first broadcast episode (from 1971) of ''All Things Considered'' was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].  Recordings in the collection are considered \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-029/ | title=National Recording Registry Picks Are \"Over the Rainbow\" | work=Library of Congress | date=March 29, 2016 | accessdate=March 29, 2016}}</ref>

==International broadcasts==
[[ABC NewsRadio]] in [[Australia]] broadcasts a continuous hour of selected segments from each day's program between 12:00 and 13:00 [[Time in Australia|Australian Eastern Standard Time]] Monday to Friday. Segments A to D are edited together omitting local NPR news inserts.

[[NPR Berlin]] in [[Germany]] aired in the local German timeslot, live from the U.S.

The '''Southern Caribbean''' is a group of islands that neighbor mainland South America in the [[West Indies]]. [[Saint Lucia]] lies to the north of the region, [[Barbados]] in the east, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] at its southernmost point, and [[Aruba]] at the most westerly section.

==Physical geography of the region==
The Southern Caribbean has the Caribbean to the north and west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the [[Gulf of Paria]] to the south. Most of the islands are in the [[windward islands]] chain and the (former) [[Netherlands Antilles]].

Geologically, the islands are referred to as being a sub-continent of North America, although most islands sit on the South American continental plate. All of the Southern Caribbean islands are small, and are either volcanic or made of limestone coral, as they form at the ridge of the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates.

The majority of the islands are covered in tropical rainforests and swamps; the densest of these are in Grenada, [[St Lucia]], and [[Tobago]]. Various other islands' rainforests have decreased in size over the last century due to deforestation.

Due to the close proximity of the equator, the Southern Caribbean has all year around tropical weather. Islands such as [[Aruba]] and [[Barbados]] occasionally suffer droughts, while [[Grenada]] receives a great deal of rainfall.  Dry seasons on Aruba and Barbados may occur even while Grenada is receiving rain.

== History ==
The Caribbean had been inhabited for about 7000 years by the [[Arawaks]], [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], [[Taínos]] and their ancestors, who came to the Southern Caribbean on canoes from South America (primarily [[Venezuela]]).<ref name=\"Reid\">Reid, Basil A. ''Myths and Realities of Caribbean History'', University of Alabama Press, 2009.</ref> In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European explorers and colonizers arrived. The Europeans replaced virtually the entire population of the native tribes through various means. The natives disappeared due to various reasons, including diseases brought in by Europeans to which they had no immunity, warring, enslavement and the removal of the natural resources upon which these tribes depended.<ref name=\"Reid\" /> European countries then made the Caribbean islands part of their respective empires. Most of these islands were disputed and fought over by European empires, such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[The Netherlands]]:

*Spain claimed: [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]] (Briefly).
*Portugal claimed: [[Barbados]].
*France claimed: [[Saint Lucia]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], Trinidad and Tobago (Briefly).
*Britain claimed: Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia.
*Netherlands claimed: [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]].

Eventually all of the islands in the region except the Dutch islands Aruba and Netherlands Antilles were occupied by the British, who were in control from the 18th century onwards. The various islands declared their independence during the 1960s. The Dutch Caribbean islands are still part of Holland and none have yet declared full independence. Trinidad & Tobago was the first nation in the Southern Caribbean to become independent in 1962, followed by Barbados in 1966. All of the islands (except the Dutch Antilles) were part of the [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 until its dissolution in 1962.

== Culture ==
Like other Caribbean nations, the Southern Caribbean island states share similar cultures. Cricket is widely enjoyed in the region and rum is the local drink. African traditions are primarily influential on these islands, particularly in Grenada and St Lucia and Indian Traditions in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. Influences from the European cultures are heavily based in Barbados and the former Netherlands Antilles. Other than English, the main language, [[French-based creole languages|French creole]], [[Portuguese creole]], Dutch, Spanish, and [[Papiamento]] are also spoken in the region, as well as [[Hindi]].

==Demographics==
The Southern Caribbean is very diverse, with over 70% of its population of [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] descent, who originated from West Africa and were brought to the Caribbean as slaves to work on plantations. Indo-Caribbeans originally from India and [[Bangladesh]] are primarily in [[Trinidad]], although large numbers can also be found in Barbados and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], many more live on the other islands too. [[Chinese people|Chinese]] arrived in the region as laborers from [[Hong Kong]], and are found on most islands. [[European ethnic groups|European]]s are found all over the West Indies due to colonization of the region by countries such as France, Spain, United Kingdom, [[The Netherlands]], and Portugal. French Creoles may be found inhabiting the islands of St Lucia, [[Trinidad]] and Grenada; while [[Portuguese people]] make up a sizeable group of Barbados' European population - numbering over 2,000 - third in size to the English and [[Irish people]] on the island. Spanish people settled on Trinidad and still have small numbers of descendants, while the [[Dutch people]] have a strong influence on [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Neighbouring South America has had a massive influence on the ethnic diversity of the Southern Caribbean. Many Brazilian mulattoes and Brazilian Jews went to Barbados, where their descendants still live. Many Venezuelans arrive in Trinidad, Barbados, and [[Aruba]] each year, and many [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] and [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] people migrate to the Southern Caribbean along with many [[Guyana|Guyanese]]. In addition, the area receives a lot of expatriates from the US, Canada, and Europe.

==Music==
Each island has its own musical flair and individuality, but musically [[Soca music|soca]] is the most dominant of the English-speaking islands in the region. Invented in Trinidad, the closest islands, Barbados and Grenada, were the first islands to promote and produce the music out of Trinidad & Tobago. Since the 1960s, many other islands have been promoting their styles of music, such as [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[St Kitts & Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], [[Dominica]], and [[Jamaica]] (although to a much lesser extent). The [[steel pan]], a famous symbol of the Caribbean, was invented in Trinidad also during the 1940s, during [[World War II]]. Many oil drums from the USA had been transported to Trinidad, and there, an inspired musician moulded the base in order to make a drum. It now is a universally recognized symbol of Trinidad and Tobago and the West Indies.

===Island music===
'''Barbados''' - Soca-Samba: A fusion of Brazilian [[Samba]] and [[Soca music]]. Samba was introduced to Barbados by [[Afro-Brazilian]]s. The music had never really been produced by Bajan artists until in 1999 when [[Square One (band)|Square One]] released \"Faluma\", spoken in the language of the Saamaka tribe in Suriname, a song featuring the Soca-Samba bass. Rupee had also produced \"Jump\", which had a soca-samba essence (although some argue it is pure soca). Barbados also produced [[Rihanna]], one of the Caribbean's more famous international artists, as well as [[Rupee (musician)|Rupert Clarke]] (Rupee) and [[Alison Hinds]].

'''Grenada''' - Grenadian Calypso: Derived from neighbouring Trinidad & Tobago, Grenadian music uses many African drums in their music, such as the \"Big Drum\", which arrived in Grenada when enslaved Africa were brought to the island by British and French colonizers. Carriacou has similar music to that of the French West Indies. [[Boula (music)|Boula]] music is a type of music made using hand drums from old rum casks.

'''St Lucia''' - Soca and calypso music are St Lucia's main types of music, just as in Trinidad and the Eastern Caribbean islands. St Lucia also holds a jazz festival; many U.S artists perform there. St Lucia is the number one island to produce [[zouk]] music featuring the French [[accordion]] with various percussion instruments.

'''Trinidad & Tobago''' - Soca: A fusion of soul and its predecessor calypso gave the name soul-calypso (or shortened as soca). Used in traditional carnivals, its features are a quick tempo with bass, hi-hat, bongo, and tassa drums, just as are used in Soca, as well as guitars. Trinidad's famous steel-pan music is made from oil drums, and is also used in carnivals. Trinidad has contributed artists such as [[Machel Montano]], [[Destra Garcia]], [[Calypso Rose]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[David Rudder]].

==Sport==
Cricket is the major sport in the Southern Caribbean. Barbados is a hub for cricket fans and sportsmen, with legendary Sir [[Garfield Sobers]] and [[Clyde Walcott]] hailing from the island. [[Brian Lara]] from [[Trinidad]] is also a key player in the [[West Indies cricket team]]. In 2007, the West Indies region hosted the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]]. Apart from [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[Jamaica]], and [[St Kitts & Nevis]], all other matches were played in the Southern Caribbean in [[Queen's Park Oval]],  Trinidad, [[Beausejour Stadium]], St Lucia, [[Queen's Park, Grenada]], and the final held at the [[Kensington Oval]] (seats 28,000), in Barbados.

Football (or called soccer in the USA) is the second sport in the area, after Trinidad & Tobago was the first team in the Southern Caribbean (and third in the Caribbean after Haiti and Jamaica), to qualify for the World Cup. They were the  Caribbean favourites in the 1974 World Cup Qualifiers but lost out to Haiti under questionable officiating. Again coming close to qualifying for the 1990 World Cup, The \"Soca Warriors fell by a single goal to the always powerful USA team despite only needing a draw to qualify.  The \"Soca Warriors\" were knocked out in the group stages as they competed in Group B along with [[England]], [[Sweden]],   and [[Paraguay]], at the [[2006 World Cup]] in Germany.  Trinidad and Tobago are still the smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup in football.

[[Netball]], [[Hockey]], and [[Volleyball]] are also competitive sports in the region, although are not as widely recognized as are Cricket and [[Soccer]]. [[Golf]] is a sport which is mainly based in Barbados' [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane]] resort, which hosted the World Golf Championships-World Cup in 2006. [[Tennis]] and [[badminton]] are on the steady increase in Barbados and Trinidad & Tobago, but they occasionally send national teams to the [[Commonwealth Games]]. [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] is a well established category of sport in the Southern Caribbean in both the [[Olympics]] and the [[Commonwealth games]]. Sprinters hailing from the Southern Caribbean include [[Obadele Thompson]] of Barbados, who won Bronze at a 100m sprint at the Sydney Olympic Games; [[Ato Boldon]] of Trinidad & Tobago, who won Silver at the 100m sprint at the Sydney Olympic Games; [[Marc Burns]] of Trinidad & Tobago, who won Bronze at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games; Trinidad's 1976 [[Montreal]] Olympics Gold Medallist [[Hasely Crawford]]; and Grenada's [[Alleyne Francique]], who ran the 400m sprint and won the silver medal at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games (2006). During the 2008 [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]], Trinidad & Tobago earned a silver medal in the 4 × 100 m men's relay, coming second to fellow West Indian island, [[Jamaica]].

==Diaspora of the Southern Caribbean==
There are over two million people involved in the Southern Caribbean diaspora. Grenada has more expatriates than any other island in the region, and with most leaving the island for the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US, although some migrate to nearer countries such as [[Trinidad]] and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. Trinidad has a growing diaspora to Canada, mostly to [[Toronto]], that has contributed the Toronto Caribana in the city. The Trinidadian diaspora is only second in size to the Jamaican diaspora in Canada from the Caribbean. Grenada and Guyana are two nations whose populations are migrating elsewhere, as the two countries are some of the least developed countries in the Americas. Many Guyanese have chosen the nearby island of Barbados, and many people on the island have Guyanese relatives or relations. Other than that, the Guyanese have settled in England (mostly London) and Canada, similar to Vincentians and St Lucians. Barbados has the least migration as it's developing a successful economy, and the living conditions are better than in some other Southern Caribbean countries. However, after World War II, many Barbadians moved to the USA ([[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]), Canada, and primarily the UK. It has a smaller diaspora compared to its neighbouring islands, however.  Arubans most often migrate to the Netherlands or the US, but a small portion migrate to Canada or Venezuela. Many black British and mixed race people have Southern Caribbean heritage, and a few possess dual heritage of two Caribbean nations. Mostly with Jamaica, (Jamaican/Trinidadian), (Jamaican/Bajan), (Jamaican/Grenadian), and to a lesser extent, a mixture of the Southern nations, (Bajan/Guyanese), (Trini/Grenadian), and (Trini/Bajan). In the United Kingdom, parts of Canada, and the US, Caribbean independence days are held in cities and are celebrated by people of Caribbean descent.

==Jamaica vs \"The Smallies\"==
In the US, Canada, and the UK, the non-Anglophone Caribbean community is mixed with many from the [[Languages of the Caribbean#English|Anglophone Caribbean]] community. Some cases of segregation have arisen among West Indian people, however, which causes a commonly found rivalry between people from the larger island of Jamaica and those from the smaller \"Smallie\" islands of the Southern Caribbean. From the 1960s to the 1980s, many Jamaicans would not associate with someone from Trinidad/Barbados/Grenada, and vice versa. Tensions between the regions originate from the days of slavery, as both regions blame each other for \"selling them out\" to Europeans. During the 1960s-1980s, this racial tension reached a high point as many Caribbean people were discouraged from intermingling with those from other nations. They were even encouraged to marry only their \"own people\", that is, Jamaican man with a Jamaican woman, Trinidadian man with a Trinidadian woman and so forth.

However, it was not frowned upon for a Southern Caribbean person to marry another Southern Caribbean person (Trinidadian man with a Barbadian woman), as they classed themselves the same (unlike the Jamaicans). Jamaicans coined the term \"Smallie\" (meaning \"small Islander\") as a derogatory word used for Trinidadians, Barbadians, Grenadians, Vincentians, and St Lucians, as well as Kittians and Antiguans. For people who were not Jamaican, the Jamaican use of the term \"Smallies\" helped create a stereotype of Jamaicans being sneaky, common, and violent. This rift was well known in London until the [[Brixton Riots (disambiguation)|Brixton Riots]] united the black Caribbean population, which now has a growing number of bi-national Caribbean descendants. Friendlier rivalry now occurs, such as the soca vs. reggae rivalry, which recently escalated between Jamaica's [[I Wayne]] and Trinidad's [[Bunji Garlin]], after I Wayne labeled soca \"Devil music\". Other than that, the two regions challenge each other to who can \"wuk up\" the best.

The natives disappeared due to various reasons, including diseases brought in by Europeans to which they had no immunity, warring, enslavement and the removal of the natural resources upon which these tribes depended.<ref name=\"Reid\" /> European countries then made the Caribbean islands part of their respective empires. Most of these islands were disputed and fought over by European empires, such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[The Netherlands]]:

*Spain claimed: [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]] (Briefly).
*Portugal claimed: [[Barbados]].
*France claimed: [[Saint Lucia]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], Trinidad and Tobago (Briefly).
*Britain claimed: Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia.
*Netherlands claimed: [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]].

Eventually all of the islands in the region except the Dutch islands Aruba and Netherlands Antilles were occupied by the British, who were in control from the 18th century onwards. The various islands declared their independence during the 1960s. The Dutch Caribbean islands are still part of Holland and none have yet declared full independence. Trinidad & Tobago was the first nation in the Southern Caribbean to become independent in 1962, followed by Barbados in 1966. All of the islands (except the Dutch Antilles) were part of the [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 until its dissolution in 1962.

== Culture ==
Like other Caribbean nations, the Southern Caribbean island states share similar cultures. Cricket is widely enjoyed in the region and rum is the local drink. African traditions are primarily influential on these islands, particularly in Grenada and St Lucia and Indian Traditions in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. Influences from the European cultures are heavily based in Barbados and the former Netherlands Antilles. Other than English, the main language, [[French-based creole languages|French creole]], [[Portuguese creole]], Dutch, Spanish, and [[Papiamento]] are also spoken in the region, as well as [[Hindi]].

==Demographics==
The Southern Caribbean is very diverse, with over 70% of its population of [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] descent, who originated from West Africa and were brought to the Caribbean as slaves to work on plantations. Indo-Caribbeans originally from India and [[Bangladesh]] are primarily in [[Trinidad]], although large numbers can also be found in Barbados and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], many more live on the other islands too. [[Chinese people|Chinese]] arrived in the region as laborers from [[Hong Kong]], and are found on most islands. [[European ethnic groups|European]]s are found all over the West Indies due to colonization of the region by countries such as France, Spain, United Kingdom, [[The Netherlands]], and Portugal. French Creoles may be found inhabiting the islands of St Lucia, [[Trinidad]] and Grenada; while [[Portuguese people]] make up a sizeable group of Barbados' European population - numbering over 2,000 - third in size to the English and [[Irish people]] on the island. Spanish people settled on Trinidad and still have small numbers of descendants, while the [[Dutch people]] have a strong influence on [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Neighbouring South America has had a massive influence on the ethnic diversity of the Southern Caribbean. Many Brazilian mulattoes and Brazilian Jews went to Barbados, where their descendants still live. Many Venezuelans arrive in Trinidad, Barbados, and [[Aruba]] each year, and many [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] and [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] people migrate to the Southern Caribbean along with many [[Guyana|Guyanese]]. In addition, the area receives a lot of expatriates from the US, Canada, and Europe.

==Music==
Each island has its own musical flair and individuality, but musically [[Soca music|soca]] is the most dominant of the English-speaking islands in the region. Invented in Trinidad, the closest islands, Barbados and Grenada, were the first islands to promote and produce the music out of Trinidad & Tobago. Since the 1960s, many other islands have been promoting their styles of music, such as [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[St Kitts & Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], [[Dominica]], and [[Jamaica]] (although to a much lesser extent). The [[steel pan]], a famous symbol of the Caribbean, was invented in Trinidad also during the 1940s, during [[World War II]]. Many oil drums from the USA had been transported to Trinidad, and there, an inspired musician moulded the base in order to make a drum. It now is a universally recognized symbol of Trinidad and Tobago and the West Indies.

===Island music===
'''Barbados''' - Soca-Samba: A fusion of Brazilian [[Samba]] and [[Soca music]]. Samba was introduced to Barbados by [[Afro-Brazilian]]s. The music had never really been produced by Bajan artists until in 1999 when [[Square One (band)|Square One]] released \"Faluma\", spoken in the language of the Saamaka tribe in Suriname, a song featuring the Soca-Samba bass. Rupee had also produced \"Jump\", which had a soca-samba essence (although some argue it is pure soca). Barbados also produced [[Rihanna]], one of the Caribbean's more famous international artists, as well as [[Rupee (musician)|Rupert Clarke]] (Rupee) and [[Alison Hinds]].

'''Grenada''' - Grenadian Calypso: Derived from neighbouring Trinidad & Tobago, Grenadian music uses many African drums in their music, such as the \"Big Drum\", which arrived in Grenada when enslaved Africa were brought to the island by British and French colonizers. Carriacou has similar music to that of the French West Indies. [[Boula (music)|Boula]] music is a type of music made using hand drums from old rum casks.

'''St Lucia''' - Soca and calypso music are St Lucia's main types of music, just as in Trinidad and the Eastern Caribbean islands. St Lucia also holds a jazz festival; many U.S artists perform there. St Lucia is the number one island to produce [[zouk]] music featuring the French [[accordion]] with various percussion instruments.

'''Trinidad & Tobago''' - Soca: A fusion of soul and its predecessor calypso gave the name soul-calypso (or shortened as soca). Used in traditional carnivals, its features are a quick tempo with bass, hi-hat, bongo, and tassa drums, just as are used in Soca, as well as guitars. Trinidad's famous steel-pan music is made from oil drums, and is also used in carnivals. Trinidad has contributed artists such as [[Machel Montano]], [[Destra Garcia]], [[Calypso Rose]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[David Rudder]].

==Sport==
Cricket is the major sport in the Southern Caribbean. Barbados is a hub for cricket fans and sportsmen, with legendary Sir [[Garfield Sobers]] and [[Clyde Walcott]] hailing from the island. [[Brian Lara]] from [[Trinidad]] is also a key player in the [[West Indies cricket team]]. In 2007, the West Indies region hosted the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]]. Apart from [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[Jamaica]], and [[St Kitts & Nevis]], all other matches were played in the Southern Caribbean in [[Queen's Park Oval]],  Trinidad, [[Beausejour Stadium]], St Lucia, [[Queen's Park, Grenada]], and the final held at the [[Kensington Oval]] (seats 28,000), in Barbados.

Football (or called soccer in the USA) is the second sport in the area, after Trinidad & Tobago was the first team in the Southern Caribbean (and third in the Caribbean after Haiti and Jamaica), to qualify for the World Cup. They were the  Caribbean favourites in the 1974 World Cup Qualifiers but lost out to Haiti under questionable officiating. Again coming close to qualifying for the 1990 World Cup, The \"Soca Warriors fell by a single goal to the always powerful USA team despite only needing a draw to qualify.  The \"Soca Warriors\" were knocked out in the group stages as they competed in Group B along with [[England]], [[Sweden]],   and [[Paraguay]], at the [[2006 World Cup]] in Germany.  Trinidad and Tobago are still the smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup in football.

[[Netball]], [[Hockey]], and [[Volleyball]] are also competitive sports in the region, although are not as widely recognized as are Cricket and [[Soccer]]. [[Golf]] is a sport which is mainly based in Barbados' [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane]] resort, which hosted the World Golf Championships-World Cup in 2006. [[Tennis]] and [[badminton]] are on the steady increase in Barbados and Trinidad & Tobago, but they occasionally send national teams to the [[Commonwealth Games]]. [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] is a well established category of sport in the Southern Caribbean in both the [[Olympics]] and the [[Commonwealth games]]. Sprinters hailing from the Southern Caribbean include [[Obadele Thompson]] of Barbados, who won Bronze at a 100m sprint at the Sydney Olympic Games; [[Ato Boldon]] of Trinidad & Tobago, who won Silver at the 100m sprint at the Sydney Olympic Games; [[Marc Burns]] of Trinidad & Tobago, who won Bronze at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games; Trinidad's 1976 [[Montreal]] Olympics Gold Medallist [[Hasely Crawford]]; and Grenada's [[Alleyne Francique]], who ran the 400m sprint and won the silver medal at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games (2006). During the 2008 [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]], Trinidad & Tobago earned a silver medal in the 4 × 100 m men's relay, coming second to fellow West Indian island, [[Jamaica]].

==Diaspora of the Southern Caribbean==
There are over two million people involved in the Southern Caribbean diaspora. Grenada has more expatriates than any other island in the region, and with most leaving the island for the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US, although some migrate to nearer countries such as [[Trinidad]] and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. Trinidad has a growing diaspora to Canada, mostly to [[Toronto]], that has contributed the Toronto Caribana in the city. The Trinidadian diaspora is only second in size to the Jamaican diaspora in Canada from the Caribbean. Grenada and Guyana are two nations whose populations are migrating elsewhere, as the two countries are some of the least developed countries in the Americas. Many Guyanese have chosen the nearby island of Barbados, and many people on the island have Guyanese relatives or relations. Other than that, the Guyanese have settled in England (mostly London) and Canada, similar to Vincentians and St Lucians. Barbados has the least migration as it's developing a successful economy, and the living conditions are better than in some other Southern Caribbean countries. However, after World War II, many Barbadians moved to the USA ([[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]), Canada, and primarily the UK. It has a smaller diaspora compared to its neighbouring islands, however.  Arubans most often migrate to the Netherlands or the US, but a small portion migrate to Canada or Venezuela. Many black British and mixed race people have Southern Caribbean heritage, and a few possess dual heritage of two Caribbean nations. Mostly with Jamaica, (Jamaican/Trinidadian), (Jamaican/Bajan), (Jamaican/Grenadian), and to a lesser extent, a mixture of the Southern nations,(Bajan/Guyanese),(Trini/Grenadian), and (Trini/Bajan). In the United Kingdom, parts of Canada, and the US, Caribbean independence days are held in cities and are celebrated by people of Caribbean descent.

==Jamaica vs \"The Smallies\"==
In the USA, Canada, and the UK, the non-Anglophone Caribbean community is mixed with many from the [[Languages of the Caribbean#English|Anglophone Caribbean]] community. Some cases of segregation have arisen among West Indian people, however, which causes a commonly found rivalry between people from the larger island of Jamaica and those from the smaller \"Smallie\" islands of the Southern Caribbean. From the 1960s to the 1980s, many Jamaicans would not associate with someone from Trinidad/Barbados/Grenada, and vice versa. Tensions between the regions originate from the days of slavery, as both regions blame each other for \"selling them out\" to Europeans. During the 1960s-1980s, this racial tension reached a high point as many Caribbean people were discouraged from intermingling with those from other nations. They were even encouraged to marry only their \"own people\", that is, Jamaican man with a Jamaican woman, Trinidadian man with a Trinidadian woman and so forth.

However, it was not frowned upon for a Southern Caribbean person to marry another Southern Caribbean person (Trinidadian man with a Barbadian woman), as they classed themselves the same (unlike the Jamaicans). Jamaicans coined the term \"Smallie\" (meaning \"small Islander\") as a derogatory word used for Trinidadians, Barbadians, Grenadians, Vincentians, and St Lucians, as well as Kittians and Antiguans. For people who were not Jamaican, the Jamaican use of the term \"Smallies\" helped create a stereotype of Jamaicans being sneaky, common, and violent. This rift was well known in London until the [[Brixton Riots (disambiguation)|Brixton Riots]] united the black Caribbean population, which now has a growing number of bi-national Caribbean descendants. Friendlier rivalry now occurs, such as the soca vs. reggae rivalry, which recently escalated between Jamaica's [[I Wayne]] and Trinidad's [[Bunji Garlin]], after I Wayne labeled soca \"Devil music\". Other than that, the two regions challenge each other to who can \"wuk up\" the best.

After obtaining ''[[Wayne Gretzky Hockey]]'' (1988), during the holiday break of his senior year in college, Howard visited the offices of the game's developer, [[Bethesda Softworks]], which he passed by daily on his commute to and from school.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> He asked for a job at the company but was rejected and told that he needed to finish school as a prerequisite.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> After graduating, he went back to Bethesda for a job but was rejected again due to a lack of job opportunities at the time.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> Instead, Howard started working for a smaller game company in [[Yorktown, Virginia]], which enabled him to visit several conventions like the [[Consumer Electronics Show]], where he continued approaching Bethesda to request being hired.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/>

==Opinions and recognition==
Regarding his own views on video games, Howard admitted in 2011 that ''The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion'' had sacrificed what made ''The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind'' \"particular\", saying: \"With ''Oblivion'', we're dealing with the capital province, and we wanted to get back to the more classic ''Arena'' and ''Daggerfall'' feel of a fantasy world that felt more refined and welcoming. But in that, we sacrificed some of what made ''Morrowind'' special: the wonder of discovery.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/26280/bethesda-oblivion-sacrificed-what-made-morrowind-special/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312093509/http://www.oxm.co.uk/26280/bethesda-oblivion-sacrificed-what-made-morrowind-special/ |archivedate=March 12, 2011 |website=[[Official Xbox Magazine]] |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2019 |title=Bethesda: Oblivion \"sacrificed what made Morrowind special\"}}</ref> He said Bethesda's philosophy for ''The Elder Scrolls'' games was to allow people to \"live another life, in another world\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/codex/team_rpgnextgen.htm |title=The RPG for the Next Generation |first=Todd |last=Howard |website=The Elder Scrolls Codex |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124180227/http://www.elderscrolls.com/codex/team_rpgnextgen.htm |archive-date=January 24, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2012, Howard also said he was favorable to [[modding]] in video games, claiming he did not understand why many developers do not allow it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2012/03/01/todd-howard-mods-make-your-game-better-more-companies-should-allow-them/ |title=Todd Howard: Mods \"make your game better\", more companies should allow them |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2019 |website=[[VG247]]}}</ref> In 2016, after the release of ''[[Fallout 4]]'', Howard admitted that he was well aware of the criticisms received by the game, especially with regards to the [[dialogue system]], saying: \"The way we did some dialogue stuff [in Fallout 4], that didn't work as well.

He serves as director and executive producer at [[Bethesda Game Studios]], where he has led the development of the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' series.

==Early life==
Todd Howard was born in [[Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"The Morning Call\" /> He has an elder brother, Jeff.<ref name=\"The Morning Call\" /> He developed an interest in computers, particularly video games, at a very young age.<ref name=\"Game Informer\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/01/13/road-to-skyrim-the-todd-howard-interview.aspx |title=Road To Skyrim: The Todd Howard Interview |first=Ben |last=Hanson |date=January 13, 2011 |website=[[Game Informer]] |access-date=March 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313052103/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/01/13/road-to-skyrim-the-todd-howard-interview.aspx |archive-date=March 13, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> Howard considers the 1980s [[role-playing video game]]s ''[[Wizardry]]'' and ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'' to be inspirations for his future games.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> He is a 1989 graduate of [[Emmaus High School]] in [[Emmaus, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"The Morning Call\" /> In 1993, he graduated from the [[College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], with a major in finance/business, despite his desire to create video games, later saying that \"it seemed like the easiest path to get through college\".<ref name=\"The Morning Call\" /><ref name=\"Game Informer\" />

After obtaining ''[[Wayne Gretzky Hockey]]'' (1988), during the holiday break of his senior year in college, Howard visited the offices of the game's developer, [[Bethesda Softworks]], which he passed by daily on his commute to and from school.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> He asked for a job at the company but was rejected and told that he needed to finish school as a prerequisite.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> After graduating, he went back to Bethesda for a job but was rejected again due to a lack of job opportunities at the time.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> Instead, Howard started working for a smaller game company in [[Yorktown, Virginia]], which enabled him to visit several conventions like the [[Consumer Electronics Show]], where he continued approaching Bethesda to request being hired.<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/>

==Career==
Howard was eventually recruited by Bethesda Softworks in 1994, originally as a [[Video game producer|producer]].<ref name=\"The Morning Call\"/><ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> His first game development credit for Bethesda was as producer and designer of ''[[The Terminator: Future Shock]]'' (1995), followed by work as a designer on ''[[Skynet (video game)|SkyNET]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall]]'', both released in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/04/skyrim-director-todd-howard-why-triple-a-games-are-better-when-you-dont-play-it-safe/4/ |title=Skyrim director Todd Howard: Why triple-A games are better when you don't play it safe |last=Takashi |first=Dean |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=July 4, 2018 |accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref> He was project leader for the first time on ''[[The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard]]'', released in 1998.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/27/18281082/elder-scrolls-morrowind-oral-history-bethesda |title=Morrowind: An oral history |last=Kane |first=Alex |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=March 27, 2019 |accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref>

==Opinions and recognition==
Regarding his own views on video games, Howard admitted in 2011 that ''The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion'' had sacrificed what made ''The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind'' \"particular\", saying: \"With ''Oblivion'', we're dealing with the capital province, and we wanted to get back to the more classic ''Arena'' and ''Daggerfall'' feel of a fantasy world that felt more refined and welcoming. But in that, we sacrificed some of what made ''Morrowind'' special: the wonder of discovery.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/26280/bethesda-oblivion-sacrificed-what-made-morrowind-special/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312093509/http://www.oxm.co.uk/26280/bethesda-oblivion-sacrificed-what-made-morrowind-special/ |archivedate=March 12, 2011 |website=[[Official Xbox Magazine]] |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2019 |title=Bethesda: Oblivion \"sacrificed what made Morrowind special\"}}</ref> He said Bethesda's philosophy for ''The Elder Scrolls'' games was to allow people to \"live another life, in another world\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/codex/team_rpgnextgen.htm |title=The RPG for the Next Generation |first=Todd |last=Howard |website=The Elder Scrolls Codex |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124180227/http://www.elderscrolls.com/codex/team_rpgnextgen.htm |archive-date=January 24, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2012, Howard also said he was favorable to [[modding]] in video games, claiming he did not understand why many developers do not allow it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2012/03/01/todd-howard-mods-make-your-game-better-more-companies-should-allow-them/ |title=Todd Howard: Mods \"make your game better\", more companies should allow them |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2019 |website=[[VG247]]}}</ref> In 2016, after the release of ''[[Fallout 4]]'', Howard admitted that he was well aware of the criticisms received by the game, especially with regards to the [[dialogue system]], saying: \"The way we did some dialogue stuff [in Fallout 4], that didn't work as well. But I know the reasons we tried that - to make a nice interactive conversation - but [it was] less successful than some other things in the game.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=June 16, 2019 |accessdate=August 3, 2019 |title=Todd Howard acknowledges criticism of dialogue in Fallout 4 |url=https://www.gamereactor.eu/todd-howard-acknowledges-criticism-of-dialogue-in-fallout-4/ |website=[[Gamereactor]]}}</ref>

'''Johann Georg Hamann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑː|m|ə|n}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhaːman|lang}}; August 27, 1730 – June 21, 1788) was a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] philosopher from [[Königsberg]] known as “the Wizard of the North” who was one of the leader figures of [[German idealism|post Kantian philosophy]]. His work was used by his student [[Johann Gottfried Herder|J. G. Herder]] as the main support of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement, and is associated with the [[Counter-Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]].<ref>[[Isaiah Berlin]], ''[[Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder]]'', London and Princeton, 2000.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magus of the North: J.

He introduced [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], also from Königsberg, to both [[David Hume|Hume]] – waking him from his \"dogmatic slumber\" – and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]].

==Early life==
[[File:Johann Georg Hamann.jpg|thumb|Johann Georg Hamann (20th century drawing)]]
Hamann was born on August 27, 1730 in Königsberg (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia). Initially he studied theology at the [[University of Königsberg]], but became a clerk in a mercantile house and afterward held many small public offices, devoting his leisure to reading philosophy.)<ref>W. M. Alexander, ''Johann Georg Hamann Philosophy and Faith'', Springer, 2012 : \"Hamann left the University in 1751 or as late as 1752 without taking a degree.\"</ref> His first publication was a study in political economy about a dispute on nobility and trade.<ref>Christoph Meineke: „Die Vortheile unserer Vereinigung“: Hamanns Dangeuil-Beylage im Lichte der Debatte um den handeltreibenden Adel. [In German] In: [http://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783110290721/9783110290721.46/9783110290721.46.xml Beetz, Manfred / Rudolph, Andre (Ed.). Johann Georg Hamann: Religion und Gesellschaft (2012)''], pp. 46–64.</ref>  He wrote under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' of “the Magus of the North” ({{lang-de|Magus im Norden}}). Hamann was a believer in the Enlightenment until a mystical experience in [[London]] in 1758.

His translation of [[David Hume]] into German is considered by most scholars as the one that Hamann's friend, Immanuel Kant, also from [[Königsberg]], had read and referred to as inspiration for awakening from \"dogmatic slumber\". Hamann and Kant held each other in mutual respect, although Hamann once declined an invitation by Kant to co-write a [[physics]] textbook for children. Hamann also introduced Kant to the work of Rousseau.

=== Music ===
Hamann was a [[lutenist]], having studied this instrument with [[Timofey Belogradsky]] (a student of [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]]), a Ukrainian virtuoso then living in Königsberg.

==Philosophical views==
His distrust of autonomous, disembodied [[reason]] and [[the Enlightenment]] (\"I look upon logical proofs the way a well-bred girl looks upon a love letter\" was one of his many witticisms) led him to conclude that faith in [[God]] was the only [[solution]] to the vexing problems of [[philosophy]].   

One of Kant's biographers compared him with Hamann: {{Quotation|Kant made reason the rule of his life and the source of his philosophy; Hamann found the source of both in his heart. While Kant dreaded enthusiasm in religion, and suspected in it superstition and fanaticism, Hamann reveled in enthusiasm; and he believed in revelation, miracles, and worship, differing also in these points from the philosopher. In some respects they complemented each other; but the repelling elements were too strong to make them fully sympathetic. The difference in their stand-points, however, makes Hamann’s views of Kant all the more interesting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeimmanuelkan00stucgoog|last=Stuckenberg|first=J. H. W.|title=The Life of Immanuel Kant|location= London|publisher=Macmillan|date=1882|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeimmanuelkan00stucgoog/page/n226 202]}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}

In Hamann's own terms Kant was a \"[[Platonism|Platonist]]\" about reason, believing it disembodied, and Hamann an \"[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]\" who believed it was embodied. Hamann was greatly influenced by Hume. This is most evident in Hamann's conviction that faith and belief, rather than knowledge, determine human actions. Also, Hamann asserted that the efficacy of a concept arises from the habits it reflects rather than any inherent quality it possesses.  

=== Works ===
Hamann's writings consist of small essays. They display two striking tendencies. The first is their brevity, in comparison with works by his contemporaries. The second is their breadth of allusion and delight in extended analogies. For example, his work ''Golgatha and Scheblimini! By a Preacher in the Wilderness'' (1784) was directed against [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''Jerusalem, or on Religious Might and Judaism'' (1782). His work was also significantly reactive; rather than advance a “position” of his own, his principal mode of thinking was to respond to others' work. 

Hamann famously used the image of [[Socrates]], who often proclaimed to know nothing, in his ''Socratic Memorabilia'', an essay in which Hamann critiques the Enlightenment's dependence on reason. In ''Aesthetica in nuce'', Hamann counters the Enlightenment by emphasizing the importance of aesthetic experience and the role of genius in intuiting nature. 

====Editions====
Fragments of his writings were published by Cramer, under the title of ''Sibyllinische Blätter des Magus aus Norden'' (1819), and a complete edition by Roth (7 vols., 1821–25, with a volume of additions and explanations by Wiener, 1843). ''Hamann's des Magus in Norden Leben und Schriften'', edited by Gildemeister, was published in 5 vols., 1857–68, and a new edition of his ''Schriften und Briefen'', edited by Petri, in 4 vols., 1872-74.

===God===
Hamann argued that the [[communicatio idiomatum]], namely, the communication of divine messages through material embodiments, applies not just to Christ, but should be generalised to cover all human action: 'This communicatio of divine and human idiomatum is a fundamental law and the master-key of all our knowledge and of the whole visible economy.\"  Hamann believed all of creation were [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] from God for us to interpret.

===Reason is language===
His most notable contributions to philosophy were his thoughts on language, which have often been considered as a forerunner to the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s. He famously said that \"Reason is language\" (\"Vernunft ist Sprache\").<ref name=\"Brief\">Johann Georg Hamann, ''Brief an Herder'', v. 8. August 1784, in: Johann Georg Hamann, ''Briefwechsel'', 7 vols., Arthur Henkel (ed.), Wiesbaden: Insel Verlag, 1955–75, vol. 5, p. 177.</ref> Hamann thought the bridge between Kant's [[Noumenon|noumenal]] and [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] realms was language, with its noumenal [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and phenomenal [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]].<br />

==Legacy==
Hamann was one of the precipitating forces for the [[Counter-Enlightenment]]. He was, moreover, a mentor to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and an admired influence on Goethe, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], Kierkegaard, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, ''Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles'' (Volume III in the English language translation of ''The Glory of the Lord'' series). Most recently, Hamann's influence can be found in the work of the theologians [[Oswald Bayer]] ([[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]), [[John Milbank]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), and [[David Bentley Hart]] ([[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]). Finally, in [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s important summative work, ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity'' (Taylor, 2016),<ref>Taylor, Charles (2016) ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref>  Hamann is given credit, along with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and Herder, for inspiring Taylor's \"HHH\" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.

However, recent scholarship, such as that by Bayer, contradicts the usual interpretation by people such as historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]], and describes Hamann as a \"radical Enlightener\" who vigorously opposed dogmatic rationalism in matters of philosophy and faith.<ref>{{Cite book|title=After Enlightenment: The Post-Secular Vision of J. G. Hamann|last=Betz|first=John|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2012|isbn=978-0-470-67492-5|location=Chicester|pages=2}}</ref> Bayer views him as less the proto-Romantic that Herder presented, and more a premodern-postmodern thinker who brought the consequences of Lutheran theology to bear upon the burgeoning Enlightenment and especially in reaction to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].<ref>Bayer, Oswald.

He famously said that \"Reason is language\" (\"Vernunft ist Sprache\").<ref name=\"Brief\">Johann Georg Hamann, ''Brief an Herder'', v. 8. August 1784, in: Johann Georg Hamann, ''Briefwechsel'', 7 vols., Arthur Henkel (ed.), Wiesbaden: Insel Verlag, 1955–75, vol. 5, p. 177.</ref> Hamann thought the bridge between Kant's [[Noumenon|noumenal]] and [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] realms was language, with its noumenal [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and phenomenal [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]].<br />

==Legacy==
Hamann was one of the precipitating forces for the [[Counter-Enlightenment]]. He was, moreover, a mentor to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and an admired influence on Goethe, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], Kierkegaard, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, ''Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles'' (Volume III in the English language translation of ''The Glory of the Lord'' series). Most recently, Hamann's influence can be found in the work of the theologians [[Oswald Bayer]] ([[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]), [[John Milbank]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), and [[David Bentley Hart]] ([[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]). Finally, in [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s important summative work, ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity'' (Taylor, 2016),<ref>Taylor, Charles (2016) ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref>  Hamann is given credit, along with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and Herder, for inspiring Taylor's \"HHH\" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.

However, recent scholarship, such as that by Bayer, contradicts the usual interpretation by people such as historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]], and describes Hamann as a \"radical Enlightener\" who vigorously opposed dogmatic rationalism in matters of philosophy and faith.<ref>{{Cite book|title=After Enlightenment: The Post-Secular Vision of J. G. Hamann|last=Betz|first=John|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2012|isbn=978-0-470-67492-5|location=Chicester|pages=2}}</ref> Bayer views him as less the proto-Romantic that Herder presented, and more a premodern-postmodern thinker who brought the consequences of Lutheran theology to bear upon the burgeoning Enlightenment and especially in reaction to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].<ref>Bayer, Oswald.

'''Michael Adams''' (born 17 November 1971) is an English chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]]. His highest ranking is world No. 4, achieved several times from October 2000 to October 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ratings.fide.com/top_files.phtml?id=400041 |title=Adams, Michael (ENG) FIDE Top Chess Player |publisher=Ratings.fide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref> His peak [[Elo rating]] is 2761.

He has achieved good results in [[World Chess Championship]] tournaments. Several times a [[Candidates Tournament|World Championship Candidate]], he reached the semifinals in 1997, 1999 and 2000. At the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004|2004 FIDE Championship]], he reached the final, narrowly losing out to [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]] in the tie-break games. He is also a seven-time [[British Chess Champion]].

==Early career==
Adams was born on 17 November 1971 in [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], UK. By 1980, his chess talent had been recognised by the [[British Chess Federation]] and he received high-level coaching from former [[European Junior Chess Championship|European Junior Champion]] [[Shaun Taulbut]] along with coaching from local chess champion Michael Prettejohn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessdevon.co.uk/HTML/Pioneers/kjb/base.htm |title=Chessdevon |publisher=Chessdevon |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004143018/http://www.chessdevon.co.uk/HTML/Pioneers/kjb/base.htm |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1981, aged nine, he entered the Cornwall (County) Under-9 Championship and won it. At the same event, he won the Under-13, Under-15 and Under-18 Championships. For one day, the latter two contests clashed and he had to play them simultaneously, commuting cautiously between different rooms, some thirty metres apart.<ref>[[CHESS magazine]] - Vol.52, December 1987, p.263</ref>

In 1987, he took the silver medal at the [[World Youth Chess Championship|World Under-16 Championship]], held in [[Innsbruck]], behind the Icelandic player [[Hannes Stefansson]].<ref>[[CHESS magazine]] - Vol.52, June 1987, p.52</ref> Later that year, at the age of fifteen, he became the world's youngest [[International Master]] (IM).<ref>[[CHESS magazine]] - Vol.52, December 1987, p.261</ref>

Two books co-written with his father, Bill Adams, ''Development of a Grandmaster'' (1991) and ''Chess in the Fast Lane'' (1996), discuss his early chess career.

==National success==
Adams' early endeavours were already beginning to pay dividends at the [[British Chess Championship|British Championship]] of 1987, where he gained his final IM norm and took the best junior prize. He proceeded to win the full Championship title in 1989, at just seventeen years old. He won again in 1997, jointly with [[Matthew Sadler (chess player)|Matthew Sadler]]. Then, after a lengthy break from the event, he returned to claim further titles in 2010, 2011, 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishchess.org.uk/british-champions-1904-present/|title=British Champions 1904 – present|website=www.englishchess.org.uk|access-date=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626111649/https://www.englishchess.org.uk/british-champions-1904-present/|archive-date=26 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>, 2018 <ref>[https://www.chess.com/news/view/adams-wins-british-championship-after-epic-final-day Adams Wins British Championship After Epic Final Day] Chess.com</ref>and 2019.

His win at the British Chess Championship 2016 with 10/11 tied the record score set by [[Julian Hodgson]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishchesschampionships.co.uk/michael-adams-is-british-champion-jovanka-houska-takes-the-womens-title/|title=Michael Adams is British Champion; Jovanka Houska takes the women’s title|website=www.britishchesschampionships.co.uk}}</ref>

Adams also won the [[British Rapidplay Chess Championships|British Rapidplay Championship]] in 1995, 1996 and 1999.

== World Championship candidate ==
Adams has performed strongly in a number of [[World Chess Championship]] tournaments.

In 1993 he finished equal first (with [[Viswanathan Anand]]) in the [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] [[Interzonal]] tournament to determine challengers for the [[PCA World Chess Championship 1995]]. This took him to the [[Candidates Tournament]] matches, where he beat [[Sergei Tiviakov]] in the quarter finals, but lost to Anand in the semifinals. 

He also qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1996]], losing to [[Boris Gelfand]] in the first round of matches.

In 1997, he took part in the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998|1997–1998 FIDE World Championship]], which, for the first time, was a large knockout event, the winner of which would play a match against reigning champion [[Anatoly Karpov]]. This tournament included most of the world's top players ([[Garry Kasparov]], [[Vladimir Kramnik]] and [[Gata Kamsky]] were the only notable absentees), and Adams won short matches against Tamaz Giorgadze, [[Sergei Tiviakov]], [[Peter Svidler]], [[Loek van Wely]] and [[Nigel Short]], before coming up against Anand in the final round. Their four games at normal time controls were all [[draw (chess)|drawn]], as were four rapidplay games at quicker time limits, before Anand won the sudden-death game, thereby eliminating Adams from the competition.

The [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1999|1999 FIDE World Championship]] resulted in another semifinal finish for Adams, before losing to [[Vladimir Akopian]].<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/9899$wix.htm World Chess Championship 1999 FIDE Knockout Matches], Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref> Yet again, he reached the semifinals of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2000|2000 FIDE World Championship]] before losing to eventual winner Anand.<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/a0a1$wix.htm World Chess Championship 2000 FIDE Knockout Matches], Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref> In the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2002|2002 FIDE World Championship]] he won his first three rounds before being knocked out in the 'round of 16' by [[Peter Svidler]].<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/a1a2$wix.htm World Chess Championship 2001–02 FIDE Knockout Matches], Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref>

Adams came closest to claiming a world title at the 2004 FIDE Championship, when he reached the final, winning matches against Hussein Asabri, [[Karen Asrian]], [[Hichem Hamdouchi]], [[Hikaru Nakamura]], [[Vladimir Akopian]] and [[Teimour Radjabov]]. However, he lost to [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]] in the final (3½–4½ after rapidplay tie-breaks, the match having been tied 3–3 after the six standard games).

As runner-up in the 2004 event, Adams was one of eight players invited to the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2005]]. He finished in equal sixth–seventh place, with a score of 5½ out of 14. 

In May–June 2007, Adams participated in the Candidates Tournament to qualify for the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2007]]. In the first round he drew 3–3 with [[Alexey Shirov]], and was beaten 2½–½ in the rapidplay playoff.

==Other results==

Among his other notable results were first place at [[Terrassa]] in 1991, joint first at [[Dos Hermanas]] in 1995 (with Kamsky and Karpov), joint first at [[Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting]] in 1998 (with Kramnik and Svidler) and clear first at Dos Hermanas in 1999, ahead of Kramnik, Anand, Svidler, Karpov, [[Veselin Topalov]], [[Judit Polgár]] and others.

In September 2007, Adams took part in a match between United Kingdom and China, held in [[Liverpool]], England. Playing alongside Adams was former World Championship challenger [[Nigel Short|GM Nigel Short]]. This chess event was the first time in almost 15 years that the two GMs had played chess together on British soil.<ref name=\"cbn20070721\"/> Overall, he scored 3½/6, conceding one loss to GM [[Zhang Pengxiang]] (ELO 2649, at time of match) in round four.

'''Michael Adams''' (born 17 November 1971) is an English chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]]. His highest ranking is world No. 4, achieved several times from October 2000 to October 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ratings.fide.com/top_files.phtml?id=400041 |title=Adams, Michael (ENG) FIDE Top Chess Player |publisher=Ratings.fide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref> His peak [[Elo rating]] is 2761.

He has achieved good results in [[World Chess Championship]] tournaments. Several times a [[Candidates Tournament|World Championship Candidate]], he reached the semifinals in 1997, 1999 and 2000. At the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004|2004 FIDE Championship]], he reached the final, narrowly losing out to [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]] in the tie-break games. He is also a seven-time [[British Chess Champion]].

==Early career==
Adams was born on 17 November 1971 in [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], UK. By 1980, his chess talent had been recognised by the [[British Chess Federation]] and he received high-level coaching from former [[European Junior Chess Championship|European Junior Champion]] [[Shaun Taulbut]] along with coaching from local chess champion Michael Prettejohn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessdevon.co.uk/HTML/Pioneers/kjb/base.htm |title=Chessdevon |publisher=Chessdevon |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004143018/http://www.chessdevon.co.uk/HTML/Pioneers/kjb/base.htm |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1981, aged nine, he entered the Cornwall (County) Under-9 Championship and won it. At the same event, he won the Under-13, Under-15 and Under-18 Championships. For one day, the latter two contests clashed and he had to play them simultaneously, commuting cautiously between different rooms, some thirty metres apart.<ref>[[CHESS magazine]] - Vol.52, December 1987, p.263</ref>

In 1987, he took the silver medal at the [[World Youth Chess Championship|World Under-16 Championship]], held in [[Innsbruck]], behind the Icelandic player [[Hannes Stefansson]].<ref>[[CHESS magazine]] - Vol.52, June 1987, p.52</ref> Later that year, at the age of fifteen, he became the world's youngest [[International Master]] (IM).<ref>[[CHESS magazine]] - Vol.52, December 1987, p.261</ref>

Two books co-written with his father, Bill Adams, ''Development of a Grandmaster'' (1991) and ''Chess in the Fast Lane'' (1996), discuss his early chess career.

==National success==
Adams' early endeavours were already beginning to pay dividends at the [[British Chess Championship|British Championship]] of 1987, where he gained his final IM norm and took the best junior prize. He proceeded to win the full Championship title in 1989, at just seventeen years old. He won again in 1997, jointly with [[Matthew Sadler (chess player)|Matthew Sadler]]. Then, after a lengthy break from the event, he returned to claim further titles in 2010, 2011, 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishchess.org.uk/british-champions-1904-present/|title=British Champions 1904 – present|website=www.englishchess.org.uk|access-date=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626111649/https://www.englishchess.org.uk/british-champions-1904-present/|archive-date=26 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>, 2018 <ref>[https://www.chess.com/news/view/adams-wins-british-championship-after-epic-final-day Adams Wins British Championship After Epic Final Day] Chess.com</ref>and 2019.

His win at the British Chess Championship 2016 with 10/11 tied the record score set by [[Julian Hodgson]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishchesschampionships.co.uk/michael-adams-is-british-champion-jovanka-houska-takes-the-womens-title/|title=Michael Adams is British Champion; Jovanka Houska takes the women’s title|website=www.britishchesschampionships.co.uk}}</ref>

Adams also won the [[British Rapidplay Chess Championships|British Rapidplay Championship]] in 1995, 1996 and 1999.

== World Championship candidate ==
Adams has performed strongly in a number of [[World Chess Championship]] tournaments.

In 1993 he finished equal first (with [[Viswanathan Anand]]) in the [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] [[Interzonal]] tournament to determine challengers for the [[PCA World Chess Championship 1995]]. This took him to the [[Candidates Tournament]] matches, where he beat [[Sergei Tiviakov]] in the quarter finals, but lost to Anand in the semifinals. 

He also qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1996]], losing to [[Boris Gelfand]] in the first round of matches.

In 1997, he took part in the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998|1997–1998 FIDE World Championship]], which, for the first time, was a large knockout event, the winner of which would play a match against reigning champion [[Anatoly Karpov]]. This tournament included most of the world's top players ([[Garry Kasparov]], [[Vladimir Kramnik]] and [[Gata Kamsky]] were the only notable absentees), and Adams won short matches against Tamaz Giorgadze, [[Sergei Tiviakov]], [[Peter Svidler]], [[Loek van Wely]] and [[Nigel Short]], before coming up against Anand in the final round. Their four games at normal time controls were all [[draw (chess)|drawn]], as were four rapidplay games at quicker time limits, before Anand won the sudden-death game, thereby eliminating Adams from the competition.

The [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1999|1999 FIDE World Championship]] resulted in another semifinal finish for Adams, before losing to [[Vladimir Akopian]].<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/9899$wix.htm World Chess Championship 1999 FIDE Knockout Matches], Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref> Yet again, he reached the semifinals of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2000|2000 FIDE World Championship]] before losing to eventual winner Anand.<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/a0a1$wix.htm World Chess Championship 2000 FIDE Knockout Matches], Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref> In the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2002|2002 FIDE World Championship]] he won his first three rounds before being knocked out in the 'round of 16' by [[Peter Svidler]].<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/a1a2$wix.htm World Chess Championship 2001–02 FIDE Knockout Matches], Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref>

Adams came closest to claiming a world title at the 2004 FIDE Championship, when he reached the final, winning matches against Hussein Asabri, [[Karen Asrian]], [[Hichem Hamdouchi]], [[Hikaru Nakamura]], [[Vladimir Akopian]] and [[Teimour Radjabov]]. However, he lost to [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]] in the final (3½–4½ after rapidplay tie-breaks, the match having been tied 3–3 after the six standard games).

As runner-up in the 2004 event, Adams was one of eight players invited to the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2005]]. He finished in equal sixth–seventh place, with a score of 5½ out of 14. 

In May–June 2007, Adams participated in the Candidates Tournament to qualify for the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2007]]. In the first round he drew 3–3 with [[Alexey Shirov]], and was beaten 2½–½ in the rapidplay playoff.

\"'''To Build a Fire'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[Jack London]]. There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends—ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to venture on in his journey he later on attempts to build another fails, and tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fail both. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].

The 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.

The 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].

==1908 version plot==
An unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to −75&nbsp;°F (−59&nbsp;°C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.

At half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire—this one under a tree—in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.

==Character relationships==
The protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />

The man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525–534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>

While the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870–1910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33–49 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so also allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct. On the other hand, London shows that men of limited intellect, such as man in the story, fail and don't survive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bowen|first=James K.|date=1971|title=Jack London's \"To Build a Fire\": Epistemology and the White Wilderness|journal=Western American Literature|volume=5|issue=4|pages=287–289|issn=0043-3462|jstor=43017420}}</ref>

==Themes==
\"[[Man vs. Nature]]\" is one of the themes present in this short story. The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.

One theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.

The protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />

\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described “He did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.” <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: “The dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.”<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

Stupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287–289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.

Succumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.

Individualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University – Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>

\"'''To Build a Fire'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[Jack London]]. There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends—ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to venture on in his journey he later on attempts to build another fails, and tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fail both. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].

The 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.

The 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].

==1908 version plot==
An unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to −75&nbsp;°F (−59&nbsp;°C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.

At half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire—this one under a tree—in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.

==Character relationships==
The protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek is seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />

The man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525–534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>

While the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870–1910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33–49 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so also allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct. On the other hand, London shows that men of limited intellect, such as man in the story, fail and don't survive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bowen|first=James K.|date=1971|title=Jack London's \"To Build a Fire\": Epistemology and the White Wilderness|journal=Western American Literature|volume=5|issue=4|pages=287–289|issn=0043-3462|jstor=43017420}}</ref>

==Themes==
\"[[Man vs. Nature]]\" is one of the themes present in this short story. The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.

One theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.

The protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />

\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described “He did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.” <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: “The dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.”<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

Stupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287–289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.

Succumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.

Individualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University – Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>

==1902 version==
The earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> It differs in some details, though the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.

\"'''To Build a Fire'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[Jack London]]. There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]].

The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to venture on in his journey he later on attempts to build another fails, and tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fail both. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].

The 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.

The 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].

==1908 version plot==
An unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to −75&nbsp;°F (−59&nbsp;°C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.

At half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire—this one under a tree—in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.

==Character relationships==
The protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />

The man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525–534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>

While the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870–1910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33–49 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so also allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

==Themes==
\"[[Man vs. Nature]]\" is one of the themes present in this short story. The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.

One theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.

The protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />

\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described “He did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.” <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: “The dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.”<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

Stupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287–289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.

Succumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.

Individualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University – Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>

\"'''To Build a Fire'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[Jack London]]. There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends—ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to venture on in his journey he later on attempts to build another fails, and tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fail both. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].

The 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.

The 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].

==1908 version plot==
An unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to −75&nbsp;°F (−59&nbsp;°C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.

At half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire—this one under a tree—in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.

==Character relationships==
The protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />

The man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525–534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>

While the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870–1910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33–49 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so also allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

==Themes==
\"[[Man vs. Nature]]\" is one of the themes present in this short story. The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.

One theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.

The protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />

\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described “He did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.” <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: “The dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.”<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

Stupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287–289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.

Succumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.

Individualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University – Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>

The earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> It differs in some details, though the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.

During the [[2018–19 in Scottish football|2018–19 season]] Kelty Hearts competed in the [[Lowland League]], the fifth tier of the [[Scottish football league system]], having been promoted from the [[East of Scotland Football League]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=KeltyHeartsFC|author=Kelty Hearts FC|number=872900346514984962|date=8 June 2017|title=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DB0qOWXXoAENZqR.jpg}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/sport/15773167.No_sunshine_for_Leith_as_Hearts_win_again/|title=Kelty Hearts continue perfect East of Scotland League record at Leith Athletic|newspaper=[[Dunfermline Press]]|date=14 December 2017 |accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43821041 |title=Kelty Hearts eye SPFL as they close in on debut season title with 100% record |first=Brian |last=McLauchlin |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=19 April 2018 |accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> The club were previously members of the Fife Junior League and the [[Scottish Junior Football East Region Super League|SJFA East Superleague]], which is the highest division of the [[Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region|East Region]] of the [[Scottish Junior Football Association]].

== History ==
In 1975, Kelty Hearts were formed as Kelty Hearts Amateur Football Club. The club turned [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] after only a few years to remain competitive with other local sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keltyhearts.co.uk/club-history/4584810886|title=Kelty Hearts - History|publisher=Kelty Hearts|language=en|accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref> 

Kelty reached the [[Scottish Junior Cup]] final twice but were runners up both times. In 1999 they were defeated 1–0 by [[Kilwinning Rangers F.C.|Kilwinning Rangers]], and in 2007 they were defeated 2–1 after extra time by [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_cups/6717345.stm|title=Linlithgow Rose 2-1 Kelty Hearts|date=2007-06-03|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Kelty looked to move away from being a [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] side after winning the [[Scottish Junior Football East Region Super League|East Region Super League]] for the second time in [[2016-17 East Superleague|2017]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/news/15342381.Kelty_accepted_into_East_of_Scotland_League/|title=Kelty accepted into East of Scotland League|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> The club applied for membership to join the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] and in December 2017 became a full [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] member, making them eligible to enter the [[Scottish Cup]] as well as joining the [[Scottish football league system]] as a senior club.<ref name=\":0\" />

After being accepted into and winning the [[East of Scotland Football League]] in [[2017–18 East of Scotland Football League|2018]], Kelty were promoted to the [[Lowland League]] (the fifth tier of the [[Scottish football league system]]) for the [[2018–19 in Scottish football|2018–19 season]] after a comprehensive 10–0 aggregate win over [[Threave Rovers F.C.|Threave Rovers]] in the [[2017–18 Lowland Football League#Lowland League play-off|promotion play-off]].<ref name=prom18>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parsreview.org/view-from-the-stands/kelty-hearts-win-promotion-to-lowland-league|title=KELTY HEARTS WIN PROMOTION TO LOWLAND LEAGUE|website=Pars Review|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/sport/16235040.kelty-hearts-celebrate-lowland-league-promotion/|title=The only way is up for Kelty!|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref>

== Supporters ==

=== Rivalries ===
Kelty share a fierce local rivalry with [[East of Scotland Football League|East of Scotland]] team [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath Hawthorn]]. 

Both clubs were founded in the same year in 1975. The rivalry mainly stems from the close proximity of the two clubs and both being very successful [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] sides within the Fife League. Kelty and [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath]] would often exchange Fife league title wins from year to year, also frequently meet in cup competitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dunfermlinepress.com/sport/15034481.hearts-and-haws-set-for-junior-cup-cracker/|title=Hearts and Haws set for Junior Cup cracker|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref> 

Kelty Hearts are currently in the league above [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath]], competing in the [[Lowland Football League|Lowland League]]. However, they can still face each other in some cup competitions. 

Kelty's other rivals include [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]], another successful former [[Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region|East junior]] side, who they have faced in both league and cup competitions.<ref name=\":1\" /> 

A lot of [[Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region|West junior]] teams had considered Kelty competitive rivals due to the clubs success in the [[Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region|East]] and meeting several times in the [[Scottish Junior Cup]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irvinetimes.com/news/15113704.buffs-send-kelty-packing/|title=Buffs send Kelty packing|website=Irvine Times|language=en|access-date=2018-12-31}}</ref>

== History ==
In 1975, Kelty Hearts were formed as Kelty Hearts Amateur Football Club. The club turned [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] after only a few years to remain competitive with other local sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keltyhearts.co.uk/club-history/4584810886|title=Kelty Hearts - History|publisher=Kelty Hearts|language=en|accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref> 

Kelty reached the [[Scottish Junior Cup]] final twice but were runners up both times. In 1999 they were defeated 1–0 by [[Kilwinning Rangers F.C.|Kilwinning Rangers]], and in 2007 they were defeated 2–1 after extra time by [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_cups/6717345.stm|title=Linlithgow Rose 2-1 Kelty Hearts|date=2007-06-03|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Kelty looked to move away from being a [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] side after winning the [[Scottish Junior Football East Region Super League|East Region Super League]] for the second time in [[2016-17 East Superleague|2017]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/news/15342381.Kelty_accepted_into_East_of_Scotland_League/|title=Kelty accepted into East of Scotland League|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> The club applied for membership to join the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] and in December 2017 became a full [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] member, making them eligible to enter the [[Scottish Cup]] as well as joining the [[Scottish football league system]] as a senior club.<ref name=\":0\" />

After being accepted into and winning the [[East of Scotland Football League]] in [[2017–18 East of Scotland Football League|2018]], Kelty were promoted to the [[Lowland League]] (the fifth tier of the [[Scottish football league system]]) for the [[2018–19 in Scottish football|2018–19 season]] after a comprehensive 10–0 aggregate win over [[Threave Rovers F.C.|Threave Rovers]] in the [[2017–18 Lowland Football League#Lowland League play-off|promotion play-off]].<ref name=prom18>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parsreview.org/view-from-the-stands/kelty-hearts-win-promotion-to-lowland-league|title=KELTY HEARTS WIN PROMOTION TO LOWLAND LEAGUE|website=Pars Review|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/sport/16235040.kelty-hearts-celebrate-lowland-league-promotion/|title=The only way is up for Kelty!|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref>

=== Rivalries ===
Kelty share a fierce local rivalry with [[East of Scotland Football League|East of Scotland]] team [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath Hawthorn]]. 

Both clubs were founded in the same year in 1975. The rivalry mainly stems from the close proximity of the two clubs and both being very successful [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] sides within the Fife League. Kelty and [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath]] would often exchange Fife league title wins from year to year, also frequently meet in cup competitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dunfermlinepress.com/sport/15034481.hearts-and-haws-set-for-junior-cup-cracker/|title=Hearts and Haws set for Junior Cup cracker|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref> 

Kelty Hearts are currently in the league above [[Hill of Beath Hawthorn F.C.|Hill of Beath]], competing in the [[Lowland Football League|Lowland League]]. However, they can still face each other in some cup competitions. 

Kelty's other rivals include [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]], another successful former [[Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region|East junior]] side, who they have faced in both league and cup competitions.<ref name=\":1\" /> 

A lot of [[Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region|West junior]] teams had considered Kelty competitive rivals due to the clubs success in the [[Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region|East]] and meeting several times in the [[Scottish Junior Cup]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irvinetimes.com/news/15113704.buffs-send-kelty-packing/|title=Buffs send Kelty packing|website=Irvine Times|language=en|access-date=2018-12-31}}</ref>

The '''ThinkPad W-series''' [[laptops]] from [[Lenovo]] are described by the manufacturer as being \"mobile workstations\",<ref name=\"ThinkPad W Series on Lenovo\">{{cite web|title=ThinkPad W Series|url=http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/thinkpad/w-series|accessdate=15 February 2012}}</ref> and suit that description by being physically on the larger side of the laptop spectrum, with screens ranging from 15\" to 17\" in size. Most W-series laptops offer high-end quad-core [[Intel]] processors with an integrated GPU as well as an [[Nvidia Quadro]] discrete GPU, utilizing [[Nvidia Optimus]] to switch between the two GPUs as required. Notable exceptions are the W500, which has ATI FireGL integrated workstation-class graphics, and the W550s, which is an [[Ultrabook]]-specification laptop with only a dual-core processor. The W-series laptops offer [[Independent software vendor|ISV]] certifications from various vendors such as [[Adobe Systems]] and [[Autodesk]] for CAD and 3D modeling software.

The W-series laptops were introduced by Lenovo as workstation-class laptops with their own letter designation, a descendant of prior [[ThinkPad T series]] models suffixed with 'p'.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\">{{cite web|title=Review Lenovo Thinkpad W500 Notebook|url=http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Lenovo-Thinkpad-W500-Notebook.11683.0.html|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> The W-series laptops were launched in 2008, at the same time as the Intel Centrino 2, marking an overhaul of Lenovo's product lineup.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\"/> The first two W-series laptops introduced were the W500 and the W700.

===W500===
Released in 2008, W500 laptop was similar in design to the Txxp models it replaced. The all-black appearance was retained, as well as the TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\" /> The W500 was appreciated for being equivalent in craftsmanship and stability to previous ThinkPads.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\" /> Large metal hinges were used to hold the display in place, preventing a worn out or unsteady display.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\" /> Other features on the laptop were a DisplayPort video output, three USB ports, a docking station connector, a maximum display resolution of {{resx|1920|1200}}, Intel Core 2 Duo processors and an ATI FireGL v5700 GPU.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\" />

===W700===
Released in October 2008, the W700 laptop was lauded for its performance and for a host of features that were industry-first at the time.<ref name=\"PCMag - ThinkPad W700 Review\">{{cite news|title=Lenovo ThinkPad W700|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2329027,00.asp|accessdate=11 July 2011|author=Cisco Cheng|date=16 December 2008|work=PC Magazine}}</ref> It was the first laptop with an integrated color calibrator. In addition, a biometric fingerprint scanner was available on the palmrest. With a quad-core Intel Core 2 Extreme processor and NVIDIA Quadro FX 3700M workstation GPU available, the laptop was among the most powerful at the time. One point not in the laptop's favor was the low battery life{{mdash}}approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.

The laptop featured up to a 2.53{{nbsp}}GHz [[Intel]] [[Core 2 Extreme]] QX9300 CPU, up to 8{{nbsp}}GB of [[DDR3 SDRAM|DDR3]] RAM (two slots), either an ([[Mobile PCI Express Module|MXM]]-mounted) [[NVIDIA]] [[Nvidia Quadro|Quadro]] FX 2700M or FX 3700M  with up to 1{{nbsp}}GB video RAM, and a {{convert|17|in|cm|adj=on}} TN LCD display with a resolution of {{resx|1440|900}} or {{resx|1920|1200}}.

===W530===

Released in June, 2012, the W530 has a very similar exterior appearance to the prior W models. Being the last W model prior to the W540 redesign, it is the last W to feature the lid lock, keyboard light and wireless and HDD LED indicators, and the first W model to feature the controversial yet well-reviewed island-style keyboard,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lenovo.com/en/blog/why-you-should-give-in-to-the-new-thinkpad-keyboard |title=Change Is Hard: Why You Should Give In to the New ThinkPad Keyboard |last=O'Hara |first=Gavin |publisher=Lenovo |date=12 July 2012 |website=blog.lenovo.com |access-date=14 February 2017}}</ref> which features 6 rows rather than 7 rows of keys and a more modern key shape. The W530 comes equipped with [[Ivy Bridge (CPU)|Ivy Bridge]] processors.

Notable changes/new features:
* 3rd generation Intel Core (Ivy Bridge) processors
* Mini DisplayPort v1.2
* New-style keyboard with backlight

===W540===

Announced in 2013 and released in the US and Europe early 2014, the W540 featured a brand new, slimmer design based on the new generations of T4xx series released the year before.
Slimmer than the prior W530, the new design received mixed reactions from traditional ThinkPad users. Critique was mainly aimed towards lower build quality and missing user interface indicators, together with a new style of trackpad where the traditional ThinkPad trackpoint functionality had been radically changed, and the controversial [[Chiclet keyboard|Chiclet style keyboard]] introduced in 2012 on other products, which many enthusiasts claimed abandoned the core tactile principles established by IBM over previous decades.

The new W series however featured newer hardware such as the option for a 3K IPS display.
<br>
Other new features included:
* Full size keyboard w/numeric keypad (though offset from center of screen, causing criticism from those who rarely use the keypad)
* New trackpad/trackpoint integration (though TrackPoint \"thumb\" buttons were removed causing criticism due to lost tactile feedback)
* Changed [[Lenovo UltraBay|UltraBay]] design (the easy eject locking buttons were replaced by a hidden locking screw rendering \"hot swap\" functionality moot and earlier UltraBay modules incompatible)
* New rectangular connector for charger (rendering earlier accessories and docking stations obsolete)
* Thinner profile
* Lighter weight

===W541===

The Lenovo W541 is a ThinkPad W540 featuring the new-style keyboard but with a re-introduction of the classic ThinkPad trackpad design. The prior ThinkPad trackpad design featured in the W540 and other 4th-gen ThinkPads was abandoned.

===W550s===

Rather than being a successor of any previous W-series model, the Lenovo W550s is a thinner [[Ultrabook]] variant of the W series; Likewise a latest P5xs series ThinkPads, the W550s was based in a T-series chassis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lenovo ThinkPad W550s Workstation Review |url=https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-W550s-Workstation-Review.137989.0.html |website=notebookcheck.net}}</ref> While a capable Ultrabook, when compared to the W541 and its predecessors, it offers less capability with only dual-core [[Hyper-threading|hyper-threaded]] [[Broadwell (CPU)|Intel Broadwell Processors]] vs. the true quad-core processors of other models and has only two RAM slots.

==Discontinuation and successor==
The ThinkPad W series was discontinued and replaced by ThinkPad [[ThinkPad P series|P series]], beginning with the P50 and P70 in 2016.<ref>[https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/lenovo-p-series-hands-on Crazy Powerful: Lenovo ThinkPad P First with Xeon CPU]</ref> The P70 re-introduced the 17-inch screen to the ThinkPad workstation line.

The '''ThinkPad W-series''' [[laptops]] from [[Lenovo]] are described by the manufacturer as being \"mobile workstations\",<ref name=\"ThinkPad W Series on Lenovo\">{{cite web|title=ThinkPad W Series|url=http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/thinkpad/w-series|accessdate=15 February 2012}}</ref> and suit that description by being physically on the larger side of the laptop spectrum, with screens ranging from 15\" to 17\" in size. Most W-series laptops offer high-end quad-core [[Intel]] processors with an integrated GPU as well as an [[Nvidia Quadro]] discrete GPU, utilizing [[Nvidia Optimus]] to switch between the two GPUs as required. Notable exceptions are the W500, which has ATI FireGL integrated workstation-class graphics, and the W550s, which is an [[Ultrabook]]-specification laptop with only a dual-core processor. The W-series laptops offer [[Independent software vendor|ISV]] certifications from various vendors such as [[Adobe Systems]] and [[Autodesk]] for CAD and 3D modeling software.

The W-series laptops were introduced by Lenovo as workstation-class laptops with their own letter designation, a descendant of prior [[ThinkPad T series]] models suffixed with 'p'.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\">{{cite web|title=Review Lenovo Thinkpad W500 Notebook|url=http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Lenovo-Thinkpad-W500-Notebook.11683.0.html|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> The W-series laptops were launched in 2008, at the same time as the Intel Centrino 2, marking an overhaul of Lenovo's product lineup.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\"/> The first two W-series laptops introduced were the W500 and the W700.

===W500===
Released in 2008, W500 laptop was similar in design to the Txxp models it replaced. The all-black appearance was retained, as well as the TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\" /> The W500 was appreciated for being equivalent in craftsmanship and stability to previous ThinkPads.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\" /> Large metal hinges were used to hold the display in place, preventing a worn out or unsteady display.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\" /> Other features on the laptop were a DisplayPort video output, three USB ports, a docking station connector, a maximum display resolution of {{resx|1920|1200}}, Intel Core 2 Duo processors and an ATI FireGL v5700 GPU.<ref name=\"Notebook Check - W500 Review\" />

===W700===
Released in October 2008, the W700 laptop was lauded for its performance and for a host of features that were industry-first at the time.<ref name=\"PCMag - ThinkPad W700 Review\">{{cite news|title=Lenovo ThinkPad W700|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2329027,00.asp|accessdate=11 July 2011|author=Cisco Cheng|date=16 December 2008|work=PC Magazine}}</ref> It was the first laptop with an integrated color calibrator. In addition, a biometric fingerprint scanner was available on the palmrest. With a quad-core Intel Core 2 Extreme processor and NVIDIA Quadro FX 3700M workstation GPU available, the laptop was among the most powerful at the time. One point not in the laptop's favor was the low battery life{{mdash}}approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.

The laptop featured up to a 2.53{{nbsp}}GHz [[Intel]] [[Core 2 Extreme]] QX9300 CPU, up to 8{{nbsp}}GB of [[DDR3 SDRAM|DDR3]] RAM (two slots), either an ([[Mobile PCI Express Module|MXM]]-mounted) [[NVIDIA]] [[Nvidia Quadro|Quadro]] FX 2700M or FX 3700M  with up to 1{{nbsp}}GB video RAM, and a {{convert|17|in|cm|adj=on}} TN LCD display with a resolution of {{resx|1440|900}} or {{resx|1920|1200}}.

Rather than being a successor of any previous W-series model, the Lenovo W550s is a thinner [[Ultrabook]] variant of the W series; Likewise a latest P5xs series ThinkPads, the W550s was based in a T-series chassis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lenovo ThinkPad W550s Workstation Review |url=https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-W550s-Workstation-Review.137989.0.html |website=notebookcheck.net}}</ref> While a capable Ultrabook, when compared to the W541 and its predecessors, it offers less capability with only dual-core [[Hyper-threading|hyper-threaded]] [[Broadwell (CPU)|Intel Broadwell Processors]] vs. the true quad-core processors of other models and has only two RAM slots.

==Discontinuation and successor==
The ThinkPad W series was discontinued and replaced by ThinkPad [[ThinkPad P series|P series]], beginning with the P50 and P70 in 2016.<ref>[https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/lenovo-p-series-hands-on Crazy Powerful: Lenovo ThinkPad P First with Xeon CPU]</ref> The P70 re-introduced the 17-inch screen to the ThinkPad workstation line.

\"'''To Build a Fire'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[Jack London]]. There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends—ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].

The 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.

The 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].

==1908 version plot==
An unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to −75&nbsp;°F (−59&nbsp;°C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.

At half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire—this one under a tree—in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.

==Character relationships==
The protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />

The man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525–534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>

While the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870–1910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33–49 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so, allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct. On the other hand, London shows that men of limited intellect, such as man in the story, fail and don't survive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bowen|first=James K.|date=1971|title=Jack London's \"To Build a Fire\": Epistemology and the White Wilderness|journal=Western American Literature|volume=5|issue=4|pages=287–289|issn=0043-3462|jstor=43017420}}</ref>

==Themes==
\"[[Man vs. Nature]]\" is one of the themes present in this short story. The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.

One theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.

The protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />

\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described “He did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.” <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: “The dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.”<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

Stupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287–289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.

Succumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.

Individualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University – Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>

==1902 version==
The earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> Although it differs in some details, the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.

\"'''To Build a Fire'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[Jack London]]. There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends—ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].

The 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.

The 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].

==1908 version plot==
An unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to −75&nbsp;°F (−59&nbsp;°C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.

At half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire—this one under a tree—in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.

==Character relationships==
The protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />

The man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525–534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>

While the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870–1910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33–49 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so also allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

==Themes==
\"[[Man vs. Nature]]\" is one of the themes present in this short story. The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.

One theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.

The protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />

\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described “He did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.” <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: “The dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.”<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> 

Stupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287–289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.

Succumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.

Individualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University – Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>

'''''Matilda''''' is a 1996 American [[Children's film|family]] [[Comedy film|comedy]] [[fantasy film]] co-produced and directed by [[Danny DeVito]] from a screenplay written by [[Nicholas Kazan]] and [[Robin Swicord]]. Based on [[Roald Dahl]]'s [[Matilda (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film stars [[Mara Wilson]] as the [[Matilda Wormwood|title character]] with DeVito, [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Embeth Davidtz]], and [[Pam Ferris]] in supporting roles. The film centers on a young genius girl named Matilda Wormwood, who develops [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic abilities]] and uses them to deal with her disreputable family and Agatha Trunchbull, the ruthless, oppressive and tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School.

Produced by DeVito's [[Jersey Group|Jersey Films]] and released theatrically in the United States on August 2, 1996 by [[TriStar Pictures]], the film received predominantly positive reviews from critics but was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $33 million in the United States on a $36 million budget.<ref name=\"gross\">{{mojo title|matilda|Matilda}}</ref>

==Plot==
Young genius [[Matilda Wormwood]] is regularly neglected and mistreated by her parents, Harry and Zinnia, and her older brother, Michael. She is smart, independent and frequently goes to the public library where she finds solace in the fictional worlds found in the books. When Matilda's parents refuse to enroll her into school, she retaliates against them, first by adding [[hydrogen peroxide]] bleaching agent to her father's [[Hair conditioner|hair tonic]] and then by gluing his hat to his head. When Harry rips up the library's copy of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (which he finds appalling because of the title) and forces Matilda to watch television instead, Matilda becomes increasingly enraged until the television mysteriously explodes.

One of Harry's car dealership customers is Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School. Harry sells her a car in exchange for her admitting Matilda as a pupil. At school, Matilda makes friends but discovers Trunchbull's harsh punishments of the students, while Matilda's teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, takes a liking to Matilda due to her intelligence; Honey requests Matilda be moved up to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. Miss Honey tells the Wormwoods about Matilda's genius-level intellect, but they ignore her while Matilda discovers that her father is under surveillance by undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Bob and Bill (with whom Zinnia flirts) because of his illegal dealings. Her parents refuse to believe her as they assume that the agents are speedboat salesmen.

As a prank, one of Matilda's friends puts a [[newt]] in Trunchbull's water jug to scare her. Trunchbull accuses Matilda, whose anger at the injustice leads her to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] tip the glass over, splashing the newt onto Trunchbull. Honey invites Matilda over to her house for tea and reveals a secret: when she was two, her mother died and her father invited his stepsister-in-law, Miss Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her, but Trunchbull abused her; when Honey was five, her father died of an alleged [[suicide]] and left everything to Trunchbull. When Matilda and Honey sneak inside Trunchbull's house to obtain some of the latter's belongings, Trunchbull's sudden return prompts the duo to barely escape without getting caught.

Matilda trains her telekinetic power by making objects fly around the house and thwarting the FBI agents who threaten to put her in an [[orphanage]]. Having practiced her ability, she returns to Trunchbull's house in an attempt to scare her away with telekinesis, but Trunchbull discovers Matilda's presence upon finding her hair ribbon. The next day, Matilda reveals her powers to Honey but Trunchbull visits the class to make Matilda confess. Matilda magically writes a message on the blackboard, pretending to be the vengeful soul of Miss Honey's deceased father, Magnus, who accuses Trunchbull of murdering him. Trunchbull attacks the students, but Matilda keeps them safe and she and the other students force her out of the school for good, and Honey moves back into her true home.

The FBI uncovers enough evidence to prosecute Harry, forcing the Wormwoods to flee to [[Guam]]. They stop by Honey's home to fetch Matilda, who refuses to go with them and says she would rather be adopted by Honey; remorseful for never understanding her daughter, Zinnia and Harry both sign Matilda's adoption papers and Matilda lives happily with Honey, who then becomes the new principal of Crunchem Hall.

==Production==
[[Pam Ferris]] (Miss Trunchbull) incurred several injuries during production on the film. The climactic scene where she is whacked by [[blackboard]] erasers required her to keep her eyes open, causing [[chalk]] dust to get caught in her eyes and necessitating several trips to the hospital to get her eyes washed out.<ref name=\":0\" /> The scene where Trunchbull whirls Amanda Thripp (Jacqueline Steiger) by her pigtails required a harness to support the little girl, the wires of which were threaded through the pigtails and then looped around Ferris's fingertips to give her grip. As she swung her around the [[centrifugal force]] grew too great and tore the top part of Ferris' finger, requiring 7 or 8 stitches.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite article|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-09-29/9-fascinating-facts-from-behind-the-scenes-of-matilda/|title=9 fascinating facts from behind the scenes of Matilda|last=Lazarus|publisher=Radio Times|date=26 September 2016|access-date=2018-01-04|first=Susanna|work=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=}}</ref>

==Music==
Two songs are featured in the film.

The other song is [[Thurston Harris]]'s \"[[Little Bitty Pretty One]]\", played when Matilda is learning to control her telekinetic powers. The film's original score was composed by [[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]], a frequent collaborator of DeVito.

'''''Matilda''''' is a 1996 American [[Children's film|family]] [[Comedy film|comedy]] [[fantasy film]] co-produced and directed by [[Danny DeVito]] from a screenplay written by [[Nicholas Kazan]] and [[Robin Swicord]]. Based on [[Roald Dahl]]'s [[Matilda (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film stars [[Mara Wilson]] as the [[Matilda Wormwood|title character]] with DeVito, [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Embeth Davidtz]], and [[Pam Ferris]] in supporting roles. The film centers on a young genius girl named Matilda Wormwood, who develops [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic abilities]] and uses them to deal with her disreputable family and Agatha Trunchbull, the ruthless, oppressive and tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School.

Produced by DeVito's [[Jersey Group|Jersey Films]] and released theatrically in the United States on August 2, 1996 by [[TriStar Pictures]], the film received predominantly positive reviews from critics but was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $33 million in the United States on a $36 million budget.<ref name=\"gross\">{{mojo title|matilda|Matilda}}</ref>

==Plot==
Young genius [[Matilda Wormwood]] is regularly neglected and mistreated by her parents, Harry and Zinnia, and her older brother, Michael. She is smart, independent and frequently goes to the public library where she finds solace in the fictional worlds found in the books. When Matilda's parents refuse to enroll her into school, she retaliates against them, first by adding [[hydrogen peroxide]] bleaching agent to her father's [[Hair conditioner|hair tonic]] and then by gluing his hat to his head. When Harry rips up the library's copy of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (which he finds appalling because of the title) and forces Matilda to watch television instead, Matilda becomes increasingly enraged until the television mysteriously explodes.

One of Harry's car dealership customers is Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School. Harry sells her a car in exchange for her admitting Matilda as a pupil. At school, Matilda makes friends but discovers Trunchbull's harsh punishments of the students, while Matilda's teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, takes a liking to Matilda due to her intelligence; Honey requests Matilda be moved up to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. Miss Honey tells the Wormwoods about Matilda's genius-level intellect, but they ignore her while Matilda discovers that her father is under surveillance by undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Bob and Bill (with whom Zinnia flirts) because of his illegal dealings. Her parents refuse to believe her as they assume that the agents are speedboat salesmen.

As a prank, one of Matilda's friends puts a [[newt]] in Trunchbull's water jug to scare her. Trunchbull accuses Matilda, whose anger at the injustice leads her to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] tip the glass over, splashing the newt onto Trunchbull. Honey invites Matilda over to her house for tea and reveals a secret: when she was two, her mother died and her father invited his stepsister-in-law, Miss Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her, but Trunchbull abused her; when Honey was five, her father died of an alleged [[suicide]] and left everything to Trunchbull. When Matilda and Honey sneak inside Trunchbull's house to obtain some of the latter's belongings, Trunchbull's sudden return prompts the duo to barely escape without getting caught.

Matilda trains her telekinetic power by making objects fly around the house and thwarting the FBI agents who threaten to put her in an [[orphanage]]. Having practiced her ability, she returns to Trunchbull's house in an attempt to scare her away with telekinesis, but Trunchbull discovers Matilda's presence upon finding her hair ribbon. The next day, Matilda reveals her powers to Honey but Trunchbull visits the class to make Matilda confess. Matilda magically writes a message on the blackboard, pretending to be the vengeful soul of Miss Honey's deceased father, Magnus, who accuses Trunchbull of murdering him. Trunchbull attacks the students, but Matilda keeps them safe and she and the other students force her out of the school for good, and Honey moves back into her true home.

The FBI uncovers enough evidence to prosecute Harry, forcing the Wormwoods to flee to [[Guam]]. They stop by Honey's home to fetch Matilda, who refuses to go with them and says she would rather be adopted by Honey; remorseful for never understanding her daughter, Zinnia and Harry both sign Matilda's adoption papers and Matilda lives happily with Honey, who then becomes the new principal of Crunchem Hall.

==Production==
[[Pam Ferris]] (Miss Trunchbull) incurred several injuries during production on the film. The climactic scene where she is whacked by [[blackboard]] erasers required her to keep her eyes open, causing [[chalk]] dust to get caught in her eyes and necessitating several trips to the hospital to get her eyes washed out.<ref name=\":0\" /> The scene where Trunchbull whirls Amanda Thripp (Jacqueline Steiger) by her pigtails required a harness to support the little girl, the wires of which were threaded through the pigtails and then looped around Ferris's fingertips to give her grip. As she swung her around the [[centrifugal force]] grew too great and tore the top part of Ferris' finger, requiring 7 or 8 stitches.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite article|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-09-29/9-fascinating-facts-from-behind-the-scenes-of-matilda/|title=9 fascinating facts from behind the scenes of Matilda|last=Lazarus|publisher=Radio Times|date=26 September 2016|access-date=2018-01-04|first=Susanna|work=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=}}</ref>

The other song is [[Thurston Harris]]'s \"[[Little Bitty Pretty One]]\", played when Matilda is learning to control her telekinetic powers.
