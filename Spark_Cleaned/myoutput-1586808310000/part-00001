There were also accusations of opening stadium gates to advantage Soviet athletes, and causing other disturbances to opposing athletes.<ref>{{Cite news|date=31 July 1980|title=Kozakiewicz Sets World Pole Vault Record |newspaper=[[Star-Banner]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aToVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3QUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4695,6604124 |location=Ocala, Florida}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXKQ_gT1w3sC&pg=PA183 |page=183|title=Olympic Sports and Propaganda Games: Moscow 1980|author=Barukh \u1e24azan|year=1982|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2995-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1185110-top-10-scandals-in-summer-olympic-history/page/3|title=Top 10 Scandals in Summer Olympic History|author=Jesse Reed|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.msn.com/life-inspired/lessons-we-can-learn-from-bad-behavior-at-the-olympic-games?pageart=4|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130129053406/http://living.msn.com/life-inspired/lessons-we-can-learn-from-bad-behavior-at-the-olympic-games?pageart=4|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 January 2013|title=Style, Love, Home, Horoscopes & more \u2013 MSN Lifestyle|website=Living.msn.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polanik.com/english/london-2012/465-moscow-1980 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130131124650/http://www.polanik.com/english/london-2012/465-moscow-1980 |archivedate=31 January 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Basketball===\n{{Main|Basketball at the 1980 Summer Olympics}}\n* Basketball was one of the hardest hit sports due to the boycott.

The hosts, Soviet Union, winners in 1972, won the bronze.\n\n===Boxing===\n{{Main|Boxing at the 1980 Summer Olympics}}\n* [[Te\u00f3filo Stevenson]] of Cuba became the first [[boxing|boxer]] to win three consecutive Olympic titles in heavyweight, and indeed the only boxer to win the same event in three Games.

Under the rules Portnov, having started, could not stop before take-off. On protest to the Swedish referee G.Olander he was allowed to repeat the dive and went ahead again of Mexico's [[Carlos Gir\u00f3n]]. Later protests by Mexico against the re-dive and by [[East Germany]] that their [[Falk Hoffmann]] wanted to re-dive after allegedly being disturbed by photographic flashlights were both turned down by [[FINA]]. FINA President Javier Ostas stated that the decision taken by the Swedish referee was the \"correct one\". FINA assessed all the Olympic diving events and considers the judging to have been objective\".

FINA President Javier Ostas stated that the decision taken by the Swedish referee was the \"correct one\". FINA assessed all the Olympic diving events and considers the judging to have been objective\". Portnov remained the winner with Giron taking silver and Cagnatto of Italy bronze.\n* Martina Jaschke ([[East Germany]]) was fourth after the preliminary high dives, but came back to win gold on the second day of competition.\n* Irina Kalinina ([[Soviet Union|USSR]]) won gold in the springboard final.
