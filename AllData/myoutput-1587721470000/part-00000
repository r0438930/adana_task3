He yearns for her and wonders if, as beautiful as she is, she might be lonely like he is. At the last minute, she turns back and joins him. The title was inspired by Orbison's wife, Claudette, interrupting a conversation to announce she was going out. When Orbison asked if she had enough cash, his co-writer Bill Dees interjected, \"[[Roy Orbison#Riding the success|A pretty woman never needs any money]].\"<ref>Amburn, Ellis.

Other musicians on the record included [[Floyd Cramer]] on piano, [[Henry Strzelecki]] on upright bass, [[Boots Randolph]] and [[Charlie McCoy]] on saxophones, [[Buddy Harman]] on drums, and Paul Garrison on percussion.<ref name=SessionReport /> Orbison played a 12-string [[Epiphone]].

In 1999, the song was honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and was named one of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it #224 on their list of the \"[[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].\" On May 14, 2008, The [[Library of Congress]] selected the song for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]].\n\n===Lawsuit against 2 Live Crew===\n{{Further|Campbell v.

The case, ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Supreme Court decided in 2 Live Crew's favor, greatly expanding the doctrine of fair use and extending its protections to parodies created for profit. It is considered a seminal fair use decision.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Matt|title=Commerce versus art: The transformation of fair use|journal=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|date=March 1995|volume=39|issue=2|pages=190\u2013199|doi=10.1080/08838159509364298}}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

He yearns for her and wonders if, as beautiful as she is, she might be lonely like he is. At the last minute, she turns back and joins him. The title was inspired by Orbison's wife, Claudette, interrupting a conversation to announce she was going out. When Orbison asked if she had enough cash, his co-writer Bill Dees interjected, \"[[Roy Orbison#Riding the success|A pretty woman never needs any money]].\"<ref>Amburn, Ellis.

Other musicians on the record included [[Floyd Cramer]] on piano, [[Henry Strzelecki]] on upright bass, [[Boots Randolph]] and [[Charlie McCoy]] on saxophones, [[Buddy Harman]] on drums, and Paul Garrison on percussion.<ref name=SessionReport /> Orbison played a 12-string [[Epiphone]].

In 1999, the song was honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and was named one of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it #224 on their list of the \"[[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].\" On May 14, 2008, The [[Library of Congress]] selected the song for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]].\n\n===Lawsuit against 2 Live Crew===\n{{Further|Campbell v.

The case, ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Supreme Court decided in 2 Live Crew's favor, greatly expanding the doctrine of fair use and extending its protections to parodies created for profit. It is considered a seminal fair use decision.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Matt|title=Commerce versus art: The transformation of fair use|journal=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|date=March 1995|volume=39|issue=2|pages=190\u2013199|doi=10.1080/08838159509364298}}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
