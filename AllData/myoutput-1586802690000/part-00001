WTOP-FM is considered the successor station to WTOP (1500 AM), now [[WFED]], a station founded in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in 1926 which moved to Washington the following year. WTOP and WTOP-FM have served as Washington's [[CBS News Radio|CBS]] affiliate for all but two years since first joining the network in 1929.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Logo of WTOP-FM (2000).png|thumb|upright|WTOP's logo in 2000.]]\n[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2007).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo before WWWT 107.7 was added to the \"tri-mulcast\".]]\n[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2010).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo after the WWWT signal was added.]]\n\n===1920s: Born in Brooklyn===\nWTOP's origins trace back to [[Brooklyn, New York]], as station WTRC (operated by the Twentieth [District] Republican Club), going to air September 25, 1926, on 1250 kilocycles with a power of 50 watts. On August 2, 1927, WTRC migrated to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia]]; a suburb of Washington.\n\nOn January 10, 1929, the call sign was changed to WJSV, reflecting the initials of owner James S. Vance, who was publisher of \"The Fellowship Forum\" and a KKK [[Grand Wizard]] in Virginia. Realizing the expense of running a 10,000-watt radio station, Vance quickly worked out a deal with the nascent [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] to become the new network's Washington affiliate, beginning a relationship that would last for almost 90 years. As part of the deal, CBS took over all of WJSV's programming and engineering costs, with an option to renew or purchase the station after five years.\n\n===1930s: CBS O&O===\nIn June 1932, CBS exercised its option to purchase WJSV outright, and moved its operations to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. After three months off the air, WJSV resumed broadcasting on October 20, 1932. [[Arthur Godfrey]], who later hosted a variety program on CBS Radio and CBS Television, hosted a program on WJSV called ''The Sundial'' on which he honed a laid-back, conversational style that was unusual on radio at the time.\n\nOn September 21, 1939, WJSV recorded its entire broadcast day for posterity. The [[WJSV broadcast day]] recordings still exist and copies can be found at archive.org and various [[old time radio]] websites.\n\nWJSV was also a key training ground for pioneering newsman [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]] in the 1930s before he became a network correspondent. (One of his broadcasting mentors was Wells (Ted) Church, who later became a [[CBS News]] executive.) Longtime [[Los Angeles]]-area TV newscaster [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]] worked at WJSV in 1938 and continued to work in radio for seven decades until his death in 2008. [[Frank Blair (anchor)|Frank Blair]], who later became an NBC News correspondent and later was a long time news anchor on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show during the 1960s and early 1970s, worked at WJSV.   [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]], longtime host of [[game show]] \"[[What's My Line?]]\" and 1950's anchor on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV news, also got his start on WJSV.\n\n===1940s===\nIn 1940, WJSV's operating power was increased to 50,000 watts from a new transmitter site in [[Wheaton, Maryland]]. On March 29, 1941, with the implementation of [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]], WJSV moved its broadcast frequency from 1460 to 1500 [[kHz]].\n\nOn March 16, 1943, after paying the [[Tiffin, Ohio]] police department $60,000 for the rights to the call letters WTOP, the calls were changed to the current WTOP because its new frequency was now at the \"top\" of the [[mediumwave]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] band.\n\nCBS sold 55 percent majority control of WTOP to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in February 1949; this deal was made so CBS could acquire full control of [[KCBS (AM)|KQW]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-24-BC.pdf|title=WTOP-KQW: CBS Sells 55% D.

In the 1960s, after a series of failed music formats, WTOP phased out its music programming for a combination of newscasts and phone-in talk shows.\n\nThe switch to all-news \u2013 at first only during the week \u2013 came in March 1969.<ref name=\"pointer\">{{cite web |last1=Pointer |first1=Jack |title=\u2018You turn us on and we\u2019re there\u2019: Looking back at 50 years of news on WTOP |url=https://wtop.com/local/2019/04/you-turn-us-on-and-were-there-looking-back-at-50-years-of-news-on-wtop |website=WTOP |page=1 April 2019}}</ref> Among those working for WTOP during this time were [[Sam Donaldson]], later on ABC-TV; [[Jim Bohannon]], who took [[Larry King]]'s place on his all-night radio network talk show after King went to CNN; and including Ralph Begleiter and Jamie MacIntyre, both of whom went to CNN.\n\nWTOP studios were apparently a critical link in [[Emergency Broadcast System]] activation scenarios during the Cold War era.<ref>[http://www.ae5d.com/images/EBS2089.jpg NIAC Order No. 1, Dec 1970], Retrieved on 2010-10-22.</ref>\n\nThe ''Post'' sold WTOP to [[The Outlet Company]] in June 1978, in reaction to the FCC looking askance at common ownership of newspapers and broadcasting outlets in the same city, believing one company should not have too much control of local media. One month later, WTOP-TV was swapped with the [[Detroit News]]'s [[WDIV|WWJ-TV]], and became WDVM-TV. The station is today [[WUSA-TV]], owned by [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]]. The original FM frequency for WTOP-FM was 96.3&nbsp;MHz, but that frequency was donated to [[Howard University]]. That station became [[WHUR]] in 1971, a commercially run radio station.\n\n===1990s-2020s: Move to FM===\nOutlet re-organized and sold WTOP to Chase Broadcasting in 1989, who in turn sold it to Evergreen Media (which eventually became Chancellor Broadcasting) in November 1992. In April 1997, Evergreen's newly acquired 94.3&nbsp;MHz facility in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] began simulcasting the WTOP signal for better coverage in the sprawling [[Northern Virginia]] suburbs. Shortly afterward, on October 10, 1997, [[Bonneville International Corporation]] purchased WTOP.\n\nOn April 1, 1998, 94.3 was swapped for a stronger signal at 107.7, also licensed to Warrenton. (The 94.3 facility is now [[K-Love]] station [[WLZV]].) Then in December 2000, WTOP gained another simulcast in [[Frederick, Maryland]] with WXTR at 820 [[kHz]], establishing the \"WTOP Radio Network\", a name it used until 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |title=Washington, D.C. |work=TopHour |date=2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321145315/http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |archivedate=March 21, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOver its first three decades, WTOP commonly broke the all-news format for sports \u2013 including, at various times, the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets/Wizards]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]] \u2013 and, in its early years, overnight and weekend talk shows. As listeners increasingly indicated a desire for uninterrupted news, this programming dwindled over the years; WTOP completed the transition to 24/7 news when it dropped the Orioles in 1999.<ref name=\"pointer\" />\n\nIn 2005, the station began providing [[podcasts]] of selected broadcast programs, and in 2006, WTOP began broadcasting in digital \"[[HD Radio]]\", utilizing [[iBiquity|iBiquity Digital Corp.'s]] IBOC ([[in-band on-channel]]) technology.\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Bonneville International announced that WTOP would move to a new primary frequency of 103.5 FM, then held by classical station [[WGMS (defunct)|WGMS]] (which would move to 103.9 and 104.1 FM). WTOP's longtime facility at 1500 AM, as well as both FM translators (107.7 in Warrenton and low-powered 104.3 in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]]), would be reassigned to the new \"[[WTWP|Washington Post Radio]]\" for a March 30, 2006 launch date. Fittingly, this new partnership also signaled the ''Post'''s return to the radio scene on the very same dial spot WTOP once held.  The station has been dominant in the 25-54 demographics since moving to FM.\n\nThe stations' respective call signs were changed as of January 11, 2006: the former WTOP pair became WTWP (The Washington Post) and WTOP's new primary stations assumed the WTOP calls. [[HD Radio]] [[digital subchannel]]s of the 103.5 carrier originally had broadcast Bonneville International's \"iChannel\" music format, which features unsigned, independent rock bands on the HD2 channel, and the HD3 channel aired continuous traffic and weather updates.  Later iChannel was dropped for an [[Local marketing agreement|LMA]] of the HD2 to a group that currently airs programming aimed at the South Asian community in the Washington area. Sometime in or before June 2013, that LMA was replaced with [[Voice of Russia|the predecessor]] to what is now [[Radio Sputnik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_06_13/VoR-6th-Video-Conference-The-PRISM-of-Snooping-2417/?slide-1 |title=VoR 6th Video Conference The PRISM of Snooping |date=June 13, 2013 |website=sputniknews.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}} See caption under top photo for relevant information.</ref> As of July 1, 2017, WTOP-HD2 began broadcasting the feed from [[WFED]] (1500 AM),<ref name=\"dcrtv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcrtv.com/index.html |title=Radio Sputnik Off WTOP - 6/29 |date=June 29, 2017 |website=www.dcrtv.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref> after Radio Sputnik moved its Washington DC-area broadcasting to conventional (non-digital) frequency 105.5&nbsp;MHz. Currently, WTOP-FM's HD3 channel is carrying a wide-ranging pop music channel called [[WWFD|\"The Gamut\"]].\n\nIn 2006, WTOP dropped its long-standing association with [[The Weather Channel]] and began airing weather reports exclusively from [[WJLA-TV]] all day long. Previously, WTOP had used weather reports from WJLA chief meteorologist [[Doug Hill (meteorologist)|Doug Hill]] during morning and evening rush hours and The Weather Channel all other times.  Until 2015, the station used all WJLA meteorologists, not just Doug Hill. WJLA's \"Live Super Doppler 7\" has been featured in weather reports as necessary. In 2015, WTOP began airing weather reports and using meteorologists exclusively from [[WRC-TV]] all day long.\n\nIn 2007, the WTOP radio configuration was realigned once again. WTLP-FM (formerly WGYS) at 103.9 picked up the WTOP simulcast on April 6, 2007 after the adult hits \"George 104\" simulcast with WXGG (now [[WPRS-FM]], since sold to Radio One) was broken up, and adopted the WTLP calls on July 5, 2007.\n\nAlso in 2007, WTOP began broadcasting on WJLA's \"Weather Now\" digital sub-channel, which is carried on cable systems well beyond WTOP's broadcast area, though this was ended in late July 2009.\n\nIn May 2007, WTOP sold the naming rights to its \"Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center\" (its nickname for its studio) to area business [[Ledo Pizza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcrtv.org/ledo.mp3 |title=DCRTV.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>  That sponsorship concluded at the end of 2007.  Other sponsorship continues, with sportscasts being \"fed\" by Ledo Pizza.\n\nWTOP AM (which was now on 820 in Frederick) changed its calls to WTWT and switched to the ''Washington Post Radio'' simulcast on June 28, 2007. On September 20, 2007, the 1500/107.7/820 multicast changed format over to a general talk format as \"Talk Radio 3WT\" under the WWWT/WWWT-FM/WWWB call letters, which was cancelled on August 11, 2008. WWWT and WWWB took over the \"Federal News Radio\" format (and for the 1500&nbsp;kHz facility, the [[WFED]] calls),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3wtradio.com/?sid=1457419&nid=24|title=Federal News Radio Expands to Full Market Signal (3wtradio.com)|author=|date=|website=3wtradio.com}}</ref> while WWWT-FM went back to simulcasting WTOP-FM. The former WFED took over the WTOP callsign on the AM dial and became a simulcast of WTOP, with preemptions for sporting events. On June 13, 2009, the 1050 AM frequency changed to a separate [[Talk radio|news/talk]] format, operated by [[Air America Radio]] as [[WBQH|WZAA]]. On January 26, 2010, following the shutdown of Air America Radio, WZAA returned to the WTOP simulcast. It took back the WTOP call letters on February 1, 2010.  WTOP AM left the simulcast on June 23, 2010, as Bonneville leased the station to [[United Media Group]].  United Media changed the call letters to [[WBQH]] and flipped to [[Regional Mexican]].\n\nIn March 2008, WTOP-FM completed a year-long, $2.5-million state-of-the-art renovation of its newsroom and studios, the first since 1989 when the station moved into the building it presently occupies in northwest Washington.\n\nIn 2008, WTOP-FM generated $51.75-million in revenue, the sixth-highest total for any radio station in the United States and the only station not based in New York City or Los Angeles to crack the top ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvbroadcasting.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=16852&p=149992 |title=WVbroadcasting.net |publisher=WVbroadcasting.net |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2009, the station generated $51-million in revenue, good for second among all radio stations in the United States, trailing only [[KIIS-FM]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/03/15/daily49.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= March 17, 2010|accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref> In 2010, WTOP generated $57.225-million in revenue, making it tops among radio station in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.kelseygroup.com/index.php/2011/03/28/wtop-am-takes-over-the-top-billing-station/ |title=BIA/Kelsey |publisher=Blog.kelseygroup.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2011 WTOP once again generated more revenue than any other station in the United States, this time with $64 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/04/12/wtop-remains-nations-top-biller.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= April 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-13 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref>\n[[File:WTOP reporter filing story on park bench Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|right|WTOP reporter filing story, [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration Day 2013]]]]\nIn 2010, WTOP-FM's coverage of the record Washington-area snowfalls in early February earned it record ratings as the only local media outlet on the air and covering the storm live all day and night.

This meant that Lisa Baden, the longtime \"voice of D.C.-area traffic\" and a Metro Networks employee, was forced to leave the station in what WTOP's Vice President of News and Programming Jim Farley said was strictly a business decision.

WTOP-FM is considered the successor station to WTOP (1500 AM), now [[WFED]], a station founded in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] in 1926 which moved to Washington the following year. WTOP and WTOP-FM have served as Washington's [[CBS News Radio|CBS]] affiliate for all but two years since first joining the network in 1929.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Logo of WTOP-FM (2000).png|thumb|upright|WTOP's logo in 2000.]]\n[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2007).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo before WWWT 107.7 was added to the \"tri-mulcast\".]]\n[[Image:Logo of WTOP-FM (2010).png|thumb|upright|The WTOP logo after the WWWT signal was added.]]\n\n===1920s: Born in Brooklyn===\nWTOP's origins trace back to [[Brooklyn, New York]], as station WTRC (operated by the Twentieth [District] Republican Club), going to air September 25, 1926, on 1250 kilocycles with a power of 50 watts. On August 2, 1927, WTRC migrated to [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia]]; a suburb of Washington.\n\nOn January 10, 1929, the call sign was changed to WJSV, reflecting the initials of owner James S. Vance, who was publisher of \"The Fellowship Forum\" and a KKK [[Grand Wizard]] in Virginia. Realizing the expense of running a 10,000-watt radio station, Vance quickly worked out a deal with the nascent [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] to become the new network's Washington affiliate, beginning a relationship that would last for almost 90 years. As part of the deal, CBS took over all of WJSV's programming and engineering costs, with an option to renew or purchase the station after five years.\n\n===1930s: CBS O&O===\nIn June 1932, CBS exercised its option to purchase WJSV outright, and moved its operations to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. After three months off the air, WJSV resumed broadcasting on October 20, 1932. [[Arthur Godfrey]], who later hosted a variety program on CBS Radio and CBS Television, hosted a program on WJSV called ''The Sundial'' on which he honed a laid-back, conversational style that was unusual on radio at the time.\n\nOn September 21, 1939, WJSV recorded its entire broadcast day for posterity. The [[WJSV broadcast day]] recordings still exist and copies can be found at archive.org and various [[old time radio]] websites.\n\nWJSV was also a key training ground for pioneering newsman [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]] in the 1930s before he became a network correspondent. (One of his broadcasting mentors was Wells (Ted) Church, who later became a [[CBS News]] executive.) Longtime [[Los Angeles]]-area TV newscaster [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]] worked at WJSV in 1938 and continued to work in radio for seven decades until his death in 2008. [[Frank Blair (anchor)|Frank Blair]], who later became an NBC News correspondent and later was a long time news anchor on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show during the 1960s and early 1970s, worked at WJSV.   [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]], longtime host of [[game show]] \"[[What's My Line?]]\" and 1950's anchor on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV news, also got his start on WJSV.\n\n===1940s===\nIn 1940, WJSV's operating power was increased to 50,000 watts from a new transmitter site in [[Wheaton, Maryland]]. On March 29, 1941, with the implementation of [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]], WJSV moved its broadcast frequency from 1460 to 1500 [[kHz]].\n\nOn March 16, 1943, after paying the [[Tiffin, Ohio]] police department $60,000 for the rights to the call letters WTOP, the calls were changed to the current WTOP because its new frequency was now at the \"top\" of the [[mediumwave]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] band.\n\nCBS sold 55 percent majority control of WTOP to the ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in February 1949; this deal was made so CBS could acquire full control of [[KCBS (AM)|KQW]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-05-24-BC.pdf|title=WTOP-KQW: CBS Sells 55% D.

In the 1960s, after a series of failed music formats, WTOP phased out its music programming for a combination of newscasts and phone-in talk shows.\n\nThe switch to all-news \u2013 at first only during the week \u2013 came in March 1969.<ref name=\"pointer\">{{cite web |last1=Pointer |first1=Jack |title=\u2018You turn us on and we\u2019re there\u2019: Looking back at 50 years of news on WTOP |url=https://wtop.com/local/2019/04/you-turn-us-on-and-were-there-looking-back-at-50-years-of-news-on-wtop |website=WTOP |page=1 April 2019}}</ref> Among those working for WTOP during this time were [[Sam Donaldson]], later on ABC-TV; [[Jim Bohannon]], who took [[Larry King]]'s place on his all-night radio network talk show after King went to CNN; and including Ralph Begleiter and Jamie MacIntyre, both of whom went to CNN.\n\nWTOP studios were apparently a critical link in [[Emergency Broadcast System]] activation scenarios during the Cold War era.<ref>[http://www.ae5d.com/images/EBS2089.jpg NIAC Order No. 1, Dec 1970], Retrieved on 2010-10-22.</ref>\n\nThe ''Post'' sold WTOP to [[The Outlet Company]] in June 1978, in reaction to the FCC looking askance at common ownership of newspapers and broadcasting outlets in the same city, believing one company should not have too much control of local media. One month later, WTOP-TV was swapped with the [[Detroit News]]'s [[WDIV|WWJ-TV]], and became WDVM-TV. The station is today [[WUSA-TV]], owned by [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]]. The original FM frequency for WTOP-FM was 96.3&nbsp;MHz, but that frequency was donated to [[Howard University]]. That station became [[WHUR]] in 1971, a commercially run radio station.\n\n===1990s-2020s: Move to FM===\nOutlet re-organized and sold WTOP to Chase Broadcasting in 1989, who in turn sold it to Evergreen Media (which eventually became Chancellor Broadcasting) in November 1992. In April 1997, Evergreen's newly acquired 94.3&nbsp;MHz facility in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] began simulcasting the WTOP signal for better coverage in the sprawling [[Northern Virginia]] suburbs. Shortly afterward, on October 10, 1997, [[Bonneville International Corporation]] purchased WTOP.\n\nOn April 1, 1998, 94.3 was swapped for a stronger signal at 107.7, also licensed to Warrenton. (The 94.3 facility is now [[K-Love]] station [[WLZV]].) Then in December 2000, WTOP gained another simulcast in [[Frederick, Maryland]] with WXTR at 820 [[kHz]], establishing the \"WTOP Radio Network\", a name it used until 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |title=Washington, D.C. |work=TopHour |date=2014 |accessdate=March 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321145315/http://www.tophour.com/audio/index.php?q=f&f=%2FWashington+DC |archivedate=March 21, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOver its first three decades, WTOP commonly broke the all-news format for sports \u2013 including, at various times, the [[Washington Capitals]], [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets/Wizards]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]] \u2013 and, in its early years, overnight and weekend talk shows. As listeners increasingly indicated a desire for uninterrupted news, this programming dwindled over the years; WTOP completed the transition to 24/7 news when it dropped the Orioles in 1999.<ref name=\"pointer\" />\n\nIn 2005, the station began providing [[podcasts]] of selected broadcast programs, and in 2006, WTOP began broadcasting in digital \"[[HD Radio]]\", utilizing [[iBiquity|iBiquity Digital Corp.'s]] IBOC ([[in-band on-channel]]) technology.\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Bonneville International announced that WTOP would move to a new primary frequency of 103.5 FM, then held by classical station [[WGMS (defunct)|WGMS]] (which would move to 103.9 and 104.1 FM). WTOP's longtime facility at 1500 AM, as well as both FM translators (107.7 in Warrenton and low-powered 104.3 in [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]]), would be reassigned to the new \"[[WTWP|Washington Post Radio]]\" for a March 30, 2006 launch date. Fittingly, this new partnership also signaled the ''Post'''s return to the radio scene on the very same dial spot WTOP once held.  The station has been dominant in the 25-54 demographics since moving to FM.\n\nThe stations' respective call signs were changed as of January 11, 2006: the former WTOP pair became WTWP (The Washington Post) and WTOP's new primary stations assumed the WTOP calls. [[HD Radio]] [[digital subchannel]]s of the 103.5 carrier originally had broadcast Bonneville International's \"iChannel\" music format, which features unsigned, independent rock bands on the HD2 channel, and the HD3 channel aired continuous traffic and weather updates.  Later iChannel was dropped for an [[Local marketing agreement|LMA]] of the HD2 to a group that currently airs programming aimed at the South Asian community in the Washington area. Sometime in or before June 2013, that LMA was replaced with [[Voice of Russia|the predecessor]] to what is now [[Radio Sputnik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_06_13/VoR-6th-Video-Conference-The-PRISM-of-Snooping-2417/?slide-1 |title=VoR 6th Video Conference The PRISM of Snooping |date=June 13, 2013 |website=sputniknews.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}} See caption under top photo for relevant information.</ref> As of July 1, 2017, WTOP-HD2 began broadcasting the feed from [[WFED]] (1500 AM),<ref name=\"dcrtv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcrtv.com/index.html |title=Radio Sputnik Off WTOP - 6/29 |date=June 29, 2017 |website=www.dcrtv.com |access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref> after Radio Sputnik moved its Washington DC-area broadcasting to conventional (non-digital) frequency 105.5&nbsp;MHz. Currently, WTOP-FM's HD3 channel is carrying a wide-ranging pop music channel called [[WWFD|\"The Gamut\"]].\n\nIn 2006, WTOP dropped its long-standing association with [[The Weather Channel]] and began airing weather reports exclusively from [[WJLA-TV]] all day long. Previously, WTOP had used weather reports from WJLA chief meteorologist [[Doug Hill (meteorologist)|Doug Hill]] during morning and evening rush hours and The Weather Channel all other times.  Until 2015, the station used all WJLA meteorologists, not just Doug Hill. WJLA's \"Live Super Doppler 7\" has been featured in weather reports as necessary. In 2015, WTOP began airing weather reports and using meteorologists exclusively from [[WRC-TV]] all day long.\n\nIn 2007, the WTOP radio configuration was realigned once again. WTLP-FM (formerly WGYS) at 103.9 picked up the WTOP simulcast on April 6, 2007 after the adult hits \"George 104\" simulcast with WXGG (now [[WPRS-FM]], since sold to Radio One) was broken up, and adopted the WTLP calls on July 5, 2007.\n\nAlso in 2007, WTOP began broadcasting on WJLA's \"Weather Now\" digital sub-channel, which is carried on cable systems well beyond WTOP's broadcast area, though this was ended in late July 2009.\n\nIn May 2007, WTOP sold the naming rights to its \"Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center\" (its nickname for its studio) to area business [[Ledo Pizza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcrtv.org/ledo.mp3 |title=DCRTV.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>  That sponsorship concluded at the end of 2007.  Other sponsorship continues, with sportscasts being \"fed\" by Ledo Pizza.\n\nWTOP AM (which was now on 820 in Frederick) changed its calls to WTWT and switched to the ''Washington Post Radio'' simulcast on June 28, 2007. On September 20, 2007, the 1500/107.7/820 multicast changed format over to a general talk format as \"Talk Radio 3WT\" under the WWWT/WWWT-FM/WWWB call letters, which was cancelled on August 11, 2008. WWWT and WWWB took over the \"Federal News Radio\" format (and for the 1500&nbsp;kHz facility, the [[WFED]] calls),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3wtradio.com/?sid=1457419&nid=24|title=Federal News Radio Expands to Full Market Signal (3wtradio.com)|author=|date=|website=3wtradio.com}}</ref> while WWWT-FM went back to simulcasting WTOP-FM. The former WFED took over the WTOP callsign on the AM dial and became a simulcast of WTOP, with preemptions for sporting events. On June 13, 2009, the 1050 AM frequency changed to a separate [[Talk radio|news/talk]] format, operated by [[Air America Radio]] as [[WBQH|WZAA]]. On January 26, 2010, following the shutdown of Air America Radio, WZAA returned to the WTOP simulcast. It took back the WTOP call letters on February 1, 2010.  WTOP AM left the simulcast on June 23, 2010, as Bonneville leased the station to [[United Media Group]].  United Media changed the call letters to [[WBQH]] and flipped to [[Regional Mexican]].\n\nIn March 2008, WTOP-FM completed a year-long, $2.5-million state-of-the-art renovation of its newsroom and studios, the first since 1989 when the station moved into the building it presently occupies in northwest Washington.\n\nIn 2008, WTOP-FM generated $51.75-million in revenue, the sixth-highest total for any radio station in the United States and the only station not based in New York City or Los Angeles to crack the top ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvbroadcasting.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=16852&p=149992 |title=WVbroadcasting.net |publisher=WVbroadcasting.net |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2009, the station generated $51-million in revenue, good for second among all radio stations in the United States, trailing only [[KIIS-FM]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/03/15/daily49.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= March 17, 2010|accessdate=2011-12-03 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref> In 2010, WTOP generated $57.225-million in revenue, making it tops among radio station in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.kelseygroup.com/index.php/2011/03/28/wtop-am-takes-over-the-top-billing-station/ |title=BIA/Kelsey |publisher=Blog.kelseygroup.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> In 2011 WTOP once again generated more revenue than any other station in the United States, this time with $64 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/04/12/wtop-remains-nations-top-biller.html |title=Bizjournals.com |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= April 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-13 |first=Jeff |last=Clabaugh}}</ref>\n[[File:WTOP reporter filing story on park bench Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|right|WTOP reporter filing story, [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration Day 2013]]]]\nIn 2010, WTOP-FM's coverage of the record Washington-area snowfalls in early February earned it record ratings as the only local media outlet on the air and covering the storm live all day and night.

This meant that Lisa Baden, the longtime \"voice of D.C.-area traffic\" and a Metro Networks employee, was forced to leave the station in what WTOP's Vice President of News and Programming Jim Farley said was strictly a business decision. Farley said WTOP tried to bring Baden and other Metro Networks employees to WTOP, but they have clauses in their contracts prohibiting them from working for competitors for one year.
