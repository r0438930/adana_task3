Incorporation by reference is often done in creating laws as well as in [[Contract|contract law]] and [[Property law|trust and estate law]].\n\nIn law regarding [[Will and testament|wills]], it is a doctrine at [[common law]] which allows a testator, or a creator of a will, to dispose of assets in his estate in accordance with a separate document. To be valid, such a document must comply with the following requirements:\n# it must have existed at the time the will was executed;\n# the will must describe the document with particularity, so that it may be identified; and\n# the will must clearly manifest the intent that the document be incorporated.\nAn exception to the first requirement is made for small gifts of tangible [[personal property]], such as household furniture and items of sentimental value.\n\nOral instructions can ''not'' be subject to incorporation by reference. For example, if a [[testator]] states in the will that he has recited to a third party the intended disposition of testamentary assets, such attempt to circumvent the requirements of a written will is [[Void (law)|void]].\n\nIn American [[administrative law]], incorporation by reference is a drafting tool that enables federal agencies to give legal effect to materials that are already published elsewhere.  This is allowed under a provision of [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|the Freedom of Information Act]], 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1).  Section 552(a) requires agencies to publish regulations in the [[Federal Register]] in order to enforce them.  Section 552(a)(1) provides that if material published elsewhere is \"reasonably available to the class of persons affected\" and the Director of the Federal Register approves its incorporation by reference, that material will be \"deemed published\" in the Federal Register.
