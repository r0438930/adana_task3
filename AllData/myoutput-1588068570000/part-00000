It was written primarily by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] songwriting partnership. The lyrics refer to [[Penny Lane, Liverpool|Penny Lane]], a street in [[Liverpool]], and make mention of the sights and characters that McCartney recalled from his upbringing in the city.\n\nThe Beatles began recording \"Penny Lane\" in December 1966, intending it as a song for their album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. Instead, after it was issued as a single to satisfy record company demand for a new release, the band adhered to their policy of omitting previously released singles from their albums. The song features numerous [[key change]]s that occur mid-verse and between its choruses. Session musician [[David Mason (trumpeter)|David Mason]] played a [[piccolo trumpet]] solo over its bridge section.\n\n\"Penny Lane\" was a top-five hit across Europe and topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In Britain, due to chart protocol regarding double A-sides, it was the first Beatles single since \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" in 1963 to fail to reach number 1 on the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart. In November 1967, \"Penny Lane\" was included on the US ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'' album. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the track at number 456 on its list of the \"[[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\". In 2006, ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' ranked the song at number 9 of \"The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs\".\n\n==Background and inspiration==\n[[Penny Lane, Liverpool|Penny Lane]] is a road in the south Liverpool suburb of [[Mossley Hill]]. The name also applies to the area surrounding its junction with [[Smithdown Road, Liverpool|Smithdown Road]] and Allerton Road, and to the roundabout at Smithdown Place that was the location for a major bus terminus, originally an important tram junction of [[Liverpool Corporation Tramways]].{{sfn|Davies|2016|loc=\"Beatles Places\" > \"Penny Lane\"}} The roundabout was a common stopping place for [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] during their years as schoolchildren and students.{{sfn|Davies|2016|loc=\"Beatles Places\" > \"Penny Lane\"}} Bus journeys via Penny Lane and the area itself subsequently became familiar elements in the early years of the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] songwriting partnership.{{sfn|Womack|2014|pp=724\u201325}} In 2009, McCartney reflected:\n<blockquote>\"Penny Lane\" was kind of nostalgic, but it was really [about] a place that John and I knew ... I'd get a bus to his house and I'd have to change at Penny Lane, or the same with him to me, so we often hung out at that terminus, like a roundabout. It was a place that we both knew, and so we both knew the things that turned up in the story.<ref name=\"clash interview\">{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Simon|title=Paul McCartney Interview: The story behind the classics|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/paul-mccartney-interview|publisher=[[Clash (magazine)|clashmusic.com]]|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLennon's original lyrics for \"[[In My Life]]\" had included a reference to Penny Lane.{{sfn|Turner|2012|p=106}} Soon after the Beatles recorded \"In My Life\" in October 1965, McCartney mentioned to an interviewer that he wanted to write a song about Penny Lane. A year later, he was spurred to write the song once presented with Lennon's \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=84}}{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|pp=111\u201312, 391}} McCartney also cited [[Dylan Thomas]]'s nostalgic poem \"[[Fern Hill]]\" as an inspiration for \"Penny Lane\".{{sfn|Womack|2014|pp=722, 724\u201325}} Lennon co-wrote the lyrics with McCartney.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=222}}{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=391}} He recalled in a 1970 interview: \"The bank was ''there'', and ''that'' was where the trams sheds were and people waiting and the inspector stood ''there'', the fire engines were down ''there''. It was reliving childhood.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=222}}\n\nWriting for the song took place early in the sessions for what became the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album,{{sfn|Sounes|2010|pp=160\u201361}} which commenced following a three-month period when the Beatles had pursued individual interests.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=367, 371}} Beatles biographer [[Ian MacDonald]] suggested an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] influence, saying that the lyrical imagery points to McCartney first taking LSD in late 1966. MacDonald concluded that the lyric \"And though she feels as if she's in a play / She is anyway\" was one of the more \"LSD-redolent phrases\" in the Beatles' catalogue.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=223}} Music critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Tony Tyler]] similarly described the subject matter as \"essentially 'Liverpool-on-a-sunny-hallucinogenic-afternoon'\".{{sfn|Carr|Tyler|1978|p=62}}\n\n==Composition==\n===Music===\n[[File:Penny Lane - Barber.jpg|thumb|The barber shop (pictured in 2018) formerly owned by Harry Bioletti, who is referred to in the song as \"a barber showing photographs / Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known\".]]\n\"Penny Lane\" begins in the [[Key (music)|key]] of B major{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=497}} and is in [[4/4 time]] throughout.<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/pl.shtml|first=Alan W.|last=Pollack|title=Notes on 'Penny Lane'|publisher=Soundscapes|date=1995|accessdate=13 June 2019}}</ref> The song comprises three rounds of two verses and a chorus, with the chorus repeated during the final round.<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\" /> In its melody, the composition has a double tonic structure of B major verse (in I\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V cycles) and A major chorus connected by formal [[Pivot chord|pivoting]] dominant chords.{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=658}} In the opening bars in B major, after singing \"In Penny Lane\" (in an F{{music|#}}\u2013B\u2013C{{music|#}}\u2013D{{music|#}} melody note ascent) McCartney sings the major third of the first chord in the progression (on \"Lane\") and major seventh (on \"barber\") then switches to a Bm chord, singing the flattened third notes (on \"know\" with a i<sup>7</sup> [Bm<sup>7</sup>] chord) and flattened seventh notes (on \"come and ''go''\" [with a {{music|b}}VI<sup>maj7</sup> [G<sup>maj7</sup>] chord] and \"''say'' hello\" [with a V<sup>7sus4</sup> [F{{music|#}}<sup>7sus4</sup>] chord]).{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp=658\u201359}} Musicologist Dominic Pedler describes this as a profound and surprising innovation involving abandoning mid-cycle what initially appears to be a standard I\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V [[doo-wop]] pop chord cycle.{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=659}}\n\nThe song features [[verse\u2013chorus form|contrasting verse\u2013chorus form]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=86}} To get from the verse \"In the pouring rain \u2013 very strange\" McCartney uses an E chord as a pivot, (it is a IV chord in the preceding B key and a V in the looming A key) to take listeners back into the chorus (\"Penny Lane is in my ears&nbsp;...\"). Likewise to get back from the chorus of \"There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back&nbsp;...\", McCartney uses an F{{music|#}}<sup>7</sup> pivot chord, which is a VI in the old A key and a V in the new B key. The lyrics \"very strange\" and \"meanwhile back\" reflect these tonal shifts.{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp=348\u201349}}\n\n===Lyrics===\nLyrically there are several ambiguous and surreal images. The song is seemingly narrated on a fine summer day (\"beneath the blue suburban skies\"), yet at the same time it is raining (\"the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain\") and approaching winter (\"selling poppies from a tray\" implies [[Remembrance Day]], 11 November). MacDonald stated: \"Seemingly naturalistic, the lyric scene is actually kaleidoscopic. As well as raining and shining at the same time, it is simultaneously summer and winter.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|page=179}} The fireman and fire engine referred to in the lyrics were based on memories of the fire station at Mather Avenue,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=307}} while the barber shop was Bioletti's, where McCartney, Harrison and Lennon each had their hair cut as children.{{sfn|Turner|2012|pp=132, 133}} The line \"Four of fish and finger pies\" is British slang. \"A four of fish\" refers to fourpennyworth of [[fish and chips]], while \"finger pie\" is sexual slang of the time, referring to intimate fondlings.<ref name=\"Blinded\">{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Brent|year=2005|title=Blinded by the Lyrics: Behind the Lines of Rock & Roll's Most Baffling Songs|p=171|location=New York, NY|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=978-08065-2695-9}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|According to MacDonald, this phrase was most likely Lennon's idea.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|page=222fn}}}}\n\nAccording to music critic and musicologist [[Wilfrid Mellers]], writing in his 1973 book ''Twilight of the Gods'': \"For both musical and verbal reasons, the song comes out as childishly merry yet dreamily wild at the same time.

It was written primarily by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] songwriting partnership. The lyrics refer to [[Penny Lane, Liverpool|Penny Lane]], a street in [[Liverpool]], and make mention of the sights and characters that McCartney recalled from his upbringing in the city.\n\nThe Beatles began recording \"Penny Lane\" in December 1966, intending it as a song for their album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. Instead, after it was issued as a single to satisfy record company demand for a new release, the band adhered to their policy of omitting previously released singles from their albums. The song features numerous [[key change]]s that occur mid-verse and between its choruses. Session musician [[David Mason (trumpeter)|David Mason]] played a [[piccolo trumpet]] solo over its bridge section.\n\n\"Penny Lane\" was a top-five hit across Europe and topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In Britain, due to chart protocol regarding double A-sides, it was the first Beatles single since \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" in 1963 to fail to reach number 1 on the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart. In November 1967, \"Penny Lane\" was included on the US ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'' album.

The name also applies to the area surrounding its junction with [[Smithdown Road, Liverpool|Smithdown Road]] and Allerton Road, and to the roundabout at Smithdown Place that was the location for a major bus terminus, originally an important tram junction of [[Liverpool Corporation Tramways]].{{sfn|Davies|2016|loc=\"Beatles Places\" > \"Penny Lane\"}} The roundabout was a common stopping place for [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] during their years as schoolchildren and students.{{sfn|Davies|2016|loc=\"Beatles Places\" > \"Penny Lane\"}} Bus journeys via Penny Lane and the area itself subsequently became familiar elements in the early years of the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] songwriting partnership.{{sfn|Womack|2014|pp=724\u201325}} In 2009, McCartney reflected:\n<blockquote>\"Penny Lane\" was kind of nostalgic, but it was really [about] a place that John and I knew ... I'd get a bus to his house and I'd have to change at Penny Lane, or the same with him to me, so we often hung out at that terminus, like a roundabout. It was a place that we both knew, and so we both knew the things that turned up in the story.<ref name=\"clash interview\">{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Simon|title=Paul McCartney Interview: The story behind the classics|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/paul-mccartney-interview|publisher=[[Clash (magazine)|clashmusic.com]]|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLennon's original lyrics for \"[[In My Life]]\" had included a reference to Penny Lane.{{sfn|Turner|2012|p=106}} Soon after the Beatles recorded \"In My Life\" in October 1965, McCartney mentioned to an interviewer that he wanted to write a song about Penny Lane.

MacDonald concluded that the lyric \"And though she feels as if she's in a play / She is anyway\" was one of the more \"LSD-redolent phrases\" in the Beatles' catalogue.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=223}} Music critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Tony Tyler]] similarly described the subject matter as \"essentially 'Liverpool-on-a-sunny-hallucinogenic-afternoon'\".{{sfn|Carr|Tyler|1978|p=62}}\n\n==Composition==\n===Music===\n[[File:Penny Lane - Barber.jpg|thumb|The barber shop (pictured in 2018) formerly owned by Harry Bioletti, who is referred to in the song as \"a barber showing photographs / Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known\".]]\n\"Penny Lane\" begins in the [[Key (music)|key]] of B major{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=497}} and is in [[4/4 time]] throughout.<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/pl.shtml|first=Alan W.|last=Pollack|title=Notes on 'Penny Lane'|publisher=Soundscapes|date=1995|accessdate=13 June 2019}}</ref> The song comprises three rounds of two verses and a chorus, with the chorus repeated during the final round.<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\" /> In its melody, the composition has a double tonic structure of B major verse (in I\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V cycles) and A major chorus connected by formal [[Pivot chord|pivoting]] dominant chords.{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=658}} In the opening bars in B major, after singing \"In Penny Lane\" (in an F{{music|#}}\u2013B\u2013C{{music|#}}\u2013D{{music|#}} melody note ascent) McCartney sings the major third of the first chord in the progression (on \"Lane\") and major seventh (on \"barber\") then switches to a Bm chord, singing the flattened third notes (on \"know\" with a i<sup>7</sup> [Bm<sup>7</sup>] chord) and flattened seventh notes (on \"come and ''go''\" [with a {{music|b}}VI<sup>maj7</sup> [G<sup>maj7</sup>] chord] and \"''say'' hello\" [with a V<sup>7sus4</sup> [F{{music|#}}<sup>7sus4</sup>] chord]).{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp=658\u201359}} Musicologist Dominic Pedler describes this as a profound and surprising innovation involving abandoning mid-cycle what initially appears to be a standard I\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V [[doo-wop]] pop chord cycle.{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=659}}\n\nThe song features [[verse\u2013chorus form|contrasting verse\u2013chorus form]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=86}} To get from the verse \"In the pouring rain \u2013 very strange\" McCartney uses an E chord as a pivot, (it is a IV chord in the preceding B key and a V in the looming A key) to take listeners back into the chorus (\"Penny Lane is in my ears&nbsp;...\"). Likewise to get back from the chorus of \"There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back&nbsp;...\", McCartney uses an F{{music|#}}<sup>7</sup> pivot chord, which is a VI in the old A key and a V in the new B key. The lyrics \"very strange\" and \"meanwhile back\" reflect these tonal shifts.{{sfn|Pedler|2003|pp=348\u201349}}\n\n===Lyrics===\nLyrically there are several ambiguous and surreal images. The song is seemingly narrated on a fine summer day (\"beneath the blue suburban skies\"), yet at the same time it is raining (\"the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain\") and approaching winter (\"selling poppies from a tray\" implies [[Remembrance Day]], 11 November). MacDonald stated: \"Seemingly naturalistic, the lyric scene is actually kaleidoscopic. As well as raining and shining at the same time, it is simultaneously summer and winter.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|page=179}} The fireman and fire engine referred to in the lyrics were based on memories of the fire station at Mather Avenue,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=307}} while the barber shop was Bioletti's, where McCartney, Harrison and Lennon each had their hair cut as children.{{sfn|Turner|2012|pp=132, 133}} The line \"Four of fish and finger pies\" is British slang. \"A four of fish\" refers to fourpennyworth of [[fish and chips]], while \"finger pie\" is sexual slang of the time, referring to intimate fondlings.<ref name=\"Blinded\">{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Brent|year=2005|title=Blinded by the Lyrics: Behind the Lines of Rock & Roll's Most Baffling Songs|p=171|location=New York, NY|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=978-08065-2695-9}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|According to MacDonald, this phrase was most likely Lennon's idea.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|page=222fn}}}}\n\nAccording to music critic and musicologist [[Wilfrid Mellers]], writing in his 1973 book ''Twilight of the Gods'': \"For both musical and verbal reasons, the song comes out as childishly merry yet dreamily wild at the same time.
