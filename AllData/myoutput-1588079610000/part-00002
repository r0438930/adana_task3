The Pirin Mountains mark its eastern edge. The Republic of North Macedonia occupies about two-fifths of the entire geographical region of Macedonia. The rest of the region belongs to Greece and Bulgaria. Most people with a Macedonian identity also refer to the region that constitutes North Macedonia as Vardar Macedonia, the Greek part of Macedonia as Aegean Macedonia, and the Bulgarian part of Macedonia as Pirin Macedonia. In this article, unless otherwise indicated, the name Macedonia refers to the present-day state of the Republic of North Macedonia when discussing geography and history since 1913 and to the larger region as described above when used in earlier historical contexts.\n\nNorth Macedonia\nNorth Macedonia\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\nThe region of Macedonia owes its importance neither to its size nor to its population but rather to its location at a major junction of communication routes\u2014in particular, the great north-south route from the Danube River to the Aegean formed by the valleys of the Morava and Vardar rivers and the ancient east-west trade routes connecting the Black Sea and Istanbul with the Adriatic Sea. Although the majority of the republic\u2019s inhabitants are of Slavic descent and heirs to the Eastern Orthodox tradition of Christianity, 500 years of incorporation into the Ottoman Empire left substantial numbers of other ethnic groups, including Albanians, Turks, Vlachs (Aromani), and Roma (Gypsies). Consequently, Macedonia forms a complex border zone between the major cultural traditions of Europe and Asia.\n\n\nOttoman control was brought to an end by the Balkan Wars (1912\u201313), after which Macedonia was divided among Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia. Following World War I, the Serbian segment was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929). After World War II the Serbian part of Macedonia became a constituent republic within the Federal People\u2019s Republic of Yugoslavia (later Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). The collapse of Yugoslavia led the Republic of Macedonia to declare its independence on September 17, 1991.\n\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription.\nSubscribe today\nThe two major problems facing the newly independent Republic of Macedonia were ensuring for its large Albanian minority the rights of full citizenship and gaining international recognition under its constitutional name and membership in international organizations in the face of strong opposition from Greece, which claimed a monopoly on the use of the term Macedonia. (See Researcher\u2019s Note: Macedonia: a contested name.) After years of largely fruitless UN-mediated negotiations regarding the name issue, in June 2018 Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced that an agreement (thereafter known as the Prespa Agreement) had been reached under which the Macedonian republic would be known both domestically and internationally as the Republic of North Macedonia (Macedonian: Severna Makedonija). By January 2019 the Macedonian and Greek legislatures had both approved the measures necessary to pave the way for formal adoption of the new name, which came into effect on February 12, 2019.\n\n\nLand\nRelief\nGeologically, North Macedonia consists mainly of heavily folded ancient metamorphic rocks, which in the west have been eroded to reveal older granites. In the central region are found sedimentary deposits of more recent age. Traversing the country from north to south is a series of active fault lines, along which earthquakes frequently occur. The most severe of these in recent history occurred at Debar in 1967. Skopje was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1963.\n\nPhysical features of North Macedonia\nPhysical features of North Macedonia\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\nThe mobility of Earth\u2019s crust has also created two tectonic lakes, Prespa and Ohrid, in the southwest and has resulted in the formation of several mineral springs and hot springs.\n\n\nNorth Macedonia is largely mountainous, with many peaks rising above the tree line at 6,600 feet (2,000 metres) above sea level. The highest elevation is at Mount Korab (9,030 feet, or 2,752 metres) on the Albanian border. Near the \u0160ar Mountains in the northwest, the country is covered with forest. Where this has been cleared (and often in the past overgrazed), the thin skeletal soils have been subjected to dramatic erosion and gullying. There are also several broad and fertile valleys that provide good potential for agriculture.\n\nDrainage\nThe greater part of North Macedonia (about nine-tenths of its area) drains southeastward into the Aegean Sea via the Vardar River and its tributaries. Smaller parts of this basin drain into Lake Doiran (Macedonian: Dojran) and into the Aegean via the Strumica and Struma rivers. The remainder of North Macedonia drains northward via the Crni Drim River toward the Adriatic Sea.\n\n\nThe convoluted and fractured geology of the area imposes upon many of these rivers erratic courses that frequently drive through narrow and sometimes spectacular gorges. Such formations facilitate the damming of rivers for electric power generation.\n\nClimate\nNorth Macedonia stands at the junction of two main climatic zones, the Mediterranean and the continental. Periodically, air breaks through mountain barriers to the north and south, bringing dramatically contrasting weather patterns; one example is the cold northerly wind known as the vardarec. Overall, there is a moderate continental climate: temperatures average in the low 30s F (about 0 \u00b0C) in January and rise to the high 60s and 70s F (about 20\u201325 \u00b0C) in July. Annual precipitation is relatively light, between about 20 and 28 inches (about 500 and 700 mm). Rainfalls of less than 1 inch (25.4 mm) in the driest months (July\u2013August) rise to nearly 4 inches (about 100 mm) in October\u2013November. Because of differences in local aspect and relief, there may be considerable variation in the climate, the eastern areas tending to have milder winters and hotter, drier summers and the western (more mountainous) regions having more severe winters.\n\nPlant and animal life\nThe mountainous northwestern parts of North Macedonia support large areas of forest vegetation. On the lower slopes this is principally deciduous woodland, but conifers grow at elevations as high as 6,600 feet (2,000 metres). Some areas of forest have been cleared to provide rough summer pasture. The forests support a variety of wildlife, including wild pigs, wolves, bears, and lynx. The dry and warm summers result in an abundance of insect life, with species of grasshoppers much in evidence, along with numerous small lizards.\n\nPeople\nEthnic groups\nThe population of the Republic of North Macedonia is diverse. At the beginning of the 21st century, nearly two-thirds of the population identified themselves as Macedonians. Macedonians generally trace their descent to the Slavic tribes that moved into the region between the 6th and 8th centuries CE. Albanians are the largest and most-important minority in the Republic of North Macedonia. According to the 2002 census, they made up about one-fourth of the population. The Albanians\u2014most of whom trace their descent to the ancient Illyrians\u2014are concentrated in the northwestern part of the country, near the borders with Albania and Kosovo. Albanians form majorities in some 16 of North Macedonia\u2019s 80 municipalities. Other, much smaller minorities (constituting less than 5 percent of the population each) include the Turks, Roma, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Vlachs (Aromani). The Turkish minority is mostly scattered across central and western North Macedonia, a legacy of the 500-year rule of the Ottoman Empire. The majority of Vlachs, who speak a language closely related to Romanian, live in the old mountain city of Kru\u0161evo.\n\nNorth Macedonia: Ethnic composition\nNorth Macedonia: Ethnic composition\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\n\nLanguage\nThe Macedonian language is very closely related to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian and is written in the Cyrillic script. When Serbian rule replaced that of the Ottoman Turks in 1913, the Serbs officially denied Macedonian linguistic distinctness and treated the Macedonian language as a dialect of Serbo-Croatian. The Macedonian language was not officially recognized until the establishment of Macedonia as a constituent republic of communist Yugoslavia in 1945.\n\nReligion\nReligious affiliation is a particularly important subject in North Macedonia because it is so closely tied to ethnic and national identity. With the exception of Bosniaks, the majority of Slavic speakers living in the region of Macedonia are Orthodox Christian. Macedonians, Serbs, and Bulgarians, however, have established their own autocephalous Orthodox churches in an effort to assert the legitimacy of their national identities. The majority Greeks in the region of Greek Macedonia, who also identify themselves as Macedonians, are Orthodox as well, but they belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. Turks and the great majority of both Albanians and Roma are Muslims. Altogether, about one-third of the population is of the Islamic faith.\n\nNorth Macedonia: Religious affiliation\nNorth Macedonia: Religious affiliation\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\n\nSettlement patterns\nSuccessive waves of migration, as well as economic and political modernization, have left their mark in a diversity of settlement patterns. The inhabitants of the highlands are generally shepherds. In more fertile areas, small-scale subsistence and market-oriented agriculture are practiced. Several small market towns are of great antiquity. In Roman times Bitola was a commercial centre known as Heraclea Lyncestis. Ohrid became a major administrative and ecclesiastical centre in the early Middle Ages. The coming of the Ottoman Turks in the 14th century promoted the growth of Skopje as a governmental and military centre and created large agrarian estates, which were later socialized by the communists and given over to extensive mechanized cultivation. This latter process was responsible for the growth, beginning in 1945, of Kavardarci and Veles.\n\nIndustrialization in the second half of the 20th century had a dramatic impact upon population distribution. The population of Skopje grew to nearly one-fourth of the population of the republic, its attractiveness as a pole for migration having been enhanced both by its location at a transcontinental transportation route and by its status as the republic\u2019s capital. Acting as a reasonably effective counterforce to the pull of Skopje is the growth of tourism around Ohrid. At the beginning of the 21st century, about three-fifths of the population of North Macedonia was urban.\n\nNorth Macedonia: Urban-rural\nNorth Macedonia: Urban-rural\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\n\nDemographic trends\nHistorically, the Balkans have experienced high rates of natural increase in population. The rate declined remarkably in the 20th century in response to industrialization and urbanization. The rate of natural increase in North Macedonia at the end of the first decade of the 21st century was about three-fifths less than it had been in the mid-1990s. Birth rates for the same period declined relatively steadily by about one-fifth, to about three-fifths of the world average. Movement from rural to urban areas in North Macedonia in the early 21st century was much more common than the reverse. Emigration to other parts of Europe, as well as to North America and Australia, has also had a significant influence on demographic trends in North Macedonia.\n\nNorth Macedonia: Age breakdown\nNorth Macedonia: Age breakdown\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\nEconomy\nAlong with the rest of the Balkan Peninsula, Macedonia underwent an impressive economic transformation after 1945\u2014in this case within the framework provided by Yugoslavia\u2019s system of \u201csocialist self-management.\u201d Even so, Macedonia remained the poorest of the Yugoslav republics and was included throughout the communist period in the list of regions that merited economic aid from wealthier parts of the federation. While this status undoubtedly brought much investment, several projects were placed without adequate attention to the supply of materials or access to markets. A prime example was the choice of Skopje as the site for a steel industry.\n\n\nAlthough socialized production dominated industrial and commercial life after the communists\u2019 rise to power in 1945, the private sector remained important in agriculture, craft production, and retail trade. About 70 percent of agricultural land was held privately, accounting for some 50 percent of output. However, privately owned enterprises were typically traditionalist in structure and outlook, and, even after the liberalization of the communist system in 1991, they were unable to develop a dynamic economic role.\n\nFollowing the onset of the Yugoslav civil war in 1991, the economic position of Macedonia became very precarious. The republic had previously depended heavily on Yugoslav rather than foreign markets, and its participation in Yugoslavia\u2019s export trade was heavily skewed toward the countries of the former Soviet bloc, which were concurrently undergoing economic crises. United Nations sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia (the federation of Serbia and Montenegro) added to these difficulties by throttling the transport of goods through Macedonia. Also, an acrimonious dispute with Greece over the name of the republic frustrated Macedonia\u2019s quest for international recognition, thereby deterring foreign investment and delaying economic reform. By 2018 that dispute was resolved, with Macedonia officially becoming the Republic of North Macedonia.\n\n\nAs early as the mid-1990s, however, Macedonia had begun to find new trading partners, and the economy began to prosper. Though gross domestic product (GDP) dipped at the turn of the 21st century, it rebounded quickly, and the country weathered the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 better than many other countries. Nevertheless, unemployment remained high, exceeding 30 percent for much of the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nAbout Us & Legal Info\nPartner Program\nContact Us\nPrivacy Notice\nTerms of Use\n\u00a92020 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Main|Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology}}\nThe name ''Macedonia'' derives from the {{Lang-el|\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}} (''{{transl|el|ISO|{{Audio|Makedonia pronunciation.ogg|Makedhon\u00eda|help=no}}}}''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364599|title=\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 |work=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott}}</ref><ref name=\"Macedonia\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Macedonia|title=Macedonia |last=Harper |first=Douglas |dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref> a [[Macedon|kingdom]] (later, [[Macedonia (region)|region]]) named after the [[ancient Macedonians]], who were the descendants of a [[Bronze-age]] Greek [[tribe]].<ref name=\"poulton'>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=j_NbmSoRsRcC&pg=PA1&dq=macedonia+is+greek#v=onepage&q=Macedones&f=false |title=Who are the Macedonians? |last=Poulton |first=Hugh |date=1995 |publisher=Hurst |isbn=9781850652380 |pages=44 |language=en}}</ref> Their name, {{Lang|el|\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2}} ({{Lang|el-Latn|Makedh\u00f3nes}}), is cognate to the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective [[Makednos|\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2]] ({{Lang|el-Latn|makedhn\u00f3s}}), meaning \"tall, slim\".<ref name=\"Macedonia\" /> It was traditionally derived from the [[Indo-European root]] ''*mak-'', meaning 'long' or 'slender'.

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed. Then in 148 BC, Macedonia was fully annexed by the Romans.<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\">N. K.

Therefore ancient Macedonia did not significantly extend beyond its current borders (in Greece). To the east, Macedonia ended according to [[Strabo]] at the river [[Struma (river)|Strymon]], although he mentions that other writers placed Macedonia's border with [[Thrace]] at the river [[Nestos (river)|Nestos]],<ref>{{cite book |first=D.

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions.

Following the campaigns of [[Basil II]], all of Macedonia returned to the Byzantine state. Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] 1203&ndash;1204, a short-lived [[Crusader states|Crusader]] realm, the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], was established in the region. It was subdued by the co-founder of the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in 1224, when Greek Macedonia and the city of [[Thessaloniki]] were at the heart of the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. Returning to the restored [[Byzantine Empire]] shortly thereafter, Greek Macedonia remained in Byzantine hands until the 1340s, when all of Macedonia (except Thessaloniki, and possibly [[Veria]]) was conquered by the Serbian ruler [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]].<ref>Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', 301&ndash;302</ref> Divided between Serbia and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] after Du\u0161an's death, the region fell quickly to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], with Thessaloniki alone holding out until 1387.

The memory of the event has survived through folk traditions containing fact and myths. Apostolos Vacalopoulos records the following Turkish tradition connected with the capture of Thessaloniki:<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia 1354&ndash;1833'', [http://www.promacedonia.org/en/av/av_3_4.htm 97]</ref>\n{{quote|\"While [[Murad II|Murad]] was asleep in his palace at Yenitsa, the story has it that, God appeared to him in a dream and gave him a lovely rose to smell, full of perfume. The sultan was so amazed by its beauty that he begged God to give it to him. God replied, \"This rose, Murad, is Thessalonica. Know that it is to you granted by heaven to enjoy it. Do not waste time; go and take it\". Complying with this exhortation from, Murad marched against Thessalonica and, as it has been written, captured it.\"}}\n\n[[Thessaloniki]] became a centre of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration in the Balkans. While most of Macedonia was ruled by the Ottomans, in [[Mount Athos]] the monastic community continued to exist in a state of autonomy. The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed.

Therefore ancient Macedonia did not significantly extend beyond its current borders (in Greece).

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions.

Following the campaigns of [[Basil II]], all of Macedonia returned to the Byzantine state. Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] 1203&ndash;1204, a short-lived [[Crusader states|Crusader]] realm, the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], was established in the region. It was subdued by the co-founder of the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in 1224, when Greek Macedonia and the city of [[Thessaloniki]] were at the heart of the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. Returning to the restored [[Byzantine Empire]] shortly thereafter, Greek Macedonia remained in Byzantine hands until the 1340s, when all of Macedonia (except Thessaloniki, and possibly [[Veria]]) was conquered by the Serbian ruler [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]].<ref>Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', 301&ndash;302</ref> Divided between Serbia and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] after Du\u0161an's death, the region fell quickly to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], with Thessaloniki alone holding out until 1387.

The memory of the event has survived through folk traditions containing fact and myths. Apostolos Vacalopoulos records the following Turkish tradition connected with the capture of Thessaloniki:<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia 1354&ndash;1833'', [http://www.promacedonia.org/en/av/av_3_4.htm 97]</ref>\n{{quote|\"While [[Murad II|Murad]] was asleep in his palace at Yenitsa, the story has it that, God appeared to him in a dream and gave him a lovely rose to smell, full of perfume. The sultan was so amazed by its beauty that he begged God to give it to him. God replied, \"This rose, Murad, is Thessalonica. Know that it is to you granted by heaven to enjoy it. Do not waste time; go and take it\". Complying with this exhortation from, Murad marched against Thessalonica and, as it has been written, captured it.\"}}\n\n[[Thessaloniki]] became a centre of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration in the Balkans. While most of Macedonia was ruled by the Ottomans, in [[Mount Athos]] the monastic community continued to exist in a state of autonomy. The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.
