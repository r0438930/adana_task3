{"title_page": "History of surfing", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=August 2015}}\nThe riding of [[wind waves|waves]] has likely existed since humans began swimming in the [[ocean]]. In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]]. The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].\n\n[[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]\n\n== Polynesian origins ==\nThe art of surfing, known as ''he\u02bbe \u02bbana'' (''he\u02bbe'' means ''to surf'', and ''\u02bbana'' is the [[Nominalization|nominalizing]] particle) in the [[Hawaiian language]], was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\n\nIn Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied\nsurfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\n\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.\n\n== Pre-Incan Per\u00fa origins and debate ==\n\nThe practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called\n\"[[Caballitos de Totora]]\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave in the world, 'Chicama,' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\n\nIt is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.\n\n==Ancient Hawaii==\nThe [[ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\n\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|to|18|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=10}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>\nSome ancient sites still popular today include [[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] and [[Holualoa Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/about/pdfs/kic_brochure.pdf |title=Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Kulana Wahi pana - Restoring Sacred Places |publisher=brochure published by Kamehameha Investment Corporation |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Contact Hawaii ==\nAfter [[History of Hawaii#Contact|contact]] with the [[Western world|Western World]] Hawaiian culture was [[History of Hawaii|forced to change]].

Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population [[Christianity and colonialism|from their traditional beliefs into Christians]]. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.\n\nIt was not until [[Waikiki]] became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. [[Mark Twain]] attempted it but failed in 1866. [[Jack London]] tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, [[George Freeth]] and [[Duke Kahanamoku]], became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.\n\nAs the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose groups of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy [[haole]] tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories.<ref name=\":0\" /> A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there.This was  the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, and South Africa, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==North America==\n\n{{See also|Surfing in the United States}}\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California.

Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.\n\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.\n\n[[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"</blockquote>\n\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the \"[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>\n\n[[Surf film|Surfing documentaries]] have been one of the main ways in which [[surf culture|surfing culture]] grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.\n\n==Professional surfing==\n\nDefining the scope of professional surfing is difficult, because like in many [[extreme sport]]s, there is more than one model for what constitutes a professional. There are three main contemporary modes of making money purely as an active surfer: [[sponsorship]], [[World Surf League|surf contests]], and [[internet celebrity|social media influence]]. Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.\n\nIf a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching) than the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).\n\nIn 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from basic action: simply riding a good wave, to a more style oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, and artistry began to become important. Becoming even more important than catching the best wave and staying on it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.\n\nThrough numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary [[Bustin' Down the Door]] much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 year tensions arose between not only the Americans and international surfers, but between the local Hawaiians and the [[haoles]] generally.\n\nInto the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from [[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as [[Town & Country Surf Designs]] and [[Body Glove]]. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.\n[[File:Professional_surfing.jpg|thumb|A surfer dropping in]]\n\n==Technological innovations in surfing==\n\nSurfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.\n\nMuch of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the [[wetsuit]]. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-[[polystyrene]] and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-[[Surfboard fin|fin]] and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until [[Tom Blake (surfer)|Tom Blake]] added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.\n\nMuch of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a [[Developed World|developed-world]] sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced [[fiberglass]] boards, quality [[wetsuit]]s, [[Off-road vehicle|offroad vehicles]], and inexpensive international [[Jet Age|travel]], surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century much of the worldwide coast line has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.\n[[File:Surfboard_technology.jpg|thumb|A quiver of surfboards]]\n\n===The Short Board Revolution===\n\nThe ancient Hawaiians had mainly three type of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 15 to 20 feet long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 6 or 7 feet long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern body board. None of these had a fin.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboads were longboards, generally 9 feet or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and shifted to lighter materials like balsa wood and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.\n\nThroughout the decades shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surboard production boom of the 1960s the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). But often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and increasingly mid-wave turns were growing in popularity. One basic reason for longer and thicker boards generally is they paddle faster. But faster waves were also becoming more popular; waves with narrower take off zones. By the early 1970s, shortboards began rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelty but fulltime craft. So design innovation was not far behind. By the 1980s the styles have become very refined and the second large burst of surf-culture popularity in the mainstream occurred as the 3-fin, 6-foot-tall \"thruster\" shortboard began to take over. A generally narrow board with small variance in design, it almost always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and is approximately the height of the rider. This basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing it has slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.\n\n==Style versus performance==\n\n\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to [[skiing]] or [[skateboarding]], which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.\n\nThe variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particually \"surfing the web\" is a particular common example. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.\n\nThere are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.\n\n==Surfing's Impact on Popular Culture==\n\nComparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.\n\nIn America and Australia the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early 1960s TV show, [[Gidget]]. The attention that surfing gets in the popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.\n\nFashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of [[boardshorts]] as swim gear for men.\n\n==Alternatives to wind-generated waves==\n\nSince their invention, surfers have sometimes used [[wave pools]] to attempt surfing, but generally the waves were too small and not well formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie [[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]] started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to construct wave pools specifically designed for surfing. As of 2020 there are only few around the world open to the public, but with many more currently in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: ''Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch''.\n\n[[Wakeboarding]] is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be [[River surfing|surfable]]. At certain times of year on large rivers, [[River surfing#Tidal bores|tidal bores are surfable]].

In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]]. The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].\n\n[[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]\n\n== Polynesian origins ==\nThe art of surfing, known as ''he\u02bbe \u02bbana'' (''he\u02bbe'' means ''to surf'', and ''\u02bbana'' is the [[Nominalization|nominalizing]] particle) in the [[Hawaiian language]], was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\n\nIn Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied\nsurfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\n\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.\n\n== Pre-Incan Per\u00fa origins and debate ==\n\nThe practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called\n\"[[Caballitos de Totora]]\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave in the world, 'Chicama,' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\n\nIt is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.\n\n==Ancient Hawaii==\nThe [[ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\n\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|to|18|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=10}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>\nSome ancient sites still popular today include [[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] and [[Holualoa Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/about/pdfs/kic_brochure.pdf |title=Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Kulana Wahi pana - Restoring Sacred Places |publisher=brochure published by Kamehameha Investment Corporation |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Contact Hawaii ==\nAfter [[History of Hawaii#Contact|contact]] with the [[Western world|Western World]] Hawaiian culture was [[History of Hawaii|forced to change]].

Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population [[Christianity and colonialism|from their traditional beliefs into Christians]]. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.\n\nIt was not until [[Waikiki]] became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. [[Mark Twain]] attempted it but failed in 1866. [[Jack London]] tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, [[George Freeth]] and [[Duke Kahanamoku]], became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.\n\nAs the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose groups of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy [[haole]] tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories.<ref name=\":0\" /> A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there.This was  the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, and South Africa, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==North America==\n\n{{See also|Surfing in the United States}}\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California.

Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.\n\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.\n\n[[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"</blockquote>\n\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the \"[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>\n\n[[Surf film|Surfing documentaries]] have been one of the main ways in which [[surf culture|surfing culture]] grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.\n\n==Professional surfing==\n\nDefining the scope of professional surfing is difficult, because like in many [[extreme sport]]s, there is more than one model for what constitutes a professional. There are three main contemporary modes of making money purely as an active surfer: [[sponsorship]], [[World Surf League|surf contests]], and [[internet celebrity|social media influence]]. Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.\n\nIf a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching) than the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).\n\nIn 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from basic action: simply riding a good wave, to a more style oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, and artistry began to become important. Becoming even more important than catching the best wave and staying on it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.\n\nThrough numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary [[Bustin' Down the Door]] much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 year tensions arose between not only the Americans and international surfers, but between the local Hawaiians and the [[haoles]] generally.\n\nInto the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from [[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as [[Town & Country Surf Designs]] and [[Body Glove]]. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.\n[[File:Professional_surfing.jpg|thumb|A surfer dropping in]]\n\n==Technological innovations in surfing==\n\nSurfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.\n\nMuch of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the [[wetsuit]]. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-[[polystyrene]] and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-[[Surfboard fin|fin]] and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until [[Tom Blake (surfer)|Tom Blake]] added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.\n\nMuch of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a [[Developed World|developed-world]] sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced [[fiberglass]] boards, quality [[wetsuit]]s, [[Off-road vehicle|offroad vehicles]], and inexpensive international [[Jet Age|travel]], surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century much of the worldwide coast line has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.\n[[File:Surfboard_technology.jpg|thumb|A quiver of surfboards]]\n\n===The Short Board Revolution===\n\nThe ancient Hawaiians had mainly three type of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 15 to 20 feet long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 6 or 7 feet long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern body board. None of these had a fin.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboads were longboards, generally 9 feet or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and shifted to lighter materials like balsa wood and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.\n\nThroughout the decades shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surboard production boom of the 1960s the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). But often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and increasingly mid-wave turns were growing in popularity. One basic reason for longer and thicker boards generally is they paddle faster. But faster waves were also becoming more popular; waves with narrower take off zones. By the early 1970s, shortboards began rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelty but fulltime craft. So design innovation was not far behind. By the 1980s the styles have become very refined and the second large burst of surf-culture popularity in the mainstream occurred as the 3-fin, 6-foot-tall \"thruster\" shortboard began to take over. A generally narrow board with small variance in design, it almost always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and is approximately the height of the rider. This basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing it has slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.\n\n==Style versus performance==\n\n\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to [[skiing]] or [[skateboarding]], which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.\n\nThe variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particually \"surfing the web\" is a particular common example. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.\n\nThere are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.\n\n==Surfing's Impact on Popular Culture==\n\nComparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.\n\nIn America and Australia the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early 1960s TV show, [[Gidget]]. The attention that surfing gets in the popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.\n\nFashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of [[boardshorts]] as swim gear for men.\n\n==Alternatives to wind-generated waves==\n\nSince their invention, surfers have sometimes used [[wave pools]] to attempt surfing, but generally the waves were too small and not well formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie [[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]] started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to construct wave pools specifically designed for surfing. As of 2020 there are only few around the world open to the public, but with many more currently in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: ''Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch''.\n\n[[Wakeboarding]] is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be [[River surfing|surfable]]. At certain times of year on large rivers, [[River surfing#Tidal bores|tidal bores are surfable]]. People have also surfed alongside large [[cargo ships]] as their wakes roll into shallower water, and a few people have even surfed the waves caused by calving glaciers.\nThe Wave Bristol opened in The UK as an inland artificial surf site.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thewave.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8Wmho9IiozSDyOcdz-YTIiGTQMLqpaYKiWdehYiAkBxR89gaETJxykaAiKSEALw_wcB|title=The Wave|website=www.thewave.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;General\n*Quinn, Richard. \"Region's First Surfboard Evokes a Wave of Nostalgia\" The Virginian Pilot.
