It was recorded at [[Nothing Studios]] in New Orleans and produced by the band's [[Marilyn Manson|eponymous vocalist]] along with [[Sean Beavan]], former [[Skinny Puppy]] producer [[Dave Ogilvie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The recording of the album was marred by excessive drug use, which provoked a high level of antagonism between band members. Consequently, it was their last release to feature contributions from founding guitarist [[Daisy Berkowitz]], who acrimoniously quit partway through recording.\n\nA [[rock opera]] and a [[concept album]], ''Antichrist Superstar'' was the first installment in a trilogy which included succeeding releases ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998) and ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)]]'' (2000). The central storyline on the album revolved around a supernatural being who seizes all power from humanity in order to initiate an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[End time|end event]]; a [[Populism|populist]] [[demagogue]] who is driven solely by resentment, misanthropy and despair, he uses his newfound position to destroy the world. The record can be seen as a [[Social criticism|social critique]], utilizing this premise as a metaphor for the perceived [[Fascism|fascist]] elements of [[conservatism in the United States]].\n\nPreceded by \"[[The Beautiful People (song)|The Beautiful People]]\", whose music video received three nominations at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]], the album was both a critical and commercial success. [[Lorraine Ali]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' credited ''Antichrist Superstar'' with ending the dominance of [[grunge]] within popular music. In the years since its release, various publications have listed it among the best albums of the 1990s. The album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has sold almost two million copies in the United States alone. As of 2011, worldwide album sales had surpassed over seven million copies.\n\nThe album was supported by the controversial \"[[Dead to the World Tour]]\", which was heavily criticized by elements of the [[Christian right]]. Nearly every North American venue the band visited was picketed by religious organizations, predominantly because of unfounded, exaggerated claims of onstage drug use, [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], and [[Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic rituals]], including [[Animal sacrifice|animal]] and even [[human sacrifice]]. The band also found itself the target of [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearings]], which attempted to implicate the group in a fan's [[suicide]]. Several previously unreleased recordings were issued on soundtracks throughout 1997, including \"[[Apple of Sodom (song)|Apple of Sodom]]\" and \"[[Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]\".\n\n==Background and development==\n[[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] was formed in 1989 by the vocalist and guitarist [[Scott Putesky|Daisy Berkowitz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/daisy-berkowitz-marilyn-manson-scott-putesky-interview-1 |title=Daisy Berkowitz: Portrait of an American Ex-Marilyn Manson Member |last=Tron |first=Gina |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2017-09-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020101/http://noisey.vice.com/blog/daisy-berkowitz-marilyn-manson-scott-putesky-interview-1 |archivedate=2016-04-02}}</ref> For the next seven years, the name of every band member was created by combining the stage name of a female [[Popular culture|pop culture]] icon with the surname of a male serial killer.<ref name=\"MansonFamilyValues\">{{cite news |last=Wartofsky |first=Alona |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/05/09/manson-family-values/509d8ebb-24f9-4f5d-b2d9-d3d252739239/?noredirect=on |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204074224/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/05/09/manson-family-values/509d8ebb-24f9-4f5d-b2d9-d3d252739239/?noredirect=on |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-02-04 |title=Manson Family Values |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1997-05-09 |accessdate=2019-01-12 }}</ref> Their highly visualized [[Marilyn Manson independent touring|concerts]] quickly earned them a loyal fanbase in the [[South Florida punk and hardcore]] music scene.

Maybe the album they had in mind for Marilyn Manson was not the one I had in mind. It seemed like Trent and I wanted to make different records. I saw ''Antichrist Superstar'' essentially as a pop album&mdash;albeit an intelligent, complex and dark one. I wanted to make something as classic as the records I had grown up on. Trent seemed to have his heart set on breaking new ground as a producer and recording something experimental, an ambition that often ran in opposition to the tunefulness, coherence and scope I insisted on. I had always relied on Trent's opinion in the studio, but what was I supposed to do now that our opinions differed? No matter what anyone said, I knew ''Antichrist Superstar'' was not the same as ''The Downward Spiral'', which was about Trent's descent into an inner, solipsistic world of self-torment and wretchedness.

In an interview with ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'', Brown recounted that his working relationship with the band started on the recommendation a friend in 1996 while working in New York City. The band was recording the album at Nothing Studios at the time and were actively looking for a cover art designer.<ref name=\"artworkstory\">{{cite news|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/culture/marilyn-mansons-antichrist-superstar-story-behind-album-cover-art |title=Marilyn Manson's 'Antichrist Superstar': The Story Behind The Album Cover Art |last=Bennett |first=J |work=Revolver |date=2019-01-05 |accessdate=2019-02-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225050429/https://www.revolvermag.com/culture/marilyn-mansons-antichrist-superstar-story-behind-album-cover-art |archivedate=2019-02-25 }}</ref> By Brown's admission, the extent of his experience designing album covers up to that point had been limited to [[jazz]] records. After researching into who Manson was, he realized it was \"pointless\" to send the band any of his prior work. Brown decided to spend a weekend \"creating fictitious album covers for made-up bands\" and sent those to New Orleans. After several months of hearing nothing back, Brown was invited to Nothing Studios to meet with Manson.\n\nDuring their meeting, Manson asked Brown to watch [[E. Elias Merhige|E. Elias Merhige's]] 1990 [[Experimental film|experimental]] [[art film]] ''[[Begotten (film)|Begotten]]''. According to Brown, Manson already had a strong idea of what he wanted the album cover to look like, drawing inspiration from the bleak [[cinematography]] of this \"grainy, scratched nightmare of a film.\"<ref name=\"artworkstory\"/> After a listening session of the unfinished record and an explanation of the album's concept and three cycle structure, both agreed that the record needed two covers to portray the \"evolution from a worm into the antichrist.\"<ref name=\"artworkstory\"/> Brown utilized [[Dean Karr]]'s photographs of the band and [[mixed media]] for the packaging. He recalled \"drawing some things and [[Image scanner|scanning]] in several layers of [[dirt]]\" during the design process.<ref name=\"artworkstory\"/> The [[paperboard]] O-card [[slipcase]] depict Manson as \"the worm\" in the front with yellowed, [[Wound healing#Proliferative phase|scabrous]] wings and black [[superficial vein]]s. A medical diagram of a [[rib cage]] can also be seen on the top left corner.

Brown explained that he conceived of them after he \"picked opposing ideals and turned them into a symbolic [[compass]] of sorts: Heart is the opposite of mind, and complacency is the opposite of malice.

It was recorded at [[Nothing Studios]] in New Orleans and produced by the band's [[Marilyn Manson|eponymous vocalist]] along with [[Sean Beavan]], former [[Skinny Puppy]] producer [[Dave Ogilvie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The recording of the album was marred by excessive drug use, which provoked a high level of antagonism between band members. Consequently, it was their last release to feature contributions from founding guitarist [[Daisy Berkowitz]], who acrimoniously quit partway through recording.\n\nA [[rock opera]] and a [[concept album]], ''Antichrist Superstar'' was the first installment in a trilogy which included succeeding releases ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998) and ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)]]'' (2000). The central storyline on the album revolved around a supernatural being who seizes all power from humanity in order to initiate an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[End time|end event]]; a [[Populism|populist]] [[demagogue]] who is driven solely by resentment, misanthropy and despair, he uses his newfound position to destroy the world. The record can be seen as a [[Social criticism|social critique]], utilizing this premise as a metaphor for the perceived [[Fascism|fascist]] elements of [[conservatism in the United States]].\n\nPreceded by \"[[The Beautiful People (song)|The Beautiful People]]\", whose music video received three nominations at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]], the album was both a critical and commercial success. [[Lorraine Ali]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' credited ''Antichrist Superstar'' with ending the dominance of [[grunge]] within popular music. In the years since its release, various publications have listed it among the best albums of the 1990s. The album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has sold almost two million copies in the United States alone. As of 2011, worldwide album sales had surpassed over seven million copies.\n\nThe album was supported by the controversial \"[[Dead to the World Tour]]\", which was heavily criticized by elements of the [[Christian right]]. Nearly every North American venue the band visited was picketed by religious organizations, predominantly because of unfounded, exaggerated claims of onstage drug use, [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], and [[Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic rituals]], including [[Animal sacrifice|animal]] and even [[human sacrifice]]. The band also found itself the target of [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearings]], which attempted to implicate the group in a fan's [[suicide]]. Several previously unreleased recordings were issued on soundtracks throughout 1997, including \"[[Apple of Sodom (song)|Apple of Sodom]]\" and \"[[Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]\".\n\n==Background and development==\n[[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] was formed in 1989 by the vocalist and guitarist [[Scott Putesky|Daisy Berkowitz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/daisy-berkowitz-marilyn-manson-scott-putesky-interview-1 |title=Daisy Berkowitz: Portrait of an American Ex-Marilyn Manson Member |last=Tron |first=Gina |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2017-09-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020101/http://noisey.vice.com/blog/daisy-berkowitz-marilyn-manson-scott-putesky-interview-1 |archivedate=2016-04-02}}</ref> For the next seven years, the name of every band member was created by combining the stage name of a female [[Popular culture|pop culture]] icon with the surname of a male serial killer.<ref name=\"MansonFamilyValues\">{{cite news |last=Wartofsky |first=Alona |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/05/09/manson-family-values/509d8ebb-24f9-4f5d-b2d9-d3d252739239/?noredirect=on |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204074224/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/05/09/manson-family-values/509d8ebb-24f9-4f5d-b2d9-d3d252739239/?noredirect=on |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-02-04 |title=Manson Family Values |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1997-05-09 |accessdate=2019-01-12 }}</ref> Their highly visualized [[Marilyn Manson independent touring|concerts]] quickly earned them a loyal fanbase in the [[South Florida punk and hardcore]] music scene.

Maybe the album they had in mind for Marilyn Manson was not the one I had in mind. It seemed like Trent and I wanted to make different records. I saw ''Antichrist Superstar'' essentially as a pop album&mdash;albeit an intelligent, complex and dark one. I wanted to make something as classic as the records I had grown up on. Trent seemed to have his heart set on breaking new ground as a producer and recording something experimental, an ambition that often ran in opposition to the tunefulness, coherence and scope I insisted on.

After researching into who Manson was, he realized it was \"pointless\" to send the band any of his prior work. Brown decided to spend a weekend \"creating fictitious album covers for made-up bands\" and sent those to New Orleans. After several months of hearing nothing back, Brown was invited to Nothing Studios to meet with Manson.\n\nDuring their meeting, Manson asked Brown to watch [[E. Elias Merhige|E.
