In order to illustrate his lectures he used various machines, models and instruments. Wright possibly attended Ferguson's lecture, especially as tickets for the event were available from [[John Whitehurst]], his close neighbour, the clockmaker and scientist. The artist could also have drawn on Whitehurst's practical knowledge to find out more about the orrery and its operation.<ref>Nicolson, Benedict, ''Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light'', Taylor & Francis, 1968, {{ISBN|0-7100-6284-2}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Significance of Joseph Wright's paintings==\n[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Alchemist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone]]'', by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], 1771]]\nThese factual paintings are considered to have metaphorical meaning too, the bursting into light of the phosphorus in front of a praying figure signifying the problematic transition from faith to scientific understanding and enlightenment, and the various expressions on the figures around the bird in the airpump indicating concern over the possible inhumanity of the coming age of science.<ref name=\"Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk\"/> These paintings represent a high point in scientific enquiry which began the undermining of the power of religion in Western societies. Some ten years later scientists worldwide would find themselves persecuted, or even put to death in the backlash to the French Revolution of 1789, itself the culmination of enlightenment thinking. Joseph Priestley, member of the Lunar Society and discoverer of [[oxygen]] would flee Britain after his laboratory in Birmingham was smashed and his house burned down in the [[Priestley Riots|Birmingham riots]] of 1791, by a mob objecting to his outspoken support for the French Revolution;<ref name=Schofield2004>{{citation | last=Schofield | first=Robert E. | year=2004 | title=The enlightened Joseph Priestley: a study of his life and work from 1773 to 1804 | publisher=Penn State Press | isbn=978-0-271-02459-2 | page=151}}</ref> and his colleague [[Lavoisier]] in France would be executed at the [[guillotine]]. The politician and philosopher [[Edmund Burke]], in his famous ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals who supported science in Britain \"considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump\". In the light of this comment, Wright's painting of the bird in the air pump, completed over twenty years earlier, seems particularly prescient.<ref name=\"Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk\"/>\n\nBecause of this web of connections related to science, and the tensions it created which were so subtly illustrated by the art of the painter Joseph Wright of Derby, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, far from being just a collection of fine paintings as the casual visitor might imagine, is significant for being in a place that some would see as having a very significant role in the birth of modern science and industry worldwide.

The Derby Gallery possesses over 300 sketches and 34 oil paintings by Wright, and also holds a document collection. One of the paintings is entitled ''[[The Alchymist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (1771) and it depicts the discovery of the element [[phosphorus]] by German alchemist [[Hennig Brand]] in 1669. A flask into which a large quantity of [[urine]] has been boiled down is seen bursting into light as the phosphorus, which is abundant in urine, ignites spontaneously in air.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vertesi|first=Janet|title=Light and Enlightenment in Joseph Wright of Derby's The Alchymist|url=http://www.reocities.com/jvertesi/wright/#_ftn11|publisher=ReoCities|accessdate=26 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004004754/http://www.reocities.com/jvertesi/wright/#_ftn11|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' shows an early mechanism for demonstrating the movement of the planets around the sun, and an actual [[orrery]] is on display in the centre of the gallery in front of the painting. The Scottish scientist, astronomer and lecturer [[James Ferguson (1710\u20131776)|James Ferguson]] undertook a series of lectures in Derby in July 1762.<ref name=\"Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf |title=Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk |accessdate=2012-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316172422/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf |archivedate=16 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> They were based on his book ''Lectures on Select Subjects in Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Optics &c.'', published in 1760. In order to illustrate his lectures he used various machines, models and instruments. Wright possibly attended Ferguson's lecture, especially as tickets for the event were available from [[John Whitehurst]], his close neighbour, the clockmaker and scientist. The artist could also have drawn on Whitehurst's practical knowledge to find out more about the orrery and its operation.<ref>Nicolson, Benedict, ''Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light'', Taylor & Francis, 1968, {{ISBN|0-7100-6284-2}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Significance of Joseph Wright's paintings==\n[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Alchemist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone]]'', by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], 1771]]\nThese factual paintings are considered to have metaphorical meaning too, the bursting into light of the phosphorus in front of a praying figure signifying the problematic transition from faith to scientific understanding and enlightenment, and the various expressions on the figures around the bird in the airpump indicating concern over the possible inhumanity of the coming age of science.<ref name=\"Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk\"/> These paintings represent a high point in scientific enquiry which began the undermining of the power of religion in Western societies. Some ten years later scientists worldwide would find themselves persecuted, or even put to death in the backlash to the French Revolution of 1789, itself the culmination of enlightenment thinking. Joseph Priestley, member of the Lunar Society and discoverer of [[oxygen]] would flee Britain after his laboratory in Birmingham was smashed and his house burned down in the [[Priestley Riots|Birmingham riots]] of 1791, by a mob objecting to his outspoken support for the French Revolution;<ref name=Schofield2004>{{citation | last=Schofield | first=Robert E. | year=2004 | title=The enlightened Joseph Priestley: a study of his life and work from 1773 to 1804 | publisher=Penn State Press | isbn=978-0-271-02459-2 | page=151}}</ref> and his colleague [[Lavoisier]] in France would be executed at the [[guillotine]]. The politician and philosopher [[Edmund Burke]], in his famous ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals who supported science in Britain \"considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump\". In the light of this comment, Wright's painting of the bird in the air pump, completed over twenty years earlier, seems particularly prescient.<ref name=\"Search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk\"/>\n\nBecause of this web of connections related to science, and the tensions it created which were so subtly illustrated by the art of the painter Joseph Wright of Derby, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, far from being just a collection of fine paintings as the casual visitor might imagine, is significant for being in a place that some would see as having a very significant role in the birth of modern science and industry worldwide. [[Birmingham]], with its science and industry, has been described as the 'silicon valley' of the eighteenth century.<ref>{{cite web |first=Arthur |last=Herman |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=994032002 |title=BOOKS: The outsiders who made the future by moonlight |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=7 September 2002 |accessdate=9 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\nErasmus Darwin has only a small display.
