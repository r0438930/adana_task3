It is located in [[Kalaw Township]] which is part of [[Taunggyi District]].\nIt lies on the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] road at an elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level.\n\nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to [[Yangon]], [[Mandalay]], [[Karen State|Kayin]] and [[Mon State|Mon]].\n\nThe single-line railway line was extended from Aungpan to [[Shwenyaung]], in the 1920s and [[Heho]], a small village of [[Danu people]] grew into a town. [[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point. Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town. The [[airport]] served as an airbase both for the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and it was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAs a trade hub in the region, more than a dozen banks are being operated. Being a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region.\nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]].\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town.\nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]] and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020. However, the opening ceremony was canceled due to the outbreak of '''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19'''), an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] in the country on March 23rd, 2020 reported by MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SPORTS<ref>https://www.mohs.gov.mm/</ref> |.\nThe town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the [[Pindaya]] junction was removed as well.\nMotorway upgrade was done in April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look.\nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n\n== Climate ==\nAungpan has a Dry-winter humid [[subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''), closely bordering a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb'') according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].\n''Cwa'' is monsoonal influenced, having the classic dry winter \u2013 wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates.\n\nThe weather is usually warm and temperate.

Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw.\n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as [[Inle Lake]] and [[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]], and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda.\n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion.\n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|right|The interior structure of pagoda.

The locals celebrated the town's 100th anniversary with many celebrations. The town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower was also built at the [[Pindaya]] junction.

Therefore, several students of various age-levels can be seen in the town.\n\n== Health care ==\n\n=== Public Hospitals ===\n* Aungpan General Hospital\n* 700-bed military Hospital\n* Gayunar Yike Nyein Clinic ({{my|\u1000\u101b\u102f\u100f\u102c\u101b\u102d\u1015\u103a\u1004\u103c\u102d\u1019\u103a\u1006\u1031\u1038\u1001\u1014\u103a\u1038}})\n\n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nLocals in the town hope that an ongoing pagoda project of '''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' will change visitors\u2019 perceptions of their hometown and will become the landmark and symbol of the religion.\n'''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' is a 162-foot (48.5-meter) replica of [[Yangon]]'s [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the [[Myanmar]] calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw.\n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as [[Inle Lake]] and [[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]], and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda.\n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion.\n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|right|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters).\nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\n== Aunpan's 100th year Anniversary ==\n\n2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town. The locals celebrated the town's 100th anniversary with many celebrations. The town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower was also built at the [[Pindaya]] junction. The tower was removed in 2019 due to the upgrading of the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] four-lane road and to be rebuilt in the same place by the construction company.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "name_user": "AungYK", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aungban"}
