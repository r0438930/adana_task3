Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, [[elbow]]s, [[knee]]s, [[forearm]]s, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person who was [[professionally]] trained to give massages was traditionally known as a '''masseur''' (male) or a '''masseuse''' (female), but those titles are outmoded{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, and carry some negative connotations. In the United States, the title '''massage therapist''' has been recognized as a business norm for those who have been professionally trained to give massages.\n\nIn professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a [[massage table]], sitting in a [[massage chair]], or lying on a mat on the floor.

Later in the 11th century copies were translated back into Latin, and again in the 15th and 16th centuries, when they helped enlighten European scholars as to the achievements of the Ancient Greeks. This renewal of the Galenic tradition during the Renaissance played a very important part in the rise of modern science.\n\nOne of the greatest Persian medics was [[Avicenna]], also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980AD to 1037AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematisation of the fragmentary and unorganised Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, ''Al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b a\u1e6d-\u1e6cibb'' (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West. Avicenna excelled in the logical assessment of conditions and comparison of symptoms and took special note of analgesics and their proper use as well as other methods of relieving pain, including massage.\n\nAD 1150: Evidence of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant [[abdomen]], can be found in one of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]].

Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower.<ref name=\"amiaspa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.circlesoflight.com/alternative/water-jet-machine.html |title=Using a Water Massage Machine |publisher=Circlesoflight.com |date=16 March 2007 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> The first type is sometimes seen available for use in malls and shopping centers for a small fee.\n\n=== Vichy showers ===\nA [[Vichy shower]] is a form of hydrotherapy which uses a series of shower nozzles which spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the client's needs.\n\n=== Cremes, lotions, gels, and oils ===\nMany different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin (hands of technician and client).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Capellini|first1=Steve|last2=Welden|first2=Michel Van|title=Massage For Dummies|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470642757|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgFnbJ7E90IC&pg=PA20|date=2010-05-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Massage tools ===\nThese instruments or devices are sometimes used during massages.  Some tools are for use by individuals, others by the therapist.\n\n====Tools used by massage therapists====\nInstrument-assisted soft-tissue massage can deploy stainless-steel devices to manipulate tissue in a way that augments hands-on work. \n\nA body rock is a serpentine-shaped tool, usually carved out of stone. It is used to amplify the therapist's strength and focus pressure on certain areas. It can be used directly on the skin with a lubricant such as oil or corn starch or directly over clothing.\n\n[[Bamboo massage|Bamboo]] and [[rosewood]] tools are also commonly used. They originate from practices in southeast Asia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma.  Some of them may be heated, oiled, or wrapped in cloth.\n\n====Tools used by both individuals and massagers====\nHand-held battery-operated massaging and vibrating instruments are available, including devices for massaging the scalp following a [[haircut]].\n\nVibrating massage pads come in a range of sizes, some with the option of heating.\n\nVibrating [[massage chair]]s can provide an alternative for therapy at home.\n\nThere is a widespread market in [[erotic massage]] instruments, including electric [[dildos]] and [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] such as the [[massage wand]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trout|first1=Christopher|title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|date=28 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|archivedate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Medical and therapeutic use ==\nThe main professionals that provide therapeutic massage are massage therapists, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]] and practitioners of many [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese and other eastern medicines]].

Other names for massage and related practices include hands-on work, body/somatic therapy, and somatic movement education. Body-mind integration techniques stress self-awareness and movement over physical manipulations by a practitioner.

Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title \"Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister\" or Medical Masseur and Spa Therapist.  This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training).  The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise and Movement Therapy.  During the training they will study: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Gynecology, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Surgery, and probably most importantly Dermiatry and Orthopedics.  They are trained in [[Electrotherapy]], and Hydrotherapy.  Hydrotherapy includes: Kneipp, Wraps, underwater Massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna and Steambath.  A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example: Foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage etc.  Finally a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor.  He is regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists.  This includes the restriction on advertising and oath of confidentiality to clients.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==== India ====\nIn India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]] in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In [[ayurveda]], massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as \"Thokkanam\" and is classified in to nine types, each for specific variety of disease.\n\n==== Japan ====\n[[File:Adolfo Farsari - Blind Shampoonier.JPG|thumb|Traditional Japanese blind massage]]\n{{see also|ja:\u3042\u3093\u6469\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u6307\u5727\u5e2b|Anma}}\n\nIn Japan, [[shiatsu]] is regulated but oil massage and [[Thai massage]] are not.

There are two levels of registration with Massage New Zealand, the professional body for massage therapists within New Zealand, although neither of these levels are government recognised.  Registration at the Certified Massage Therapist level denotes competency in the practice of relaxation massage.

Later in the 11th century copies were translated back into Latin, and again in the 15th and 16th centuries, when they helped enlighten European scholars as to the achievements of the Ancient Greeks. This renewal of the Galenic tradition during the Renaissance played a very important part in the rise of modern science.\n\nOne of the greatest Persian medics was [[Avicenna]], also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980AD to 1037AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematisation of the fragmentary and unorganised Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, ''Al-Q\u0101n\u016bn f\u012b a\u1e6d-\u1e6cibb'' (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West. Avicenna excelled in the logical assessment of conditions and comparison of symptoms and took special note of analgesics and their proper use as well as other methods of relieving pain, including massage.\n\nAD 1150: Evidence of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant [[abdomen]], can be found in one of the [[bas relief]]s decorating the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]].

A typical commercial massage table has an easily cleaned, heavily padded surface, and a horseshoe-shaped head support that allows the client to breathe easily while lying face down and can be stationary or portable, while home versions are often lighter weight or designed to fold away easily. An [[orthopedic pillow]] or bolster can be used to correct body positioning.\n\nErgonomic chairs serve a similar function as a massage table. Chairs may be either stationary or portable models. Massage chairs are easier to transport than massage tables, and recipients do not need to disrobe to receive a chair massage. Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as corporate offices, outdoor festivals, shopping malls, and other public locations.\n\n=== Warm-water therapy pools ===\nTemperature-controlled warm-water therapy pools are used to perform aquatic bodywork.<ref name=Osinski2011>Osinski, A. 2011.

These tables differ from a Vichy shower in that the client usually stays dry. Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower.<ref name=\"amiaspa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.circlesoflight.com/alternative/water-jet-machine.html |title=Using a Water Massage Machine |publisher=Circlesoflight.com |date=16 March 2007 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> The first type is sometimes seen available for use in malls and shopping centers for a small fee.\n\n=== Vichy showers ===\nA [[Vichy shower]] is a form of hydrotherapy which uses a series of shower nozzles which spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the client's needs.\n\n=== Cremes, lotions, gels, and oils ===\nMany different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin (hands of technician and client).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Capellini|first1=Steve|last2=Welden|first2=Michel Van|title=Massage For Dummies|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470642757|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgFnbJ7E90IC&pg=PA20|date=2010-05-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Massage tools ===\nThese instruments or devices are sometimes used during massages.  Some tools are for use by individuals, others by the therapist.\n\n====Tools used by massage therapists====\nInstrument-assisted soft-tissue massage can deploy stainless-steel devices to manipulate tissue in a way that augments hands-on work. \n\nA body rock is a serpentine-shaped tool, usually carved out of stone. It is used to amplify the therapist's strength and focus pressure on certain areas. It can be used directly on the skin with a lubricant such as oil or corn starch or directly over clothing.\n\n[[Bamboo massage|Bamboo]] and [[rosewood]] tools are also commonly used. They originate from practices in southeast Asia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma.  Some of them may be heated, oiled, or wrapped in cloth.\n\n====Tools used by both individuals and massagers====\nHand-held battery-operated massaging and vibrating instruments are available, including devices for massaging the scalp following a [[haircut]].\n\nVibrating massage pads come in a range of sizes, some with the option of heating.\n\nVibrating [[massage chair]]s can provide an alternative for therapy at home.\n\nThere is a widespread market in [[erotic massage]] instruments, including electric [[dildos]] and [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] such as the [[massage wand]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trout|first1=Christopher|title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|date=28 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|archivedate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Medical and therapeutic use ==\nThe main professionals that provide therapeutic massage are massage therapists, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]] and practitioners of many [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese and other eastern medicines]].

Examples are:\n* Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) Canada\n* Remedial Massage Therapist (RMT) New Zealand\n* Certified Massage Therapist (CMT) New Zealand\n* Licensed Massage Practitioner (LMP)\n* Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT)\n* Licensed Massage and Bodywork Therapist (LMBT) North Carolina\n* Therapeutic Massage Therapist (TMT) South Africa\n\nIn some jurisdictions, [[practicing without a license]] is a crime. One such jurisdiction is [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], where any health professionals practicing without a license can be issued a fine and charged with a misdemeanor offense.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.130.190 |title=RCW 18.130.190}}</ref>\n\n==== Canada ====\nIn regulated provinces massage therapists are known as Registered Massage Therapists, in Canada five [[provinces]] regulate massage therapy:<ref name=overviewca>{{cite web |url= https://nccih.nih.gov/node/3365 |title=Overview of Manual Therapy in Canada | vauthors =Verhoef M | publisher=The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) |date=10 June 2005}}</ref> [[British Columbia]], [[Ontario]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[New Brunswick]].<ref name=law/> Registered Massage Therapy in British Columbia is regulated by the College of Massage Therapists of British Columbia (CMTBC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmtbc.ca/law-standards/health-professions-act-regulations/|title=Health Professions Act & Regulations|website=College of Massage Therapists of British Columbia|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Regulated provinces have, since 2012, established inter-jurisdiction competency standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmto.com/cmto-wordpress/assets/Inter-Jurisdictional-Competency-Standards-June-2012.pdf |title=Inter-Jurisdiction Competency Standards |date=10 June 2012 }}</ref><ref name=overviewca/> [[Quebec]] is not provincially regulated. Massage therapists may obtain a certification with one of various associations operating. There is the Professional Association of Specialized Massage Therapists of Quebec, also named Mon R\u00e9seau Plus, which represents 6,300 massage therapists (including orthotherapists, naturotherapists and others), the Quebec Federation of massage therapists (FMQ), and the Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise des th\u00e9rapeutes naturels; however, none of these are regulated by provincial law.\n\nCanadian educational institutions are undergoing a formal accreditation process through the Canadian Massage Therapy Council for Accreditation (CMTCA).\n\n==== China ====\nMost types of massage, with the exception of some [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are not regulated in China. Although illegal in China, some of the smaller businesses are fronts for prostitution. J.K., anti-prostitution operation has established sting operations to combat the situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gochina.about.com/od/tripplanning/a/prostitution.htm |title=About.com&nbsp;\u2014 Traveler Warning: Prostitution in China |publisher=Gochina.about.com |date=10 April 2012 |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> These are called [[Prostitution in China#Types and venues|falangmei]] (\u53d1\u5eca\u59b9 \"hairdressing salon sisters\").\n\n==== France ====\nFrance requires three years of study and two final exams in order to apply for a license.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=7F4C787EF6BFD7F0C51286E82C217E0F.tpdjo09v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020567935&categorieLien=id |title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2009-494 du 29 avril 2009 relatif aux \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9paratoires et au dipl\u00f4me d'Etat de masseur-kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeute |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance |date= |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Germany ====\nIn Germany massage is regulated by the government on a federal and national level.  Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title \"Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister\" or Medical Masseur and Spa Therapist.  This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training).  The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise and Movement Therapy.  During the training they will study: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Gynecology, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Surgery, and probably most importantly Dermiatry and Orthopedics.  They are trained in [[Electrotherapy]], and Hydrotherapy.  Hydrotherapy includes: Kneipp, Wraps, underwater Massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna and Steambath.  A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example: Foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage etc.  Finally a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor.  He is regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists.  This includes the restriction on advertising and oath of confidentiality to clients.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==== India ====\nIn India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]] in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In [[ayurveda]], massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as \"Thokkanam\" and is classified in to nine types, each for specific variety of disease.\n\n==== Japan ====\n[[File:Adolfo Farsari - Blind Shampoonier.JPG|thumb|Traditional Japanese blind massage]]\n{{see also|ja:\u3042\u3093\u6469\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u6307\u5727\u5e2b|Anma}}\n\nIn Japan, [[shiatsu]] is regulated but oil massage and [[Thai massage]] are not.

There are two levels of registration with Massage New Zealand, the professional body for massage therapists within New Zealand, although neither of these levels are government recognised.  Registration at the Certified Massage Therapist level denotes competency in the practice of relaxation massage.  Registration at the Remedial massage therapist denotes competency in the practice of remedial or orthopedic massage.  Both levels of registration are defined by agreed minimum competencies and minimum hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.massagenewzealand.org.nz/Site/membership/levels.aspx |title=Levels of Membership |publisher=Massage New Zealand |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== South Africa ====\nIn South Africa, massage is regulated, but enforcement is poor.  The minimum legal requirement to be able to practice as a professional massage therapist is a 2-year diploma in Therapeutic Massage and registration with The Allied Health Professions Council of SA (AHPCSA). The 2 year qualification includes 240 credits, about 80 case studies, and about 100 hours community service.\n\n==== South Korea ====\nIn [[South Korea]],  blind and visually impaired people can become licensed masseurs.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7699114.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blind S Korea masseurs win case | date=30 October 2008 | access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Thailand ====\nIn [[Thailand]], [[Thai massage]] is officially listed as one of the branches of [[traditional Thai medicine]], recognized and regulated by the government.
