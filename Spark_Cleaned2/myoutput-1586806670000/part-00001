It consists of four schools and one division: the [[Ancell School of Business]] (which includes the Justice & Law Administration program), the Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the School of Professional Studies, and the Division of Graduate Studies.\n\nFounded in 1903, WCSU is part of the [[Connecticut State University System|Connecticut State University]] (CSU) system, the primary division of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities (CSCU) system, which also includes [[Eastern Connecticut State University|Eastern]], [[Southern Connecticut State University|Southern]] and [[Central Connecticut State University|Central]] Connecticut state universities; CSCU as a whole consists of those universities in addition to a number of [[community college]]s. Between the four state universities, more than 34,000 students are enrolled, with more than 5,700 students enrolled at WCSU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/president/facts-figures/|title=Western Facts & Figures - Office of the President|website=www.wcsu.edu}}</ref> (As of the Fall 2016 semester.)\n\nWCSU is home to the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]], which is the result of a partnership between WCSU and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (a private non-profit organization that promotes research, education and wildlife conservation). The university's Westside campus houses the [[Ives Concert Park]], one of the premier performance venues in the area.\n\nWestern Connecticut State University is part of the [[Little East Conference]] and [[New Jersey Athletic Conference]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding and growth ===\n\n[[File:The Gates at Western Connecticut State University.jpg|thumb|The entrance gates of WCSU's Midtown campus, located in downtown Danbury.]]\n\nWestern was founded in 1903 as a [[teachers' college]], training the primary and secondary school educators for Connecticut's [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and surrounding areas. The school's name has changed over the years as it has focused on additional areas of study. First named the '''Danbury Normal School''' (also known as the '''Danbury State Normal School'''), starting in 1937 it was called the '''Danbury State Teachers College''', a name it retained until the late 1950s. The college was renamed '''Danbury State College''' in 1959, then '''Western Connecticut State College''' in 1967, and finally, in 1983, '''Western Connecticut State University'''.<ref>{{citation|first=Ray C.|last=Brown|url=http://collegehistorygarden.blogspot.com/2014/12/connecticut-colleges-that-have-closed.html |title=Connecticut Colleges that have Closed, Merged, Changed Names|date= |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref> In 2011, governance of the university was transferred to the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities system.\n\nIn 1904, 41 students were enrolled in the first classes on campus, the number of enrollments climbing to 362 students by 1912.\n\n=== WXCI and music publicization ===\n\nIn 1968, WCSU's radio station, [[WXCI]] (91.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]), then going by the [[call sign]] WCST and broadcasting with [[AM broadcasting|AM]] transmission, was established.\n\nIn 1973 WCST was switched from AM to FM transmission, obtained an [[FCC]] license, was renamed WXCI, and went on air under that call sign.\n\nIn the early 1980s, WXCI became one of the first FM stations to focus on [[alternative rock]]. Throughout the 80s the station was instrumental in promoting the work of a number of contemporary bands and musicians: While the station is perhaps best known for popularizing the English band [[Duran Duran]] in the United States, it also helped to familiarize the American audience with other projects and musicians from [[Great Britain]], such as [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Culture Club]], and it popularized among residents of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern U.S.]] the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] punk group [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based [[R.E.M.]], while also providing greater listenership to New York City's [[Talking Heads]]. [[Thurston Moore]], a founding member of [[Sonic Youth]], attended WCSU for a [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter]] during the fall of 1976, though he left afterward.\n\n=== Jane Goodall Institute and environmental projects ===\n\n{{further|Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies|Jane Goodall Institute|Roots & Shoots}}\n\nIn 1995, the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]] (JGC) was founded on campus. The Center is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[501(c)(3) organization]] dedicated to environmental stewardship and conservation, and wildlife education and research, being the result of a partnership between Western and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (JGI). Since the Center's founding, its namesake, primatologist Dr. [[Jane Goodall]], has visited Western on at least a dozen occasions to give lectures on the issue of ecology.\n\nThe Center has also hosted a number of seminars and public talks by other environmentalist speakers at the university: Notably, [[Smithsonian]] ethnobotanist [[Mark Plotkin]] and veteran ecologist [[Thomas Lovejoy]] spoke at the university in 1998, and in 2013 ocean conservationist [[Fabien Cousteau]] presented a public seminar on campus.\n\nIn 2005, Western was established by JGI as a \"National Center for University Roots and Shoots\"; this event resulted in the institution of the eponymous student environmental club, a chapter of the international [[Roots & Shoots]] (also known as Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots), on campus. Roots & Shoots is a subsidiary organization of JGI, and its WCSU chapter is one of only several based in the United States. The club's office, located in the Midtown campus's White Hall, remained the first of its kind between 2005 and 2012; afterwards, the organization's international headquarters was established at JGI's head office in Washington, D.C.\n\nRoots & Shoots serves as, according to the university and the JGC, \"a regional and national office of excellence in training university students, faculty and administrators to develop programs for K-12 and college students in local, regional and global conservation.\"\n\n=== Significant visitors and lectures ===\nThe university of visited by former President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2005 and by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in 2012.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Schools ===\n {{Div col|colwidth=22em}} \n*[[Ancell School of Business]]\n*Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences\n*School of Visual and Performing Arts\n*School of Professional Studies\n*Division of Graduate Studies\n {{Div col end}}\n\n=== Campus ===\n\nWestern has two campuses, midtown and westside, both located in Danbury. The campuses are three miles (5&nbsp;km) apart and connected by a university shuttle service.\n\nThe midtown campus is the original campus, located on White Street near downtown Danbury and the [[Main Street Historic District (Danbury, Connecticut)|Main Street Historic District]]. It is home to the [https://www.wcsu.edu/sas/ Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences], School of Professional Studies, and most of the university's administration. Dormitories on this campus include Fairfield Hall, Litchfield Hall, and Newbury Hall. The Midtown student center is located on this campus. In 2018, the fully renovated Higgins Hall reopened. Higgins Hall features the MSAS Dean's offices, state-of-the-art communication, media, and computer technology.\n\nThe westside campus is located on land purchased in 1969 on the outskirts of Danbury. This {{convert|439|acre|km2|adj=on}} lot is home to the [[Ancell School of Business]], the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the Westside Nature Preserve, an amphitheater and three residence halls. Westside also houses athletic facilities, including the William O'Neill Athletic and Convocation Center (completed in 1995), and the Westside Athletic Complex (completed in 2003), as well as an observatory with a 20-inch Ritchy-Chretien telescope and a 20-foot planetarium dome.  On January 23, 2007, the Westside Campus Center was officially opened. This new facility serves as a student center, meeting and banquet facility for the Westside campus. In August 2014, the Westside campus saw the opening of the new Visual and Performing Arts Center, a comprehensive arts building with Theatre Arts, Music and Visual Arts wings.\n\nA major improvement program was started in the mid-1990s to beautify the campus.  Several parking lots became green space, and improvements were made to the landscaping.\n\nIn April 2013, startup of a newly installed [[fuel cell]] power unit for the Science Building on the university's Midtown campus began. The [[PureCell System|PureCell]] System, provided by [[ClearEdge Power]], will support the university to reap significant energy cost savings and enhanced electricity and heating efficiencies.\n<ref>[http://www.power-eng.com/news/2013/04/24/fuel-cell-installation-to-provide-clean-power-for-wcsu-science-building.html News - Power Engineering].

The Visual and Performing Arts Center as well as Centennial Hall also obtained LEED certification. In 2014, WCSU installed four EV (electric vehicle) charging stations, two on each campus. These charging stations are available to both students and the public, free of charge. The university is a participant in EV Connecticut Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions program. \n \nThe \"WestConn at Waterbury\" program is located on the campus of [[Naugatuck Valley Community College]] in [[Waterbury|Waterbury, Connecticut]]. The program offers completion courses for a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in management or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), as well as a [[Master of Health Administration]] (M.H.A.).<ref>{{cite web|title=Western at Waterbury|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/waterbury/|website=www.wcsu.edu/|publisher=Western Connecticut State University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Buildings==\n\n===Midtown Campus===\n {{Div col}}\n*University Hall (Administrative Offices)\n*White Hall (Classrooms & Faculty Offices)\n*Warner Hall (Classrooms & Faculty Offices)\n*Ruth A.

It consists of four schools and one division: the [[Ancell School of Business]] (which includes the Justice & Law Administration program), the Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the School of Professional Studies, and the Division of Graduate Studies.\n\nFounded in 1903, WCSU is part of the [[Connecticut State University System|Connecticut State University]] (CSU) system, the primary division of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities (CSCU) system, which also includes [[Eastern Connecticut State University|Eastern]], [[Southern Connecticut State University|Southern]] and [[Central Connecticut State University|Central]] Connecticut state universities; CSCU as a whole consists of those universities in addition to a number of [[community college]]s. Between the four state universities, more than 34,000 students are enrolled, with more than 5,700 students enrolled at WCSU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/president/facts-figures/|title=Western Facts & Figures - Office of the President|website=www.wcsu.edu}}</ref> (As of the Fall 2016 semester.)\n\nWCSU is home to the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]], which is the result of a partnership between WCSU and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (a private non-profit organization that promotes research, education and wildlife conservation). The university's Westside campus houses the [[Ives Concert Park]], one of the premier performance venues in the area.\n\nWestern Connecticut State University is part of the [[Little East Conference]] and [[New Jersey Athletic Conference]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding and growth ===\n\n[[File:The Gates at Western Connecticut State University.jpg|thumb|The entrance gates of WCSU's Midtown campus, located in downtown Danbury.]]\n\nWestern was founded in 1903 as a [[teachers' college]], training the primary and secondary school educators for Connecticut's [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and surrounding areas. The school's name has changed over the years as it has focused on additional areas of study. First named the '''Danbury Normal School''' (also known as the '''Danbury State Normal School'''), starting in 1937 it was called the '''Danbury State Teachers College''', a name it retained until the late 1950s. The college was renamed '''Danbury State College''' in 1959, then '''Western Connecticut State College''' in 1967, and finally, in 1983, '''Western Connecticut State University'''.<ref>{{citation|first=Ray C.|last=Brown|url=http://collegehistorygarden.blogspot.com/2014/12/connecticut-colleges-that-have-closed.html |title=Connecticut Colleges that have Closed, Merged, Changed Names|date= |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref> In 2011, governance of the university was transferred to the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities system.\n\nIn 1904, 41 students were enrolled in the first classes on campus, the number of enrollments climbing to 362 students by 1912.\n\n=== WXCI and music publicization ===\n\nIn 1968, WCSU's radio station, [[WXCI]] (91.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]), then going by the [[call sign]] WCST and broadcasting with [[AM broadcasting|AM]] transmission, was established.\n\nIn 1973 WCST was switched from AM to FM transmission, obtained an [[FCC]] license, was renamed WXCI, and went on air under that call sign.\n\nIn the early 1980s, WXCI became one of the first FM stations to focus on [[alternative rock]]. Throughout the 80s the station was instrumental in promoting the work of a number of contemporary bands and musicians: While the station is perhaps best known for popularizing the English band [[Duran Duran]] in the United States, it also helped to familiarize the American audience with other projects and musicians from [[Great Britain]], such as [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Culture Club]], and it popularized among residents of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern U.S.]] the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] punk group [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based [[R.E.M.]], while also providing greater listenership to New York City's [[Talking Heads]]. [[Thurston Moore]], a founding member of [[Sonic Youth]], attended WCSU for a [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter]] during the fall of 1976, though he left afterward.\n\n=== Jane Goodall Institute and environmental projects ===\n\n{{further|Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies|Jane Goodall Institute|Roots & Shoots}}\n\nIn 1995, the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]] (JGC) was founded on campus. The Center is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[501(c)(3) organization]] dedicated to environmental stewardship and conservation, and wildlife education and research, being the result of a partnership between Western and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (JGI). Since the Center's founding, its namesake, primatologist Dr. [[Jane Goodall]], has visited Western on at least a dozen occasions to give lectures on the issue of ecology.\n\nThe Center has also hosted a number of seminars and public talks by other environmentalist speakers at the university: Notably, [[Smithsonian]] ethnobotanist [[Mark Plotkin]] and veteran ecologist [[Thomas Lovejoy]] spoke at the university in 1998, and in 2013 ocean conservationist [[Fabien Cousteau]] presented a public seminar on campus.\n\nIn 2005, Western was established by JGI as a \"National Center for University Roots and Shoots\"; this event resulted in the institution of the eponymous student environmental club, a chapter of the international [[Roots & Shoots]] (also known as Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots), on campus. Roots & Shoots is a subsidiary organization of JGI, and its WCSU chapter is one of only several based in the United States. The club's office, located in the Midtown campus's White Hall, remained the first of its kind between 2005 and 2012; afterwards, the organization's international headquarters was established at JGI's head office in Washington, D.C.\n\nRoots & Shoots serves as, according to the university and the JGC, \"a regional and national office of excellence in training university students, faculty and administrators to develop programs for K-12 and college students in local, regional and global conservation.\"\n\n=== Significant visitors and lectures ===\nThe university of visited by former President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2005 and by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in 2012.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Schools ===\n {{Div col|colwidth=22em}} \n*[[Ancell School of Business]]\n*Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences\n*School of Visual and Performing Arts\n*School of Professional Studies\n*Division of Graduate Studies\n {{Div col end}}\n\n=== Campus ===\n\nWestern has two campuses, midtown and westside, both located in Danbury. The campuses are three miles (5&nbsp;km) apart and connected by a university shuttle service.\n\nThe midtown campus is the original campus, located on White Street near downtown Danbury and the [[Main Street Historic District (Danbury, Connecticut)|Main Street Historic District]]. It is home to the [https://www.wcsu.edu/sas/ Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences], School of Professional Studies, and most of the university's administration. Dormitories on this campus include Fairfield Hall, Litchfield Hall, and Newbury Hall. The Midtown student center is located on this campus. In 2018, the fully renovated Higgins Hall reopened. Higgins Hall features the MSAS Dean's offices, state-of-the-the art communication, media, and computer technology.\n\nThe westside campus is located on land purchased in 1969 on the outskirts of Danbury. This {{convert|439|acre|km2|adj=on}} lot is home to the [[Ancell School of Business]], the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the Westside Nature Preserve, an amphitheater and three residence halls. Westside also houses athletic facilities, including the William O'Neill Athletic and Convocation Center (completed in 1995), and the Westside Athletic Complex (completed in 2003), as well as an observatory with a 20-inch Ritchy-Chretien telescope and a 20-foot planetarium dome.  On January 23, 2007, the Westside Campus Center was officially opened. This new facility serves as a student center, meeting and banquet facility for the Westside campus. In August 2014, the Westside campus saw the opening of the new Visual and Performing Arts Center, a comprehensive arts building with Theatre Arts, Music and Visual Arts wings.\n\nA major improvement program was started in the mid-1990s to beautify the campus.  Several parking lots became green space, and improvements were made to the landscaping.\n\nIn April 2013, startup of a newly installed [[fuel cell]] power unit for the Science Building on the university's Midtown campus began. The [[PureCell System|PureCell]] System, provided by [[ClearEdge Power]], will support the university to reap significant energy cost savings and enhanced electricity and heating efficiencies.\n<ref>[http://www.power-eng.com/news/2013/04/24/fuel-cell-installation-to-provide-clean-power-for-wcsu-science-building.html News - Power Engineering].

The Visual and Performing Arts Center as well as Centennial Hall also obtained LEED certification. In 2014, WCSU installed four EV (electric vehicle) charging stations, two on each campus. These charging stations are available to both students and the public, free of charge. The university is a participant in EV Connecticut Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions program. \n \nThe \"WestConn at Waterbury\" program is located on the campus of [[Naugatuck Valley Community College]] in [[Waterbury|Waterbury, Connecticut]]. The program offers completion courses for a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in management or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), as well as a [[Master of Health Administration]] (M.H.A.).<ref>{{cite web|title=Western at Waterbury|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/waterbury/|website=www.wcsu.edu/|publisher=Western Connecticut State University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Buildings==\n\n===Midtown Campus===\n {{Div col}}\n*University Hall (Administrative Offices)\n*White Hall (Classrooms & Faculty Offices)\n*Warner Hall (Classrooms & Faculty Offices)\n*Ruth A.
