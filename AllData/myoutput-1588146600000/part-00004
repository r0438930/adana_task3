On August 15, 1943, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military forces landed on [[Kiska Island]], which had been occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces since June 1942.\n\nThe Japanese, however, had secretly abandoned the island two weeks prior, and so the Allied landings were unopposed. Allied forces suffered over 313 casualties in total during the operation, due to stray Japanese landmines and booby traps, [[friendly fire]] incidents, and vehicle accidents.<ref name=\"ndupress.ndu.edu\"/>\n\n==Background==\n{{Campaignbox Aleutians}}\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Kiska}}\n\nThe Japanese under [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Takeji Ono]] had landed on Kiska at approximately 01:00 on June 6, 1942, with a force of about 500 [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Marines (military)|marines]]. Soon after arrival, they stormed an American [[weather station]], where they killed two and captured eight [[United States Navy]] officers. The captured officers were sent to Japan as [[prisoners of war]].\nAnother 2,000 Japanese troops arrived, landing in Kiska Harbor. At this time, [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Monzo Akiyama]] headed the force on Kiska. In December 1942, additional anti-aircraft units, engineers, and a negligible number of reinforcement infantry arrived on the island. In the spring of 1943, control was transferred to [[Kiichiro Higuchi]].\n\n==Invasion plan and execution==\n[[File:Kiska Island 1943.svg|thumb|right|The Allied invasion of Kiska, August 17, 1943]]\n\nA [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] aircraft sighted Japanese ships in Kiska.

To United States naval planners, none was necessary and the orders to invade Kiska soon followed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nAfter the heavy casualties suffered at [[Battle of Attu|Attu Island]], planners were expecting another costly operation. The Japanese tactical planners had, however, realized the isolated island was no longer defensible and planned for an evacuation.\n\nStarting in late July, there were increasing signs of Japanese withdrawal. Aerial photograph analysts noticed that routine activities appeared to greatly diminish and almost no movement could be detected in the harbor. Bomb damage appeared unrepaired and aircrews reported greatly diminished anti-aircraft fire. On July 28, radio signals from Kiska ceased entirely. \n\nOn August 15, 1943, the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 7th Infantry Division]] and the 13th Infantry Brigade (Canada), landed on opposite shores of Kiska. The invasion also involved the first combat deployment of the [[First Special Service Force]], an elite [[special forces]] unit consisted of American and Canadian [[commando]]s.\n\nBoth U.S. and Canadian forces mistook each other, after a Canadian soldier shot at American lines believing they were Japanese, and a sporadic [[friendly fire]] incident occurred, which had left 28 Americans and 4 Canadians dead, with 50 wounded on either side. Progress was also hampered by mines, timed bombs, accidental ammunition detonations, vehicle accidents and booby traps.<ref name=\"The Battle for Kiska\"/> A stray Japanese [[Naval mine|mine]] also caused the {{USS|Abner Read|DD-526}} to lose a large chunk of its stern.
