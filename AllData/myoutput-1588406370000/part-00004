For example, a given tonal scale and its chords will have the same shape, and hence consistent fingering, all across the tuning range of the [[syntonic temperament]]. Of the various isomorphic keyboards (e.g., the [[Robert Holford Macdowell Bosanquet|Bosanquet]], [[Jank\u00f3 keyboard|Janko]], [[Adriaan Fokker|Fokker]], and [[Array system|Wesley]]), the [[Wicki-Hayden note layout|Wicki]] keyboard is optimal for dynamic tonality.<ref>Milne, A., Sethares, W.A. and Plamondon, J., [http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/paperspdf/tuningcontinua.pdf Tuning Continua and Keyboard Layouts], ''Journal of Mathematics and Music'', Spring 2008.</ref>\n\n== Dynamic tuning ==\nOn a tuning invariant keyboard, any given musical structure\u2014a [[Musical scale|scale]], a [[Chord (music)|chord]], a [[chord progression]], or an entire [[song]]\u2014has exactly the same fingering in every tuning of a given temperament. This tuning allows a performer to learn to play a song in one tuning of a given temperament and then to play it with exactly the same finger-movements, on exactly the same note-controlling buttons, in every other tuning of that temperament.\n\nFor example, one could learn to play [[Rodgers and Hammerstein|Rodgers and Hammerstein's]] [[Do-Re-Mi]] in its original [[equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]] (12-tet) and then play it with exactly the same finger-movements, on exactly the same note-controlling buttons, while smoothly changing the tuning in real time across the [[syntonic temperament]]'s tuning continuum.\n\n==Piano keyboard==\nThe [[piano]] keyboard is one-dimensional, and therefore cannot present the intervals of a rank-2 (two-dimensional) temperament isomorphically. As it is not isomorphic, the piano keyboard is also not tuning invariant, and hence cannot control dynamic tuning with consistent fingering. Without consistent fingering, a pianist would have to change a given interval's fingering constantly as the tuning changed, which would be impractical. Whereas an isomorphic keyboard's tuning invariance makes dynamic tonality easy to control, the piano keyboard's lack of tuning invariance makes it impractical.\n\n==New musical effects==\nDynamic tuning enables musical effects which ''require'' a change in tuning, such as\n# ''polyphonic tuning bends'', in which the pitch of the tonic remains fixed while the pitches of all other notes change to reflect changes in the tuning, with notes that are close to the tonic in [[pitch space|tonal space]] changing pitch only slightly and those that are distant changing considerably;\n# ''new chord progressions'' that start in a first tuning, change to second tuning (to progress across a comma which the second tuning tempers out but the first tuning does not), optionally change to subsequent tunings for similar reasons, and then conclude in the first tuning; and\n# ''temperament modulations'', which start in a first tuning of a first temperament, change to a second tuning of the first temperament which is also a first tuning of a second temperament (a \"pivot tuning\"), change note-selection among enharmonics to reflect the second temperament, change to a second tuning of the second temperament, then optionally change to additional tunings and temperaments before returning through the pivot tuning to the first tuning of the first temperament.\n\n==Dynamic timbre==\nOne solution to the problem of temperament is to temper a timbre's partials to align with a tempered tuning's notes.<ref>Sethares, W.A., [http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/consemi.html Relating Tuning and Timbre], ''Experimental Musical Instruments'', September 1992.</ref> The laws of physics make it difficult for acoustic instruments to temper their partials in real time, but acoustically-produced timbres can be tempered electronically in real time, and electronic music synthesis can be used to generate tempered timbres in real time, too.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | first = William\n | last = Sethares\n | authorlink = |author2=Milne, A. |author3=Tiedje, S. |author4=Prechtl, A. |author5=Plamondon, J. \n | year = 2009\n | title = '''Spectral Tools for Dynamic Tonality and Audio Morphing'''\n | journal = Computer Music Journal\n | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/computer_music_journal/summary/v033/33.2.sethares.html\n | volume = 33\n | issue = 2\n | pages = 71\u201384\n | accessdate = 2009-09-20\n | doi = 10.1162/comj.2009.33.2.71\n }}</ref>\n\nThe tempering of timbres to match tunings can be seen as a generalization of the relationship between Just Intonation and the Harmonic Series\u2014the relationship from which all of tonality arguably springs\u2014to a much wider range of 'pseudo-tonal' tunings and their related 'pseudo-harmonic' timbres. As such, it can be seen as a general solution to the problem of [[Musical temperament|temperament]], at least for music that is produced or processed electronically.\n\n==Dynamic sonance==\nThe ability to control tuning and timbre together does not preclude their independent control. For example, the one can independently control [[sonance]]\u2014i.e., the degree of a timbre's alignment with the current tuning\u2014in real time. Using dynamic sonance, one can (for example) shift the tonic triad from consonance to dissonance and back, or the tritone from dissonant to consonant and back, as a means of controlling [[Tension (music)|tension and relief.]]\n\n==Compared to microtonality==\nWhile [[microtonal music]] usually involves a single fixed tuning that is something other than 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet), dynamic tuning involves a real-time change among two or more tunings of which one may be 12-tet.  The syntonic temperament's tonally-valid tuning range includes all of the meantone tunings, facilitating the use of the diatonic scale (or any other) therein through its consistent fingering on an isomorphic keyboard.\n\nTuning invariance facilitates the exploration of static microtonal tunings, while dynamic tuning incorporates microtonality's static tunings into tuning continua along which tuning can be changed dynamically in real time.\n\n==Example: C2ShiningC==\nAn example of Dynamic Tonality can be heard in \"C to Shining C\" [http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/C2ShiningC.mp3 C2ShiningC] (composed and recorded by [[William Sethares]] in April 2008).\nThis sound example contains only one chord, [[Major chord|Dmaj]] (the piece is, oddly enough, recorded or transposed in the recording to D major), played throughout, yet a sense of [[Tension (music)|harmonic tension]] is imparted by a [[tuning progression]] and a [[timbre progression]]: \n<blockquote>\n'''Cmaj 19-tet/harmonic -> Cmaj 5-tet/harmonic -> Cmaj 19-tet/consonant -> Cmaj 5-tet/consonant'''\n</blockquote>\n* The ''timbre'' progresses from a harmonic timbre (with partials following the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]) to a 'pseudo-harmonic' timbre (with partials adjusted to align with the notes of the current tuning) and back again.\n* Twice as rapidly, the ''tuning'' progresses (via [[polyphonic tuning bends]]), within the [[syntonic temperament]], from an initial tuning in which the tempered perfect fifth (P5) is 695 cents wide (19-tone equal temperament, 19-tet) to a second tuning in which the P5 is 720 cents wide (5-tet), and back again.\n\nAs the tuning changes, the pitches of all notes except the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] change, and the widths of all [[Interval (music)|intervals]] except the [[octave]] change; however, the relationships among the intervals, as defined by the [[Musical temperament|temperament's]] [[comma sequence]], remain constant throughout. This consistency among a temperament's interval relationships is what makes tuning invariance possible (Milne, 2007).\n\nIn the [[syntonic temperament]], the tempered [[major third]] (M3) is as wide as four tempered [[perfect fifth]]s (P5's) minus two [[octaves]]\u2014so the M3's width changes across the tuning progression\n* from 380 cents in 19-tet (P5 = 695), where the Cmaj triad's M3 is very close in width to its [[Just intonation|just]] width of 386.3 cents,\n* to 480 cents in 5-tet (P5 = 720), where the Cmaj triad's M3 is close in width to a slightly flat [[perfect fourth]] of 498 cents, making the [[Major chord|Cmaj]] chord sound rather like a [[Suspended chord|Csus4]].\n\nThus, the tuning progression's widening of the Cmaj's M3 from a nearly-just [[major third]] in 19-tet to a slightly flat [[perfect fourth]] in 5-tet creates [[Tension (music)|harmonic tension]], which is relieved by the return to 19-tet.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Atonality}}\n\n[[Category:Musical temperaments]]\n[[Category:Post-tonal music theory]]\n", "text_old": "'''Dynamic Tonality''' is the use of [[wiktionary:realtime|real-time]] changes in [[musical tuning|tuning]] and [[timbre]] to perform new tonal effects such as [[polyphonic tuning bends]], new [[chord progressions]], and [[temperament modulations]], with the option of [[consonance and dissonance|consonance]].<ref>Plamondon, J., Milne, A., and Sethares, W.A., [http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/paperspdf/CMS2009.pdf Dynamic Tonality: Extending the Framework of Tonality into the 21st Century], ''Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the South Central Chapter of the College Music Society,'' 2009.</ref> Dynamic Tonality also enables new structured manipulations of timbre in real time, such as controlling primeness, conicality, and richness.<ref name=\"X_System\">\n{{cite journal\n |author1=Milne, A.\n |author2=Sethares, W.\n |author3=Plamondon, J. \n | year = 2006\n | title = '''X System'''\n | journal = Technical Report, Thumtronics Inc.\n | url = http://oro.open.ac.uk/21510/1/X_System.pdf\n | accessdate = 2020-05-02\n }}</ref> The performance of dynamic tonality requires an [[isomorphic keyboard]] driving a music [[synthesizer]] which implements [[dynamic tuning]] and [[dynamic timbres]].
