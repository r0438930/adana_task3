[[Incumbent]] Republican U.S. Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)|Peter Fitzgerald]] decided to retire after one term. The Democratic and Republican [[primary election]]s were held in March, which included a total of 15 candidates who combined to spend a record total of over $60 million seeking the [[open seat]].\n\nOn March 16, 2004, State Senator [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic primary, and businessman [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]] won the Republican primary. Three months later, Ryan announced his withdrawal from the race four days after the [[Chicago Tribune]] persuaded a California court to release records from Ryan's divorce case, which included allegations that Ryan had pressured his then-wife actress [[Jeri Ryan]] to perform sexual acts in public.\n\nSix weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. The election was the first for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were [[African American]]. Obama won by 43%, the largest margin of victory in the state history of U.S. Senate elections, and served in the Senate for four years until he was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected President]] in 2008. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections \u2013 $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes \u2013 is also among the largest in history in both [[absolute and relative terms]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 | last=Jacobson | first=Gary C. | title=The First Congressional Elections After BCRA | work=The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign RDUNIAt | publisher=Rowman and Littlefield | isbn=978-0742538702 | page=[https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 195] | date=March 30, 2006 | accessdate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Election information==\nThe primaries and general elections coincided with those for [[2004 United States presidential election in Illinois|United States President]] and [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois|congress]], as well as those for state offices.\n\n===Turnout===\nFor the primary elections, turnout was 26.69%, with 1,904,800 votes cast.<ref>{{cite web |title=Voter Turnout |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VoterTurnout.aspx?MID=fVf30XCcBCY%3d&T=637204877664537563 |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"result\">{{cite web |title=Election Results |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/ElectionVoteTotals.aspx |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> For the general election, turnout was 68.56%, with 5,141,520 votes cast.<ref name=turnoutgen>{{cite web |title=Voter Turnout |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VoterTurnout.aspx?MID=fVf30XCcBCY%3d&T=637204879738085590 |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"result\"/>\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n=== Candidates ===\n==== Declared ====\n* [[Gery Chico]], [[Chicago Public Schools|President of the Chicago Board of Education]]\n* [[Blair Hull]], businessman\n* [[Daniel Hynes]], State Comptroller\n* [[Barack Obama]], State Senator and future [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Maria Pappas]], Cook County Treasurer\n* [[Nancy Skinner (Midwestern politician)|Nancy Skinner]], radio personality\n* Joyce Washington, health care executive\n* Estella Johnson Hunt (write-in)\n\n==== Withdrew ====\n* Matt O'Shea, Mayor of [[Metamora, Illinois]].

[[Incumbent]] Republican U.S. Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)|Peter Fitzgerald]] decided to retire after one term. The Democratic and Republican [[primary election]]s were held in March, which included a total of 15 candidates who combined to spend a record total of over $60 million seeking the [[open seat]].\n\nOn March 16, 2004, State Senator [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic primary, and businessman [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]] won the Republican primary. Three months later, Ryan announced his withdrawal from the race four days after the [[Chicago Tribune]] persuaded a California court to release records from Ryan's divorce case, which included allegations that Ryan had pressured his then-wife actress [[Jeri Ryan]] to perform sexual acts in public.\n\nSix weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. The election was the first for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were [[African American]]. Obama won by 43%, the largest margin of victory in the state history of U.S. Senate elections, and served in the Senate for four years until he was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected President]] in 2008. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections \u2013 $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes \u2013 is also among the largest in history in both [[absolute and relative terms]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 | last=Jacobson | first=Gary C. | title=The First Congressional Elections After BCRA | work=The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign RDUNIAt | publisher=Rowman and Littlefield | isbn=978-0742538702 | page=[https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 195] | date=March 30, 2006 | accessdate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Election information==\nThe primaries and general elections coincided with those for [[2004 United States presidential election in Illinois|United States President]] and [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois|congress]], as well as those for state offices.\n\n===Turnout===\nFor the primary elections, turnout was 26.69%, with 1,904,800 votes cast.<ref>{{cite web |title=Voter Turnout |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VoterTurnout.aspx?MID=fVf30XCcBCY%3d&T=637204877664537563 |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"result\">{{cite web |title=Election Results |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/ElectionVoteTotals.aspx |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> For the general election, turnout was 68.56%, with 5,141,520 votes cast.<ref name=turnoutgen>{{cite web |title=Voter Turnout |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VoterTurnout.aspx?MID=fVf30XCcBCY%3d&T=637204879738085590 |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"result\"/>\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n=== Candidates ===\n==== Declared ====\n* [[Gery Chico]], [[Chicago Public Schools|President of the Chicago Board of Education]]\n* [[Blair Hull]], businessman\n* [[Daniel Hynes]], State Comptroller\n* [[Barack Obama]], State Senator and future [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Maria Pappas]], Cook County Treasurer\n* [[Nancy Skinner (Midwestern politician)|Nancy Skinner]], radio personality\n* Joyce Washington, health care executive\n* Estella Johnson Hunt (write-in)\n\n==== Withdrew ====\n* Matt O'Shea, Mayor of [[Metamora, Illinois]].

Obama and Keyes differed on many issues including [[education voucher|school vouchers]] and tax cuts, both of which Keyes supported and Obama opposed.<ref>Alan Keyes Archives, [http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm 2004 Illinois Debates] {{Webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225055002/http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm | date=February 25, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== Results ===\n{{Election box begin | title=2004 United States Senate election in Illinois<ref name=\"result\"/><ref name=turnoutgen/>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Barack Obama]]\n | votes      = 3,597,456\n | percentage = 70.0%\n | change     = +22.6%\n}}{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Alan Keyes]]\n | votes      = 1,390,690\n | percentage = 27.0%\n | change     = -23.3%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Independent (United States)\n | candidate  = Al Franzen\n | votes      = 81,164\n | percentage = 1.6%\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Jerry Kohn\n | votes      = 69,253\n | percentage = 1.3%\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate\n | party      = Write-ins\n | candidate  = \n | votes      = 2,957\n | percentage = 0.1%\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box total\n | votes      = '''5,141,520'''\n | percentage = '''68.6%'''\n | change     = N/A\n}}\n{{Election box gain with party link no swing\n | winner    = Democratic Party (United States)\n | loser     = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nThe Obama-Keyes race was one of the first to be called on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], November 2, 2004.\n\nAt the start of Keyes' candidacy in August, Keyes had 24% support in the [[opinion poll|polls]].
