Takeuchi considered many variations before settling on a three-wheeled design with low-pressure ballon tires, driven by an enlarged [[Honda ST70]] engine, through a 4 Speed Dual-Range Semi automatic clutched transmission. <ref>{{cite web|author=ATC90.com |url= http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html |title=ATC90-History|website=ATC90.tripod.com|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==1st Generation US90 (1970-1973)==\n\nThe Initial US90 was offered at $595 in 1970, and featured an 89cc engine producing 7hp.
