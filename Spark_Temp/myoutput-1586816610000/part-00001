The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus' international advisory board chair [[Dan Quayle]], the former Vice-President of the United States. Cerberus was rejected because it had a reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the [[CAW National Council 4000|CAW]]. At first, Air Canada selected Victor Li's ''Trinity Time Investments'', which initially asked for a board veto and the chairmanship in return for investing $650 million in the airline.

After Air Canada and Aeroplan changed the division of points collection and redemption, Air Canada introduced an internal rewards program, Altitude. The two programs operate in conjunction.\n\nOn 11 May 2017, Air Canada announced it plans to launch a new loyalty program to replace Aeroplan and Altitude in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=Galleries Aimia shares crash after Air Canada parts ways with Aeroplan loyalty program|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-aeroplan-1.4109868|accessdate=12 May 2017|date=11 May 2017}}</ref> On 10 January 2019, Air Canada re-acquired Aeroplan from Aimia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/air-canada-closes-aeroplan-loyalty-programme-purchase/130931.article|title=Air Canada closes Aeroplan loyalty programme purchase|last=Hemmerdinger|first=Jon|date=10 January 2019|website=Flight Global|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skift.com/2019/01/15/air-canada-completes-bringing-aeroplan-loyalty-program-into-its-fold/|title=Air Canada Completes Bringing Aeroplan Loyalty Program Into Its Fold|date=2019-01-15|website=Skift|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n\n===Air Canada Altitude===\nOn 20 September 2012, Air Canada unveiled its new frequent flyer status program named \"Air Canada Altitude\" to supplement Aeroplan. Aeroplan remained the frequent flyer rewards program, collecting miles which can be \"spent\", whereas status level is determined by Altitude standing.\n\nThere are five levels of membership in Air Canada's Altitude Program: Basic, Prestige 25K, Elite 35K, Elite 50K, Elite 75K and Super Elite 100K. The latter three are called \"Top Tier\" membership levels and provide travel benefits such as upgrades, lounge access, priority services (e.g., check-in, luggage handling), and bonuses when earning miles through air travel. In order to qualify for these levels, a member must earn, through flight activities, a certain number of miles ''or'' a certain number of segments ''and'' spending some level of money. Altitude refers to these as Altitude Qualifying Miles (AQM), Segments (AQS), and Dollars (AQD).\n\nPrestige members and Altitude Elite 35 K receive Star Alliance Silver status, while Elite 50K, Elite 75K, and Super Elite 100K members receive Star Alliance Gold status.\n\nAir Canada Status Miles are calculated on an annual basis (1 January through 31 December) to determine Altitude Membership Status for the following benefit year (1 March through 28 February). At the 35K and above levels, that level of status is granted when achieved, for the remainder of the current year, as well as for the next year.\n\nThis coincides with the alliance with [[Star Alliance]], and this can give you access to any Star Alliance lounge (you must be Star Alliance Gold) and discounts or upgrades on another Star Alliance member. \n\n===Status requirements===\n\nBeginning 1 January 2016, for the 2017 status year, Air Canada began requiring a minimum spend level for each level, Altitude Qualifying Dollars. The requirements were not changed for 2018, and thus are currently at:\n{{col div}}\n*Altitude Prestige: 25,000 AQM or 25 AQS and $3,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 35K: 35,000 AQM or 35 AQS and $4,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 50K: 50,000 AQM or 50 AQS and $6,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 75K: 75,000 AQM or 75 AQS and $9,000 AQD\n*Altitude Super Elite: 100,000 AQM or 95 AQS and $20,000 AQD\n{{col div end}}\n==Accidents and incidents==\n{{for|incidents before 1963|Trans-Canada Air Lines}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Flight number\n!Description\n|-\n|<center>13 June 1964</center>\n|<center>3277</center>\n|[[Vickers Viscount]] registration CF-THT was damaged beyond economical repair when it crash-landed at Toronto Airport after the failure of two engines on approach.<ref name=ASN130664>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19640613-1 |title=Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n|-\n|<center>19 May 1967</center>\n|\n|[[Douglas DC-8|McDonnell Douglas DC-8-54F]] CF-TJM crashed and burned on a training flight while making a three-engine landing at [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|Ottawa]], Ontario.

During the period of bankruptcy protection, the company was subject to two competing bids from [[Cerberus Capital Management]] and [[Victor Li]]. The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus' international advisory board chair [[Dan Quayle]], the former Vice-President of the United States. Cerberus was rejected because it had a reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the [[CAW National Council 4000|CAW]]. At first, Air Canada selected Victor Li's ''Trinity Time Investments'', which initially asked for a board veto and the chairmanship in return for investing $650 million in the airline. Li, who holds dual citizenship from Canada and Hong Kong, later demanded changes to the pension plan (which was not in his original takeover bid), but since the unions refused to budge, the bid was withdrawn.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-04-05-air-canada_x.htm |title=Air Canada unions dig in, rescue deal seen at risk |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=5 April 2004 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nFinally, [[Deutsche Bank]] unveiled an $850 million financing package for Air Canada, if it would cut $200 million in annual costs in addition to the $1.1 billion that the unions agreed on in 2003.

Aeroplan remained the frequent flyer rewards program, collecting miles which can be \"spent\", whereas status level is determined by Altitude standing.\n\nThere are five levels of membership in Air Canada's Altitude Program: Basic, Prestige 25K, Elite 35K, Elite 50K, Elite 75K and Super Elite 100K. The latter three are called \"Top Tier\" membership levels and provide travel benefits such as upgrades, lounge access, priority services (e.g., check-in, luggage handling), and bonuses when earning miles through air travel. In order to qualify for these levels, a member must earn, through flight activities, a certain number of miles ''or'' a certain number of segments ''and'' spending some level of money. Altitude refers to these as Altitude Qualifying Miles (AQM), Segments (AQS), and Dollars (AQD).\n\nPrestige members and Altitude Elite 35 K receive Star Alliance Silver status, while Elite 50K, Elite 75K, and Super Elite 100K members receive Star Alliance Gold status.\n\nAir Canada Status Miles are calculated on an annual basis (1 January through 31 December) to determine Altitude Membership Status for the following benefit year (1 March through 28 February). At the 35K and above levels, that level of status is granted when achieved, for the remainder of the current year, as well as for the next year.\n\nThis coincides with the alliance with [[Star Alliance]], and this can give you access to any Star Alliance lounge (you must be Star Alliance Gold) and discounts or upgrades on another Star Alliance member. \n\n===Status requirements===\n\nBeginning 1 January 2016, for the 2017 status year, Air Canada began requiring a minimum spend level for each level, Altitude Qualifying Dollars. The requirements were not changed for 2018, and thus are currently at:\n{{col div}}\n*Altitude Prestige: 25,000 AQM or 25 AQS and $3,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 35K: 35,000 AQM or 35 AQS and $4,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 50K: 50,000 AQM or 50 AQS and $6,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 75K: 75,000 AQM or 75 AQS and $9,000 AQD\n*Altitude Super Elite: 100,000 AQM or 95 AQS and $20,000 AQD\n{{col div end}}\n==Accidents and incidents==\n{{for|incidents before 1963|Trans-Canada Air Lines}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Flight number\n!Description\n|-\n|<center>13 June 1964</center>\n|<center>3277</center>\n|[[Vickers Viscount]] registration CF-THT was damaged beyond economical repair when it crash-landed at Toronto Airport after the failure of two engines on approach.<ref name=ASN130664>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19640613-1 |title=Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n|-\n|<center>19 May 1967</center>\n|\n|[[Douglas DC-8|McDonnell Douglas DC-8-54F]] CF-TJM crashed and burned on a training flight while making a three-engine landing at [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|Ottawa]], Ontario.
