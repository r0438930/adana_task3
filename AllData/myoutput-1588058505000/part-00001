From the uplands to the west, rivers and streams cut channels in a generally west to east or southeast direction. [[Erosion]] of the Rockies provided [[alluvial]] and [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] sediment that filled the ancient channels and eventually covered the entire area of the present-day aquifer, forming the water-bearing Ogallala Formation.<ref>Gustavson, T.

The major differences are time and depth.\n\nThe depth of the Ogallala varies with the shape of then-prevailing surface, being deepest where it fills ancient valleys and channels. The Ogallala Formation consists mostly of coarse sedimentary rocks in its deeper sections, which transition upward into finer-grained material. \n\nThe water-saturated thickness of the Ogallala Formation ranges from a few feet to more than 1,000&nbsp;feet. Its deepest part is 1200 ft. (300&nbsp;m) and is generally greater in the Northern Plains.<ref>[http://www.hpwd.com/the_ogallala.asp High Plains Underground Water Conservation District #1 (Texas)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514235824/http://www.hpwd.com/the_ogallala.asp |date=2007-05-14 }} retrieved April 9, 2007.</ref> The depth of the water below the surface of the land ranges from almost {{convert|400|ft}} in parts of the north to between {{convert|100|and|200|ft|m|0}} throughout much of the south. Present-day recharge of the aquifer with fresh water occurs at an exceedingly slow rate, suggesting that much of the water in its [[porosity|pore]] spaces is [[paleowater]], dating back to the [[last glacial period|most recent ice age]] and probably earlier.\n\nGroundwater within the Ogallala generally flows from west to east at an average rate of a foot per day. [[Hydraulic conductivity]], or the ability for a fluid (water) to move through porous material, ranges from {{convert|25|to|300|ft|m}} per day.<ref>Gutentag, E. D, Heimes, F. J, Krothe, N.

While groundwater is a renewable source, reserves replenish relatively slowly. The [[US Geological Survey|USGS]] has performed several studies of the aquifer, to determine what is coming in ([[groundwater recharge]] from the surface), what is leaving (water pumped out and [[baseflow]] to streams), and what the net changes in storage are (rise, fall or no change).\n\nWithdrawals from the Ogallala Aquifer for irrigation amounted to {{convert|26|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} in 2000. As of 2005, the total depletion since before development amounted to {{convert|253,000,000|acre.ft|km3}}.<ref name=\"mcguire07\">{{Cite web\n|last= Mcguire, V.L. |title= Changes in Water Levels and Storage in the High Plains Aquifer, Predevelopment to 2005\n|work= USGS Fact Sheet 2007-3029 |publisher = [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |accessdate= 2009-08-12 |date= May 2007 |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2007/3029/}}</ref> Some estimates indicate the remaining volume could be depleted as soon as 2028.

Much of the plains region is [[steppe|semiarid]], with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the [[vadose zone]], with a shallow layer of [[caliche]] that is practically [[hydraulic conductivity|impermeable]]; this limits the amount of water able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the [[playa lakes]] is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.\n\nRecharge in the aquifer ranges from {{convert|0.024|in|mm}} per year in parts of Texas and New Mexico to {{convert|6|in|mm}} per year in south-central Kansas.<ref>[https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/usgspubs/pp/pp1400B ''Geohydrology of the High Plains Aquifer in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming''].

The success of large-scale farming in areas that do not have adequate [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and do not always have perennial [[surface water]] for diversion has depended heavily on pumping groundwater for irrigation.\n\nEarly settlers of the semiarid High Plains were plagued by crop failures due to cycles of [[drought]], culminating in the disastrous [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s. Only after [[World War II]], when center pivot irrigation became available, was the land mass of the High Plains aquifer system transformed into one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world.\n\n===Change in groundwater storage===\nGround water levels decline when the rate of extraction by irrigation exceeds the rate of recharge. At places, the water table was measured to drop more than 5&nbsp;ft (1.5&nbsp;m) per year at the time of maximum extraction. In extreme cases, the deepening of [[water well|wells]] was required to reach the steadily falling water table. In the 21st century, recognition of the significance of the aquifer has led to increased coverage from regional and international journalists.<ref>[http://www.nwanews.com/adg/Business/167660/ \"Shrinking aquifer looms as big problem for farms\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204014036/http://www.nwanews.com/adg/Business/167660/ |date=2009-02-04 }}.

Participating farmers grow corn with just over half of the water that they would normally require to irrigate the fields, or they plant several weeks later than customary. Pivot sprinklers are used in the project, rather than the more expensive drip irrigation.

From the uplands to the west, rivers and streams cut channels in a generally west to east or southeast direction. [[Erosion]] of the Rockies provided [[alluvial]] and [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] sediment that filled the ancient channels and eventually covered the entire area of the present-day aquifer, forming the water-bearing Ogallala Formation.<ref>Gustavson, T.

The major differences are time and depth.\n\nThe depth of the Ogallala varies with the shape of then-prevailing surface, being deepest where it fills ancient valleys and channels. The Ogallala Formation consists mostly of coarse sedimentary rocks in its deeper sections, which transition upward into finer-grained material. \n\nThe water-saturated thickness of the Ogallala Formation ranges from a few feet to more than 1,000&nbsp;feet.

(300&nbsp;m) and is generally greater in the Northern Plains.<ref>[http://www.hpwd.com/the_ogallala.asp High Plains Underground Water Conservation District #1 (Texas)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514235824/http://www.hpwd.com/the_ogallala.asp |date=2007-05-14 }} retrieved April 9, 2007.</ref> The depth of the water below the surface of the land ranges from almost {{convert|400|ft}} in parts of the north to between {{convert|100|and|200|ft|m|0}} throughout much of the south. Present-day recharge of the aquifer with fresh water occurs at an exceedingly slow rate, suggesting that much of the water in its [[porosity|pore]] spaces is [[paleowater]], dating back to the [[last glacial period|most recent ice age]] and probably earlier.\n\nGroundwater within the Ogallala generally flows from west to east at an average rate of a foot per day. [[Hydraulic conductivity]], or the ability for a fluid (water) to move through porous material, ranges from {{convert|25|to|300|ft|m}} per day.<ref>Gutentag, E. D, Heimes, F. J, Krothe, N.

While groundwater is a renewable source, reserves replenish relatively slowly. The [[US Geological Survey|USGS]] has performed several studies of the aquifer, to determine what is coming in ([[groundwater recharge]] from the surface), what is leaving (water pumped out and [[baseflow]] to streams), and what the net changes in storage are (rise, fall or no change).\n\nWithdrawals from the Ogallala Aquifer for irrigation amounted to {{convert|26|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} in 2000.

Much of the plains region is [[steppe|semiarid]], with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the [[vadose zone]], with a shallow layer of [[caliche]] that is practically [[hydraulic conductivity|impermeable]]; this limits the amount of water able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the [[playa lakes]] is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.\n\nRecharge in the aquifer ranges from {{convert|0.024|in|mm}} per year in parts of Texas and New Mexico to {{convert|6|in|mm}} per year in south-central Kansas.<ref>[https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/usgspubs/pp/pp1400B ''Geohydrology of the High Plains Aquifer in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming''].

The success of large-scale farming in areas that do not have adequate [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and do not always have perennial [[surface water]] for diversion has depended heavily on pumping groundwater for irrigation.\n\nEarly settlers of the semiarid High Plains were plagued by crop failures due to cycles of [[drought]], culminating in the disastrous [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s. Only after [[World War II]], when center pivot irrigation became available, was the land mass of the High Plains aquifer system transformed into one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world.\n\n===Change in groundwater storage===\nGround water levels decline when the rate of extraction by irrigation exceeds the rate of recharge. At places, the water table was measured to drop more than 5&nbsp;ft (1.5&nbsp;m) per year at the time of maximum extraction. In extreme cases, the deepening of [[water well|wells]] was required to reach the steadily falling water table. In the 21st century, recognition of the significance of the aquifer has led to increased coverage from regional and international journalists.<ref>[http://www.nwanews.com/adg/Business/167660/ \"Shrinking aquifer looms as big problem for farms\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204014036/http://www.nwanews.com/adg/Business/167660/ |date=2009-02-04 }}.

Participating farmers grow corn with just over half of the water that they would normally require to irrigate the fields, or they plant several weeks later than customary. Pivot sprinklers are used in the project, rather than the more expensive drip irrigation. According to district manager Steve Walthour, conservation is essential considering declining levels of the aquifer.<ref name=\"cons\">{{cite web | url=http://lubbockonline.com/texas/2013-07-01/texas-push-show-farmers-how-save-water#.UdNzYBUo45t | title=In Texas, a push to show farmers how to save water | publisher=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal | work=lubbockonline.com/ | date=July 1, 2013 | accessdate=August 1, 2013 | author=Gailbraith, Kate | quote=The North Plains district first imposed pumping limits in 2005 and tightened them in 2009. In 2005, it also began phasing in requirements for some wells to have meters. Both moves were controversial at the time. A larger groundwater district just south of North Plains, the 16-county High Plains Underground Water Conservation District, has struggled in its attempts to impose metering requirements and pumping limits.  North Plains officials \"just were a little further ahead of the curve\", said David Brauer, who manages the Ogallala Aquifer program for a United States Department of Agriculture research laboratory in the Panhandle town of Bushland.

They are leaving more space between plants,  a technique that retains moisture for a longer period of time. Soil sensors permit farmers to gather accurate information about the moisture level of their crops. The motivation to save water comes from the district's regulations on extracting water from the aquifer. The [[United States Geological Survey]] determined the water level in the aquifer has dropped more in Texas than in any other state in the basin.<ref name=\"cons\" />\n\nFarmers on their own land may draw water without charge from the aquifer. Pumping costs are low because the fuel used, [[natural gas]], is inexpensive. The North Plains district first established limits on pumping in 2005 and tightened the regulations four years later. Certain wells are now required to have meters. Yet another challenge facing the district is that higher prices for crops{{when|date=April 2016}} have prompted some to plant additional fields and further increase the use of water from the aquifer.<ref name=\"cons\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Aquifer]]\n*[[Fossil water]]\n*[[Great Recycling and Northern Development Canal]]\n*[[Groundwater]]\n*[[Guarani Aquifer]]\n*[[Hydrogeology]]\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n*[[Irrigation]]\n*[[Laurentide Ice Sheet]]\n*[[Llano Estacado]]\n*[[Water table]]\n*[[Western Interior Seaway]], the salt-water strait that once covered the area of today's Ogalalla Aquifer. \n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Ogallala Aquifer}}\n*[http://kerrcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ogallala_aquifer.pdf \"The Ogallala Aquifer\"] Manjula V.
