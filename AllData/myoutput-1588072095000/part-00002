The woolen and worsted industries were completely a product of Japan's re-established contact with the West in the 1850s and 1860s. Before the 1860s, Japanese clothing consisted entirely of a great variety of [[kimono]]. These first appeared in the [[J\u014dmon period]] (14,500 B.C. \u2013 300 B.C.), with no distinction between [[male]] and [[female]].\n\nAfter Japan opened up for trading with the outside world, other clothing options started to come in. The first Japanese to adopt western clothing were officers and men of some units of the sh\u014dgun's army and navy.\n\nSometime in the 1850s these men adopted woolen uniforms worn by English marines stationed at Yokohama. To produce them domestically was not easy, and cloth had to be imported. Perhaps the most significant of this early adoption of Western styles was its public origin.

Soon, courtiers and bureaucrats were urged to adopt Western clothing, which was thought to be more practical.\n\nThe [[Ministry of Education]] ordered that Western-style student uniforms be worn in public colleges and universities. Businessmen, teachers, doctors, bankers, and other leaders of the new society wore suits to work and at large social functions. Although western-style dress was becoming more popular for workplaces, schools, and streets, it was not worn by everybody.<ref>Dalby, Liza. (Mar 1995) \"Kimono: Fashioning Culture\".</ref>\n\nSince [[World War II]] most areas have been taken over by western clothing. Thus, by the opening of the twentieth century, western dress was a symbol of social dignity and progressiveness. However, the vast majority of Japanese stuck to their fashions, in favor of the more comfortable kimono. Western dress for street wear and Japanese dress at home remained the general rule for a very long time.<ref name=Jackson95/>\n\nAn example of Eastern influence from Japan that spread to the rest of the world is evident in the late 1880s. An ordinary wool blanket was used as a shawl for women, and a red blanket was featured in ''Vogue'' for winter wear.\n\nUntil the 1930s, the majority of Japanese wore the kimono, and Western clothes were still restricted to out-of-home use by certain classes. The Japanese have interpreted western clothing styles from the United States and Europe and made it their own. Overall, it is evident throughout history that there has been much more of a Western influence on Japan's culture and clothing. However, the traditional kimono remains a major part of the Japanese way of life and will be for a long time.<ref name=Jackson95/>\n\n== Types of traditional clothing ==\n\n=== Kimono ===\n{{main|Kimono}}\n[[File:Gion Sayaka 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tomesode|Kuro-Tomesode]] (black Tomesode)]]\nThe Kimono (\u7740\u7269), labelled the \"national costume of Japan\",<ref name=\":3\">Assmann, Stephanie. \"Between Tradition and Innovation: The Reinvention of the Kimono in Japanese Consumer Culture.\" ''Fashion Theory: The Journal of Dress, Body & Culture'' 12, no. 3 (September 2008): 359-376.

The process of wearing a kimono requires a knowledge of multiple steps and layers that must precede the final thick layer of the outer robe. Kimono schools have been built specifically to teach those interested in learning about the garment and the proper method of wearing it.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:-Japanese Woman in Traditional Dress Posing Outdoors- MET DP155576.jpg|thumb|upright|''Japanese Woman in Traditional Dress Posing Outdoors'' by [[Suzuki Shin'ichi I|Suzuki Shin'ichi]], ca. 1870s]]\nThe uchikake is a type of kimono coat worn by Japanese brides on their wedding day. Unlike Western styled wedding gowns that include a train solely following the back of the bride's dress, the uchikake features a long train of fabric encircling the bride's entire body. Traditionally, it was typically a red coat with cranes printed on the design, but in modern times, many brides opt to wear white. This characteristic requires brides to be accompanied by people to hold onto all ends of the gown as she transports between locations.<ref>Whiting, Connie. Types of Clothing in Japan. Demand Media Incorporated, 2016 (accessed November 2, 2016).</ref>\n\nIn modern Japan, kimono are a marked feminine costume and a national attire. There are multiple types and subtypes of kimono that a woman can wear: [[furisode]] (a type of kimono with longer sleeves worn by single women, worn mostly for coming of age celebrations), [[uchikake]] and shiromuku, houmongi, [[yukata]], [[tomesode]], and [[mofuku]], depending on her marital status and the event she attends.<ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni99/>\n\n====Dressing in kimono====\nThe word kimono literally translates as \"thing to wear\", and up until the 19th century it was the main form of dress worn by men and women alike in Japan.<ref name=Grant05>Grant, P. (2005). Kimonos: the robes of Japan. ''Phoebe Grant\u2019s Fascinating Stories of World Cultures and Customs'', 42.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the art of assembling the kimono was passed on from mother to daughter. Today this art is also taught in schools, and the technique is the same.<ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni99/> First, one puts on the tabi, which are white cotton socks.<ref name=Grant05/> Then the undergarments are put on followed by a top and a wraparound skirt.<ref name=Grant05/> Next, the nagajuban (under-kimono) is put on, which is then tied by a datemaki belt.<ref name=Grant05/> Finally, the kimono is put on, with the left side covering the right, and then tied with an obi. (It is important to not tie the kimono with the right side covering the left because this signifies the dressing of a corpse for burial.<ref name=Grant05/>) When the kimono is worn outside, z\u014dri sandals are traditionally worn on the feet.<ref name=Grant05/>\n\n[[File:Japanese Wedding Day.jpg|thumb|left|A couple wearing kimono on their wedding day]]\nThere are types of kimono that are worn for different occasions and seasons. Women typically wear kimono when they attend traditional arts, such as a tea ceremonies or [[ikebana]] classes.<ref name=Jackson95/> Girls and young single women wear furisode: a colorful style of kimono with long sleeves that are tied with a brightly colored obi.<ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni99/>\n\nDuring wedding ceremonies, the bride and groom will often go through many costume changes. Shiromuku or [[uchikake]] are worn by brides, which are heavily embroidered white kimono.<ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni99/> Grooms wear black kimono made from habutae silk.\n\nFuneral kimono (''mofuku') for both men and women are plain black with five 'mon' (crests), though Western clothing is also worn to funerals. Any plain black kimono with less than five crests is not considered to be mourning wear.\n\nThe \"coming of age\" ceremony, [[Seijin no Hi]], is another occasion where kimono are worn.<ref>Ashikari, M. (2003). The memory of the women\u2019s white faces: Japanese and the ideal image of women. ''Japan Forum'', 15 (1), 55.</ref> At these annual celebrations, women wear brightly-coloured furisode, often with fur stoles around the neck. Other occasions where kimono are traditionally worn in the modern day include the period surrounding the New Year, graduation ceremonies, and [[Shichi-go-san]], which is a celebration for children aged 3, 5 and 7.\n\n====Seasons====\nKimono are matched with seasons. Awase (lined) kimono, made of silk, wool, or synthetic fabrics, are worn during the cooler months.<ref name=Jackson95/> During these months, kimono with more rustic colors and patterns (like russet leaves), and kimono with darker colors and multiple layers, are favored.<ref name=Jackson95/> Light, cotton yukata are worn by men and women during the spring and summer months. In the warmer weather months, vibrant colors and floral designs (like cherry blossoms) are common.<ref name=Jackson95/>\n\n====Materials====\n[[File:Kimono backshot by sth der.png|thumb|upright|Formal \"tateya musubi\" obi knot]]\nUp until the fifteenth century kimono were made of [[hemp]] or linen, and they were made with multiple layers of materials.<ref name=Yamaka12>Yamaka, Norio. (Nov 9 2012) The Book of Kimono.</ref> Today, kimono can be made of silk, silk brocade, silk crepes (such as chirimen) and satin weaves (such as [[rinzu]]).<ref name=Yamaka12/> Modern kimono that are made with less-expensive easy-care fabrics such as rayon, cotton sateen, cotton, polyester and other synthetic fibers, are more widely worn today in Japan.<ref name=Yamaka12/> However, silk is still considered the ideal fabric for more formal kimono.<ref name=Jackson95/>\n\nKimono are typically 39-43 inches long with eight 14-15 inch-wide pieces.<ref name=Nakagawa63>Nakagawa, K. Rosovsky, H. (1963). The case of the dying kimono: the influence of changing fashions on the development of the Japanese woolen industry. ''The Business History Review'', 37 (1/2), 59-68</ref> These pieces are sewn together to create the basic T-shape. Kimono are traditionally sewn by hand.<ref name=Nakagawa63/> However, even machine-made kimono require substantial hand-stitching.\n\nKimono are traditionally made from a single bolt of fabric called a ''tanmono''.<ref name=Jackson95/> Tanmono come in standard dimensions, and the entire bolt is used to make one kimono.<ref name=Jackson95/> The finished kimono consists of four main strips of fabric \u2014 two panels covering the body and two panels forming the sleeves \u2014 with additional smaller strips forming the narrow front panels and collar.<ref name=Nakagawa63/> Kimono fabrics are frequently hand-made and -decorated.\n\nKimono are worn with sash-belts called [[Obi (sash)|obi]], of which there are several varieties. In previous centuries, obi were relatively pliant and soft, so literally held the kimono closed; modern-day obi are generally stiffer, meaning the kimono is actually kept closed through tying a series of flat ribbons, such as kumihimo, around the body. The two most common varieties of obi for women are ''fukuro'' obi, which can be worn with everything but the most casual forms of kimono, and ''nagoya'' obi, which are narrower at one end to make them easier to wear.\n\n=== Yukata ===\nThe Yukata (\u6d74\u8863) is a kimono-like robe that is worn specifically in the spring and summer, and it is generally less expensive than the traditional kimono. Because it was made for warm weather, the fabric is often lighter in weight and brighter in color in order to correspond to the seasons. It is worn for festivals and cherry blossom viewing ceremonies, but is considered to be informal.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/traditional-fashions|title=16 Traditional Japanese Fashions|last=Spacey|first=John|date=July 11, 2015|website=Japan Talk|publisher=|access-date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Hakama, obi, z\u014dri ===\nThe hakama, which resembles a long, wide pleated skirt, is generally worn over the kimono and is considered formal wear. Although it was traditionally created to be worn by men of all occupations (craftsmen, farmers, samurai, etc.), it is now socially accepted to be worn by women as well.\n\nThe [[Obi (sash)|obi]] is similar to a belt as it wraps around the final layer of the traditional robe to help in keeping all of the layers together for a long period of time. It is often bright, extremely thick, and bow-shaped, and it serves as the final touch to the costume.\n\nA [[z\u014dri]] is a type of sandal worn with a traditional outfit that resembles flip-flops by design, with the exception that the base of the shoe is a block of wood, rather than rubber or plastic. These shoes are typically worn with white socks that are usually covered by the gown. The geta is a sandal similar to a z\u014dri that is made to be worn in the snow or dirt, featured with wooden columns underneath the shoes.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Designers ===\nMultiple designers use the kimono as a foundation for their current designs, being influenced by its cultural and aesthetic aspects and including them into their garments.\n\n[[File:Brigitte Lacombe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Issey Miyake]], known for his technology-driven clothing designs]]\n[[Issey Miyake]] is most known for crossing boundaries in fashion and reinventing forms of clothing while simultaneously transmitting the traditional qualities of the culture into his work. He has explored various techniques in design, provoking discussion on what identifies as \"dress\". He has also been tagged the \"Picasso of Fashion\" due to his recurring confrontation of traditional values. Miyake found interest in working with dancers to create clothing that would best suit them and their aerobic movements, eventually replacing the models he initially worked with for dancers, in hopes of producing clothing that benefits people of all classifications.<ref name=\":0\" /> His use of pleats and polyester jersey reflected a modern form of fashion due to their practical comfort and elasticity. Over 10 years of Miyake's work was featured in Paris in 1998 at the \"Issey Miyake: Making Things\" exhibition. His two most popular series was titled, \"Pleats, Please\" and \"A-POC (A piece of Cloth)\".\n\n[[Yohji Yamamoto]] and [[Rei Kawakubo]] are Japanese fashion designers who share similar tastes in design and style, their work often considered by the public to be difficult to differentiate. They were influenced by social conflicts, as their recognizable work bloomed and was influenced by the post war era of Japan. They differ from Miyake and several other fashion designers in their dominating use of dark colors, especially the color black. Traditional clothing often included a variety of colors in their time, and their use of \"the absence of color\" provoked multiple critics to voice their opinions and criticize the authenticity of their work. American Vogue of April 1983 labeled the two \"avant-garde designers\", eventually leading them to their success and popularity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Aesthetics ===\nThe Japanese are often recognized for their traditional art and its capability of transforming simplicity into creative designs. As stated by Valerie Foley, \"Fan shapes turn out to be waves, waves metamorphose into mountains; simple knots are bird wings; wobbly semicircles signify half-submerged Heian period carriage wheels\".<ref>Foley, Valerie. \"Western fashion, Eastern look: the influence of the kimono and the qipau.\" ''Surface Design Journal'' 24, no. 1 (September 1, 1999): 23-29. ''Bibliography of Asian Studies'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 3, 2016).\n</ref> These art forms have been transferred onto fabric that then mold into clothing. With traditional clothing, specific techniques are used and followed, such as metal applique, silk embroidery, and paste- resist. The type of fabric used to produce the clothing was often indicative of a person's social class, for the wealthy were able to afford clothing created with fabrics of higher quality. Stitching techniques and the fusion of colors also distinguished the wealthy from the commoner, as those of higher power had a tendency to wear ornate, brighter clothing.<ref>Carpenter, John T. \"Weaving Kimono Back into the Fabric of Japanese Art History.\" ''Orientations'' (October 2014): 1-5.

Ageha (\u63da\u7fbd), which translates to \"swallowtail butterfly\",  roots from a club-hostess look, as the club culture is prevalent in the nightlife of the Shibuya district. Those who follow the Ageha trend are often seen wearing dark, thick eyeliner, false eyelashes, and contact lenses specially worn to transform the appearance of eyes to make them appear larger. The style is also characterized by lighter hair and sparkly accessories. The [[Kogal]] trend is found in both Shibuya and Harajuku, and is influenced by a \"schoolgirl\" look, with participants often wearing short skirts, oversized knee-high socks. It is also characterized by artificially tanned skin or dark makeup, pale lipstick, and light hair.<ref>Black, Daniel. \"Wearing Out Racial Discourse: Tokyo Street Fashion and Race as Style.\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 42, no. 2 (April 2009): 239-256.

(Mar 1995) \"Kimono: Fashioning Culture\".</ref>\n\nSince [[World War II]] most areas have been taken over by western clothing. Thus, by the opening of the twentieth century, western dress was a symbol of social dignity and progressiveness. However, the vast majority of Japanese stuck to their fashions, in favor of the more comfortable kimono. Western dress for street wear and Japanese dress at home remained the general rule for a very long time.<ref name=Jackson95/>\n\nAn example of Eastern influence from Japan that spread to the rest of the world is evident in the late 1880s. An ordinary wool blanket was used as a shawl for women, and a red blanket was featured in ''Vogue'' for winter wear.\n\nUntil the 1930s, the majority of Japanese wore the kimono, and Western clothes were still restricted to out-of-home use by certain classes. The Japanese have interpreted western clothing styles from the United States and Europe and made it their own. Overall, it is evident throughout history that there has been much more of a Western influence on Japan's culture and clothing. However, the traditional kimono remains a major part of the Japanese way of life and will be for a long time.<ref name=Jackson95/>\n\n== Types of traditional clothing ==\n\n=== Kimono ===\n{{main|Kimono}}\n[[File:Gion Sayaka 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tomesode|Kuro-Tomesode]] (black Tomesode)]]\nThe Kimono (\u7740\u7269), labelled the \"national costume of Japan\",<ref name=\":3\">Assmann, Stephanie. \"Between Tradition and Innovation: The Reinvention of the Kimono in Japanese Consumer Culture.\" ''Fashion Theory: The Journal of Dress, Body & Culture'' 12, no. 3 (September 2008): 359-376.

The process of wearing a kimono requires a knowledge of multiple steps and layers that must precede the final thick layer of the outer robe. Kimono schools have been built specifically to teach those interested in learning about the garment and the proper method of wearing it.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:-Japanese Woman in Traditional Dress Posing Outdoors- MET DP155576.jpg|thumb|upright|''Japanese Woman in Traditional Dress Posing Outdoors'' by [[Suzuki Shin'ichi I|Suzuki Shin'ichi]], ca. 1870s]]\nThe uchikake is a type of kimono coat worn by Japanese brides on their wedding day. Unlike Western styled wedding gowns that include a train solely following the back of the bride's dress, the uchikake features a long train of fabric encircling the bride's entire body. Traditionally, it was typically a red coat with cranes printed on the design, but in modern times, many brides opt to wear white. This characteristic requires brides to be accompanied by people to hold onto all ends of the gown as she transports between locations.<ref>Whiting, Connie. Types of Clothing in Japan. Demand Media Incorporated, 2016 (accessed November 2, 2016).</ref>\n\nIn modern Japan, kimono are a marked feminine costume and a national attire. There are multiple types and subtypes of kimono that a woman can wear: [[furisode]] (a type of kimono with longer sleeves worn by single women, worn mostly for coming of age celebrations), [[uchikake]] and shiromuku, houmongi, [[yukata]], [[tomesode]], and [[mofuku]], depending on her marital status and the event she attends.<ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni99/>\n\n====Dressing in kimono====\nThe word kimono literally translates as \"thing to wear\", and up until the 19th century it was the main form of dress worn by men and women alike in Japan.<ref name=Grant05>Grant, P. (2005). Kimonos: the robes of Japan. ''Phoebe Grant\u2019s Fascinating Stories of World Cultures and Customs'', 42.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the art of assembling the kimono was passed on from mother to daughter. Today this art is also taught in schools, and the technique is the same.<ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni99/> First, one puts on the tabi, which are white cotton socks.<ref name=Grant05/> Then the undergarments are put on followed by a top and a wraparound skirt.<ref name=Grant05/> Next, the nagajuban (under-kimono) is put on, which is then tied by a datemaki belt.<ref name=Grant05/> Finally, the kimono is put on, with the left side covering the right, and then tied with an obi. (It is important to not tie the kimono with the right side covering the left because this signifies the dressing of a corpse for burial.<ref name=Grant05/>) When the kimono is worn outside, z\u014dri sandals are traditionally worn on the feet.<ref name=Grant05/>\n\n[[File:Japanese Wedding Day.jpg|thumb|left|A couple wearing kimono on their wedding day]]\nThere are types of kimono that are worn for different occasions and seasons. Women typically wear kimono when they attend traditional arts, such as a tea ceremonies or [[ikebana]] classes.<ref name=Jackson95/> Girls and young single women wear furisode: a colorful style of kimono with long sleeves that are tied with a brightly colored obi.<ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni99/>\n\nDuring wedding ceremonies, the bride and groom will often go through many costume changes. Shiromuku or [[uchikake]] are worn by brides, which are heavily embroidered white kimono.<ref name=Goldstein-Gidoni99/> Grooms wear black kimono made from habutae silk.\n\nFuneral kimono (''mofuku') for both men and women are plain black with five 'mon' (crests), though Western clothing is also worn to funerals. Any plain black kimono with less than five crests is not considered to be mourning wear.\n\nThe \"coming of age\" ceremony, [[Seijin no Hi]], is another occasion where kimono are worn.<ref>Ashikari, M. (2003). The memory of the women\u2019s white faces: Japanese and the ideal image of women. ''Japan Forum'', 15 (1), 55.</ref> At these annual celebrations, women wear brightly-coloured furisode, often with fur stoles around the neck. Other occasions where kimono are traditionally worn in the modern day include the period surrounding the New Year, graduation ceremonies, and [[Shichi-go-san]], which is a celebration for children aged 3, 5 and 7.\n\n====Seasons====\nKimono are matched with seasons. Awase (lined) kimono, made of silk, wool, or synthetic fabrics, are worn during the cooler months.<ref name=Jackson95/> During these months, kimono with more rustic colors and patterns (like russet leaves), and kimono with darker colors and multiple layers, are favored.<ref name=Jackson95/> Light, cotton yukata are worn by men and women during the spring and summer months. In the warmer weather months, vibrant colors and floral designs (like cherry blossoms) are common.<ref name=Jackson95/>\n\n====Materials====\n[[File:Kimono backshot by sth der.png|thumb|upright|Formal \"tateya musubi\" obi knot]]\nUp until the fifteenth century kimono were made of [[hemp]] or linen, and they were made with multiple layers of materials.<ref name=Yamaka12>Yamaka, Norio. (Nov 9 2012) The Book of Kimono.</ref> Today, kimono can be made of silk, silk brocade, silk crepes (such as chirimen) and satin weaves (such as [[rinzu]]).<ref name=Yamaka12/> Modern kimono that are made with less-expensive easy-care fabrics such as rayon, cotton sateen, cotton, polyester and other synthetic fibers, are more widely worn today in Japan.<ref name=Yamaka12/> However, silk is still considered the ideal fabric for more formal kimono.<ref name=Jackson95/>\n\nKimono are typically 39-43 inches long with eight 14-15 inch-wide pieces.<ref name=Nakagawa63>Nakagawa, K. Rosovsky, H. (1963). The case of the dying kimono: the influence of changing fashions on the development of the Japanese woolen industry. ''The Business History Review'', 37 (1/2), 59-68</ref> These pieces are sewn together to create the basic T-shape. Kimono are traditionally sewn by hand.<ref name=Nakagawa63/> However, even machine-made kimono require substantial hand-stitching.\n\nKimono are traditionally made from a single bolt of fabric called a ''tanmono''.<ref name=Jackson95/> Tanmono come in standard dimensions, and the entire bolt is used to make one kimono.<ref name=Jackson95/> The finished kimono consists of four main strips of fabric \u2014 two panels covering the body and two panels forming the sleeves \u2014 with additional smaller strips forming the narrow front panels and collar.<ref name=Nakagawa63/> Kimono fabrics are frequently hand-made and -decorated.\n\nKimono are worn with sash-belts called [[Obi (sash)|obi]], of which there are several varieties. In previous centuries, obi were relatively pliant and soft, so literally held the kimono closed; modern-day obi are generally stiffer, meaning the kimono is actually kept closed through tying a series of flat ribbons, such as kumihimo, around the body. The two most common varieties of obi for women are ''fukuro'' obi, which can be worn with everything but the most casual forms of kimono, and ''nagoya'' obi, which are narrower at one end to make them easier to wear.\n\n=== Yukata ===\nThe Yukata (\u6d74\u8863) is a kimono-like robe that is worn specifically in the spring and summer, and it is generally less expensive than the traditional kimono. Because it was made for warm weather, the fabric is often lighter in weight and brighter in color in order to correspond to the seasons. It is worn for festivals and cherry blossom viewing ceremonies, but is considered to be informal.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/traditional-fashions|title=16 Traditional Japanese Fashions|last=Spacey|first=John|date=July 11, 2015|website=Japan Talk|publisher=|access-date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Hakama, obi, z\u014dri ===\nThe hakama, which resembles a long, wide pleated skirt, is generally worn over the kimono and is considered formal wear. Although it was traditionally created to be worn by men of all occupations (craftsmen, farmers, samurai, etc.), it is now socially accepted to be worn by women as well.\n\nThe [[Obi (sash)|obi]] is similar to a belt as it wraps around the final layer of the traditional robe to help in keeping all of the layers together for a long period of time. It is often bright, extremely thick, and bow-shaped, and it serves as the final touch to the costume.\n\nA [[z\u014dri]] is a type of sandal worn with a traditional outfit that resembles flip-flops by design, with the exception that the base of the shoe is a block of wood, rather than rubber or plastic. These shoes are typically worn with white socks that are usually covered by the gown. The geta is a sandal similar to a z\u014dri that is made to be worn in the snow or dirt, featured with wooden columns underneath the shoes.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Designers ===\nMultiple designers use the kimono as a foundation for their current designs, being influenced by its cultural and aesthetic aspects and including them into their garments.\n\n[[File:Brigitte Lacombe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Issey Miyake]], known for his technology-driven clothing designs]]\n[[Issey Miyake]] is most known for crossing boundaries in fashion and reinventing forms of clothing while simultaneously transmitting the traditional qualities of the culture into his work. He has explored various techniques in design, provoking discussion on what identifies as \"dress\". He has also been tagged the \"Picasso of Fashion\" due to his recurring confrontation of traditional values. Miyake found interest in working with dancers to create clothing that would best suit them and their aerobic movements, eventually replacing the models he initially worked with for dancers, in hopes of producing clothing that benefits people of all classifications.<ref name=\":0\" /> His use of pleats and polyester jersey reflected a modern form of fashion due to their practical comfort and elasticity. Over 10 years of Miyake's work was featured in Paris in 1998 at the \"Issey Miyake: Making Things\" exhibition. His two most popular series was titled, \"Pleats, Please\" and \"A-POC (A piece of Cloth)\".\n\n[[Yohji Yamamoto]] and [[Rei Kawakubo]] are Japanese fashion designers who share similar tastes in design and style, their work often considered by the public to be difficult to differentiate. They were influenced by social conflicts, as their recognizable work bloomed and was influenced by the post war era of Japan. They differ from Miyake and several other fashion designers in their dominating use of dark colors, especially the color black. Traditional clothing often included a variety of colors in their time, and their use of \"the absence of color\" provoked multiple critics to voice their opinions and criticize the authenticity of their work. American Vogue of April 1983 labeled the two \"avant-garde designers\", eventually leading them to their success and popularity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Aesthetics ===\nThe Japanese are often recognized for their traditional art and its capability of transforming simplicity into creative designs. As stated by Valerie Foley, \"Fan shapes turn out to be waves, waves metamorphose into mountains; simple knots are bird wings; wobbly semicircles signify half-submerged Heian period carriage wheels\".<ref>Foley, Valerie. \"Western fashion, Eastern look: the influence of the kimono and the qipau.\" ''Surface Design Journal'' 24, no. 1 (September 1, 1999): 23-29. ''Bibliography of Asian Studies'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 3, 2016).\n</ref> These art forms have been transferred onto fabric that then mold into clothing. With traditional clothing, specific techniques are used and followed, such as metal applique, silk embroidery, and paste- resist. The type of fabric used to produce the clothing was often indicative of a person's social class, for the wealthy were able to afford clothing created with fabrics of higher quality. Stitching techniques and the fusion of colors also distinguished the wealthy from the commoner, as those of higher power had a tendency to wear ornate, brighter clothing.<ref>Carpenter, John T. \"Weaving Kimono Back into the Fabric of Japanese Art History.\" ''Orientations'' (October 2014): 1-5. ''Art & Architecture Source'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed November 9, 2016).\n</ref>\n\n== Influence on modern fashion ==\n\n===Tokyo street fashion===\n{{main|Japanese street fashion}}\nTraditional fashion gradually transformed to best suit Japanese people lifestyles, as their clothing became more practical, light, and self-expressive.\n\nJapanese street fashion emerged in the 1990s and differed from traditional fashion in the sense that it was initiated and popularized by the general public, specifically teenagers, rather than by well known fashion figures/designers.<ref name=\":1\">Aliyaapon, Jiratanatiteenun, et al. \"The Transformation of Japanese Street Fashion between 2006 and 2011.\" ''Advances In Applied Sociology'' no. 4 (2012): 292.

Different forms of street fashion have been socially categorized based on geography and style, such as the [[Lolita fashion|Lolita]] in Harajuku (\u539f\u5bbf) or the Ageha of Shibuya (\u6e0b\u8c37), all of them being based in the popular shopping districts of Tokyo, Japan.\n\n[[File:\u5236\u670d (5346443876).jpg|thumb|left|[[Kogal]] girls, identified by shortened [[Japanese school uniform]] skirts]]\nLolita emerged in Harajuku, Japan in the late 1990s and became popular in the mid 2000s. It is characterized by \"a knee length skirt or dress in a bell shape assisted by petticoats, worn with a blouse, knee high socks or stockings and a headdress\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Different sub-styles of Lolita include casual, gothic, and hime. Ageha (\u63da\u7fbd), which translates to \"swallowtail butterfly\",  roots from a club-hostess look, as the club culture is prevalent in the nightlife of the Shibuya district. Those who follow the Ageha trend are often seen wearing dark, thick eyeliner, false eyelashes, and contact lenses specially worn to transform the appearance of eyes to make them appear larger. The style is also characterized by lighter hair and sparkly accessories. The [[Kogal]] trend is found in both Shibuya and Harajuku, and is influenced by a \"schoolgirl\" look, with participants often wearing short skirts, oversized knee-high socks. It is also characterized by artificially tanned skin or dark makeup, pale lipstick, and light hair.<ref>Black, Daniel. \"Wearing Out Racial Discourse: Tokyo Street Fashion and Race as Style.\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 42, no. 2 (April 2009): 239-256.
