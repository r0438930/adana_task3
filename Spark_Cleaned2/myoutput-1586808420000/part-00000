Based on [[Roald Dahl]]'s [[Matilda (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film stars [[Mara Wilson]] as the [[Matilda Wormwood|title character]] with DeVito, [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Embeth Davidtz]], and [[Pam Ferris]] in supporting roles. The film centers on a young genius girl named Matilda Wormwood, who develops [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic abilities]] and uses them to deal with her disreputable family and Agatha Trunchbull, the ruthless, oppressive and tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School.\n\nProduced by DeVito's [[Jersey Group|Jersey Films]] and released theatrically in the United States on August 2, 1996 by [[TriStar Pictures]], the film received predominantly positive reviews from critics but was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $33 million in the United States on a $36 million budget.<ref name=\"gross\">{{mojo title|matilda|Matilda}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nYoung genius [[Matilda Wormwood]] is regularly neglected and mistreated by her parents, Harry and Zinnia, and her older brother, Michael. She is smart, independent and frequently goes to the public library where she finds solace in the fictional worlds found in the books. When Matilda's parents refuse to enroll her into school, she retaliates against them, first by adding [[hydrogen peroxide]] bleaching agent to her father's [[Hair conditioner|hair tonic]] and then by gluing his hat to his head. When Harry rips up the library's copy of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (which he finds appalling because of the title) and forces Matilda to watch television instead, Matilda becomes increasingly enraged until the television mysteriously explodes.\n\nOne of Harry's car dealership customers is Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School. Harry sells her a car in exchange for her admitting Matilda as a pupil. At school, Matilda makes friends but discovers Trunchbull's harsh punishments of the students, while Matilda's teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, takes a liking to Matilda due to her intelligence; Honey requests Matilda be moved up to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. Miss Honey tells the Wormwoods about Matilda's genius-level intellect, but they ignore her while Matilda discovers that her father is under surveillance by undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Bob and Bill (with whom Zinnia flirts) because of his illegal dealings. Her parents refuse to believe her as they assume that the agents are speedboat salesmen.\n\nAs a prank, one of Matilda's friends puts a [[newt]] in Trunchbull's water jug to scare her. Trunchbull accuses Matilda, whose anger at the injustice leads her to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] tip the glass over, splashing the newt onto Trunchbull. Honey invites Matilda over to her house for tea and reveals a secret: when she was two, her mother died and her father invited his stepsister-in-law, Miss Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her, but Trunchbull abused her; when Honey was five, her father died of an alleged [[suicide]] and left everything to Trunchbull. When Matilda and Honey sneak inside Trunchbull's house to obtain some of the latter's belongings, Trunchbull's sudden return prompts the duo to barely escape without getting caught.\n\nMatilda trains her telekinetic power by making objects fly around the house and thwarting the FBI agents who threaten to put her in an [[orphanage]]. Having practiced her ability, she returns to Trunchbull's house in an attempt to scare her away with telekinesis, but Trunchbull discovers Matilda's presence upon finding her hair ribbon. The next day, Matilda reveals her powers to Honey but Trunchbull visits the class to make Matilda confess. Matilda magically writes a message on the blackboard, pretending to be the vengeful soul of Miss Honey's deceased father, Magnus, who accuses Trunchbull of murdering him. Trunchbull attacks the students, but Matilda keeps them safe and she and the other students force her out of the school for good, and Honey moves back into her true home.\n\nThe FBI uncovers enough evidence to prosecute Harry, forcing the Wormwoods to flee to [[Guam]]. They stop by Honey's home to fetch Matilda, who refuses to go with them and says she would rather be adopted by Honey; remorseful for never understanding her daughter, Zinnia and Harry both sign Matilda's adoption papers and Matilda lives happily with Honey, who then becomes the new principal of Crunchem Hall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as [[Matilda Wormwood]]\n** Alissa and Amanda Graham, Trevor and James Gallagher as Newborn Matilda\n** Kayla and Kelsey Fredericks as 9-month-old Matilda\n** Amanda and Caitlin Fein as 2-year-old Matilda\n** Sara Magdalin as 4-year-old Matilda\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Miss Jennifer Honey\n** Amanda and Kristyn Summers as 2-year-old Miss Honey\n** Phoebe Pearl as 5-year-old Miss Honey\n* [[Pam_Ferris|Pam Ferris]] as [[Miss Trunchbull|Agatha Trunchbull]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Harold \"Harry\" Wormwood and the Narrator\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] as Zinnia Wormwood\n* [[Brian Levinson]] as Michael Wormwood\n** Nicholas Cox as 6-year-old Michael\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as FBI Agent Bob\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as FBI Agent Bill\n* Kiami Davael as Lavender \n* Jacqueline Steiger as Amanda Thripp\n* Kira Spencer Hesser as Hortensia\n* [[Jean Speegle Howard]] as Mrs. Phelps\n* [[Marion Dugan]] as Cookie\n* Cade Allum as Bruce Bogtrotter\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] (uncredited) as Mickey on \"The Million Dollar Sticky\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Pam Ferris]] (Miss Trunchbull) incurred several injuries during production on the film.
