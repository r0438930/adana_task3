The port only has a small basin which is occasionally used to provide water to the companies located at the [[Cassella]] Industrial Park.\n* [[Frankfurt Osthafen|Osthafen]] is the biggest port in Frankfurt and almost working at full capacity. It consists of the ''Oberhafen (Upper Harbour)'' and the ''Unterhafen'' ''(Lower Harbour)'' which are separated from each other by the [[Offenbach Barrage]]. Oberhafen consists of two basins, both of which flow directly into the Main, and is easily accessible from land via the [[Frankfurt City Link Line|Hafenbahn]] and the nearby A 661 [[Autobahn]]. A third, easterly basin was planned, but it was never built. The Unterhafen has the shape of a [[tuning fork]] and has a [[forebay (reservoir)]] which branches into two separate basins. A planned extension of the ''Nordbecken'' (north basin) was indeed excavated, but it was never connected to the basin. The pit filled up with [[groundwater]] and now forms the [[Schwedlersee]]. The [[Honsellbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the forebay and the [[Schmickbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the ''S\u00fcdbecken'' (southern basin).\n* The [[Mainkai]], located by the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], was the oldest port in the city. Today it serves as a waterfront. The extension of the Mainkai in the West towards the [[Main-Neckar-Br\u00fccke]] is called the [[Untermainkai]]. Until the mid-19th century a narrow [[tributary]] of the Main, called the ''Kleiner Main (Small Main),'' flowed underneath the quay's wall. The tributary was home to a small, off-shore island called ''Mainlust'', until the Kleiner Main was filled in during 1859. After the tributary had been filled in, the [[Nizza (Frankfurt)|Nizza]], an area of green space, developed. Tracks for the Verbindungsbahn still remain in the area, but now serve more of a tourist purpose for the [[Historic Railway, Frankfurt|Historic Railway]] than to transport goods. Companies such as ''Antwerpener Werft, Nizzawerft, Leonhardswert, Fahrtowerft,'' and ''Weseler Werft'' all make reference to the older usage of the port area as a shipyard (''Werft'' in German), as well as a historical loading crane located opposite the [[St\u00e4del Museum]]. By the [[Eiserner Steg]] there is still a landing stage for excursion ships; hotel ships also dock downstream to the [[Holbeinsteg]] during exhibition seasons.\n* The '''Schaumainkai''', located on the [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]] side of the Main, has become synonymous with the [[Museumsufer]] \u2014 a series of museums all located along the Main. Whilst the museums reside by the high banks of the river, the Tiefkai, the lower part of the port, is a green area and one of the most attractive parts of the city. There also exist references here to the previous usage of the port as a shipyard, such as ''Schifferwerft, Dreik\u00f6nigswerft, Deutschherrnwerft'', and ''Schlachthofwerft''.\n* The [[Westhafen]] in the [[Gutleutviertel]] district was converted into an inner-city living quarter. The basin, now connected by two bridges, still remains accessible and serves as a [[yacht harbor]]. The neighbouring [[Heizkraftwerk West]] still continues to receive black coal by ship via its own landing stage.\n* The The river port '''Gutleuthof''' downstream of the power plant is still in operation and has a rail connection to the port Hafenbahn.\n* The loading dock at [[Griesheim Industry Park|Griesheim Industrial Park]] is still used, albeit it only rarely.\n* The [[H\u00f6chster Hafen]] below the [[H\u00f6chster Altstadt]] was shut down in 1982. A gantry crane from the 1950s (extending to the height of the former power stations), as well as another crane from the 19th century at the mouth of the Niddamm, are reminders of the previous usage as a harbour.\n* At the [[H\u00f6chst Industrial Park]], there are six dock shelters on the north bank for handling tankers. Between the [[Mittlere Werksbr\u00fcck|mittlere Werksbr\u00fccke]] and the [[Leunabr\u00fccke]] is a quay wall several hundred meters long, where ships can also dock. The quay is mainly used to unload power plant coal for the park's combined heat and power plant. On the south side there is a 450-metre-long basin in which several ships can moor at the same time. It is mainly used for the delivery of rock salt for the [[Chloralkali process]] as well as container handling for the ''Rhine-Main Container Port''.\n\nCargo handling in the Frankfurt ports fluctuates depending on the economic situation, but is slightly declining overall. In 1997, a total of 8,439 ships were handled in all the Frankfurt ports, handling about 4.9 million tonnes of goods. By 2006, the figures had fallen to 5516 ships with approx. 3.5 million tonnes of goods handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frankfurt.de/-/media/d438f2d4342749469924a1947109c1da.ashx|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch Frankfurt am Main 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=frankfurt.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> The decline in bulk goods such as coal, gravel and scrap metal plays a major role in this.
