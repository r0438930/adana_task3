the democratic nature of the U.S. is lost and those who seek to keep it that way.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is in this way that the music industry reflects the nature of politics- quality and integrity is

Bush]] was the catalyst for his political intrigue, this link between political thought and music became much more evident upon the 2018 release of The Voidz\u2019 album, ''Virtue,'' through which he more explicitly expresses politically-charged ideas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Doing so, Casablancas explains, is using his music as a \u201cmeans to an end to make the world a better place.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The music industry, according to Casablancas, operates quite similarly to the political world, where \u201cwhoever\u2019s propaganda\u2019s the loudest\u201d is what is popular, regardless of its quality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2016 Casablancas interviewed [[Henry Giroux]], during which they discuss the idea of whether or not the average American identifies that there are still existing struggles and conflicts that need to be addressed within the country.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rolling Stone|title=Julian Casablancas Interviews Henry Giroux|date=2016-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLRWPsIzSOo&list=RD94hM2wkA1mw&index=3|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> Amongst various other issues impending on society today, Casablancas is most concerned with the idea that institutions have become more powerful than democratic government.<ref name=\":3\" /> He proposes that there is a perpetual conflict between those who understand that the democratic nature of the U.S. is lost and those who seek to keep it that way.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is in this way that the music industry reflects the nature of politics- quality and integrity is compromised under the control of capitalist greed.\n\nCasablancas cites some of his most politically influential figures as [[Oliver Stone]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Jesse Ventura]], and [[Howard Zinn]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He notes [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as his favorite philosopher, whose work, Casablancas claims, held truth as an important standard value.<ref name=\":3\" /> He recognizes [[Paul Robeson]] as someone who used his musical platform to help further his serious political intrigue and as someone who, therefore, serves as a role model for politically engaged musicians.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCasablancas has been a guest on ''[[Redacted Tonight]]'', as well as included its host, Lee Camp, as an opener for a Voidz show in Houston, Texas in October 2018.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCasablancas endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], and performed with his band at a rally in the [[University of New Hampshire]] the night before the New Hampshire primary.<ref> {{url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/the-strokes-bernie-sanders-rally-in-new-hampshire/}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\n[[Courtney Love]]'s song \"But Julian, I'm a Little Bit Older Than You\", from her debut solo album ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'' (2004), was written
