It was [[epicenter|centered]] near the city of [[Muzaffarabad]], and also affected Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province and Indian-administered [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. It registered a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.6 and had a maximum [[Modified Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of VIII (''Severe''). The earthquake also affected countries in the surrounding region where tremors were felt in [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[China|Chinese]] [[Xinjiang]]. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. It is considered the [[Lists_of_earthquakes#Deadliest_earthquakes|deadliest earthquake]] to hit [[South Asia]] since the [[1935 Quetta earthquake]].<ref name=\"Dawn_Quetta_2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/10/25/fea.htm|title=The great Quetta tragedy|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN Newspaper]]|date=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Earthquake==\nKashmir lies in the area of collision of the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[India Plate|Indian tectonic plates]]. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable [[seismicity]] in the region. The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the [[moment magnitude scale]], with its epicentre about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad.\n\n===Damage===\n[[File:earthquake Information for Pakistan.png|thumb|left|Map depicting regional tectonic plates]]\n\nMost of the devastation hit north Pakistan and [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]]. In Kashmir, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad.  Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.\n\nThe Pakistani government's official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could reach over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.\n\nAs Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck.  Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. Many people were also trapped in their homes and, because it was the month of [[Ramadan]], most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.\n\n[[File:USGS Shakemap - 2005 Kashmir earthquake.jpg|thumb|USGS Shakemap for the event]]\n\n:\"...a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now\", [[Kofi Annan]] said on 20 October with reference to the thousand remote villages in which people are in need of medical attention, food, clean water and shelter and the 120,000 survivors that have not yet been reached.\"<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1835627,00.html \"Thousands at risk of starving in earthquake aid shortfall\"] ''The Times'', 21 October 2005.

In the initial phases of response, the Pakistan Medical corps, Corps of Engineers, Army aviation and a large number of infantry units played important roles. Lt. Gen Afzal, Maj. Gen. Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj. Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co-ordination. The relief work in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and [[Jaipal Singh]]. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international [[NGO]]s with high pay scales. The rest of the money pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called [[Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority]], which was made by then military regime to accommodate retired high military officials and while keeping the command of the reconstruction and rehabilitation authority directly under the military. The basic infrastructure, including tertiary care, health, education, road networks, water supply, waste management and other basic needs, was still underdeveloped and had not reached pre-earthquake status in the region.\n\nWell over [[United States dollar|US$]] 5.4 billion (400 billion [[Pakistani rupee]]s)<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pakistan Earthquake of October 2005: A Reminder of Human-Science Interaction in Natural Disasters Risk Management |author=Amr S.
