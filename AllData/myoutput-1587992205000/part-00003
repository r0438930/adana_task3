For example, NEWb and Rookie Entertainment are student-run companies for our music and media students. Here they learn how to produce a radio or TV show, do market research, create a promotional campaign or organise an event. In Delft, Inholland Composites offers Aeronautical Engineering students an opportunity to gain practical and theoretical knowledge on advanced composite materials.\n\n[[Bachelor's degree]]s at Inholland University of Applied Sciences demand three or four years of full-time study and require 240 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits. One [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS]] credit represents 28 hours of full-time study and the study/workload for one academic year accounts for 60 credits.The Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders ([[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]]) approves study programs offered by [[Dutch universities]].

Internships, or\u00a0 work placements, can be done in the Netherlands or abroad, and the choice upon the company is generally done by students themselves, but supervised and approved by the university. Specific requirements may vary according to the study programme.\n\nDuring the internship students are supervised by one university lecturer or coach, and one company employee.\n\nThese internships are useful for building a professional network and gaining work experience directly on the field.
