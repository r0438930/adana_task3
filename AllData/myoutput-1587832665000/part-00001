He later represented another Queens residents group, the [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]]\u2013[[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] Committee on Urban Scale, who opposed [[Samuel J. LeFrak]]'s housing proposal adjacent to Willow Lake in Queens. In 1972, Cuomo became known beyond New York City when Mayor [[John Lindsay]] appointed him to conduct an inquiry and mediate a dispute over low-income public housing slated for the upper-middle-class neighborhood of Forest Hills.<ref name=marioeffect/> Cuomo described his experience in that dispute in the book ''Forest Hills Diary'', and the story was retold by sociologist [[Richard Sennett]] in ''The Fall of Public Man''.\n\n===New York Secretary of State===\nIn 1974, he ran for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]] on a ticket headed by gubernatorial candidate [[Howard J. Samuels]], and both won the designation of the Democratic State Committee at the party convention. But their entire ticket, including the nominees for [[attorney general]] and [[U.S. Senator]], was defeated in the Democratic [[primary election]]: Samuels by Rep. [[Hugh Carey]] of Brooklyn, and Cuomo by State Senator [[Mary Anne Krupsak]].\n\nGovernor-elect Carey chose to bring Cuomo into his new administration, naming him in December as his choice for [[Secretary of State of New York]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Poster |first=Thomas |date=December 20, 1974 |title=Cuomo Named N.Y.

In a close and highly fractured election, U.S. Representative [[Ed Koch]] finished first with 19.81% of the vote and Cuomo came second with 18.74%. As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff. Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06%. Cuomo had received the nomination of the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] several months previously and was urged to drop out of the race but he contested the general election against Koch and token Republican opposition.<ref name=marioeffect/>\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, placards appeared saying: \"Vote for Cuomo, not the homo\" in reference to rumors about Koch's sexuality.

Cuomo then went negative with ads that likened Koch to unpopular former mayor [[John Lindsay]].

He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic primary. This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and upstate New York as \"sterile\" and lamented the thought of having to live in \"the small town\" of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] as governor, saying it was \"a city without a good Chinese restaurant\".<ref name=\"marioeffect\"/> Cuomo won the primary by ten points and faced Republican nominee businessman [[Lewis Lehrman]] in the general election. With [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|the recession]] aiding Democratic candidates, Cuomo beat Lehrman 50.91% to 47.48%.\n\nCuomo actively campaigned for [[Walter Mondale]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]], and was named on Mondale's list of vice presidential candidates. [[Geraldine Ferraro]] was ultimately nominated as his running mate, but Cuomo was chosen to give the keynote speech at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]]. He vigorously attacked [[Ronald Reagan]]'s record and policies in his [[A Tale of Two Cities (speech)|''Tale of Two Cities'' speech]] that brought him to national attention, most memorably saying: \"There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don't see, in the places that you don't visit, in your shining city.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/speeches/speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention#speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention |title=Mario Cuomo Delivers Keynote Address to Democratic National Convention |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001201/http://www.history.com/speeches/speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention |archivedate=December 31, 2013|website=History Channel |publisher=A & E Television Networks |year=2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>Cuomo, M.M.

In October 1991, news broke that he was interested in running and was taking advice from consultant [[Bob Shrum]]. At the same time, he began working on a budget with the [[New York State Legislature]], and promised not to make any announcements about a presidential run until he had reached an agreement with the Republican-controlled [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] and the Democratic-controlled [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]]. Two polls taken in November of the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992|New Hampshire Democratic primary]] showed him leading the field by at least twenty points, and a poll in December showed him trailing President [[George H. W. Bush]] 48% to 43%, having been behind by twenty-eight points two months earlier.<ref name=marioeffect/>\n\nThe filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary was on December 20, 1991, and candidates were required to submit a ballot application in person.

In this election, Republicans attacked him for the weak economic recovery within the state since the early 1990s recession and the resulting high unemployment as well as his opposition to the death penalty by highlighting the case of [[Arthur Shawcross]], a multiple murderer convicted of manslaughter who was paroled by the state in 1987 and while on release became a serial killer. Republicans were able to associate Shawcross with Cuomo much like [[Willie Horton]] with [[Michael Dukakis]] six years earlier. Cuomo was defeated by [[George Pataki]] in the [[Republican Revolution|1994 Republican landslide]], taking 45.4% of the vote to Pataki's 48.8%. Cuomo lost mainly because his support outside of New York City all but vanished; he only carried one county outside the Five Boroughs, [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]].\n\nCuomo and fellow Democrat [[Ann Richards]], the [[Governor of Texas]] who had been defeated in her re-election campaign by [[George W.

His statewide initiatives in developing over 1,000 [[family support]] programs are today termed \"individual and family support\" nationwide and are cited by the National Council on Disability. He was the first governor to support an ecological approach to families which was represented by [[community integration]] and community development as the goal of deinstitutionalization.\n\nHealthcare was also an area that Cuomo improved as governor, implementing initiatives that succeeded in reducing costs of prescription medications.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />  This endeavor assisted senior citizens in making the medications more affordable.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />  Under Cuomo's leadership, a public health plan that tackled the AIDS epidemic was the most intense in the nation.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />\n\nOverseeing programs for environmental preservation and conservation, Cuomo implemented aggressive initiatives in these areas.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />  Under Cuomo's leadership, New York State was the first in the United States to integrate both environmental protection and energy conservation goals.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />\n\nCuomo's progressivism was also evident in his appointments of judges to the [[New York Court of Appeals]]. Cuomo appointed all of the judges to the State Appeals Court, including the first two female judges, as well as both the first African-American and Hispanic judges.\n\nCuomo eliminated the New York State Regents Scholarship given to all students who ranked high on a statewide special examination.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Planned assassination ==\n\nEx-Mafia imprisoned [[informant]] Maurizio Avola told ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2016 that the [[Sicilian mafia]] had planned to kill Governor Cuomo on a visit to Italy in November 1992. The plan was for about a dozen gunmen armed with assault rifles and explosives to ambush Cuomo. Avola's [[Crime boss|godfather]], Aldo Ercolano, considered that Cuomo would be an excellent target; Avola said: \"The aim was to target politicians or members of institutions in order to send out a clear message\"\u2014this was a few months after the mafia murdered [[Antimafia Pool|antimafia]] judge [[Giovanni Falcone]] as a demonstration of power. Killing a prominent American was a warning to law enforcement agencies that had allowed several prominent mafia informants to live in the US under assumed identities. The attack was to be carried out in the main square of [[Messina]] in [[Sicily]], in daylight. However, after Cuomo arrived in [[Rome]], it became apparent that he had extremely tight security, with many bodyguards and a bullet-proof car, and the attack was called off.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/mario-cuomo-mafia-assassination-target-italy-cosa-nostra |title=Mafia planned to kill Mario Cuomo during Italy trip as New York governor |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 March 2016  |author= Lorenzo Tondo|accessdate= 23 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Political views ==\n\n[[Image:Mario Cuomo.png|thumb|100px|Mario Cuomo after a lecture at [[Baldwin\u2013Wallace College]], September 10, 2007]]\nCuomo was notable for his [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] political views, particularly his steadfast opposition to the death penalty,<ref name=\"Veto\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/21/nyregion/cuomo-vetoes-death-penalty-seventh-time.html Cuomo vetoes death penalty seventh time], ''The New York Times Archives'', New York, March 21, 1989, Kolbert, E., Retrieved December 29, 2013.</ref> an opinion that was unpopular in New York during the high-crime era of the 1980s and early 1990s.<ref name=\"Veto\" /> While governor, he vetoed several bills that would have re-established capital punishment in New York State.<ref name=\"Veto\" /> The death penalty was reinstated by Governor Pataki the year after he defeated Cuomo in the 1994 election, although it was never put into effect and the statute was declared unconstitutional by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in 2004.<ref>''The People of the State of New York v Stephen S.

He later represented another Queens residents group, the [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]]\u2013[[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] Committee on Urban Scale, who opposed [[Samuel J. LeFrak]]'s housing proposal adjacent to Willow Lake in Queens. In 1972, Cuomo became known beyond New York City when Mayor [[John Lindsay]] appointed him to conduct an inquiry and mediate a dispute over low-income public housing slated for the upper-middle-class neighborhood of Forest Hills.<ref name=marioeffect/> Cuomo described his experience in that dispute in the book ''Forest Hills Diary'', and the story was retold by sociologist [[Richard Sennett]] in ''The Fall of Public Man''.\n\n===New York Secretary of State===\nIn 1974, he ran for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]] on a ticket headed by gubernatorial candidate [[Howard J. Samuels]], and both won the designation of the Democratic State Committee at the party convention. But their entire ticket, including the nominees for [[attorney general]] and [[U.S. Senator]], was defeated in the Democratic [[primary election]]: Samuels by Rep.

In a close and highly fractured election, U.S. Representative [[Ed Koch]] finished first with 19.81% of the vote and Cuomo came second with 18.74%. As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff. Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06%. Cuomo had received the nomination of the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] several months previously and was urged to drop out of the race but he contested the general election against Koch and token Republican opposition.<ref name=marioeffect/>\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, placards appeared saying: \"Vote for Cuomo, not the homo\" in reference to rumors about Koch's sexuality. Cuomo denied responsibility for this, but Koch never forgave him \"as he made clear with a pointedly disparaging reference to Mr. Cuomo in a recorded interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' that was not to be made public until Mr. Koch's death\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/nyregion/edward-i-koch-ex-mayor-of-new-york-dies.html?pagewanted=all Edward I.

Cuomo then went negative with ads that likened Koch to unpopular former mayor [[John Lindsay]].

He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic primary. This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and upstate New York as \"sterile\" and lamented the thought of having to live in \"the small town\" of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] as governor, saying it was \"a city without a good Chinese restaurant\".<ref name=\"marioeffect\"/> Cuomo won the primary by ten points and faced Republican nominee businessman [[Lewis Lehrman]] in the general election. With [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|the recession]] aiding Democratic candidates, Cuomo beat Lehrman 50.91% to 47.48%.\n\nCuomo actively campaigned for [[Walter Mondale]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]], and was named on Mondale's list of vice presidential candidates. [[Geraldine Ferraro]] was ultimately nominated as his running mate, but Cuomo was chosen to give the keynote speech at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]] in [[San Francisco]]. He vigorously attacked [[Ronald Reagan]]'s record and policies in his [[A Tale of Two Cities (speech)|''Tale of Two Cities'' speech]] that brought him to national attention, most memorably saying: \"There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don't see, in the places that you don't visit, in your shining city.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/speeches/speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention#speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention |title=Mario Cuomo Delivers Keynote Address to Democratic National Convention |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001201/http://www.history.com/speeches/speeches-mario-cuomo-delivers-keynote-address-to-democratic-national-convention |archivedate=December 31, 2013|website=History Channel |publisher=A & E Television Networks |year=2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>Cuomo, M.M.

In October 1991, news broke that he was interested in running and was taking advice from consultant [[Bob Shrum]]. At the same time, he began working on a budget with the [[New York State Legislature]], and promised not to make any announcements about a presidential run until he had reached an agreement with the Republican-controlled [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] and the Democratic-controlled [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]]. Two polls taken in November of the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992|New Hampshire Democratic primary]] showed him leading the field by at least twenty points, and a poll in December showed him trailing President [[George H.
