The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name=\"RTGB\" />) once stood beside it.

Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.\n\nThe earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308.

It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their wedding in the Cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.\n\n===Castle===\n{{Main|Winchester Castle}}\n[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The \"Winchester Round Table\" in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]\nWinchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts.

It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th centuries and is the place of interment of numerous [[Bishop of Winchester|Bishops of Winchester]] (such as [[William of Wykeham]]), [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs (such as [[Egbert of Wessex]]) and later monarchs such as King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]].<ref name=\"RTGB\">{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Aidan |title=The Royal Tombs of Great Britain |location=London |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co. |year=2004}}</ref> It was once an important [[pilgrim]]age centre and housed the [[shrine]] of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]]. The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name=\"RTGB\" />) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.\n\nWinchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.\n\nThe earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of [[The Pilgrims' School]], the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete{{clarify|date=September 2019}} rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals etc.\n\nEntrance for pedestrians to the North [[garth (architecture)|garth]] of the cathedral is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice's tower, in the High Street.<ref>Hampshire Churches, Margaret Green,Winton Pubs.Ltd.1967.

It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their wedding in the Cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.\n\n===Castle===\n{{Main|Winchester Castle}}\n[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The \"Winchester Round Table\" in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]\nWinchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}</ref> (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, based at the [[Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence training\">{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Hospital of St Cross===\n{{Main|Hospital of St Cross}}\n[[File:The Hospital of St Cross.jpg|alt=The Hospital of St Cross|thumb|The Hospital of St Cross]]\nThe [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s.
