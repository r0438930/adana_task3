In this modern idiom, a cutter is a [[sailing]] vessel with more than one [[head sail]] and one [[mast (sailing)|mast]]. Cutters carry a [[staysail]] directly in front of the mast, set from the [[forestay]]. A traditional vessel would also normally have a [[bowsprit]] to carry one or more [[jib]]s from its end via jibstay(s) on travelers (to preserve the ability to reef the bowsprit). In modern vessels the jib may be set from a permanent stay fixed to the end of a fixed (non-reeving) bowsprit, or directly to the stem fitting of the bow itself. In these cases, that may be referred to as the forestay, and the inner one, which will be less permanent in terms of keeping the mast up, may be called the stays'l stay. A [[sloop]] carries only one head sail, called either the [[foresail]] or jib.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.\n\nThe cutter rig, especially a [[gaff rig]] version where the sails aft the mast were divided between a mainsail below the gaff and a topsail above, was useful for sailing with small crews as the total sail area was divided into smaller individual sails. These could be managed without the need for large crews, [[winch]]es, or complex [[Block and tackle|tackles]], making the cutter especially suitable for pilot, customs and [[coast guard]] duties.

As with cutters in general they were distinguished by their large fore-aft sail plans with multiple headsails, usually carried on a very long [[bowsprit]], which was sometimes as long as half the length of the boat's hull. The rig gave the cutter excellent maneuverability and they were much better at sailing to windward than a larger [[Square rig|square-rigged]] ship. Larger naval cutters often had the ability to hoist two or three square-rigged sails from their mast to improve their downwind sailing performance as well. Navies used cutters for coastal patrol, customs duties, escort, carrying personnel and dispatches, and for small 'cutting out' raids. As befitted their size and intended role, naval cutters, such as those of the [[Royal Navy]], were lightly armed, often with between six and ten small [[cannon]] (or [[carronade]]s).<ref name=poa/>\n\nIn the [[Royal Navy]] the naval cutter originated in the 1730s as a development of the gaff-rigged sloop. The term 'cutter' originally referred to the vessel's hull shape: A sloop had a hull form like a miniature full-size ship, a raised quarterdeck and a [[Cabin (ship)|great cabin]] at the stern, itself often elevated under a poop deck, while the Cutter had a single uninterrupted deck and a plain transom stern. The cutter was narrower above the water (a length:beam ratio of about 3.3:1 against the sloop's 2.6:1) and had finer and sharper lines under the water, while her general hull form resembled an enlarged rowing cutter (hence the shared named) rather than a small ship. Cutters had a much lower [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] than sloops, allowing them to carry a proportionally greater sail area which, with their finer hull lines, made them much faster for their size. Cutters were often designed with rear-sloping keels, aided by ballasting the ship so it sat lower at the stern than the bow. This meant that the naval cutter drew much more water at the stern than the bow, counterbalancing the drive of the large fore/aft mainsail and giving full effect to the rudder while reducing the drag of the bow, greatly enhancing the agility of the ship.  \n\nIn the [[rating system of the Royal Navy]] 'cutter' became the lowest classification, coming below the [[sloop-of-war]] as an 'unrated' vessel. Whilst the classification included true sailing cutters the rating was given to any ship of suitable size and/or importance. Under the system a 'cutter' was commanded by a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] who would be the only commissioned officer on board. {{HMS|Bounty}} was classed as a cutter under the command of [[William Bligh|Lieutenant William Bligh]] despite being a [[Full-rigged ship|true ship]] with three square-rigged masts.\n\n===Pilot===\n[[File:Lizzie May au Brest 2008.jpg|thumb|Wooden pilot cutter ''Lizzie May'' under sail in [[Brest, France]]]]\nThe '''pilot cutter''' developed from the need for a fast boat to take [[maritime pilot]]s from [[harbour]] to incoming large trading vessels.\n\nAs most early pilots were local [[fisherman]] who undertook both jobs, although licensed by the harbour to operate within their jurisdiction, pilots were generally self-employed, and the quickest transport meant greater income. As their [[fishing boat]]s were heavy working boats, and filled with fishing equipment, they needed a new type of boat; early boats were developed from single masted fishing cutter designs and twin masted [[yawl]]s, and latterly into the specialist pilot cutter.\n\nThe natural dangers of the [[Bristol Channel]] brought about over many years the development of the specialist [[Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter]]. According to records from [[Pill, Somerset]] now housed in the [[Bristol Museum]], the first official Bristol Channel pilot was barge master George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot [[John Cabot]]'s {{ship||Matthew|ship|2}} from [[Bristol harbour]] to the open sea beyond. In 1837 Pilot George Ray guided [[Brunel]]'s {{ship|SS|Great Western}}, and in 1844 William Ray piloted the larger {{ship|SS|Great Britain}} on her maiden voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annabel-j.co.uk/55ft-bristol-pilot-cutter/history-of-annabel-j|title=History of Pilot Cutters|publisher=Annabel J|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===Customs services===\nThe term ''cutter'' is also used for any seaworthy vessel used in the law enforcement duties of the United Kingdom's [[Border Force]], the [[United States Coast Guard]] (because of its descent from the [[Revenue Cutter Service]]) or the customs services of other countries.\n\nIn America, the early [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|Revenue Cutter Service]] operated customs cutters that were commonly [[schooner]]s or [[brig]]s. In Britain, they were usually rigged as defined under ''Sailing'' ([[#Sailing|above]]). The British [[HM Customs and Excise#Customs|Board of Customs]] also used other vessels as [[Hulk (ship)|hulks]], which were moored in places such as tidal [[Creek (tidal)|creeks]].  Customs officers worked from the hulks in smaller boats.\n\nIn the UK, the [[Border Force]] (successor to the [[UK Border Agency]] and [[HM Customs and Excise]]) currently operates a fleet of 42 m [[Corvette#Modern corvettes|corvette]]-type vessels throughout UK territorial waters as border cutters, inspecting vessels for illicit cargoes.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:USCGC Hamilton (WHEC-715).jpg|\"High Endurance Cutter\" {{ship|USCGC|Hamilton|WHEC-715|6}}\nImage:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-08328-0004, Berlin, Jachtwerft Berlin, Fischkutter.jpg|German Fishcutter, ''Jachtwerft'', [[K\u00f6penick]], [[Berlin]], 1950\nImage:Stan Patrol P810 Jaguar Dutch Caribbean Coastguard.jpg|[[Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard]] cutter ''Jaguar''\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter]]\n* [[Clipper]]\n* [[United States Coast Guard Cutter]]\n* [[Yacht]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Cutters}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.uscg.mil/history/cutterindex.asp U.

According to records from [[Pill, Somerset]] now housed in the [[Bristol Museum]], the first official Bristol Channel pilot was barge master George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot [[John Cabot]]'s {{ship||Matthew|ship|2}} from [[Bristol harbour]] to the open sea beyond. In 1837 Pilot George Ray guided [[Brunel]]'s {{ship|SS|Great Western}}, and in 1844 William Ray piloted the larger {{ship|SS|Great Britain}} on her maiden voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annabel-j.co.uk/55ft-bristol-pilot-cutter/history-of-annabel-j|title=History of Pilot Cutters|publisher=Annabel J|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===Customs services===\nThe term ''cutter'' is also used for any seaworthy vessel used in the law enforcement duties of the United Kingdom's [[Border Force]], the [[United States Coast Guard]] (because of its descent from the [[Revenue Cutter Service]]) or the customs services of other countries.\n\nIn America, the early [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|Revenue Cutter Service]] operated customs cutters that were commonly [[schooner]]s or [[brig]]s. In Britain, they were usually rigged as defined under ''Sailing'' ([[#Sailing|above]]). The British [[HM Customs and Excise#Customs|Board of Customs]] also used other vessels as [[Hulk (ship)|hulks]], which were moored in places such as tidal [[Creek (tidal)|creeks]].  Customs officers worked from the hulks in smaller boats.\n\nIn the UK, the [[Border Force]] (successor to the [[UK Border Agency]] and [[HM Customs and Excise]]) currently operates a fleet of 42 m [[Corvette#Modern corvettes|corvette]]-type vessels throughout UK territorial waters as border cutters, inspecting vessels for illicit cargoes.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:USCGC Hamilton (WHEC-715).jpg|\"High Endurance Cutter\" {{ship|USCGC|Hamilton|WHEC-715|6}}\nImage:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-08328-0004, Berlin, Jachtwerft Berlin, Fischkutter.jpg|German Fishcutter, ''Jachtwerft'', [[K\u00f6penick]], [[Berlin]], 1950\nImage:Stan Patrol P810 Jaguar Dutch Caribbean Coastguard.jpg|[[Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard]] cutter ''Jaguar''\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter]]\n* [[Clipper]]\n* [[United States Coast Guard Cutter]]\n* [[Yacht]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Cutters}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.uscg.mil/history/cutterindex.asp U.
