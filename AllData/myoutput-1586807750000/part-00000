Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, the Rogue being one of them. Another Small Overlap Test was conducted on a number of vehicles including a 2014 Rogue, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. Based on this test, the Rogue would have received a \"Marginal\" rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test's intrusion was 10 inches further into the vehicle on the passenger's side than on the driver's side and completely tore off the structural door hinge pillar on the passenger side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|title=Passengers at risk in small overlap crashes|website=www.iihs.org|access-date=2016-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901003219/http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|archivedate=2016-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Rogue was redesigned for the 2014 model year. The redesigned Rogue shares no ratings with the previous design, built since the 2008 model year and given a new name for 2014-15, the Rogue Select.

Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, the Rogue being one of them. Another Small Overlap Test was conducted on a number of vehicles including a 2014 Rogue, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. Based on this test, the Rogue would have received a \"Marginal\" rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test's intrusion was 10 inches further into the vehicle on the passenger's side than on the driver's side and completely tore off the structural door hinge pillar on the passenger side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|title=Passengers at risk in small overlap crashes|website=www.iihs.org|access-date=2016-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901003219/http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|archivedate=2016-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Rogue was redesigned for the 2014 model year.
