    "\n",
    "<b>Label:</b> Label is the target feature which we aim to predict. The possible values are 'safe', 'unsafe' or 'vandal'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Comment:</b> The editor is asked to summarize the changes that have been made to the page. It is considered good practice to provide a summary about the edit, however, the user is free to leave this field blank, therefore empty values can occur.\n",
