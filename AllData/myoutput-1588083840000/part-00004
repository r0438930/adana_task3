He had a brief stint in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in 1995, before he signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW).\n\nIn WCW, Mysterio helped popularize the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|high-flying]] ''[[lucha libre]]'' wrestling style, which is credited with having also helped kick-start the emergence of [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] wrestling in the United States. He also won a number of championships during his time with the company, including the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991\u20132007)|WCW Cruiserweight Championship]] and the [[ WCW World Tag Team Championship]].

This led to a match at [[SuperBrawl IX]] where Mysterio and tag partner Konnan lost a \"Hair vs. Mask match\" against [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]], forcing Mysterio to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him the news. Mysterio has publicly expressed his disappointment over being unmasked:\n\n{{cquote|I was strongly against it! I don't think WCW understood what the mask meant to me, to my fans and to my family. It was a very bad move on their behalf. The fans wanted Rey Mysterio with the mask and losing it hurt me a lot.

In a departure from traditional [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booking]], the new champions did not defend their title at [[WrestleMania 21]], but instead had a match against each other which Mysterio won. Two months later, at [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], Mysterio faced and defeated long-time rival Psicosis for the first time in nearly five years.\n\n[[File:Rey3 WrestlemaniaRevenge.JPG|thumb|upright|Mysterio during a WWE [[house show]] in 2005]]\nThe match at WrestleMania was part of a storyline in which Guerrero turned on Mysterio and beat him up after abandoning him during a match against [[MNM (wrestling)|MNM]] for the Tag Team Championship. Then after a [[No Disqualification match|no disqualification match]] against Chavo, Eddie came out and slammed Mysterio on the steel steps, displaying Eddie's increasing frustration with being unable to defeat Mysterio. Guerrero and Mysterio continued to feud, with Guerrero threatening to reveal a secret he and Mysterio shared involving Mysterio's real life son Dominick, unless Mysterio deferred to Guerrero's authority. Guerrero later revealed that, in the storyline, he was Dominick's biological father. The storyline went that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick as a baby with Mysterio and his wife Angie to raise. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. At [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]], Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a [[ladder match]] for the custody of Dominick. Their feud ended when Guerrero gained a victory over Mysterio in a steel cage match. On November 13, 2005, Eddie Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. That same day at a WWE \"Super Show\" where ''SmackDown!'' and ''Raw'' were both taped, Mysterio gave an emotional speech about Guerrero, and in a show of respect removed his mask (though he put his head down, so no one could see his face). Mysterio went on to defeat [[Shawn Michaels]] in an interpromotional match later that night. After the match, Michaels and Mysterio hugged in the ring and Mysterio pointed up to the sky, crying, in memory of Guerrero.\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion (2005\u20132007) ====\nMysterio participated in the main event of [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series]] as part of Team SmackDown! along with [[Randy Orton]], [[Bobby Lashley]], [[Dave Batista|Batista]], and [[John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] who defeated Team Raw ([[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Big Show]], [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]], and [[Chris Masters]]). After Survivor Series, Mysterio started a feud with Big Show after Mysterio eliminated Big Show at Survivor Series, Mysterio would face Big Show in a match billed as \"[[David]] vs. [[Goliath]]\" in a ''SmackDown!'' special show, and ended as a \"[[Professional wrestling#No contest|no contest]]\" when Big Show's tag team partner Kane interfered in the match. Mysterio continued to feud with Raw's [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champions]], and found a tag team partner in [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] Batista. They were booked to face Raw's Kane and Big Show in a tag match at [[Armageddon (2005)|Armageddon]]. Before Armageddon, Batista and Mysterio defeated MNM on the December 16 episode of ''SmackDown!'' to win the WWE Tag Team Championship in a match they both dedicated to Eddie Guerrero. Now the Tag Team Champions, Mysterio and Batista's match with Big Show and Kane was billed as \"Champions vs. Champions.\" Mysterio and Batista lost the match when Kane pinned Mysterio after a [[chokeslam]]. On the December 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', MNM invoked their rematch clause, defeating Batista and Mysterio after interference from [[Mark Henry]] to regain the Tag Team Championship. The following week, Mysterio and Batista received their rematch for the titles in a steel cage match, which they lost after more interference by Henry. On the January 13, 2006, episode of ''SmackDown!'', Mysterio was involved in a 20-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated by Henry.\n\n[[File:ReyMysterio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mysterio at a house show in 2005]]\nMysterio was the second entrant in the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]] match.

December 11, 1974), better known by his [[ring name]] '''Rey Mysterio''', is an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently signed to [[WWE]], where he performs on the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand. According to [[ESPN]], he is \"widely regarded as the greatest [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] in pro wrestling history\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/wwe/story/_/id/21847264/rey-mysterio-excited-wrestle-open-wwe-return|title=Rey Mysterio's career far from over, open to WWE return|last=Wonsover|first=Michael|date=December 22, 2017|publisher=[[ESPN]]|access-date=December 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez was born and raised in [[Chula Vista, California]], and began his professional wrestling career at age 14 in 1989, prior to debuting for Mexican promotion [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] (AAA) in 1992, under the tutelage of his uncle, [[Rey Misterio]]. He had a brief stint in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in 1995, before he signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW).\n\nIn WCW, Mysterio helped popularize the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|high-flying]] ''[[lucha libre]]'' wrestling style, which is credited with having also helped kick-start the emergence of [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] wrestling in the United States. He also won a number of championships during his time with the company, including the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991\u20132007)|WCW Cruiserweight Championship]] and the [[ WCW World Tag Team Championship]]. After WCW closed in 2001, Mysterio returned to Mexico, briefly wrestling for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), before signing with [[WWE]] in 2002.\n\nOver the course of his time with the company, he has achieved sustained success, and is a two-time [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental champion]], two-time [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]], a four-time [[WWE Tag Team Championship|tag-team champion]], a three-time [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|Cruiserweight champion]], and a three-time [[WWE Championship|world champion]].

During this time Mysterio had a video camera, which was called the \"619 cam\", during his entrance he taped members of the audience with this. In a departure from traditional [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booking]], the new champions did not defend their title at [[WrestleMania 21]], but instead had a match against each other which Mysterio won. Two months later, at [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], Mysterio faced and defeated long-time rival Psicosis for the first time in nearly five years.\n\n[[File:Rey3 WrestlemaniaRevenge.JPG|thumb|upright|Mysterio during a WWE [[house show]] in 2005]]\nThe match at WrestleMania was part of a storyline in which Guerrero turned on Mysterio and beat him up after abandoning him during a match against [[MNM (wrestling)|MNM]] for the Tag Team Championship. Then after a [[No Disqualification match|no disqualification match]] against Chavo, Eddie came out and slammed Mysterio on the steel steps, displaying Eddie's increasing frustration with being unable to defeat Mysterio. Guerrero and Mysterio continued to feud, with Guerrero threatening to reveal a secret he and Mysterio shared involving Mysterio's real life son Dominick, unless Mysterio deferred to Guerrero's authority. Guerrero later revealed that, in the storyline, he was Dominick's biological father. The storyline went that Guerrero knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominick as a baby with Mysterio and his wife Angie to raise. In subsequent weeks, Guerrero threatened to take custody of Dominick, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. At [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]], Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a [[ladder match]] for the custody of Dominick. Their feud ended when Guerrero gained a victory over Mysterio in a steel cage match. On November 13, 2005, Eddie Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. That same day at a WWE \"Super Show\" where ''SmackDown!'' and ''Raw'' were both taped, Mysterio gave an emotional speech about Guerrero, and in a show of respect removed his mask (though he put his head down, so no one could see his face). Mysterio went on to defeat [[Shawn Michaels]] in an interpromotional match later that night. After the match, Michaels and Mysterio hugged in the ring and Mysterio pointed up to the sky, crying, in memory of Guerrero.\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion (2005\u20132007) ====\nMysterio participated in the main event of [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series]] as part of Team SmackDown! along with [[Randy Orton]], [[Bobby Lashley]], [[Dave Batista|Batista]], and [[John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] who defeated Team Raw ([[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Big Show]], [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]], and [[Chris Masters]]). After Survivor Series, Mysterio started a feud with Big Show after Mysterio eliminated Big Show at Survivor Series, Mysterio would face Big Show in a match billed as \"[[David]] vs. [[Goliath]]\" in a ''SmackDown!'' special show, and ended as a \"[[Professional wrestling#No contest|no contest]]\" when Big Show's tag team partner Kane interfered in the match. Mysterio continued to feud with Raw's [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champions]], and found a tag team partner in [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] Batista. They were booked to face Raw's Kane and Big Show in a tag match at [[Armageddon (2005)|Armageddon]]. Before Armageddon, Batista and Mysterio defeated MNM on the December 16 episode of ''SmackDown!'' to win the WWE Tag Team Championship in a match they both dedicated to Eddie Guerrero. Now the Tag Team Champions, Mysterio and Batista's match with Big Show and Kane was billed as \"Champions vs. Champions.\" Mysterio and Batista lost the match when Kane pinned Mysterio after a [[chokeslam]]. On the December 30 episode of ''SmackDown!'', MNM invoked their rematch clause, defeating Batista and Mysterio after interference from [[Mark Henry]] to regain the Tag Team Championship. The following week, Mysterio and Batista received their rematch for the titles in a steel cage match, which they lost after more interference by Henry. On the January 13, 2006, episode of ''SmackDown!'', Mysterio was involved in a 20-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated by Henry.\n\n[[File:ReyMysterio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mysterio at a house show in 2005]]\nMysterio was the second entrant in the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]] match.
