More specifically, a small village called Rio Pi\u00e9dras, where the first trial would take place in 1956[[User:Mdzyr/sandbox#%20ftn10|.]]<ref>Liao, Pamela Verma, and Janet Dollin. \u201cHalf a century of the oral contraceptive pill: historical review and view to the future.\u201d ''Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien'' vol. 58,12 (2012): e757-60.</ref>Puerto Rico offered the perfect location for the trials for three key reasons. The first reason was that contraceptives had been legal in Puerto Rico since 1937, so long as they were being used for medical reasons, rather than \u201csocial or economic ones[[User:Mdzyr/sandbox#%20ftn11|\".]]<ref>Marsh, Margaret S., and Ronner, Wanda. The Fertility Doctor : John Rock and the Reproductive Revolution. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008.</ref> \u00a0The second reason was that Puerto Rico was facing a tremendous population boom, along with high rates of poverty and unemployment[[User:Mdzyr/sandbox#%20ftn12|.]]<ref>Andrews, Katherine. \u201cThe Dark History of Forced Sterilization of Latina Women.\u201d Panoramas, October 31, 2017. <nowiki>https://www.panoramas.pitt.edu/health-and-society/dark</nowiki> history- forced-sterilization-latina-women.</ref> And lastly, the third major reason why Puerto Rico was the perfect spot for the trials was because Sanger and Pincus\u2019 team had an ally with a strong foothold on the island. Puerto Rico already contained multiple birth control clinics which were originally funded by the U.S. government under the New Deal programs. However, many of these clinics were turned over to the heir of Procter & Gamble and eugenicist Clarence Gamble, who had already been involved in plans lead by the government to control the population by pushing women towards sterilization as a method of birth control.<ref>Blakemore, Erin. \u201cThe First Birth Control Pill Used Puerto Rican Women as Guinea Pigs.\u201d \u00a0History.com.

The women that were recruited for these trials were \u201c \u2026the poorest of the poor, had no place else to go, and, short of sterilization, no birth control options\u201d<ref>Seaman B. The Greatest Experiment Ever Performed on Women. Exploding The Estrogen Myth. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Hyperion Books; 2003. [Google Scholar]</ref>, and were poorly educated, nonetheless they were willing to do whatever it took to avoid sterilization. The women who were given the pills only understood that they would prevent pregnancy, they knew nothing of the potential health and safety risks of taking the pills. As one woman who participated in the trials described it, \u201c[p]hysicians dispatched their assistants to rap on doors throughout the town's slums, telling women they didn't have to have another child if they took the pills regularly. That's how many of the test recruits were found, said Conchita Santos, 80, a lifelong resident\u2026Santos, a homemaker, accepted her first package of pills in 1955, shortly after the birth of her first and only child. \u2018You have to do what's best for you and your family,\u2019 she said. \u2018It's not easy making a choice like that.\"\u2019<ref>Quintanilla, Ray. \u201cPuerto Ricans Recall Being Guinea Pigs for `Magic Pill'.\u201d chicagotribune.com.

A small group of female medical students were also recruited to participate in the study, but dropped out due to similar symptoms despite being told that they would receive worse grades if they quit.<ref>Seaman B.

A&E Television Networks, May 9, 2018. \u00a0<nowiki>https://www.history.com/news/birth-control-pill-history-puerto-rico-enovid</nowiki>.</ref> In the minds of the researchers behind the pill, these side-effects were insignificant in comparison to what they had discovered; a hormonal oral contraceptive that did in fact stop women from becoming pregnant. Envoid was approved by the FDA in the year 1960, and became an instant success in the United States.\n\n=== Deaths ===\n\nThree deaths occurred among patients who were taking the birth control drug during these trials.<ref name=\"pbs\" /> Despite strong circumstantial evidence that the pill was causing these unexpected deaths, they were not reported, as those conducting the trial considered the deaths to be coincidental.\n\n== Ethics and Controversy ==\n\u00a0Although the contents of the original birth control pill had to be adjusted, due to their dangerously high hormone levels, the discovery and approval of the pill was revolutionary for women\u2019s reproduction rights in the United States. The legalization of the pill, as well as the studies done to produce it, meant that women now had control over their own fertility. This new found control meant that women could postpone having children so they might have time to attend college or get a job, rather than being trapped by an accidental or unwanted pregnancy. According to statistics, the pill was listed as \u201c\u2026one of the most transformational developments in the business sector in the last 85 years. Fully one-third of the wage gains women have made since the 1960s are the result of access to oral contraceptives\u201d.<ref>Planned Parenthood. \u201cFact Sheets and Reports: Margaret Sanger - Our Founder.\u201d Planned Parenthood Fact Sheets & Reports. Planned Parenthood, June 2016.\u00a0 <nowiki>https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/facts-figures/fact-sheets-reports</nowiki>.</ref>Furthermore, studies have shown that \u201cbetween 1969 and 1980, the dropout rate among women with access to the pill was 35 percent lower than women without access to the pill\u2026\u201d, and that \u201cbirth control has been estimated to account for more than 30 percent of the increase in the proportion of women in skilled careers from 1970 to 1990\u201d.<ref>Ibid</ref> It is undeniable that oral contraceptives have forever changed women\u2019s reproductive rights, as well as what they are capable of in today's society. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the birth control pill has also left behind a trail of negative impacts. Delia Mestre is one of the Puerto Rican women who unknowingly participated in the trial that made the pill possible. For Mestre, it is difficult to think of the experiments under which she and hundreds of other women acted as human guinea pigs to test a pill that would ultimately benefit mainly rich white women on the mainland of the United States. When asked about how she felt about her participation in the experiments, Delia Mestre explained that \u201c\"the experiments were both good and bad. Why didn't anyone let us make some decisions for ourselves?\" she asked, her eyes welling with tears. \u2018I have difficulty explaining that time to my own grown children. I have very mixed feelings about the entire thing\"\u2019.<ref>Quintanilla, Ray. \u201cPuerto Ricans Recall Being Guinea Pigs for `Magic Pill'.\u201d chicagotribune.com. Chicago Tribune, August 27, 2018. <nowiki>https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-04-11-0404110509-story.html</nowiki>.</ref> Unfortunately, Mestre and the other women involved in the trials did not have a choice as to whether or not they wanted to be participants in the sexual revolution that was occurring within the continental United States. Instead, the bodies and wellbeing of impoverished and uneducated women were sacrificed for those of white women and male scientists who deemed the pill a victory in the fields of science and society.\n\n== A Gendered Perspective ==\n[[Alice Wolfson]] is among the many advocates that critiqued and condemned the contraceptive trials conducted on Puerto Rican women. Not only were advocates challenging the bigoted and hateful outlooks of both liberal and conservatives within the United States, but also the systematic inferiorization of women through colonial, racial and gendered structures.\n\nFeminist scholar and activist, [[Antonia Darder]] analyzed the various degrading policies that were enforced following World War II. As explained, women were seen as the means towards the advancement of imperialistic interests held by philanthropists and foreign policy makers. Notoriously, it was the exploitation of poor and working-class women\u2019s sexuality and reproduction in which forged the crude occupation of the United States in Puerto Rico.  Furthermore, feminist [[Catharine MacKinnon|Catherine MacKinnon]] scrutinized the hierarchy of power between men and women as a key component in their encroached subjection. Such disparities within Puerto Rico constrained their advancement and rendered them as inferior citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publici.ucimc.org/colonized-wombs-reproduction-rights-and-puerto-rican-women/|title=Colonized Wombs? Reproduction Rights and Puerto Rican Women {{!}}|website=publici.ucimc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, native Puerto Rican women were constantly targeted and discriminated based on derogatory stereotypes. Considered incapable of socio-economic achievement, they were often deemed as prostitutes, welfare abusers and incompetent mothers.\n\nThis stigma enforced the idea that low socio-economic communities had the moral obligation to limit and restrict the growth of families with inadequate capability to sustain themselves. This ideology was cultivated by the fears and biases of white pro-birth control groups in the United States who wanted to prevent abusive dependency on social welfare services by poor familial units.\n\nAmong those culpable in supporting this race-suicide discourse as explained by political activist, [[Angela Davis|Angela Yvonne Davis]], were white pro-birth control women like [[Margaret Sanger]]. Her public statement in support for the implementation of forced contraceptive trials in Puerto Rico is a direct example of the negative rhetoric that harmed minority women. As she argued, \u201cmorons, mental defectives, epileptics, illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals and prostitutes\u201d should be forcibly sterilized or given contraception to limit their reproductive capabilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women, Race & Class|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1983|isbn=0394713516|location=New York|pages=359\u2013361}}</ref>\n\nAs [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw]] would argue through the theory of intersectionality, Sanger exclusively includes women in her hateful remarks since women are also victims of multiple conditions and societal strains at the same time. Due to this hateful discourse, minority women from Puerto Rico were coerced to undergo clinical treatments. In her film, '''''[[La Operaci\u00f3n]],''''' Ana Maria Garcia provides these women a platform to denounce the practices. Some women as seen in the film, were inadequately advised on procedures, and others argued that they did not have other choices due to the constant coercion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmandhistory.org/documentary/women/operacion.php|title=Film & History|website=www.filmandhistory.org|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\nThrough a gendered perspective, it is evident that women are exclusively targeted due to their innate attributes such as their ability to reproduce. By forcibly restricting and removing their capabilities, women are actively being denied their fundamental right to parenthood. Not only is this hindering the progression of minority women, but also an attempt in annihilating \u201cinferior\u201d and \u201cother\u201d groups.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n----<br />\n[[Category:Clinical trials]]\n[[Category:Birth control]]\n", "text_old": "The first large-scale human trial of the [[birth control pill]] was carried out in Puerto Rico in the 1950s.

More specifically, a small village called Rio Pi\u00e9dras, where the first trial would take place in 1956[[User:Mdzyr/sandbox#%20ftn10|.]]<ref>Liao, Pamela Verma, and Janet Dollin. \u201cHalf a century of the oral contraceptive pill: historical review and view to the future.\u201d ''Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien'' vol. 58,12 (2012): e757-60.</ref>Puerto Rico offered the perfect location for the trials for three key reasons. The first reason was that contraceptives had been legal in Puerto Rico since 1937, so long as they were being used for medical reasons, rather than \u201csocial or economic ones[[User:Mdzyr/sandbox#%20ftn11|\".]]<ref>Marsh, Margaret S., and Ronner, Wanda. The Fertility Doctor : John Rock and the Reproductive Revolution.

Puerto Rico already contained multiple birth control clinics which were originally funded by the U.S. government under the New Deal programs. However, many of these clinics were turned over to the heir of Procter & Gamble and eugenicist Clarence Gamble, who had already been involved in plans lead by the government to control the population by pushing women towards sterilization as a method of birth control.<ref>Blakemore, Erin. \u201cThe First Birth Control Pill Used Puerto Rican Women as Guinea Pigs.\u201d \u00a0History.com.

The women that were recruited for these trials were \u201c \u2026the poorest of the poor, had no place else to go, and, short of sterilization, no birth control options\u201d<ref>Seaman B.

[Google Scholar]</ref>, and were poorly educated, nonetheless they were willing to do whatever it took to avoid sterilization. The women who were given the pills only understood that they would prevent pregnancy, they knew nothing of the potential health and safety risks of taking the pills. As one woman who participated in the trials described it, \u201c[p]hysicians dispatched their assistants to rap on doors throughout the town's slums, telling women they didn't have to have another child if they took the pills regularly. That's how many of the test recruits were found, said Conchita Santos, 80, a lifelong resident\u2026Santos, a homemaker, accepted her first package of pills in 1955, shortly after the birth of her first and only child. \u2018You have to do what's best for you and your family,\u2019 she said. \u2018It's not easy making a choice like that.\"\u2019<ref>Quintanilla, Ray. \u201cPuerto Ricans Recall Being Guinea Pigs for `Magic Pill'.\u201d chicagotribune.com.

A&E Television Networks, May 9, 2018. \u00a0<nowiki>https://www.history.com/news/birth-control-pill-history-puerto-rico-enovid</nowiki>.</ref> In the minds of the researchers behind the pill, these side-effects were insignificant in comparison to what they had discovered; a hormonal oral contraceptive that did in fact stop women from becoming pregnant. Envoid was approved by the FDA in the year 1960, and became an instant success in the United States.\n\n<br />\n=== Deaths ===\n\nThree deaths occurred among patients who were taking the birth control drug during these trials<ref name=\"pbs\" />. Despite strong circumstantial evidence that the pill was causing these unexpected deaths, they were not reported, as those conducting the trial considered the deaths to be coincidental.\n\n== Ethics and Controversy ==\n\u00a0Although the contents of the original birth control pill had to be adjusted, due to their dangerously high hormone levels, the discovery and approval of the pill was revolutionary for women\u2019s reproduction rights in the United States. The legalization of the pill, as well as the studies done to produce it, meant that women now had control over their own fertility. This new found control meant that women could postpone having children so they might have time to attend college or get a job, rather than being trapped by an accidental or unwanted pregnancy. According to statistics, the pill was listed as \u201c\u2026one of the most transformational developments in the business sector in the last 85 years. Fully one-third of the wage gains women have made since the 1960s are the result of access to oral contraceptives\u201d.<ref>Planned Parenthood. \u201cFact Sheets and Reports: Margaret Sanger - Our Founder.\u201d Planned Parenthood Fact Sheets & Reports. Planned Parenthood, June 2016.\u00a0 <nowiki>https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/facts-figures/fact-sheets-reports</nowiki>.</ref>Furthermore, studies have shown that \u201cbetween 1969 and 1980, the dropout rate among women with access to the pill was 35 percent lower than women without access to the pill\u2026\u201d, and that \u201cbirth control has been estimated to account for more than 30 percent of the increase in the proportion of women in skilled careers from 1970 to 1990\u201d.<ref>Ibid</ref> It is undeniable that oral contraceptives have forever changed women\u2019s reproductive rights, as well as what they are capable of in today's society. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the birth control pill has also left behind a trail of negative impacts. Delia Mestre is one of the Puerto Rican women who unknowingly participated in the trial that made the pill possible. For Mestre, it is difficult to think of the experiments under which she and hundreds of other women acted as human guinea pigs to test a pill that would ultimately benefit mainly rich white women on the mainland of the United States. When asked about how she felt about her participation in the experiments, Delia Mestre explained that \u201c\"the experiments were both good and bad. Why didn't anyone let us make some decisions for ourselves?\" she asked, her eyes welling with tears. \u2018I have difficulty explaining that time to my own grown children. I have very mixed feelings about the entire thing\"\u2019.<ref>Quintanilla, Ray. \u201cPuerto Ricans Recall Being Guinea Pigs for `Magic Pill'.\u201d chicagotribune.com. Chicago Tribune, August 27, 2018. <nowiki>https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-04-11-0404110509-story.html</nowiki>.</ref> Unfortunately, Mestre and the other women involved in the trials did not have a choice as to whether or not they wanted to be participants in the sexual revolution that was occurring within the continental United States. Instead, the bodies and wellbeing of impoverished and uneducated women were sacrificed for those of white women and male scientists who deemed the pill a victory in the fields of science and society.\n\n== A Gendered Perspective ==\n[[Alice Wolfson]] is among the many advocates that critiqued and condemned the contraceptive trials conducted on Puerto Rican women. Not only were advocates challenging the bigoted and hateful outlooks of both liberal and conservatives within the United States, but also the systematic inferiorization of women through colonial, racial and gendered structures.\n\nFeminist scholar and activist, [[Antonia Darder]] analyzed the various degrading policies that were enforced following World War II. As explained, women were seen as the means towards the advancement of imperialistic interests held by philanthropists and foreign policy makers. Notoriously, it was the exploitation of poor and working-class women\u2019s sexuality and reproduction in which forged the crude occupation of the United States in Puerto Rico.  Furthermore, feminist [[Catharine MacKinnon|Catherine MacKinnon]] scrutinized the hierarchy of power between men and women as a key component in their encroached subjection. Such disparities within Puerto Rico constrained their advancement and rendered them as inferior citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publici.ucimc.org/colonized-wombs-reproduction-rights-and-puerto-rican-women/|title=Colonized Wombs? Reproduction Rights and Puerto Rican Women {{!}}|website=publici.ucimc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, native Puerto Rican women were constantly targeted and discriminated based on derogatory stereotypes. Considered incapable of socio-economic achievement, they were often deemed as prostitutes, welfare abusers and incompetent mothers.\n\nThis stigma enforced the idea that low socio-economic communities had the moral obligation to limit and restrict the growth of families with inadequate capability to sustain themselves. This ideology was cultivated by the fears and biases of white pro-birth control groups in the United States who wanted to prevent abusive dependency on social welfare services by poor familial units.\n\nAmong those culpable in supporting this race-suicide discourse as explained by political activist, [[Angela Davis|Angela Yvonne Davis]], were white pro-birth control women like [[Margaret Sanger]]. Her public statement in support for the implementation of forced contraceptive trials in Puerto Rico is a direct example of the negative rhetoric that harmed minority women. As she argued, \u201cmorons, mental defectives, epileptics, illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals and prostitutes\u201d should be forcibly sterilized or given contraception to limit their reproductive capabilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women, Race & Class|last=Davis|first=Angela Y.|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1983|isbn=0394713516|location=New York|pages=359\u2013361}}</ref>\n\nAs [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw]] would argue through the theory of intersectionality, Sanger exclusively includes women in her hateful remarks since women are also victims of multiple conditions and societal strains at the same time. Due to this hateful discourse, minority women from Puerto Rico were coerced to undergo clinical treatments. In her film, '''''[[La Operaci\u00f3n]],''''' Ana Maria Garcia provides these women a platform to denounce the practices. Some women as seen in the film, were inadequately advised on procedures, and others argued that they did not have other choices due to the constant coercion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmandhistory.org/documentary/women/operacion.php|title=Film & History|website=www.filmandhistory.org|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\nThrough a gendered perspective, it is evident that women are exclusively targeted due to their innate attributes such as their ability to reproduce. By forcibly restricting and removing their capabilities, women are actively being denied their fundamental right to parenthood. Not only is this hindering the progression of minority women, but also an attempt in annihilating \u201cinferior\u201d and \u201cother\u201d groups.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n----<br />\n[[Category:Clinical trials]]\n[[Category:Birth control]]\n", "name_user": "Dgpop", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe trials:Removed unneeded blank line.
