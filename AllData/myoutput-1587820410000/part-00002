After studying theology, he gave it up in favour of public law and politics. He was employed by M. de Torcy, minister of foreign affairs, and by the regent and Cardinal Dubois in several secret missions, in which he acquitted himself with great success. He was rewarded with a pension and other advantages. Having obtained these, he retired from political life and devoted himself to history and literature. He gained such distinction as an author that in 1720 he was elected a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], of which, in 1723, he was appointed perpetual secretary in succession to [[Andr\u00e9 Dacier]]. He died in Paris, repeating the remark, \"Death is a law, not a punishment.\"\n\n==Works==\n\nDubos' first work was ''L'Histoire des quatre Gordiens prouv\u00e9e et illustr\u00e9e par des m\u00e9dailles'' (Paris, 1695), which, in spite of its ingenuity, did not succeed in convincing most people. At the beginning of the war of 1701 he was charged with different negotiations (both in the [[Netherlands]] and England). In an attempt to persuade those countries to adopt a policy of peace, he published a work entitled ''Les Int\u00e9r\u00e9ts de l'Angleterre mal entendus dans la guerre pr\u00e9sente'' (Amsterdam, 1703). This work contained indiscreet disclosures and predictions that were not fulfilled. The enemy took advantage of the work, and a wag took occasion to remark that the title ought to be read thus: ''Les Int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'Angleterre mal entendus par l'abb\u00e9 Dubos''. It is remarkable as containing a distinct prophecy of the revolt of the American colonies from Great Britain.\n\nDubos' next work was ''L'Histoire de la Ligue de Cambray'' (Paris, 1709, 1728 and 1785, 2 vols.), a full, clear and interesting history, commended by [[Voltaire]]. In 1734 he published his ''Histoire critique de l'\u00e9tablissement de la monarchie fran\u00e7aise dans les Gaules'' (3 vols. 4to)--a work the object of which was to prove that the Franks had entered Gaul, not as conquerors, but at the request of the nation, which, according to him, had called them in to govern it. This system, though unfolded with a degree of skill and ability that, at first, procured many zealous partisans, was attacked by [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] at the end of the thirtieth book of the ''Esprit des lois''.\n\nDubos' principle work, ''R\u00e9flexions critiques sur la po\u00e9sie et sur la peinture'', was published for the first time in 1719 (2 vols, but often reprinted in three volumes). In France it was considered an important text for the study of aesthetics and was a popular textbook until the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Griener |first1=Pascal |title=Dubos [Du Bos], Jean-Baptiste, Abb\u00e9 |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T023814 |website=www.oxfordartonline.com |publisher=Oxford University |accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref> Like his history of the [[League of Cambray]], it was highly praised by [[Voltaire]].
