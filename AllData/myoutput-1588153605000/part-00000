Since 1876, it is officially Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana.</ref> It is one of the earliest surviving public libraries and repositories for manuscript in Italy and holds one of the greatest collections of classical texts in the world. It is named after [[St. Mark]], the patron saint of the city. In historical documents, it is officially ''Bibliotheca Aedis Sancti Marci'' but commonly ''Pubblica Libreria di san Marco''.<ref group=\"note\">The official Latin name was indicated by the Venetian Senate on 10 August 1468. See Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 34 and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe library was founded in 1468 when the humanist scholar Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]], titular [[Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople|Latin patriarch of Constantinople]], donated his personal collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts to the [[Republic of Venice]] with the stipulation that a library of public utility be established. The collection was the result of Bessarion's concerted effort to locate and acquire rare manuscripts throughout Greece and Italy as a means of preserving the knowledge of the [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] world after [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. His choice of Venice was primarily due to the city's large community of Greek refugees and its historical ties to Byzantium. The Venetian government was slow, however, to honor its commitment to suitably house the collection with decades of discussion and indecision, owing to a series of military crises and the resulting climate of political uncertainty. The library was ultimately built during the period of recovery as a part of a vast program of urban renewal aimed at glorifying the republic through architecture and affirming its international prestige as a center of wisdom and learning.\n\nThe original library building is prominently located in [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]], Venice's former governmental center, with its long fa\u00e7ade facing the [[Doge's Palace]]. Constructed between 1537 and 1588, it is considered to be the masterpiece of [[Jacopo Sansovino]] and a key work in [[Venetian Renaissance architecture]].<ref>Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance art''..., p. 633 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 226</ref> The  Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]] described it as \"perhaps the richest and most ornate building that there has been since ancient times up until now\" (\"''il pi\u00f9 ricco ed ornato edificio che forse sia stato da gli Antichi in qua''\").<ref>Palladio, Andrea, ''I quattro libri dell'architettura di Andrea Palladio'', 1581, Venetia, Bartolomeo Carampello, p. 5</ref> The art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] regarded it as \"the most magnificent secular Italian building\"  (''\"das pr\u00e4chtigste profane Geb\u00e4ude Italiens\"''),<ref>Burckhardt, Jacob, ''Der Cicerone eine Anleitung zum Genuss der Kunstwerke Italiens'', vol 1, ''Architektur'', 1869, Liepzig, Verlag von E.

Since 1904, the library offices, the reading rooms, and most of the collection have been housed in the adjoining [[Zecca of Venice|Zecca]], the former mint of the Venetian Republic.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{See also|History of libraries#Renaissance}}\n\nCathedral and [[History of libraries#European Middle Ages|monastic libraries]] were the principal centers of study and learning throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

The cardinal's stated desire in offering the collection to Venice specifically was that the manuscripts should be properly conserved in a city where many Greek refugees had fled and which he himself had come to consider \"another Byzantium\" (''\"alterum Byzantium\"'').<ref group=\"note\">The formal letter of donation is preserved in Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana codice Lat.

There were additional charges of heresy that reflected the pope\u2019s deep aversion to Platonism, secular poetry, rhetoric, and astrology. Zorzi argues that in this climate of suspicion and repression, Bessarion would have been anxious to quickly remove his collection to safety, outside the territory of the Papal States.

This second shipment, arranged in 1474 by [[Federico da Montefeltro]], departed from Urbino where Bessarion had deposited the remainder of his collection for safekeeping. It included the books that the cardinal had reserved for his personal use or had added to his collection after 1468.<ref>Zorzi, ''Bessarione e Venezia''..., p. 221</ref>\n\nBut despite the grateful acceptance of the donation by the Venetian government and the commitment to establish a library of public utility, the codices remained crated inside the [[Doge's Palace]], entrusted to the care of the state historian under the direction of the [[Procurator of St Mark's|procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'']]. Access was difficult and consultation impracticable. To no avail, both [[Marcantonio Sabellico]] and [[Andrea Navagero]], in their capacity as official historian, and various other prominent humanists urged the government repeatedly to provide a suitable location. But the political and financial situation during the long years of the [[Italian wars]] stymied any serious plan, notwithstanding the Senate's statement of intent to build a library in 1515.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 18.</ref><ref group=\"note\">The deliberation of the Senate appropriated no funding and was without effect. It nevertheless constitutes the first proposal to construct a library rather than to simply find a suitable location for the collection. The deliberation of the Senate, dated 5 May 1515, is published in Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 130\u2013131.</ref> However, with the nomination of [[Pietro Bembo]] as ''gubernator'' (curator) in 1530 and the termination of the [[War of the League of Cognac]] in that same year, efforts were renewed. At the instigation of Bembo, an enthusiast of classical studies, the collection was transferred in 1532 to the upper floor of [[St Mark's Basilica|Saint Mark's Basilica]] where the codices were finally uncrated and placed on shelves.<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library...'', p. 75 and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 108</ref> This facilitated consultation. That same year, Vettore Grimani pressed his fellow procurators, insisting that the time had come to act on the republic's longstanding intention to construct a suitable public library wherein Bessarion's collection of codices could be housed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 18.

Championed by the [[Grimani]] family, the program called for the transformation of [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]] from a medieval town center with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical forum. The intent was to evoke the memory of the ancient [[Roman republic]] and, in the aftermath of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, to present Venice as Rome's true successor.<ref>See in general Chambers, ''The Imperial Age of Venice''..., pp. 12\u201331 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 10\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the [[Zecca of Venice|mint]] (begun 1536) and the [[Loggetta del Sansovino|loggia]] of the bell tower (begun 1538), the program involved replacing the dilapidated thirteenth-century buildings that lined the southern side of the square and the area in front of the Doge's Palace. For this, [[Jacopo Sansovino]], a refugee from the Sack of Rome, was commissioned on 14 July 1536.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino\u2026'', pp. 14\u201315</ref> Subsequently, on 6 March 1537, it was decided that the area of the building facing the palace was to be destined for the offices of the procurators and for the library.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino\u2026'', p. 15. The deliberation of the procurators is in the Archives (PS, Atti, reg. 125, c. 2) and is published in Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 163.</ref> This would not only satisfy the terms of the donation, it would also bring special renown to the republic as a center of wisdom, learning, and culture. Significantly, the earlier decree of 1515, citing as examples the libraries in [[Ulpian Library|Rome]] and [[Hadrian's Library|Athens]], had expressly stated that a perfect library with fine books would serve as an ornament for the city and as a light for all of Italy.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?\u2026'', p. 35</ref> The construction of the library was also seen as an opportunity to promote the publishing industry by providing ready access for printers who needed to periodically consult the original manuscripts whenever printing critical editions and to make working copies of the manuscripts on which to write notes and make corrections.<ref group=\"note\">The decision to begin the construction of the library coincided with the laws of 1534 and 1537 which sought to redress a decline in the book trade and the increasing importation of books printed elsewhere by providing further copyright protection to printers and imposing standards of printing quality. For the printing history of the period, see Brown, Horatio, ''The Venetian Printing Press: an Historical Study'', 1891, London, John C. Nimmo, pp. 75\u201382.</ref> Many of the manuscripts were later copied to produce the ''[[Editio princeps|editiones principes]]'' (first editions) of the Greek classics in the printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]].<ref>Rapp, ''Bessarion of Nicaea'', p. 126</ref>\n\n====Sansovino\u2019s  superintendence (1537\u2013''c''.1560)====\nConstruction proceeded slowly. The chosen site for the library, although owned by the government, was already occupied by five hostelries and several food stalls, many of which had longstanding contractual rights.  It was consequently necessary to find a mutually agreed upon alternative location, and at least three of the hostelries had to remain in the area of Saint Mark's Square.<ref name=Howard-19>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 19</ref> Also, the hostelries and shops provided a steady flow of rental income to the procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'', the magistrate responsible for the public buildings around Saint Mark's Square. So there was the need to limit the disruption of the revenue by gradually relocating the activities as the building progressed and new space was required to continue.<ref name=Howard-19/> \n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header = Construction of the<br />Biblioteca Marciana\n | image1 = Biblioteca Marciana-construction plan.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n{{legend|#FAD9D0| area of meat market}}\n{{legend|#D9DCE5| area of hostelries}}\n{{legend|#ECE6BB| area of lean-to bread shops}}\n}}\nThe lean-to bread shops and a portion of the Pellegrino hostelry adjoining the bell tower were demolished in early 1537.<ref name=Howard-19/> But rather than reutilizing the existing foundations, Sansovino built the library detached so as to make the bell tower a freestanding structure and transform Saint Mark's Square into a trapezoid. This was meant to give greater visual importance to the Basilica of Saint Mark located on the eastern side and also make it possible to see the Doge's Palace from anywhere in the square.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File:Jost Amman-detail from Procession for the marriage with the sea.jpg|thumb|[[Jost Amman]], ''Procession for the Doge's Marriage with the Sea'' (detail), showing the meat market in the foreground and the unfinished library behind, ''circa'' 1565]]\nWork was suspended following the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1537\u20131540)]] due to lack of funding in the period of recovery but resumed in 1543. The next year, 1544, the rest of the Pellegrino hostelry was torn down, followed by the Rizza.<ref name=Howard-19/> But on 18 December 1545, the heavy masonry vault collapsed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 20 and Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 132</ref> In the subsequent enquiry, Sansovino claimed that workmen had prematurely removed the temporary wooden supports before the concrete had set and that a galley in the basin of Saint Mark, firing cannon as a salute, had shaken the building. Nevertheless, the architect was sentenced to personally repay the cost of the damage which took him 20 years.<ref group=\"note\">In 1565, the procurators discharged the remaining debt in exchange for sculptural work by Sansovino. The deliberation of the procurators, dated 20 March 1565, is in the Archives (PS, Atti, reg. 130, c. 72). See Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino...'', p. 21.</ref> Also, his stipend was suspended until 1547.  As a consequence of the collapse, the design was modified with a lighter wooden structure to support the roof.  \n\nIn the following years, the procurators increased funding by borrowing from trust funds, recovering unpaid rents, selling unprofitable holdings, and drawing upon the interest income from government bonds.<ref name=Howard-21and23>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 21 and 23</ref> Work proceeded rapidly thereafter. The Cavaletto hostelry was relocated in 1550.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 21</ref> This was followed by the demolition of the Luna. By 1552, at least the seven [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]s in correspondence to the reading room, had been completed.<ref group=\"note\">In 1552, the practice began of extracting by lot the use of the balconies by the procurators and their guests to observe the carnival celebrations in the Piazzetta. In that year, seven balconies were awarded.

By then, fourteen bays had been constructed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 23</ref> However, owing to difficulties in finding a suitable alternative location, only in 1556 was the last of the hostelries, the Lion, relocated, allowing the building to reach the sixteenth bay in correspondence to the lateral entry of the mint.<ref name=Howard-21and23/> Beyond stood the central meat market. This was a significant source of rental income for the procurators, and construction was halted. The work on the interior decorations continued until about 1560.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 158</ref> Although it was decided five years later to relocate the meat market and continue the building,<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 135</ref> no further action was taken, and in 1570 Sansovino died.\n\n====Scamozzi\u2019s  superintendence (1582\u20131588)====\nIn 1582, following the demolition of the meat market (1581), [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] was selected to oversee the construction of the final five bays, continuing Sansovino's design.<ref>Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 135</ref> This brought the building down to the ''molo'', or embankment, in correspondence with the main fa\u00e7ade of the mint. Scamozzi also added the crowning statues and obelisks. Since the original design by Sansovino does not survive, it is not known whether the architect ever intended for the library to reach its actual length of twenty-one bays. Scamozzi's negative comment on the junction of the library with the mint<ref group=\"note\">Scamozzi criticizes the truncating of cornices, bases, and capitals in reference to the junction of the facades of the library and the mint and considers such solutions \"indecencies and follies\" (''\"indecentie e sciocchezze\"'').

With no surviving classical examples to guide them, Bramante, Antonio da Sangallo, Raphael, and other great Renaissance architects had struggled with the dilemma, implementing various ideas, none of which satisfied the Vitruvian dictum.

The enlarged [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s of the arches on the ground floor alternate between lions\u2019 heads and the heads of pagan divinities (Ceres?, Pan, Apollo, Diana, Mercury, Minerva, Venus, Mars, Juno?, Jupiter, Saturn, and Phanes). In low relief, the [[soffit]]s have either mythological scenes, mostly related to the divinity in the keystone, or [[grotesques]]. The spandrels on the upper floor have allegorical female figures with wings, including Knowledge (book) and Intelligence (celestial sphere) but also Fame (trumpet), Glory (palm), Honor (laurel wreath), Immortality (circle without beginning or end), and Reward (crown).

Statues and carvings abound, and no large areas of plain wall are visible. In addition to the abundance of classical decorative elements \u2013 obelisks, keystone heads, spandrel figures, and a richly carved frieze \u2013 there is a correct and erudite use of the Doric and Ionic orders that recalls Roman prototypes with the intent of giving the building a sense of authenticity. The proportions do not always respect Vitruvian canons. Scamozzi, a rigid classicist, was specifically critical of the arches on the ground floor, considered to be dwarfed and ill-proportioned, and the excessive height of the Ionic entablature with respect to the columns.<ref group=\"note\">Scamozzi considered appropriate a ratio between the height of the entablature and the column of 1 to 4 for the Doric order and 1 to 5 of the Ionic order, whereas the ratios in the library are 1 to 3 and 1 to 2 respectively.

VII, pp. 20-21.</ref> Nevertheless, the classical references were sufficient to satisfy the Venetians\u2019 desire to emulate the great civilizations of Antiquity and to present their own city as the successor of the Roman republic. At the same time, the design respects many local building traditions, and it harmonizes with the gothic [[Doge's Palace]] through the common use of [[Istrian stone|Istrian limestone]], the two-story arcades, the balustrades, and the elaborate rooflines.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, pp. 26\u201328, Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', pp. 150\u2013152, and Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance Art'', p. 633</ref>\n\n===Interiors===\nThe actual library was always only on the upper floor with the ground floor being let to shops and, later on, cafes as a source of revenue to the procurators.  The gilded interior rooms are decorated with oil paintings by the masters of Venice's [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] period, including [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese]], and [[Andrea Schiavone]]. Some of these paintings show mythological narratives, principally drawn from the writings of classical authors: Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Apuleius\u2019 ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', Nonnus\u2019 ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', Martianus Capella's [[Martianus Capella#De nuptiis|''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'']], and the [[Suda]].  In many instances, these stories of the pagan divinities are employed in a metaphorical sense on the basis of the early Christian writings of Arnobius and Eusebius. Other paintings show allegorical figures and include Renaissance hieroglyphics which reflect the renewed interest in the esotericism of the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic writings]] and of the [[Chaldean Oracles]] that impassioned many humanists following the publication in 1505 of [[Horapollo]]\u2019s ''\u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac''  (''Hieroglyphica''), the purported key to unlock the mysteries of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nThe iconographic sources vary and include [[Pierio Valeriano Bolzani|Pierio Valeriano\u2019s]] dictionary of symbols, ''Hieroglyphica'' (1556); popular emblem books such as [[Andrea Alciati|Andrea Alciati\u2019s]] ''Emblematum Liber'' (1531) and [[Achille Bocchi|Achille Bocchi\u2019s]] ''Symbolicarum quaestionum de universo genere'' (1555); Francesco Marcolini\u2019s divination game ''Le ingeniose sorti'' (1540); as well as [[Vincenzo Cartari|Vincenzo Cartari\u2019s]] mythographic manual for painters ''Imagini colla sposizione degli dei degli antichi'' (1556).<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., p. 21</ref> The \"[[Mantegna Tarocchi]]\" were used as iconographic sources for the depictions of the liberal arts and the muses in the staircase.<ref>Broderick, ''Ascent to Wisdom''..., pp. 98\u2013103, 108 (note 210), and 155 and Ivanoff, ''La libreria marciana...'', pp. 30 and 32</ref>\n\nAlthough several images have a specific pedagogical function aimed at forging temperate and stalwart rulers and inculcating qualities of dedication to duty and moral excellence in the noble youth who studied in the library,<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 28\u201352</ref> the overall decorative program reflects the Venetian aristocracy's interest in philosophy as an intellectual pursuit and, in a broader sense, the growing interest in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism|Platonic philosophy]] as one of the central currents in Renaissance thought. It is conceptually organized on the basis of the Neoplatonic ascent of the soul  and affirms that the quest for knowledge is directed towards the attainment of divine wisdom.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 140</ref> The staircase largely represents the life of the embodied soul in the early stages of the ascent: the practice of the cardinal virtues, the studious contemplation of corporeal matters in both their multiplicity and harmony, the transcendence of mere opinions through dialectic, and catharsis. The reading room corresponds to the soul's subsequent journey within the intellectual realm and shows the culmination of the ascent with the awakening of the higher, intellective soul, ecstatic union, and illumination.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 21\u201328 and 52\u201359</ref> The program culminates with the representation of the [[Plato's political philosophy|ideal Platonic State]] founded upon a transcendent understanding of a higher reality. By association, it is implied that the Republic of Venice is the very paradigm of wisdom, order, and harmony.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 84\u201392</ref>\n\n[[File:SCALA 3.jpg|thumb|left|Staircase with the Dome of Poetics and the second flight (stuccoes by [[Alessandro Vittoria]])]]\n\n====Staircase====\nThe staircase consists of four domes (the Dome of Ethics, the Dome of Rhetoric, the Dome of Dialectic, and the Dome of Poetics) and two flights, the vaults of which are each decorated with twenty-one images of alternating quadrilinear [[Stucco|stuccoes]] by [[Alessandro Vittoria]] and octagonal [[Fresco|frescoes]] by [[Battista Franco]] (first flight) and [[Battista del Moro]] (second flight).<ref>Broderick, ''Ascent to Wisdom''..., pp. 19\u201320, Sansovino, ''Venetia citt\u00e0 nobilissima et singolare''.., c. 114r, and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 141</ref> At the entry and on the landings, Sansovino repeated the Serlian element from the fa\u00e7ade, making use of ancient columns recuperated from the sixth-century Byzantine Church of Santa Maria del Canneto in Pola (Pula, Croatia).<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 157</ref>\n\n[[File:Tiziano-la_sapienza.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], ''\"Wisdom\"'' (''c''. 1560).]]\n\n====Vestibule====\nThe vestibule was originally a lecture hall for the public school of Saint Mark which had been founded in 1446 to train future civil servants of the Ducal Chancery.  The initial curriculum, focusing on grammar and rhetoric, was expanded in 1460 with the creation of a second lectureship for poetry, oratory, and history.

Similar portraits were located in the vestibule. Over time, however, these paintings were moved to various locations within the library and eventually, in 1763, to the Doge's Palace in order to create the wall space necessary for more bookshelves. As a result, some were lost along with all of the identifying inscriptions.

However, these identifications are purely speculative and without significant supporting arguments. Ivanoff identifies Aristotle solely on the basis of the oriental headdress, which is said to be a reference to his Arab translators.  He also sees a possible correlation in the hand gesture between Veronese's \"philosopher\" and the figure of Aristotle in Raphael\u2019s ''School of Athens''. For Plato, he references Marsilio Ficino\u2019s imaginary description of the philosopher as being older and bearded with broad shoulders, a high brow, and an inspired look and then writes that most of these features are present in Veronese\u2019s \u201cphilosopher\u201d.

The roundels by Bernardo Strozzi and Alessandro Varotari are replacements from 1635 of earlier roundels, respectively by Giulio Licinio and Giambattista Zelotti, which were irreparably damaged by water infiltrations. The original roundels were commissioned in 1556.<ref group=\"note\">The contracts stipulated with Giuseppe Salviati, Battista Franco, and Giulio Licinio survive and specify a payment of 20 ducats per painting.

The contract relative to Salviati is published in Pittoni, ''La libreria di san Marco'', pp. 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nAlthough the original seven artists were formally chosen by Sansovino and Titian, their selection for an official and prestigious commission such as the library was indicative of the ascendancy of the Grimani and of those other families within the aristocracy who maintained close ties with the papal court and whose artistic preferences consequently tended towards [[Mannerism]] as it was developing in Tuscany and Rome. The artists were mostly young and innovative. They were primarily foreign-trained and notably non-Venetian for their artistic styles, having been influenced by the new Mannerist trends in Florence, Rome, Mantua, and Parma.

Created in 1517, the ''riformadori'' had initially been tasked with reopening the [[University of Padua]] after its closure during the years of the [[War of the League of Cambrai|War of Cambrai]].<ref group=\"note\">Originating as a temporaray committee, the riformatori were definitively established in 1528. See Da Mosto, Andrea, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia: indice generale, storico, descrittivo ed analitico'', vol. I, 1937, Roma, Biblioteca d'arte, p. 217</ref> This involved repairing physical damage to the buildings, hiring new professors, and organizing courses. Over time, their role came to encompass virtually all aspects of public education, including, after 1559, the nomination of the librarian, a patrician chosen for life.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 119</ref> But in 1626, the Senate assumed once again the direct responsibility for the nomination of the librarian whose term was limited in 1775 to three years. The reform of 1626 also established the position of custodian  with the requirement that he be fluent in Greek.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 212\u2013214</ref> Under the ''Riformadori'', the collection was inventoried and first catalogued (1545). For the loaning of the valuable codices, the Council of Ten established stricter conditions which included the requirement of a deposit in gold or silver in the amount of 25 ducats.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 111\u2013112</ref> This sum, already substantial, was increased to 50 ducats in 1558.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 173</ref> \n\nAfter the [[fall of the Venetian Republic]] to Napoleon in 1797, 470 precious manuscripts, selected from public, religious, and private libraries throughout Venice, were turned over to the French as prizes of war. Of these, 203 were subtracted from the Marciana collection along with two musical scores.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 352</ref> Six rare ''incunabula'' and 10 important manuscripts were also removed during the first period of Austrian occupation (1798\u20131805).<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 355. As a consequence of the Austrian defeats in 1866 and 1918, most of the volumes were returned as reparations of war.</ref>\n\nIn 1811, during the second period of French occupation (1805\u20131815), the entire collection was moved to the former Hall of the Great Council in the Doge's Palace when the library, as a building, was transformed together with the adjoining Procuratie Nuove into an official residence for the viceroy of the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. It continued to be used in this capacity during the second period of [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Austrian occupation]] (1815\u20131866), and after the annexation of Venice to the Kingdom of Italy, it came into the possession of the Italian Crown which ceded ownership to the State in 1919.\n\nIn 1904, the collection was moved from the Doge's Palace to the former [[Zecca of Venice|mint]], and in 1924, the Marciana came into possession of the historical rooms of the library. These underwent extensive restoration and in 1929 were reopened to the public. The historical rooms are presently incorporated into the [[Correr Museum]].\n\n==Collection==\n{{See also|Manuscripts in the Biblioteca Marciana}}\n\nThe Venetian government viewed the possession of the valuable codices as a source of civic pride and prestige for the Republic. Little was done initially to favor public access to the library or to improve services to readers.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 35</ref> Although inventories were sporadically conducted, no bibliographical material was developed to facilitate consultation until the nomination of the scholar [[Antonio Maria Zanetti]] (the younger) as custodian in 1737, nor was an acquisition policy established for the continued incrementation of the collection.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 43</ref> Only one new manuscript, a donation, entered into the collection in the twenty years following the opening of the library.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 40</ref> Although a law was passed in 1603 requiring that a copy of all books printed within the territory of the Venetian Republic be deposited in the Marciana (the first such law in Italy),<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 207</ref><ref group=\"note\">The requirement was part of the law of 21 May 1603 that regulated the printers' guild.

In addition to liturgical and theological texts for reference, Bessarion's library initially reflected his particular interests in ancient Greek history, Platonic philosophy, and science, especially astronomy. Some of these texts were brought by Bessarion when he arrived in Italy (1438) for the [[Council of Florence|Council of Ferrara-Florence]]; others were shipped at an unknown later date from the Venetian city of Modone ([[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]), near [[Mystras]] where Bessarion had studied under [[Gemistus Pletho]]. Among the early codices in his collection were works by [[Cyril of Alexandria]], [[Euclid]], [[Ptolemy]], and [[Strabo]], some of which were rare, if not unknown, in Western Europe.<ref>Labowsky, ''Besssarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, pp. 6-7</ref> Elevated to the cardinalate in 1440, Bessarion enjoyed greater financial resources, and he added notable codices that included the precious tenth-century manuscripts of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]' works and of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' that once belonged to the library of Boniface VIII.<ref>Labowsky, ''Besssarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, p. 8</ref>\n\n[[File:VA024RN-0025.jpg|thumb|left|\"Venetus A\", BNM ms Gr.

The manuscript, purchased by Cardinal Bessarion from Giovanni Aurispa, contains the oldest complete text of Homer's epic ''Iliad''.]]\nIn 1454, following the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottoman Turks (1453) and the ensuing devastation, Bessarion charged [[Michael Apostolius]] and Theophanes, bishop of Athens, with the task of locating and purchasing specific works throughout Greece, primarily in Adrianople, Athens, Thessaloniki, Aenos, Gallipoli, and Constantinople, with the objective of preserving the knowledge of the Hellenistic world. He also established a ''[[scriptorium]]'' on Crete, under the direction of Apostolius, where hired scribes copied the texts that could not be found for purchase.<ref>Zorzi, ''Biblioteca Marciana'', p. 18</ref> A similar ''scriptorium'' existed in his Roman residence, Palazzo Colonna near Santi Apostoli, where other texts were copied. Many of the originals were borrowed for this purpose from monasteries in southern Italy, most notably San Nicola di Casole (Apulia), and from [[Fonte Avellana|Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana]] (Marche). These included Bessarion's remarkable discoveries of the ''[[Posthomerica]]'' by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] and the ''Abduction of Helen'' by [[Coluthus]] which would have otherwise been lost as a result of the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] and the destruction of the library of San Nicola di Casole in 1480.<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 9\u201312</ref> Copyists were also hired and coordinated through the bookseller [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]].\n\nFrom the scholar and book trader [[Giovanni Aurispa]] and subsequently from his nephew and heir, Nardo Palmieri, Bessarion acquired \"[[Venetus A]]\" and \"Venetus B\", the oldest texts of [[Homer]]\u2019s ''[[Iliad]]'' with centuries of [[scholia]], the [[Anthology of Planudes|Anthologia Planudea]] containing 2400 Greek poems, the autograph copy of the commentary on Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], the orations of [[Demosthenes]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' by [[Cassius Dio]], the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Photius, and the only surviving copy of ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' by [[Athenaeus]].<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., p. 5 and ''passim'' and Zorzi, ''Biblioteca Marciana'', pp. 18\u201319</ref> \n\nSimultaneously, Bessarion assembled a parallel collection of Latin codices with a relative preponderance of works on philosophy (primarily the medieval Platonic and Aristotelian traditions), history, mathematics, and literature. Some of these were purchased during his residence in Bologna (1450\u20131455) or copied from originals in [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]] (Ravenna), including the works by [[Quintilian]], [[Lactantius]], [[Augustine]], and [[Jerome]]. Of particular interest to Bessarion were the Latin historiographers. Among these were [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]]. The Latin codices also included translations of Greek works, commissioned by Bessarion. Other Latin codices were purchased during his legation to Germany (1460\u20131461), predominately works by [[Nicholas of Lyra]].<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, printed books became increasingly available, and Bessarion began to purchase ''incunabula'', primarily from the printing house of [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]] in Rome. These books included works by [[Cicero]], [[Plutarch]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], Quintilian, and [[Thomas Aquinas]] as well as the Latin translation of Bessarion's own work in defense of Plato, ''Adversus calumniatorem Platonis'' (1469).<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, pp. 17\u201318 and 481\u2013482</ref>\n\nThe Marciana Library now possesses 548 Greek codices, 337 Latin codices, and 27 ''incunabula'' that once belonged to Cardinal Bessarion.<ref>https://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/la-biblioteca/il-patrimonio/patrimonio-librario/fondi/lascito-bessarioneo.

See Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 34 and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe library was founded in 1468 when the humanist scholar Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]], titular [[Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople|Latin patriarch of Constantinople]], donated his personal collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts to the [[Republic of Venice]] with the stipulation that a library of public utility be established. The collection was the result of Bessarion's concerted effort to locate and acquire rare manuscripts throughout Greece and Italy as a means of preserving the knowledge of the [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] world after [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. His choice of Venice was primarily due to the city's large community of Greek refugees and its historical ties to Byzantium. The Venetian government was slow, however, to honor its commitment to suitably house the collection with decades of discussion and indecision, owing to a series of military crises and the resulting climate of political uncertainty. The library was ultimately built during the period of recovery as a part of a vast program of urban renewal aimed at glorifying the republic through architecture and affirming its international prestige as a center of wisdom and learning.\n\nThe original library building is prominently located in [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]], Venice's former governmental center, with its long fa\u00e7ade facing the [[Doge's Palace]]. Constructed between 1537 and 1588, it is considered to be the masterpiece of [[Jacopo Sansovino]] and a key work in [[Venetian Renaissance architecture]].<ref>Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance art''..., p. 633 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 226</ref> The  Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]] described it as \"perhaps the richest and most ornate building that there has been since ancient times up until now\" (\"''il pi\u00f9 ricco ed ornato edificio che forse sia stato da gli Antichi in qua''\").<ref>Palladio, Andrea, ''I quattro libri dell'architettura di Andrea Palladio'', 1581, Venetia, Bartolomeo Carampello, p. 5</ref> The art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] regarded it as \"the most magnificent secular Italian building\"  (''\"das pr\u00e4chtigste profane Geb\u00e4ude Italiens\"''),<ref>Burckhardt, Jacob, ''Der Cicerone eine Anleitung zum Genuss der Kunstwerke Italiens'', vol 1, ''Architektur'', 1869, Liepzig, Verlag von E.

Since 1904, the library offices, the reading rooms, and most of the collection have been housed in the adjoining [[Zecca of Venice|Zecca]], the former mint of the Venetian Republic.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{See also|History of libraries#Renaissance}}\n\nCathedral and [[History of libraries#European Middle Ages|monastic libraries]] were the principal centers of study and learning throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

There were additional charges of heresy that reflected the pope\u2019s deep aversion to Platonism, secular poetry, rhetoric, and astrology. Zorzi argues that in this climate of suspicion and repression, Bessarion would have been anxious to quickly remove his collection to safety, outside the territory of the Papal States.

This second shipment, arranged in 1474 by [[Federico da Montefeltro]], departed from Urbino where Bessarion had deposited the remainder of his collection for safekeeping.

Access was difficult and consultation impracticable. To no avail, both [[Marcantonio Sabellico]] and [[Andrea Navagero]], in their capacity as official historian, and various other prominent humanists urged the government repeatedly to provide a suitable location. But the political and financial situation during the long years of the [[Italian wars]] stymied any serious plan, notwithstanding the Senate's statement of intent to build a library in 1515.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 18.</ref><ref group=\"note\">The deliberation of the Senate appropriated no funding and was without effect.

Championed by the [[Grimani]] family, the program called for the transformation of [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]] from a medieval town center with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical forum. The intent was to evoke the memory of the ancient [[Roman republic]] and, in the aftermath of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, to present Venice as Rome's true successor.<ref>See in general Chambers, ''The Imperial Age of Venice''..., pp. 12\u201331 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 10\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the [[Zecca of Venice|mint]] (begun 1536) and the [[Loggetta del Sansovino|loggia]] of the bell tower (begun 1538), the program involved replacing the dilapidated thirteenth-century buildings that lined the southern side of the square and the area in front of the Doge's Palace. For this, [[Jacopo Sansovino]], a refugee from the Sack of Rome, was commissioned on 14 July 1536.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino\u2026'', pp. 14\u201315</ref> Subsequently, on 6 March 1537, it was decided that the area of the building facing the palace was to be destined for the offices of the procurators and for the library.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino\u2026'', p. 15.

Significantly, the earlier decree of 1515, citing as examples the libraries in [[Ulpian Library|Rome]] and [[Hadrian's Library|Athens]], had expressly stated that a perfect library with fine books would serve as an ornament for the city and as a light for all of Italy.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?\u2026'', p. 35</ref> The construction of the library was also seen as an opportunity to promote the publishing industry by providing ready access for printers who needed to periodically consult the original manuscripts whenever printing critical editions and to make working copies of the manuscripts on which to write notes and make corrections.<ref group=\"note\">The decision to begin the construction of the library coincided with the laws of 1534 and 1537 which sought to redress a decline in the book trade and the increasing importation of books printed elsewhere by providing further copyright protection to printers and imposing standards of printing quality. For the printing history of the period, see Brown, Horatio, ''The Venetian Printing Press: an Historical Study'', 1891, London, John C. Nimmo, pp. 75\u201382.</ref> Many of the manuscripts were later copied to produce the ''[[Editio princeps|editiones principes]]'' (first editions) of the Greek classics in the printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]].<ref>Rapp, ''Bessarion of Nicaea'', p. 126</ref>\n\n====Sansovino\u2019s  superintendence (1537\u2013''c''.1560)====\nConstruction proceeded slowly. The chosen site for the library, although owned by the government, was already occupied by five hostelries and several food stalls, many of which had longstanding contractual rights.  It was consequently necessary to find a mutually agreed upon alternative location, and at least three of the hostelries had to remain in the area of Saint Mark's Square.<ref name=Howard-19>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 19</ref> Also, the hostelries and shops provided a steady flow of rental income to the procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'', the magistrate responsible for the public buildings around Saint Mark's Square. So there was the need to limit the disruption of the revenue by gradually relocating the activities as the building progressed and new space was required to continue.<ref name=Howard-19/> \n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header = Construction of the<br />Biblioteca Marciana\n | image1 = Biblioteca Marciana-construction plan.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n{{legend|#FAD9D0| area of meat market}}\n{{legend|#D9DCE5| area of hostelries}}\n{{legend|#ECE6BB| area of lean-to bread shops}}\n}}\nThe lean-to bread shops and a portion of the Pellegrino hostelry adjoining the bell tower were demolished in early 1537.<ref name=Howard-19/> But rather than reutilizing the existing foundations, Sansovino built the library detached so as to make the bell tower a freestanding structure and transform Saint Mark's Square into a trapezoid. This was meant to give greater visual importance to the Basilica of Saint Mark located on the eastern side and also make it possible to see the Doge's Palace from anywhere in the square.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File:Jost Amman-detail from Procession for the marriage with the sea.jpg|thumb|[[Jost Amman]], ''Procession for the Doge's Marriage with the Sea'' (detail), showing the meat market in the foreground and the unfinished library behind, ''circa'' 1565]]\nWork was suspended following the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1537\u20131540)]] due to lack of funding in the period of recovery but resumed in 1543. The next year, 1544, the rest of the Pellegrino hostelry was torn down, followed by the Rizza.<ref name=Howard-19/> But on 18 December 1545, the heavy masonry vault collapsed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 20 and Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 132</ref> In the subsequent enquiry, Sansovino claimed that workmen had prematurely removed the temporary wooden supports before the concrete had set and that a galley in the basin of Saint Mark, firing cannon as a salute, had shaken the building. Nevertheless, the architect was sentenced to personally repay the cost of the damage which took him 20 years.<ref group=\"note\">In 1565, the procurators discharged the remaining debt in exchange for sculptural work by Sansovino. The deliberation of the procurators, dated 20 March 1565, is in the Archives (PS, Atti, reg. 130, c. 72). See Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino...'', p. 21.</ref> Also, his stipend was suspended until 1547.  As a consequence of the collapse, the design was modified with a lighter wooden structure to support the roof.  \n\nIn the following years, the procurators increased funding by borrowing from trust funds, recovering unpaid rents, selling unprofitable holdings, and drawing upon the interest income from government bonds.<ref name=Howard-21and23>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 21 and 23</ref> Work proceeded rapidly thereafter. The Cavaletto hostelry was relocated in 1550.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 21</ref> This was followed by the demolition of the Luna. By 1552, at least the seven [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]s in correspondence to the reading room, had been completed.<ref group=\"note\">In 1552, the practice began of extracting by lot the use of the balconies by the procurators and their guests to observe the carnival celebrations in the Piazzetta. In that year, seven balconies were awarded.

By then, fourteen bays had been constructed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 23</ref> However, owing to difficulties in finding a suitable alternative location, only in 1556 was the last of the hostelries, the Lion, relocated, allowing the building to reach the sixteenth bay in correspondence to the lateral entry of the mint.<ref name=Howard-21and23/> Beyond stood the central meat market. This was a significant source of rental income for the procurators, and construction was halted. The work on the interior decorations continued until about 1560.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 158</ref> Although it was decided five years later to relocate the meat market and continue the building,<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 135</ref> no further action was taken, and in 1570 Sansovino died.\n\n====Scamozzi\u2019s  superintendence (1582\u20131588)====\nIn 1582, following the demolition of the meat market (1581), [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] was selected to oversee the construction of the final five bays, continuing Sansovino's design.<ref>Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 135</ref> This brought the building down to the ''molo'', or embankment, in correspondence with the main fa\u00e7ade of the mint. Scamozzi also added the crowning statues and obelisks. Since the original design by Sansovino does not survive, it is not known whether the architect ever intended for the library to reach its actual length of twenty-one bays. Scamozzi's negative comment on the junction of the library with the mint<ref group=\"note\">Scamozzi criticizes the truncating of cornices, bases, and capitals in reference to the junction of the facades of the library and the mint and considers such solutions \"indecencies and follies\" (''\"indecentie e sciocchezze\"''). See Scamozzi, Vicenzo, ''L'idea della architettura universale di Vincenzo Scamozzi architetto veneto'', Parte seconda, 1615, Venetiis, Giorgio Valentini, p. 171.</ref> has led some architectural historians to argue that the result could never have been intentionally designed by Sansovino. But archival research and technical and aesthetic considerations have not been conclusive.<ref group=\"note\">Deborah Howard summarizes the issue in Howard, Deborah, ''The Length of the Library'', \u00abAteneo veneto\u00bb, Anno CXCVII, terza serie, 9/11, 2010, pp. 23\u201329, {{ISSN|0004-6558}}.</ref>\n\nDuring Scamozzi's superintendence, the debate regarding the height of the building was reopened. When Sansovino had first been commissioned on 14 July 1536, the project expressly called for a three-story construction similar to the recently rebuilt [[Procuratie#Procuratie Vecchie|Procuratie Vecchie]] on the northern side of Saint Mark's Square. But by 6 March 1537, when the decision was made to locate the library within the new building, the plan had been abandoned in favor of a single floor above the ground level.<ref group=\"note\">There are no surviving records regarding the debate, and it is not known what factors were determinative. See, Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino...''\u2026, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> Scamozzi, nonetheless, recommended adding a floor to the library. Engineers were called to assess the existing foundation to determine whether it could bear the additional weight. The conclusions were equivocal, and it was ultimately decided in 1588 that the library would remain with only two floors.<ref group=\"note\">Manuela Morresi suggests that in addition to engineering considerations, the decision to retain the height of the library stemmed from the ascendency of the ''giovani'' faction in the aftermath of the constitutional crisis of 1582 and its opposition to the aggressive building program.

He would have undoubtedly seen [[Bramante]]'s tripartite window in the Sala Regia of the Vatican during his Roman sojourn<ref name=\"Lotz, p. 10\">Lotz, ''The Roman Legacy in Sansovino's Venetian Buildings'', p. 10</ref> and may also have been aware of the sixteenth-century nymphaeum at Genazzano near Rome, attributed to Bramante, where the Serlian is placed in a series.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 193</ref> At the Marciana, Sansovino adopted the Serlian of the Orsanmichele prototype, which has narrow sidelights, but these are separated from the tall opening by double columns, placed one behind the other.<ref>Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance Art'', p. 633</ref> This solution of the narrow sidelights ensured greater strength to the structural walls, which was necessary to balance the thrust of the [[barrel vault]] originally planned for the upper story.<ref name=\"Lotz, p. 10\"/>\n\nSuperimposed upon the series of Serlians is a row of large [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]].

These principles required that a [[triglyph]] be centered over the last column and then followed by half a [[metope]], but the space was insufficient.  With no surviving classical examples to guide them, Bramante, Antonio da Sangallo, Raphael, and other great Renaissance architects had struggled with the dilemma, implementing various ideas, none of which satisfied the Vitruvian dictum. Sansovino's solution was to lengthen the end of the frieze by superimposing a final pilaster on a wider [[Pier (architecture)|pier]], thus creating the space necessary for a perfect half metope.<ref>See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 451\u2013452 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref group=\"note\">Lotz suggests that the inspiration may have been the corner pier in Santa Maria presso San Biaggio in Montepulciano which lacks, however, the corner metope.

Statues and carvings abound, and no large areas of plain wall are visible. In addition to the abundance of classical decorative elements \u2013 obelisks, keystone heads, spandrel figures, and a richly carved frieze \u2013 there is a correct and erudite use of the Doric and Ionic orders that recalls Roman prototypes with the intent of giving the building a sense of authenticity. The proportions do not always respect Vitruvian canons. Scamozzi, a rigid classicist, was specifically critical of the arches on the ground floor, considered to be dwarfed and ill-proportioned, and the excessive height of the Ionic entablature with respect to the columns.<ref group=\"note\">Scamozzi considered appropriate a ratio between the height of the entablature and the column of 1 to 4 for the Doric order and 1 to 5 of the Ionic order, whereas the ratios in the library are 1 to 3 and 1 to 2 respectively.

At the same time, the design respects many local building traditions, and it harmonizes with the gothic [[Doge's Palace]] through the common use of [[Istrian stone|Istrian limestone]], the two-story arcades, the balustrades, and the elaborate rooflines.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, pp. 26\u201328, Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', pp. 150\u2013152, and Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance Art'', p. 633</ref>\n\n===Interiors===\nThe actual library was always only on the upper floor with the ground floor being let to shops and, later on, cafes as a source of revenue to the procurators.

In many instances, these stories of the pagan divinities are employed in a metaphorical sense on the basis of the early Christian writings of Arnobius and Eusebius. Other paintings show allegorical figures and include Renaissance hieroglyphics which reflect the renewed interest in the esotericism of the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic writings]] and of the [[Chaldean Oracles]] that impassioned many humanists following the publication in 1505 of [[Horapollo]]\u2019s ''\u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac''  (''Hieroglyphica''), the purported key to unlock the mysteries of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nThe iconographic sources vary and include [[Pierio Valeriano Bolzani|Pierio Valeriano\u2019s]] dictionary of symbols, ''Hieroglyphica'' (1556); popular emblem books such as [[Andrea Alciati|Andrea Alciati\u2019s]] ''Emblematum Liber'' (1531) and [[Achille Bocchi|Achille Bocchi\u2019s]] ''Symbolicarum quaestionum de universo genere'' (1555); Francesco Marcolini\u2019s divination game ''Le ingeniose sorti'' (1540); as well as [[Vincenzo Cartari|Vincenzo Cartari\u2019s]] mythographic manual for painters ''Imagini colla sposizione degli dei degli antichi'' (1556).<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., p. 21</ref> The \"[[Mantegna Tarocchi]]\" were used as iconographic sources for the depictions of the liberal arts and the muses in the staircase.<ref>Broderick, ''Ascent to Wisdom''..., pp. 98\u2013103, 108 (note 210), and 155 and Ivanoff, ''La libreria marciana...'', pp. 30 and 32</ref>\n\nAlthough several images have a specific pedagogical function aimed at forging temperate and stalwart rulers and inculcating qualities of dedication to duty and moral excellence in the noble youth who studied in the library,<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 28\u201352</ref> the overall decorative program reflects the Venetian aristocracy's interest in philosophy as an intellectual pursuit and, in a broader sense, the growing interest in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism|Platonic philosophy]] as one of the central currents in Renaissance thought. It is conceptually organized on the basis of the Neoplatonic ascent of the soul  and affirms that the quest for knowledge is directed towards the attainment of divine wisdom.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 140</ref> The staircase largely represents the life of the embodied soul in the early stages of the ascent: the practice of the cardinal virtues, the studious contemplation of corporeal matters in both their multiplicity and harmony, the transcendence of mere opinions through dialectic, and catharsis. The reading room corresponds to the soul's subsequent journey within the intellectual realm and shows the culmination of the ascent with the awakening of the higher, intellective soul, ecstatic union, and illumination.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 21\u201328 and 52\u201359</ref> The program culminates with the representation of the [[Plato's political philosophy|ideal Platonic State]] founded upon a transcendent understanding of a higher reality. By association, it is implied that the Republic of Venice is the very paradigm of wisdom, order, and harmony.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 84\u201392</ref>\n\n[[File:SCALA 3.jpg|thumb|left|Staircase with the Dome of Poetics and the second flight (stuccoes by [[Alessandro Vittoria]])]]\n\n====Staircase====\nThe staircase consists of four domes (the Dome of Ethics, the Dome of Rhetoric, the Dome of Dialectic, and the Dome of Poetics) and two flights, the vaults of which are each decorated with twenty-one images of alternating quadrilinear [[Stucco|stuccoes]] by [[Alessandro Vittoria]] and octagonal [[Fresco|frescoes]] by [[Battista Franco]] (first flight) and [[Battista del Moro]] (second flight).<ref>Broderick, ''Ascent to Wisdom''..., pp. 19\u201320, Sansovino, ''Venetia citt\u00e0 nobilissima et singolare''.., c. 114r, and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 141</ref> At the entry and on the landings, Sansovino repeated the Serlian element from the fa\u00e7ade, making use of ancient columns recuperated from the sixth-century Byzantine Church of Santa Maria del Canneto in Pola (Pula, Croatia).<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 157</ref>\n\n[[File:Tiziano-la_sapienza.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], ''\"Wisdom\"'' (''c''. 1560).]]\n\n====Vestibule====\nThe vestibule was originally a lecture hall for the public school of Saint Mark which had been founded in 1446 to train future civil servants of the Ducal Chancery.  The initial curriculum, focusing on grammar and rhetoric, was expanded in 1460 with the creation of a second lectureship for poetry, oratory, and history.  Over time, it evolved into a humanistic school principally for the sons of the nobles and citizens.  Among the Italian humanists who taught at the school were [[George of Trebizond]], [[Giorgio Valla]], [[Marcantonio Sabellico]], [[Raphael Regius]], and [[Marco Musuro]].<ref>Grendler, Paul, ''Schooling in Renaissance Italy: Literacy and Learning 1300\u20131600'', 1989, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 61\u201363, {{ISBN|9780801842290}} and Ross, James Bruce, ''Venetian Schools and Teachers Fourteenth to Early Sixteenth Century: A Survey and a Study of Giovanni Battista Egnazio'', \u00abRenaissance Quarterly\u00bb, Volume 29, Issue 4, Winter 1976, pp. 533-534, {{ISSN|0034-4338}}</ref>  The vestibule also briefly (1560\u20131561) hosted the meetings of the [[Accademia Veneziana|Accademia veneziana]] before its failure for bankruptcy.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., 162\u2013163</ref> During this period, the room was lined with wooden benches, interrupted by the lectern which was located under the central window of the western wall.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 162</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1591, the vestibule was transformed into the public Statuary Hall by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] in order to display the collection of ancient sculpture that [[Giovanni Grimani]] had donated to the Venetian Republic in 1587.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 165\u2013166</ref> Of the original decoration, only the ceiling remains with the [[Illusionistic ceiling painting|illusionistic three-dimensional decoration]] by [[Cristoforo Rosa|Cristoforo and Stefano De Rosa]] of Brescia (1559).  [[Titian]]\u2019s octagonal painting in the center (''c''.1560) has been alternatively identified as ''Wisdom'', ''History'', or ''The Soul''.\n\n[[File:Jacopo tintoretto, diogene.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tintoretto]], ''Diogenes'']]\n\n====Reading Room====\nThe adjacent reading room originally had 38 desks in the center, arranged in two rows, to which the valuable codices were [[Chained library|chained]] according to subject matter.<ref group=\"note\">The Latin section, slightly smaller, occupied desks 1 to 16 and included rhetoric, secular history, medicine, canon and civil law, logic, moral philosophy, the works of Aristotle and his commentators, natural sciences, mathematics, astronomy, Peter Lombard\u2019s ''[[The Four Books of Sentences]]'' and relative commentaries, theology, the works of Thomas Aquinas and Augustine, and Biblical texts with commentaries. The Greek section originally occupied desks 17 to 38 and included grammar, poetry, secular history, rhetoric, medicine, civil law, the works of Aristotle and his commentators, the writings of Plato and the Platonists, mathematics and astronomy, hagiography, theology, canon law, and Biblical texts with commentaries. See Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 159\u2013161 and Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Between the windows were imaginary portraits of great men of Antiquity, the \"philosophers\", each originally accompanied by an identifying inscription. Similar portraits were located in the vestibule. Over time, however, these paintings were moved to various locations within the library and eventually, in 1763, to the Doge's Palace in order to create the wall space necessary for more bookshelves. As a result, some were lost along with all of the identifying inscriptions. The ten that survive were returned to the library in the early nineteenth century and integrated with other paintings in 1929.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 152\u2013157</ref> Of the \"philosophers\", only Diogenes by Tintoretto has been credibly identified.<ref>Ridolfi, Carlo, ''Le marauiglie dell'arte, ouero Le vite de gl'illustri pittori veneti, e dello Stato'', II, 1648, Venetia, Gio. Battista Sgava, p. 26.</ref><ref group=\"note\">In 1967, Nicola Ivanoff identified Aristotle and Plato in the \"philosophers\" by Veronese and, tentatively, Ptolemy and Democritus in the \"philosophers\" by Andrea Schiavone (one of which is alternatively attributed to Giuseppe Salviati). However, these identifications are purely speculative and without significant supporting arguments. Ivanoff identifies Aristotle solely on the basis of the oriental headdress, which is said to be a reference to his Arab translators.  He also sees a possible correlation in the hand gesture between Veronese's \"philosopher\" and the figure of Aristotle in Raphael\u2019s ''School of Athens''. For Plato, he references Marsilio Ficino\u2019s imaginary description of the philosopher as being older and bearded with broad shoulders, a high brow, and an inspired look and then writes that most of these features are present in Veronese\u2019s \u201cphilosopher\u201d. See Ivanoff, ''La libreria Marciana''..., pp. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battista franco, diana e atteone.jpg|thumb|[[Battista Franco]], ''Actaeon and Diana'' and grotesques]]\nThe ceiling of the reading room is decorated with 21 roundels, circular oil paintings, by [[Giovanni de Mio]], [[Giuseppe Salviati]], [[Battista Franco]], [[Giulio Licinio]], [[Bernardo Strozzi]], [[Giambattista Zelotti]], [[Alessandro Varotari]], [[Paolo Veronese]], and [[Andrea Schiavone]]. They are inserted into a gilded and painted wooden framework along with 52 [[Grotesque|grotesques]] by Battista Franco. The roundels by Bernardo Strozzi and Alessandro Varotari are replacements from 1635 of earlier roundels, respectively by Giulio Licinio and Giambattista Zelotti, which were irreparably damaged by water infiltrations. The original roundels were commissioned in 1556.<ref group=\"note\">The contracts stipulated with Giuseppe Salviati, Battista Franco, and Giulio Licinio survive and specify a payment of 20 ducats per painting. Although the canvas would be provided by the procurators, the artists themselves were to provide their own pigments with the exception of blue ultramarine which would be paid for separately. The contract relative to Salviati is published in Pittoni, ''La libreria di san Marco'', pp. 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nAlthough the original seven artists were formally chosen by Sansovino and Titian, their selection for an official and prestigious commission such as the library was indicative of the ascendancy of the Grimani and of those other families within the aristocracy who maintained close ties with the papal court and whose artistic preferences consequently tended towards [[Mannerism]] as it was developing in Tuscany and Rome. The artists were mostly young and innovative. They were primarily foreign-trained and notably non-Venetian for their artistic styles, having been influenced by the new Mannerist trends in Florence, Rome, Mantua, and Parma.  The roundels that they produced for the ceiling of the reading room are consequently characterized by the greater sculptural rigidity and artificial poses of the figures, the emphasis on line drawing, and the overall dramatic compositions.  They nevertheless show the influence of local painting traditions in both the coloring and brushwork.<ref>See Humfrey, ''Painting in Renaissance Venice'', pp. 188\u2013198 and Paolucci, ''La sala della libreria e il ciclo pittorico'', pp. 290\u2013291.</ref>\n\nFor the single roundels, various and conflicting titles have been proposed over time.<ref group=\"note\">For the principal studies and proposed titles, see  Vasari, Giorgio, ''Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori scultori e architettori'', vol.

See Da Mosto, Andrea, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia: indice generale, storico, descrittivo ed analitico'', vol. I, 1937, Roma, Biblioteca d'arte, p. 217</ref> This involved repairing physical damage to the buildings, hiring new professors, and organizing courses. Over time, their role came to encompass virtually all aspects of public education, including, after 1559, the nomination of the librarian, a patrician chosen for life.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 119</ref> But in 1626, the Senate assumed once again the direct responsibility for the nomination of the librarian whose term was limited in 1775 to three years. The reform of 1626 also established the position of custodian  with the requirement that he be fluent in Greek.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 212\u2013214</ref> Under the ''Riformadori'', the collection was inventoried and first catalogued (1545). For the loaning of the valuable codices, the Council of Ten established stricter conditions which included the requirement of a deposit in gold or silver in the amount of 25 ducats.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 111\u2013112</ref> This sum, already substantial, was increased to 50 ducats in 1558.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 173</ref> \n\nAfter the [[fall of the Venetian Republic]] to Napoleon in 1797, 470 precious manuscripts, selected from public, religious, and private libraries throughout Venice, were turned over to the French as prizes of war. Of these, 203 were subtracted from the Marciana collection along with two musical scores.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 352</ref> Six rare ''incunabula'' and 10 important manuscripts were also removed during the first period of Austrian occupation (1798\u20131805).<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 355. As a consequence of the Austrian defeats in 1866 and 1918, most of the volumes were returned as reparations of war.</ref>\n\nIn 1811, during the second period of French occupation (1805\u20131815), the entire collection was moved to the former Hall of the Great Council in the Doge's Palace when the library, as a building, was transformed together with the adjoining Procuratie Nuove into an official residence for the viceroy of the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. It continued to be used in this capacity during the second period of [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Austrian occupation]] (1815\u20131866), and after the annexation of Venice to the Kingdom of Italy, it came into the possession of the Italian Crown which ceded ownership to the State in 1919.\n\nIn 1904, the collection was moved from the Doge's Palace to the former [[Zecca of Venice|mint]], and in 1924, the Marciana came into possession of the historical rooms of the library. These underwent extensive restoration and in 1929 were reopened to the public. The historical rooms are presently incorporated into the [[Correr Museum]].\n\n==Collection==\n{{See also|Manuscripts in the Biblioteca Marciana}}\n\nThe Venetian government viewed the possession of the valuable codices as a source of civic pride and prestige for the Republic.

In addition to liturgical and theological texts for reference, Bessarion's library initially reflected his particular interests in ancient Greek history, Platonic philosophy, and science, especially astronomy. Some of these texts were brought by Bessarion when he arrived in Italy (1438) for the [[Council of Florence|Council of Ferrara-Florence]]; others were shipped at an unknown later date from the Venetian city of Modone ([[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]), near [[Mystras]] where Bessarion had studied under [[Gemistus Pletho]]. Among the early codices in his collection were works by [[Cyril of Alexandria]], [[Euclid]], [[Ptolemy]], and [[Strabo]], some of which were rare, if not unknown, in Western Europe.<ref>Labowsky, ''Besssarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, pp. 6-7</ref> Elevated to the cardinalate in 1440, Bessarion enjoyed greater financial resources, and he added notable codices that included the precious tenth-century manuscripts of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]' works and of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' that once belonged to the library of Boniface VIII.<ref>Labowsky, ''Besssarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, p. 8</ref>\n\n[[File:VA024RN-0025.jpg|thumb|left|\"Venetus A\", BNM ms Gr.

The manuscript, purchased by Cardinal Bessarion from Giovanni Aurispa, contains the oldest complete text of Homer's epic ''Iliad''.]]\nIn 1454, following the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottoman Turks (1453) and the ensuing devastation, Bessarion charged [[Michael Apostolius]] and Theophanes, bishop of Athens, with the task of locating and purchasing specific works throughout Greece, primarily in Adrianople, Athens, Thessaloniki, Aenos, Gallipoli, and Constantinople, with the objective of preserving the knowledge of the Hellenistic world. He also established a ''[[scriptorium]]'' on Crete, under the direction of Apostolius, where hired scribes copied the texts that could not be found for purchase.<ref>Zorzi, ''Biblioteca Marciana'', p. 18</ref> A similar ''scriptorium'' existed in his Roman residence, Palazzo Colonna near Santi Apostoli, where other texts were copied. Many of the originals were borrowed for this purpose from monasteries in southern Italy, most notably San Nicola di Casole (Apulia), and from [[Fonte Avellana|Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana]] (Marche). These included Bessarion's remarkable discoveries of the ''[[Posthomerica]]'' by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] and the ''Abduction of Helen'' by [[Coluthus]] which would have otherwise been lost as a result of the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] and the destruction of the library of San Nicola di Casole in 1480.<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 9\u201312</ref> Copyists were also hired and coordinated through the bookseller [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]].\n\nFrom the scholar and book trader [[Giovanni Aurispa]] and subsequently from his nephew and heir, Nardo Palmieri, Bessarion acquired \"[[Venetus A]]\" and \"Venetus B\", the oldest texts of [[Homer]]\u2019s ''[[Iliad]]'' with centuries of [[scholia]], the [[Anthology of Planudes|Anthologia Planudea]] containing 2400 Greek poems, the autograph copy of the commentary on Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], the orations of [[Demosthenes]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' by [[Cassius Dio]], the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Photius, and the only surviving copy of ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' by [[Athenaeus]].<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., p. 5 and ''passim'' and Zorzi, ''Biblioteca Marciana'', pp. 18\u201319</ref> \n\nSimultaneously, Bessarion assembled a parallel collection of Latin codices with a relative preponderance of works on philosophy (primarily the medieval Platonic and Aristotelian traditions), history, mathematics, and literature. Some of these were purchased during his residence in Bologna (1450\u20131455) or copied from originals in [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]] (Ravenna), including the works by [[Quintilian]], [[Lactantius]], [[Augustine]], and [[Jerome]]. Of particular interest to Bessarion were the Latin historiographers. Among these were [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]]. The Latin codices also included translations of Greek works, commissioned by Bessarion. Other Latin codices were purchased during his legation to Germany (1460\u20131461), predominately works by [[Nicholas of Lyra]].<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, printed books became increasingly available, and Bessarion began to purchase ''incunabula'', primarily from the printing house of [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]] in Rome. These books included works by [[Cicero]], [[Plutarch]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], Quintilian, and [[Thomas Aquinas]] as well as the Latin translation of Bessarion's own work in defense of Plato, ''Adversus calumniatorem Platonis'' (1469).<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, pp. 17\u201318 and 481\u2013482</ref>\n\nThe Marciana Library now possesses 548 Greek codices, 337 Latin codices, and 27 ''incunabula'' that once belonged to Cardinal Bessarion.<ref>https://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/la-biblioteca/il-patrimonio/patrimonio-librario/fondi/lascito-bessarioneo.
