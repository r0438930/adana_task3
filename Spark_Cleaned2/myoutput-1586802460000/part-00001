New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1970.</ref> and \"July, 1773\",<ref>''A Part''.

New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1968.</ref> and \"Some Further Words\",<ref>''Given: New Poems''. Washington D. C.: Shoemaker & Hoard. 2005.</ref> respectively).\n\nBerry's first published poetry book consisted of a single poem, the elegiac ''November Twenty Six Nineteen Hundred Sixty Three'' (1964), initiated and illustrated by [[Ben Shahn]], commemorating the death of [[John F. Kennedy]]. It begins,\n\n<poem>We know\nThe winter earth\nUpon the body\nOf the young\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the early dark\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling;</poem>\n\nand continues through ten more stanzas (each propelled by the [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]] of \"We know\").

In \"Notes: Unspecializing Poetry,\" Berry writes, \"Devotion to order that is not poetical prevents the specialization of poetry.\"<ref>Berry, Wendell. ''Standing by Words''. San Francisco: North Point, 1983, p.80.</ref>  He goes on to note, \"Nothing exists for its own sake, but for a harmony greater than itself which includes it. A work of art, which accepts this condition, and exists upon its terms, honors the Creation, and so becomes a part of it\" <ref>Berry, Wendell. ''Standing by Words''. San Francisco: North Point, 1983, p.85.</ref>\n\n[[Lionel Basney]] placed Berry's poetry within a tradition of [[Didacticism|didactic poetry]] that stretches back to [[Horace]]: \"To say that Berry's poetry can be didactic, then, means that it envisions a specific wisdom, and also the traditional sense of art and culture that gives art the task of teaching this wisdom\"<ref>Basney, Lionel. 175. \"Five Notes on the Didactic Tradition, in Praise of Wendell Berry\" in Paul Merchant, editor. ''Wendell Berry'' (American Authors Series). Lewiston, Idaho: Confluence, 1991. pp.174\u2013183.</ref>\n\nFor Berry, poetry exists \"at the center of a complex reminding\"<ref>Berry, Wendell. \"The Responsibility of the Poet.\" ''What Are People For?'' New York: North Point, 1990. p.88.</ref>  Both the poet and the reader are reminded of the poem's crafted language, of the poem's formal literary antecedents, of  \"what is remembered or ought to be remembered,\" and of \"the formal integrity of other works, creatures and structures of the world.\".<ref>Berry, Wendell. \"The Responsibility of the Poet.\" ''What Are People For?'' New York: North Point, 1990. p.89.</ref>\n\n=== The Sabbath Poems ===\nFrom 1979 to the present Berry has been writing what he calls \"[[Sabbath]] poems.\" They were first collected in ''A Timbered Choir: The Sabbath Poems 1979-1997''. This was followed by Sabbaths from 1998 to 2004 in ''Given: New Poems''; and those from 2005 to 2008 are in ''Leavings''. All Sabbath poems through 2012 are published in ''This Day: New and Collected Sabbath Poems 1979 - 2012''. ''Sabbaths 2013'' has been published by [[Larkspur Press]]. ''A Small Porch'' contains nine Sabbath poems from 2014 and sixteen from 2015. One Sabbath poem, \"What Passes, What Remains\" (VIII from 2016), is published as the epilogue in ''The Art of Loading Brush''. That poem, along with fourteen others, can also be found in ''Sabbaths 2016'', published by Larkspur Press.\n\nThe poems are motivated by Berry's longtime habit of walking out onto the land on Sunday mornings. As he puts it, \"I go free from the tasks and intentions of my workdays, and so my mind becomes hospitable to unintended thoughts: to what I am very willing to call inspiration.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=This Day: Collected and New Sabbath Poems|last=Berry|first=Wendell|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61902-198-3|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=xxi}}</ref> He writes in a poem from 1979,\n<poem>The bell calls in the town \nWhere forebears cleared the shaded land\nAnd brought high daylight down\nTo shine on field and trodden road.\nI hear, but understand\nContrarily, and walk into the woods.\nI leave labor and load,\nTake up a different story.\nI keep an inventory\nOf wonders and of uncommercial goods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=This Day: Collected & New Sabbath Poems|last=Berry|first=Wendell|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61902-198-3|location=Berkeley|page=11}}</ref></poem>The Sabbath poems have been described as \"written from a particular place and on particular Sabbaths, and so should be read as part of a spiritual practice and as poems, in some sense, devoted to dwelling, to living thoughtfully in one place.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Marc|date=Winter 2015|title=Instantaneous and Eternal: Wendell Berry's Sabbath Poems|url=|journal=Sewanee Review|volume=123|pages=182\u2013191|doi=10.1353/sew.2015.0010}}</ref>  Oehlschlaeger links Berry's project to a key observation by [[Henry David Thoreau]],\n\n<blockquote>As Thoreau continues in '[[Life Without Principle]],' he notes the constant busyness of Americans, so engaged in 'infinite bustle' that 'there is no sabbath.' And he notes later that 'there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself, than this incessant business.' The logic is clear: destruction of the Sabbath is contrary to 'life itself.' That, I suggest, is the context in which we should read the Sabbath poems that Berry has been writing for nearly the last thirty years.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Achievement of Wendell Berry: The Hard History of Love|last=Oehlschlaeger|first=Fritz|publisher=U P of Kentucky|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8131-3007-1|location=Lexington, KY|page=37}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Fiction==\n\nBerry's fiction to date consists of eight novels and fifty-one short stories (forty-three of which are collected in ''That Distant Land'', 2004 and ''A Place in Time'', 2012) which, when read as a whole, form a chronicle of the fictional small Kentucky town of [[Port William, Kentucky|Port William]]. Because of his long-term, ongoing exploration of the life of an imagined place, Berry has been compared to [[William Faulkner]].<ref>Goodrich, Janet. ''The Unforeseen Self in the Works of Wendell Berry.'' University of Missouri Press, 2001. p.21.</ref> Yet, although Port William is no stranger to murder, suicide, alcoholism, marital discord, and the full range of losses that touch human lives, it lacks the extremes of characterization and plot development that are found in much of Faulkner. Hence Berry is sometimes described as working in an idealized, pastoral, or nostalgic mode, a characterization of his work which he resists: \"If your work includes a criticism of history, which mine certainly does, you can't be accused of wanting to go back to something, because you're saying that what we were wasn't good enough.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/218/field-observations|title=Field Observations: An Interview with Wendell Berry|first=Jordan|last=Fisher-Smith|work=The Sun Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 21, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe effect of profound shifts in the agricultural practices of the United States, and the disappearance of traditional agrarian life,<ref>Cochrane, Willard Wesley. The Development of American Agriculture: A Historical Analysis. University of Minnesota Press, 1993. pp.122\u2013149.</ref> are some of the major concerns of the Port William fiction, though the theme is often only a background or subtext to the stories themselves. The Port William fiction attempts to portray, on a local scale, what \"a human economy \u2026 conducted with reverence\"<ref>Berry, Wendell. \"Imagination in Place.\"  ''The Way of Ignorance.'' Washington, D. C.: Shoemaker & Hoard, 2005. p.50.</ref>  looked like in the past\u2014and what civic, domestic, and personal virtues might be evoked by such an economy were it pursued today. Social as well as seasonal changes mark the passage of time. The Port William stories allow Berry to explore the human dimensions of the decline of the family farm and farm community, under the influence of expanding post-[[World War II]] agribusiness. But these works rarely fall into simple didacticism, and are never merely tales of decline. Each is grounded in a realistic depiction of character and community. In ''A Place on Earth'' (1967), for example, farmer Mat Feltner comes to terms with the loss of his only son, Virgil. In the course of the novel, we see how not only Mat but the entire community wrestles with the acute costs of World War II.\n\nBerry's fiction also allows him to explore the literal and metaphorical implications of [[marriage]] as that which binds individuals, families, and communities to each other and to Nature itself\u2014yet not all of Port William is happily or conventionally married. \"Old Jack\" Beechum struggles with significant incompatibilities with his wife, and with a brief yet fulfilling extramarital affair. The barber Jayber Crow lives with a forlorn, secret, and unrequited love for a woman, believing himself \"mentally\" married to her even though she knows nothing about it. Burley Coulter never formalizes his bond with Kate Helen Branch, the mother of his son. Yet, each of these men find themselves firmly bound up in the community, the \"membership,\" of Port William.\n\nOf his fictional project, Berry has written: \"I have made the imagined town of Port William, its neighborhood and membership, in an attempt to honor the actual place where I have lived. By means of the imagined place, over the last fifty years, I have learned to see my native landscape and neighborhood as a place unique in the world, a work of God, possessed of an inherent sanctity that mocks any human valuation that can be put upon it.\"<ref>\"Imagination in Place\" in ''Imagination in Place''. Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2010. p.15.</ref> Elsewhere, Berry has said, \"The only thing I try to accomplish in fiction is to show how people act when they love each other.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Memory of Old Jack by Wendell Berry: A Review|work=Above the Fray|date=December 2, 2014|url=http://www.deanabbott.com/the-memory-of-old-jack-by-wendell-berry-a-review/|first=Dean|last=Abbott|accessdate=August 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704180338/http://www.deanabbott.com/the-memory-of-old-jack-by-wendell-berry-a-review/|archive-date=July 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe novels and stories can be read in any order.\n\nIn January, 2018, the [[Library of America]] published a volume of Berry's fiction\u2014the first of a projected four volumes of his writing.

Reprinting by North Point Press in 1983 allowed Berry to radically revise the novel,<ref>\"Author's Note\", ''A Place on Earth''. Berkeley: Counterpoint, 1999. p.xi.</ref> removing almost a third of its original length. Jeffrey Bilbro believes that these substantial changes marked growth in Berry's approach. \"In Berry's revised edition, his technique caught up with his subject.

The story ranges from the Civil War to just past World War II. Josh Hurst comments on Berry's ability to avoid certain narrative pitfalls, \"Jack's story could be presented us either as heroic ballad or as cautionary [tale]\u2014and there is much in his life to support both admiration and gentle tisk-tisking\u2014but the gift of this book is how it allows a man's memories to wash over us as though unshaped by narrative or conscious editorializing.\" <ref>\"A Fiction of Remembering: Wendell Berry and The Memory of Old Jack\" http://cahootsmag.com/2015/01/a-fiction-of-remembering-wendell-berry-and-the-memory-of-old-jack/</ref>\n\n===''Remembering'' (1988)===\nIn Berry's fourth novel, an adult Andy Catlett wanders through San Francisco remembering, but feeling alienated from, his native Port William. He struggles to come to terms with himself, his marriage, his farm, and the distorted values of American society. Of Berry's vision here, Charles Solomon writes, \"Wendell Berry contrasts modern American agribusiness--which he depicts as an artificial conglomeration of sterile flow charts, debts and mechanization--with the older ideal of farming as a nurturing way of life.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-16/books/bk-1082_1_wendell-berry|title=REMEMBERING By Wendell Berry (North Point Press: $7.95)|first=CHARLES|last=SOLOMON|date=September 16, 1990|via=LA Times}}</ref> But along these lines, Bruce Bawer finds a problem with the novel, \"Here, for the first time in a Port William novel, Berry seems more interested in communicating opinions than in portraying sympathetic characters in plausible situations; the opening episode, set at a conference on agricultural policy, paints the ideological conflict between Andy and his adversaries in broad, unsubtle strokes.\" <ref>\"Membership & memory: A review of ''Fidelity'' by Wendell Berry\" by Bruce Bawer http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Membership---memory-4642</ref>\n\n===''A World Lost'' (1996)===\nYoung Andy Catlett's uncle Andrew had been murdered back in 1944, and now an adult Andy is reconstructing the event and its aftermath. \"Looking back with a mixture of a young boy's incomprehension and an older man's nostalgia, Andy evokes the past not as a narrative but as a series of disembodied fragments in the flow of time.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/books/books-in-brief-fiction-072109.html|title=A World Lost|first=Tobin|last=Harshaw|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 3, 1996|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> In this fifth novel of Port William, Berry considers the violence of men and its impact on the family and community that must come to terms with it. \"Berry shows us the psychic costs of misplaced family pride and social rigidity, and yet he also celebrates the benevolent blessing of familial love. This is simple, soul-satisfying storytelling, augmented by understated humor and quiet insight.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-887178-22-8|title=Fiction Book Review: \"A World Lost\" by Wendell Berry|work=PublishersWeekly.com|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Jayber Crow'' (2000)===\nPort William's barber recounts his life's journey in Berry's sixth novel. Jayber's early life as an orphan near Port William is followed by studies towards a possible vocation to Church ministry. A questioning mind, however, sends him in other directions until he finds himself back in Port William with an ever-growing commitment to that place and its people. As ''Publisher's Weekly'' notes, \"Crow's life, which begins as WWI is about to erupt, is emblematic of a century of upheaval, and Berry's anecdotal and episodic tale sounds a challenge to contemporary notions of progress. It is to Berry's credit that a novel so freighted with ideas and ideology manages to project such warmth and luminosity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-58243-029-4|title=Fiction Book Review: \"Jayber Crow\" by Wendell Berry|work=PublishersWeekly.com|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Hannah Coulter'' (2004)===\nBerry's seventh novel presents a concise vision of Port William's \"membership.\" The story encompasses Hannah's life, including the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], the postwar industrialization of agriculture, the flight of youth to urban employment, and the consequent remoteness of grandchildren. The tale is told in the voice of an old woman twice widowed, who has experienced much loss yet has never been defeated. Somehow, lying at the center of her strength is the \"membership\"\u2014the fact that people care for each other and, even in absence, hold each other in a kind of presence. All in all, ''Hannah Coulter'' embodies many of the themes of Berry's Port William saga.\n\n===''Andy Catlett: Early Travels'' (2006)===\nAndy Catlett, age nine, makes his first solo journey to visit with both sets of grandparents in Port William. ''The New York Times'' reviewer notes, \"What the grown-up Andy recalls of that experience is transformed into 'a sort of homage' to a now-vanished world. Title characters from Berry's earlier Port William volumes \u2014 Jayber Crow, Old Jack, Hannah Coulter \u2014 appear here in affectionate cameos as the adult Andy, echoing Wordsworth, observes that 'in my memory, all who were there ... seem now to be gathered into a love that is at once a boy's and an aging man's.'\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Roy|last=Hoffman|title=Boy on the Bus|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 28, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Hoffman.t.html?_r=0|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He is also an acerbic critic of what he dislikes, particularly modern individualism, and his emphasis on family and marriage and his ambivalence toward abortion mark him as an outsider to the left.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/wendell-berry-essays-library-of-america-review/|title=Wendell Berry\u2019s Lifelong Dissent|last=Britton-Purdy|first=Jedediah|date=2019-09-09|access-date=2019-09-09|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref></blockquote>The concept of \"''Solving for pattern''\", coined by Berry in his essay of the same title, is the process of finding solutions that solve multiple problems, while minimizing the creation of new problems.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berry|first=Wendell|title=The Gift of Good Land: Further Essays Cultural and Agricultural|url=https://archive.org/details/giftofgoodlandf00berr|url-access=registration|location=San Francisco|publisher=North Point|year=1981|isbn=0-86547-052-9}}</ref> The essay was originally published in the [[Rodale Press]] periodical ''The New Farm''.

New York: North Point, 1990. p.89.</ref>\n\n=== The Sabbath Poems ===\nFrom 1979 to the present Berry has been writing what he calls \"[[Sabbath]] poems.\" They were first collected in ''A Timbered Choir: The Sabbath Poems 1979-1997''. This was followed by Sabbaths from 1998 to 2004 in ''Given: New Poems''; and those from 2005 to 2008 are in ''Leavings''. All Sabbath poems through 2012 are published in ''This Day: New and Collected Sabbath Poems 1979 - 2012''. ''Sabbaths 2013'' has been published by [[Larkspur Press]]. ''A Small Porch'' contains nine Sabbath poems from 2014 and sixteen from 2015. One Sabbath poem, \"What Passes, What Remains\" (VIII from 2016), is published as the epilogue in ''The Art of Loading Brush''. That poem, along with fourteen others, can also be found in ''Sabbaths 2016'', published by Larkspur Press.\n\nThe poems are motivated by Berry's longtime habit of walking out onto the land on Sunday mornings. As he puts it, \"I go free from the tasks and intentions of my workdays, and so my mind becomes hospitable to unintended thoughts: to what I am very willing to call inspiration.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=This Day: Collected and New Sabbath Poems|last=Berry|first=Wendell|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61902-198-3|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=xxi}}</ref> He writes in a poem from 1979,\n<poem>The bell calls in the town \nWhere forebears cleared the shaded land\nAnd brought high daylight down\nTo shine on field and trodden road.\nI hear, but understand\nContrarily, and walk into the woods.\nI leave labor and load,\nTake up a different story.\nI keep an inventory\nOf wonders and of uncommercial goods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=This Day: Collected & New Sabbath Poems|last=Berry|first=Wendell|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61902-198-3|location=Berkeley|page=11}}</ref></poem>The Sabbath poems have been described as \"written from a particular place and on particular Sabbaths, and so should be read as part of a spiritual practice and as poems, in some sense, devoted to dwelling, to living thoughtfully in one place.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Marc|date=Winter 2015|title=Instantaneous and Eternal: Wendell Berry's Sabbath Poems|url=|journal=Sewanee Review|volume=123|pages=182\u2013191|doi=10.1353/sew.2015.0010}}</ref>  Oehlschlaeger links Berry's project to a key observation by [[Henry David Thoreau]],\n\n<blockquote>As Thoreau continues in '[[Life Without Principle]],' he notes the constant busyness of Americans, so engaged in 'infinite bustle' that 'there is no sabbath.' And he notes later that 'there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself, than this incessant business.' The logic is clear: destruction of the Sabbath is contrary to 'life itself.' That, I suggest, is the context in which we should read the Sabbath poems that Berry has been writing for nearly the last thirty years.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Achievement of Wendell Berry: The Hard History of Love|last=Oehlschlaeger|first=Fritz|publisher=U P of Kentucky|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8131-3007-1|location=Lexington, KY|page=37}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Fiction==\n\nBerry's fiction to date consists of eight novels and fifty-one short stories (forty-three of which are collected in ''That Distant Land'', 2004 and ''A Place in Time'', 2012) which, when read as a whole, form a chronicle of the fictional small Kentucky town of [[Port William, Kentucky|Port William]]. Because of his long-term, ongoing exploration of the life of an imagined place, Berry has been compared to [[William Faulkner]].<ref>Goodrich, Janet. ''The Unforeseen Self in the Works of Wendell Berry.'' University of Missouri Press, 2001. p.21.</ref> Yet, although Port William is no stranger to murder, suicide, alcoholism, marital discord, and the full range of losses that touch human lives, it lacks the extremes of characterization and plot development that are found in much of Faulkner. Hence Berry is sometimes described as working in an idealized, pastoral, or nostalgic mode, a characterization of his work which he resists: \"If your work includes a criticism of history, which mine certainly does, you can't be accused of wanting to go back to something, because you're saying that what we were wasn't good enough.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/218/field-observations|title=Field Observations: An Interview with Wendell Berry|first=Jordan|last=Fisher-Smith|work=The Sun Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 21, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe effect of profound shifts in the agricultural practices of the United States, and the disappearance of traditional agrarian life,<ref>Cochrane, Willard Wesley. The Development of American Agriculture: A Historical Analysis. University of Minnesota Press, 1993. pp.122\u2013149.</ref> are some of the major concerns of the Port William fiction, though the theme is often only a background or subtext to the stories themselves. The Port William fiction attempts to portray, on a local scale, what \"a human economy \u2026 conducted with reverence\"<ref>Berry, Wendell. \"Imagination in Place.\"  ''The Way of Ignorance.'' Washington, D. C.: Shoemaker & Hoard, 2005. p.50.</ref>  looked like in the past\u2014and what civic, domestic, and personal virtues might be evoked by such an economy were it pursued today. Social as well as seasonal changes mark the passage of time. The Port William stories allow Berry to explore the human dimensions of the decline of the family farm and farm community, under the influence of expanding post-[[World War II]] agribusiness. But these works rarely fall into simple didacticism, and are never merely tales of decline. Each is grounded in a realistic depiction of character and community. In ''A Place on Earth'' (1967), for example, farmer Mat Feltner comes to terms with the loss of his only son, Virgil. In the course of the novel, we see how not only Mat but the entire community wrestles with the acute costs of World War II.\n\nBerry's fiction also allows him to explore the literal and metaphorical implications of [[marriage]] as that which binds individuals, families, and communities to each other and to Nature itself\u2014yet not all of Port William is happily or conventionally married. \"Old Jack\" Beechum struggles with significant incompatibilities with his wife, and with a brief yet fulfilling extramarital affair. The barber Jayber Crow lives with a forlorn, secret, and unrequited love for a woman, believing himself \"mentally\" married to her even though she knows nothing about it. Burley Coulter never formalizes his bond with Kate Helen Branch, the mother of his son. Yet, each of these men find themselves firmly bound up in the community, the \"membership,\" of Port William.\n\nOf his fictional project, Berry has written: \"I have made the imagined town of Port William, its neighborhood and membership, in an attempt to honor the actual place where I have lived. By means of the imagined place, over the last fifty years, I have learned to see my native landscape and neighborhood as a place unique in the world, a work of God, possessed of an inherent sanctity that mocks any human valuation that can be put upon it.\"<ref>\"Imagination in Place\" in ''Imagination in Place''. Berkeley: Counterpoint, 2010. p.15.</ref> Elsewhere, Berry has said, \"The only thing I try to accomplish in fiction is to show how people act when they love each other.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Memory of Old Jack by Wendell Berry: A Review|work=Above the Fray|date=December 2, 2014|url=http://www.deanabbott.com/the-memory-of-old-jack-by-wendell-berry-a-review/|first=Dean|last=Abbott|accessdate=August 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704180338/http://www.deanabbott.com/the-memory-of-old-jack-by-wendell-berry-a-review/|archive-date=July 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe novels and stories can be read in any order.\n\nIn January, 2018, the [[Library of America]] published a volume of Berry's fiction\u2014the first of a projected four volumes of his writing.

Reprinting by North Point Press in 1983 allowed Berry to radically revise the novel,<ref>\"Author's Note\", ''A Place on Earth''. Berkeley: Counterpoint, 1999. p.xi.</ref> removing almost a third of its original length. Jeffrey Bilbro believes that these substantial changes marked growth in Berry's approach. \"In Berry's revised edition, his technique caught up with his subject.

The story ranges from the Civil War to just past World War II. Josh Hurst comments on Berry's ability to avoid certain narrative pitfalls, \"Jack's story could be presented us either as heroic ballad or as cautionary [tale]\u2014and there is much in his life to support both admiration and gentle tisk-tisking\u2014but the gift of this book is how it allows a man's memories to wash over us as though unshaped by narrative or conscious editorializing.\" <ref>\"A Fiction of Remembering: Wendell Berry and The Memory of Old Jack\" http://cahootsmag.com/2015/01/a-fiction-of-remembering-wendell-berry-and-the-memory-of-old-jack/</ref>\n\n===''Remembering'' (1988)===\nIn Berry's fourth novel, an adult Andy Catlett wanders through San Francisco remembering, but feeling alienated from, his native Port William. He struggles to come to terms with himself, his marriage, his farm, and the distorted values of American society. Of Berry's vision here, Charles Solomon writes, \"Wendell Berry contrasts modern American agribusiness--which he depicts as an artificial conglomeration of sterile flow charts, debts and mechanization--with the older ideal of farming as a nurturing way of life.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-16/books/bk-1082_1_wendell-berry|title=REMEMBERING By Wendell Berry (North Point Press: $7.95)|first=CHARLES|last=SOLOMON|date=September 16, 1990|via=LA Times}}</ref> But along these lines, Bruce Bawer finds a problem with the novel, \"Here, for the first time in a Port William novel, Berry seems more interested in communicating opinions than in portraying sympathetic characters in plausible situations; the opening episode, set at a conference on agricultural policy, paints the ideological conflict between Andy and his adversaries in broad, unsubtle strokes.\" <ref>\"Membership & memory: A review of ''Fidelity'' by Wendell Berry\" by Bruce Bawer http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Membership---memory-4642</ref>\n\n===''A World Lost'' (1996)===\nYoung Andy Catlett's uncle Andrew had been murdered back in 1944, and now an adult Andy is reconstructing the event and its aftermath. \"Looking back with a mixture of a young boy's incomprehension and an older man's nostalgia, Andy evokes the past not as a narrative but as a series of disembodied fragments in the flow of time.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/books/books-in-brief-fiction-072109.html|title=A World Lost|first=Tobin|last=Harshaw|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 3, 1996|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> In this fifth novel of Port William, Berry considers the violence of men and its impact on the family and community that must come to terms with it. \"Berry shows us the psychic costs of misplaced family pride and social rigidity, and yet he also celebrates the benevolent blessing of familial love.

Jayber's early life as an orphan near Port William is followed by studies towards a possible vocation to Church ministry. A questioning mind, however, sends him in other directions until he finds himself back in Port William with an ever-growing commitment to that place and its people. As ''Publisher's Weekly'' notes, \"Crow's life, which begins as WWI is about to erupt, is emblematic of a century of upheaval, and Berry's anecdotal and episodic tale sounds a challenge to contemporary notions of progress. It is to Berry's credit that a novel so freighted with ideas and ideology manages to project such warmth and luminosity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-58243-029-4|title=Fiction Book Review: \"Jayber Crow\" by Wendell Berry|work=PublishersWeekly.com|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Hannah Coulter'' (2004)===\nBerry's seventh novel presents a concise vision of Port William's \"membership.\" The story encompasses Hannah's life, including the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], the postwar industrialization of agriculture, the flight of youth to urban employment, and the consequent remoteness of grandchildren. The tale is told in the voice of an old woman twice widowed, who has experienced much loss yet has never been defeated. Somehow, lying at the center of her strength is the \"membership\"\u2014the fact that people care for each other and, even in absence, hold each other in a kind of presence. All in all, ''Hannah Coulter'' embodies many of the themes of Berry's Port William saga.\n\n===''Andy Catlett: Early Travels'' (2006)===\nAndy Catlett, age nine, makes his first solo journey to visit with both sets of grandparents in Port William. ''The New York Times'' reviewer notes, \"What the grown-up Andy recalls of that experience is transformed into 'a sort of homage' to a now-vanished world. Title characters from Berry's earlier Port William volumes \u2014 Jayber Crow, Old Jack, Hannah Coulter \u2014 appear here in affectionate cameos as the adult Andy, echoing Wordsworth, observes that 'in my memory, all who were there ... seem now to be gathered into a love that is at once a boy's and an aging man's.'\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Roy|last=Hoffman|title=Boy on the Bus|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 28, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Hoffman.t.html?_r=0|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
