Also, many Jewish immigrants settled in Whitechapel after fleeing from persecution in Western Europe at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/ripper-street/blog/2012/12/whitechapel|title=Whitechapel|website=BBC America|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Barnetts used their roles in the parish to improve the Whitechapel area. They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities.The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses.<ref name=\"Abel\"/> However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the [[parish]] had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church.<ref name=\"Abel\"/> In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it.<ref name=\"ellis\"/>\n\nIn 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at [[St John's College, Oxford]] to gain support for his idea. Barnett was able to gather enough support and a committee called the \"University Settlement of East London\" was set up by Oxford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Picht|first=Werner|title=Toynbee Hall and the English Settlement Movement|publisher=G.

At its opening, Toynbee Hall introduced University Extension Society lectures. These lectures were taught by university professors.

They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities.The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses.<ref name=\"Abel\"/> However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the [[parish]] had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church.<ref name=\"Abel\"/> In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it.<ref name=\"ellis\"/>\n\nIn 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at [[St John's College, Oxford]] to gain support for his idea.
