It is even referred to as '''Coringa''' by the [[East India Company|Britishers]] because of the proximity of its [[Port|Sea Port]] to the [[Koringa River|river Koringa]].\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] also called it '''Cocanada''' when they established the first Canadian Baptist Mission. After [[Independence of India|Independence]], it finally got the name '''Kakinada'''. Some theories suggest Kakasura's losing his eye by an arrow of [[Lord Rama]] gave the name ''Kakinada'' or that ''Kaki Nandivada'' is derived from (''Kaka'', an [[Ikshvaku]] king) who built the town.

The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river. As the principal seaport on this coast, it soon became a large shipbuilding yard of some importance.

The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river. As the principal seaport on this coast, it soon became a large shipbuilding yard of some importance. In 1802 a dock was built for repair of [[Royal Navy]] and other vessels, it boasted the only wet dock between Bombay and Calcutta. \u2018\u2019Cape Cori, or Hope Island\u2019' as it was called was known internationally for shipbuilding and repairs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sankar|first1=K.N.
