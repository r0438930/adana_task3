Brownson was a [[publicist]], a career which spanned his affiliation with the New England [[Transcendentalist]]s through his subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism.\n\n==Early years and education==\nBrownson was born on September 16, 1803 to Sylvester Augustus Brownson and Relief Metcalf, who were farmers in [[Stockbridge, Vermont]]. Sylvester Brownson died when Orestes was young and Relief decided to give her son up to a nearby adoptive family when he was six years old. The family raised him under the strict confines of Calvinist [[Congregational church|Congregationalism]] on a small farm in [[Royalton, Vermont]]. He did not receive much schooling but he immensely enjoyed reading books.  Among these were volumes by [[Homer]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] and the Bible.<ref>[[Theodore Maynard|Maynard, Theodore]] (1943). ''Orestes Brownson:  Yankee, Radical, Catholic''. New York:  Macmillan, pp. 2\u20139.</ref> In 1817, when he was fourteen, Orestes attended an academy briefly in New York.  This was the extent of his formal education.<ref>Hoeveler, David (2000). \"Brownson, Orestes Augustus\", American National Biography Online.</ref>\n\n==Religious unease==\nIn 1822, Brownson was baptized in the [[Presbyterian]] Church in [[Ballston, New York]], but he quickly complained that Presbyterians only associated with themselves, and that the [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] doctrines of [[predestination]] and [[eternal sin]] were too harsh. After withdrawing from Presbyterianism in 1824 and teaching at various schools in upstate New York and Detroit, Brownson applied to be a [[Universalist]] preacher. [[Universalism]], for Brownson, represented the only liberal variety of Christianity he knew of. However, [[Universalism]] also failed to quell his desire for religious understanding. He became the editor of a Universalist journal, ''Gospel Advocate and Impartial Investigator'', in which he wrote about his own religious doubt and criticized organized faiths and [[mysticism]] in religion.<ref>[[Arthur M.

There, he began publishing the magazine ''The Philanthropist''. In it, he could express his ideas outside of the pulpit since he thought of himself as a better journalist than preacher.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Transcendentalism==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Portrait of Orestes Augustus Brownson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Orestes Brownson.]]\nAfter the demise of the ''Philanthropist'' in 1832, Brownson moved to [[Walpole, New Hampshire]], where he was a part of the [[Transcendentalist]] movement that swept through the Boston Unitarian community.<ref>Caponigri, A. Robert (1945). \"Brownson and Emerson: Nature and History\", ''The New England Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 368\u201390.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> He read in English Romanticism and English and French reports on German Idealist philosophy, and was passionate about the work of [[Victor Cousin]] and [[Pierre Leroux]]. In 1836, the same year that [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s  ''Nature'' was published, Brownson participated in the founding of the [[Transcendental Club]].\n\nIn the same year he moved to [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]], to set up his own church, which he called \"The Society for Christian Union and Progress\", and publish his first book, ''New Views of Christianity, Society, and the Church.'' This work combined Transcendentalist religious views with radical social egalitarianism, sharply criticizing the unequal social distribution of wealth as un-Christian and unprincipled. After President [[Martin Van Buren]] appointed [[George Bancroft]] as Collector of Customs at Boston in 1837, Bancroft in turn gave jobs to Brownson and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].\n\nIn 1838, he founded the ''[[Boston Quarterly Review]]'', and served as its editor and main contributor for four years. Other contributors included [[George Bancroft]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], and [[Elizabeth Peabody]].<ref name=Lewis185>Lewis, R. W. B. (1955).

Among these was a favourable review of [[Thomas Carlyle|Thomas Carlyle's]] ''Chartism'', separately published as ''The Laboring Classes'' (1840), which caused considerable controversy. The article and Brownson's review of it is sometimes blamed for causing Van Buren, whom Brownson avidly supported, to lose the 1840 election to [[William Henry Harrison]].<ref>Schlesinger (1963), pp. 44\u201390.</ref> In fact, Van Buren himself is said to have \"blamed [Brownson] as the main cause of his defeat\" because the ''Boston Quarterly Review'' had recently promoted socialist ideas.<ref>Brownson, Henry (1908). Orestes Augustus Brownson. The Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nIn 1840 Brownson published his semi-autobiographical work, ''Charles Elwood; Or, The Infidel Converted''. Through the protagonist, Brownson railed against organized religion and questioned the Bible's infallibility, or truthfulness. In 1842, Brownson ceased separate publication of the ''Boston Quarterly Review'', and it was merged into ''[[The United States Magazine and Democratic Review]]'', but his beliefs were once again evolving. He found it necessary to break with the ''Review'' after a series of his essays created new scandal.\n\n==Conversion to Catholicism==\nIn the spring of 1843, rumors spread that Brownson was considering converting to Catholicism, especially when he met with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston.<ref name=Packer171>Packer, Barbara L.

Giles refers to Brownson's \"[http://orestesbrownson.org/330.html Protestantism in a Nutshell].\"</ref>\n\nHe soon renounced what he now considered the errors of his past, including [[Transcendentalism]] and liberalism, and devoted himself to writing articles dedicated to converting America to Catholicism.<ref>See for example his [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.a0004688602;view=1up;seq=72 debunking of a Presbyterian sermon] entitled \"The Dangers of Jesuit Instruction.\"</ref> Brownson used his articles to strike out against his former friends in the Transcendental movement, whom, he wrote, would be damned unless they converted as well.<ref name=Packer171/> He succeeded in persuading [[Sophia Ripley]], wife of George Ripley, to convert, but few others. At the same time, he lost the respect of many of his correspondents. According to one scholar, after his conversion, Brownson's writing changed, and the work he published in ''[[Brownson's Quarterly Review]]'' expressed ''\"''liberal views [that] frequently got Brownson into trouble, sometimes with the Catholic hierarchy.\"<REF NAME=\"THORP\"/> His conversion prompted him to be overzealous in defense of the Catholic Church. His unruly enthusiasm resulted in letters from local Catholic journalists and even the bishop of his diocese requesting that he cease leveling such harsh criticisms.<ref>Schlesinger (1963), pp. 200\u201310.</ref> Brownson's stance had much in common with the [[liberal Catholicism]] of [[Charles de Montalembert]], with whom he corresponded, and he published articles in French liberal Catholic publications such as ''Le Correspondant'', taking the side of the liberals against the conservative Catholics such as [[Louis Veuillot]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Longley |first1=Max |title=For the Union and the Catholic Church: Four Converts in the Civil War |date=2015 |publisher=McFarland |pages=85-87}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carey |first1=Patrick W. |title=Orestes Brownson and the Civil War |journal=U.S. Catholic Historian |date=2013 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1-20}}</ref>\n\nBrownson had also been writing many articles for the [[Paulist Fathers]]' ''[[Catholic World]]'' publication.

These writings caused a controversy among Catholic immigrants and the entire Catholic community in general. This controversy caused bishops all over New England to begin condemning his writings. He became increasingly lonely as a result of his being shunned from Boston communities, so he moved the ''Review'' and his family to New York in 1855, where he revived his interest in Catholic political philosophy.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1860, he announced that the Catholic Church must progress towards a welcoming intellectual environment.  He argued forcefully and eloquently that \"neither the friends nor the enemies of religion have anything to fear from adopting the great principle of civil and religious liberty, and asserting a free Church in a free State.\"<ref>Orestes Brownson, Civil and Religious Freedom from ''Seeking the Truth'', ''LOGOS: A Journal of Catholic Thought and Culture'', 20:4 (Fall 2017) pp. 124\u201362, here 158.</ref> Brownson noted with dismay how few European Catholics supported [[abolitionism|abolition]], and applauded liberal Catholics like Montalembert for being \"the only Catholics in Europe who sympathize with the loyal people of the Union.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rosenblatt |first1=Helena |title=The Lost History of Liberalism: From Ancient Rome to the Twenty-First Century |date=2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=174}}</ref> He posited that conscience must remain free to believe as it decides, and religion deals with the spiritual, not the civil realm.

After these two defeats, Brownson\u2019s declining health, spirit, and subscribers caused him to stop publishing the ''Review'' the same year. The journal was relaunched again later in Brownson's life after a nearly ten-year hiatus, in 1873. The ''Review'' finally ceased publication in 1875, the year before Brownson's death.

He was invited to New Orleans in 1855 by the publication ''Le Propagateur'', because he was viewed as a figure whom both Protestants and Catholics might enjoy hearing from, because of his multiple political and religious associations during his life. Although various newspapers recorded contradictory opinions on his lectures, all praised his \"eloquent\" speech.<ref>LeBreton, Dagmar Renshaw, \"Orestes Brownson's visit to New Orleans in 1855,\" ''American Literature'' 16, no. 2 (May 1944): 110\u201314, here 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1850s, among his many intellectual contributions, in the midst of Irish and German immigration debate and related [[Know Nothing#Underlying issues|nativist moral panic]], Brownson introduced the term ''Americanization'' into the public discourse while delivering a lecture, \"Church and the Republic\", at St. John\u2019s College, future [[Fordham University]].<ref>Elteren, Mel van.

Brownson was a [[publicist]], a career which spanned his affiliation with the New England [[Transcendentalist]]s through his subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism.\n\n==Early years and education==\nBrownson was born on September 16, 1803 to Sylvester Augustus Brownson and Relief Metcalf, who were farmers in [[Stockbridge, Vermont]]. Sylvester Brownson died when Orestes was young and Relief decided to give her son up to a nearby adoptive family when he was six years old. The family raised him under the strict confines of Calvinist [[Congregational church|Congregationalism]] on a small farm in [[Royalton, Vermont]]. He did not receive much schooling but he immensely enjoyed reading books.  Among these were volumes by [[Homer]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] and the Bible.<ref>[[Theodore Maynard|Maynard, Theodore]] (1943). ''Orestes Brownson:  Yankee, Radical, Catholic''. New York:  Macmillan, pp. 2\u20139.</ref> In 1817, when he was fourteen, Orestes attended an academy briefly in New York.  This was the extent of his formal education.<ref>Hoeveler, David (2000). \"Brownson, Orestes Augustus\", American National Biography Online.</ref>\n\n==Religious unease==\nIn 1822, Brownson was baptized in the [[Presbyterian]] Church in [[Ballston, New York]], but he quickly complained that Presbyterians only associated with themselves, and that the [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] doctrines of [[predestination]] and [[eternal sin]] were too harsh. After withdrawing from Presbyterianism in 1824 and teaching at various schools in upstate New York and Detroit, Brownson applied to be a [[Universalist]] preacher. [[Universalism]], for Brownson, represented the only liberal variety of Christianity he knew of. However, [[Universalism]] also failed to quell his desire for religious understanding. He became the editor of a Universalist journal, ''Gospel Advocate and Impartial Investigator'', in which he wrote about his own religious doubt and criticized organized faiths and [[mysticism]] in religion.<ref>[[Arthur M.

There, he began publishing the magazine ''The Philanthropist''. In it, he could express his ideas outside of the pulpit since he thought of himself as a better journalist than preacher.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Transcendentalism==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Portrait of Orestes Augustus Brownson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Orestes Brownson.]]\nAfter the demise of the ''Philanthropist'' in 1832, Brownson moved to [[Walpole, New Hampshire]], where he was a part of the [[Transcendentalist]] movement that swept through the Boston Unitarian community.<ref>Caponigri, A. Robert (1945). \"Brownson and Emerson: Nature and History\", ''The New England Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 368\u201390.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> He read in English Romanticism and English and French reports on German Idealist philosophy, and was passionate about the work of [[Victor Cousin]] and [[Pierre Leroux]]. In 1836, the same year that [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s  ''Nature'' was published, Brownson participated in the founding of the [[Transcendental Club]].\n\nIn the same year he moved to [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]], to set up his own church, which he called \"The Society for Christian Union and Progress\", and publish his first book, ''New Views of Christianity, Society, and the Church.'' This work combined Transcendentalist religious views with radical social egalitarianism, sharply criticizing the unequal social distribution of wealth as un-Christian and unprincipled. After President [[Martin Van Buren]] appointed [[George Bancroft]] as Collector of Customs at Boston in 1837, Bancroft in turn gave jobs to Brownson and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].\n\nIn 1838, he founded the ''[[Boston Quarterly Review]]'', and served as its editor and main contributor for four years. Other contributors included [[George Bancroft]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], and [[Elizabeth Peabody]].<ref name=Lewis185>Lewis, R. W. B. (1955).

Among these was a favourable review of [[Thomas Carlyle|Thomas Carlyle's]] ''Chartism'', separately published as ''The Laboring Classes'' (1840), which caused considerable controversy. The article and Brownson's review of it is sometimes blamed for causing Van Buren, whom Brownson avidly supported, to lose the 1840 election to [[William Henry Harrison]].<ref>Schlesinger (1963), pp. 44\u201390.</ref> In fact, Van Buren himself is said to have \"blamed [Brownson] as the main cause of his defeat\" because the ''Boston Quarterly Review'' had recently promoted socialist ideas.<ref>Brownson, Henry (1908). Orestes Augustus Brownson. The Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nIn 1840 Brownson published his semi-autobiographical work, ''Charles Elwood; Or, The Infidel Converted''. Through the protagonist, Brownson railed against organized religion and questioned the Bible's infallibility, or truthfulness. In 1842, Brownson ceased separate publication of the ''Boston Quarterly Review'', and it was merged into ''[[The United States Magazine and Democratic Review]]'', but his beliefs were once again evolving. He found it necessary to break with the ''Review'' after a series of his essays created new scandal.\n\n==Conversion to Catholicism==\nIn the spring of 1843, rumors spread that Brownson was considering converting to Catholicism, especially when he met with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston.<ref name=Packer171>Packer, Barbara L.

Giles refers to Brownson's \"[http://orestesbrownson.org/330.html Protestantism in a Nutshell].\"</ref>\n\nHe soon renounced what he now considered the errors of his past, including [[Transcendentalism]] and liberalism, and devoted himself to writing articles dedicated to converting America to Catholicism.<ref>See for example his [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.a0004688602;view=1up;seq=72 debunking of a Presbyterian sermon] entitled \"The Dangers of Jesuit Instruction.\"</ref> Brownson used his articles to strike out against his former friends in the Transcendental movement, whom, he wrote, would be damned unless they converted as well.<ref name=Packer171/> He succeeded in persuading [[Sophia Ripley]], wife of George Ripley, to convert, but few others. At the same time, he lost the respect of many of his correspondents. According to one scholar, after his conversion, Brownson's writing changed, and the work he published in ''[[Brownson's Quarterly Review]]'' expressed ''\"''liberal views [that] frequently got Brownson into trouble, sometimes with the Catholic hierarchy.\"<REF NAME=\"THORP\"/> His conversion prompted him to be overzealous in defense of the Catholic Church. His unruly enthusiasm resulted in letters from local Catholic journalists and even the bishop of his diocese requesting that he cease leveling such harsh criticisms.<ref>Schlesinger (1963), pp. 200\u201310.</ref> Brownson's stance had much in common with the [[liberal Catholicism]] of [[Charles de Montalembert]], with whom he corresponded, and he published articles in French liberal Catholic publications such as ''Le Correspondant'', taking the side of the liberals against the conservative Catholics such as [[Louis Veuillot]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Longley |first1=Max |title=For the Union and the Catholic Church: Four Converts in the Civil War |date=2015 |publisher=McFarland |pages=85-87}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carey |first1=Patrick W. |title=Orestes Brownson and the Civil War |journal=U.S. Catholic Historian |date=2013 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1-20}}</ref>\n\nBrownson had also been writing many articles for the [[Paulist Fathers]]' ''[[Catholic World]]'' publication.

These writings caused a controversy among Catholic immigrants and the entire Catholic community in general. This controversy caused bishops all over New England to begin condemning his writings. He became increasingly lonely as a result of his being shunned from Boston communities, so he moved the ''Review'' and his family to New York in 1855, where he revived his interest in Catholic political philosophy.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1860, he announced that the Catholic Church must progress towards a welcoming intellectual environment.

After these two defeats, Brownson\u2019s declining health, spirit, and subscribers caused him to stop publishing the ''Review'' the same year. The journal was relaunched again later in Brownson's life after a nearly ten-year hiatus, in 1873. The ''Review'' finally ceased publication in 1875, the year before Brownson's death.

He was invited to New Orleans in 1855 by the publication ''Le Propagateur'', because he was viewed as a figure whom both Protestants and Catholics might enjoy hearing from, because of his multiple political and religious associations during his life. Although various newspapers recorded contradictory opinions on his lectures, all praised his \"eloquent\" speech.<ref>LeBreton, Dagmar Renshaw, \"Orestes Brownson's visit to New Orleans in 1855,\" ''American Literature'' 16, no. 2 (May 1944): 110\u201314, here 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1850s, among his many intellectual contributions, in the midst of Irish and German immigration debate and related [[Know Nothing#Underlying issues|nativist moral panic]], Brownson introduced the term ''Americanization'' into the public discourse while delivering a lecture, \"Church and the Republic\", at St. John\u2019s College, future [[Fordham University]].<ref>Elteren, Mel van.
