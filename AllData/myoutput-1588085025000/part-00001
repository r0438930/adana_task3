Later, in late times, they too began to use this term to differentiate themselves from other ethnic groups.\n\nOne opinion, it is that originally the Ligurians did not have a term to define their entire ethnicity, but only had names by which they defined themselves as members of a particular tribe.

A controversy of great importance for the supporters of a Celto-Ligurian similarity.

The connection between Massalia and the Phoceans is mentioned in [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War|Peloponnesian War]]'';{{sfn|Duch\u00eane|Contrucci|1998|p=42}} he notes that the Phocaean project was opposed by the [[Carthaginians]], whose fleet was defeated.<ref>{{Thucydides|en|1|13|6|ref}}</ref> \n\nThe founding of Massalia has also been recorded as a legend. According to the legend, Protis, or Euxenes, a native of Phocae, while exploring for a new trading outpost or ''emporion'' to make his fortune, discovered the Mediterranean [[cove]] of the Lacydon, fed by a freshwater stream and protected by two rocky promontories.<ref>Duboi, Marius; Gaffarel, Paul; Samat, J.-B. (1913). ''Histoire de Marseille'' (in French). Marseille: Librairie P. Ruat.</ref> Protis was invited inland to a banquet held by Nannu, the chief of the local ligurian tribe of Segobrigi, for suitors seeking the hand of his daughter Gyptis in marriage. At the end of the banquet, Gyptis presented the ceremonial cup of wine to Protis, indicating her unequivocal choice. Following their marriage, they moved to the hill just to the north of the Lacydon; and from this settlement grew Massalia.<ref>Duboi, Marius; Gaffarel, Paul; Samat, J.-B. (1913). ''Histoire de Marseille'' (in French). Marseille: Librairie P. Ruat.</ref> [[Graham Robb|Robb]] gives greater weight to the Gyptis story, though he notes that the tradition was to offer water, not wine, to signal the choice of a marriage partner.<ref>Robb, Graham, ''The Discovery of Middle Earth'', p. 6</ref> Later, the natives would treacherously lay a plot to destroy the new colony, but the scheme was divulged and Conran, king of the natives, was killed in the ensuing battle.<ref>Duboi, Marius; Gaffarel, Paul; Samat, J.-B. (1913). ''Histoire de Marseille'' (in French). Marseille: Librairie P. Ruat.</ref> Probably the Greeks expressed the intention to expand the territory of the colony, and this is why Conran ( the son of Nannu),tried to destroy it. However, the resistance of the Ligurians had the effect of reducing the Greek claims, which renounced territorial expansion. The massaliotes ended up concentrating on the development of trade, first with the Ligurians, and then with the Gauls, until Massalia became the most important port in [[Gaul]].\n\n=== The arrival and the fusion with the Celts  ===\n[[File:Salyens villes map-fr.svg|thumb|239x239px|Tribal groups of ancient Provence and their settlements|alt=]]\nBetween the 8th and 5th centuries BC, tribes of Celtic peoples, probably coming from Central Europe, also began moving into Provence. They had weapons made of iron, which allowed them to easily defeat the local tribes, who were still armed with bronze weapons.\n\nLigurians and new-arrivals Celts spread throughout the area, sharing the territory of modern [[Provence]], [[Celts]] and Ligurians later started to inter-mixing between each other and form a Celto-Ligurian culture, with many tribes. Each tribe in its own alpine valley or settlement along a river, each with its own king and dynasty. Of these numerous Celto-Ligurian tribes, the Salluvi settled north of Massalia, in the area of Aix-en-Provence while Caturiges, Tricastins, and Cavares settled to the west of the [[Durance]] river.<ref>J. R. Palanque, ''Ligures, Celts et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34</ref> They built hilltop forts and settlements, later given the Latin name ''oppida''. Today the traces 165 ''[[Oppidum|oppida]]'' are found in the [[Var (department)|Var]], and as many as 285 in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]].<ref>J. R. Palanque, ''Ligures, Celts et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34.</ref>\n\nThey worshipped various aspects of nature, establishing sacred woods at Sainte-Baume and Gemenos, and healing springs at Glanum and Vern\u00e8gues. Later, in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the different tribes formed confederations; the Voconces in the area from the [[Is\u00e8re]] to the [[Vaucluse]]; the Cavares in the Comtat; and the Salyens, from the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] river to the Var. The tribes began to trade their local products, iron, silver, alabaster, marble, gold, resin, wax, honey and cheese; with their neighbours, first by trading routes along the Rh\u00f4ne river, and later [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] traders visited the coast. Etruscan [[amphorae]] from the 7th and 6th centuries BC have been found in Marseille, Cassis, and in hilltop oppida in the region.<ref>J. R.

The Greeks called the island first Kalliste and then Cyrnos, Cernealis, Corsis and Cirn\u00e9.\n\nIn 535 B.C., following the [[Battle of Alalia|Battle Alalia]], they were defeated by an Etruscan-Carthaginian coalition formed on a pact specifically stipulated and that, after the conflict, in case of victory, provided for the division of the two islands on which the influence had been conquered: Sardinia to the Carthaginians, Corsica to the Etruscans. In reality, according to [[Herodotus]], the Focei had won, but it would have been a [[pyrrhic victory]], given that of the 60 ships employed (half of the total armoury of the opposing fleets) 40 were sunk and the remaining rendered useless. The Massaliotes then left Corsica and the Carthaginians and Etruscans were able to give substance equally to the pact of partition. The Etruscans regained control over the eastern shores of the island, which they had already consolidated with the activity of the war marinas of Pisa, [[Volterra]], [[Populonia]], [[Tarquinia]] and Cere.\n\n=== Between Celts and Etruscans ===\n\n==== The Celto-Ligurian fusion in Western Alps and Po Valley ====\n{{see also||Canegrate culture|Golasecca culture}}\nStarting from the 12th century B.C., from the union of the previous [[Polada culture|cultures of Polada]] and [[Canegrate culture|Canegrate]], that is from the union of pre-existing Ligurian populations with the arrival of Celtic populations, at the same time as the birth of the [[Hallstatt culture]] in central Europe and the [[Villanovan culture|Villanova culture]] in central Italy, a new civilization developed that archaeologists call Golasecca from the name of the place where the first discoveries were found.\n\nThe People of Golasecca Culture inhabited a territory of about 20,000 km\u00b2, from the Alpine watershed to the Po, from Valsesia to the Serio, gravitating around three main centers: the area of Sesto Calende, Bellinzona, but especially the protourban center of Como.\n\nWith the arrival of Gallic populations from beyond the Alps, in the 4th century B.C. this Celtic-Ligurian civilization declined and came to an end.\n\nThe Etruscan expansion in the plain of the Po and the invasion of the Gauls confined the Ligurians between the Alps and the Apennines, where they offered such resistance to Roman penetration that they gained a reputation with the ancients for primitive fierceness.\n\n====== The Cultures of Canagrate, Polada and Golasecca ======\n[[File:Cultura di Canegrate map.svg|left|thumb|Areal of diffusion of Canagrate Culture]]\nThe [[Canegrate culture]] (13th century BC) may represent the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic<ref>Venceslas Kruta: ''La grande storia dei celti.

They coincide, in a significant way, with the territories occupied by those tribal groups whose names are reported by Latin and Greek historians and geographers<ref name=\":2\" />:\n\n*'''[[Insubres|Insubri]]''': in the area south of Lake Maggiore, in Varese and part of Novara with Golasecca, Sesto Calende, Castelletto sopra Ticino; from the fifth century BC this area remains suddenly depopulated, while the first settlement of Mediolanum (Milan) rises.\n*'''[[Lepontii|Leponti]]''': in the [[Canton of Ticino]], with Bellinzona and Sopra Ceneri; in the Ossola.\n*'''[[Orobii|Orobi]]''': in the area of Como and Bergamo.\n*'''[[Laevi]]''' and '''[[Marici (Ligures)|Marici]]''': in Lomellina (Pavia/Ticinum).\n\nThe Celts have not imposed themselves on the existing tribes, but have mixed with them. When the Etruscans and Romans arrived, north-west Italy was inhabited by a complex network of Celtic-Ligurian populations with some geographical differences: in general, to the north of the Po (named ''Gallia Transpadana'' later by Romans '')'', Celtic culture prevailed decisively, while to the south (''Gallia Cispadana'' named later'')'' the Ligurian imprint continued to leave important traces. \n\nLooking at North-Western Italy up to the Po river, while in modern Lombardy and eastern Piedmont the Golasecca culture emerged, in the westernmost part there are 2 principal tribal groups: the [[Taurini]] in the area of Turin and the [[Salassi]] in modern [[Ivrea]] and the [[Aosta Valley]].\n\n==== The Etruscan expansion and foundation of Genua ====\n[[File:Etruscan civilization map.png|thumb|Etruscan expansion in the south Po Valley, and in Corsica |alt=|left]]\nLigurian sepulchres of the Italian Riviera and of Provence, holding cremations, exhibit Etruscan and Celtic influences.<ref>Ancient Italic people, The Ligurians, Enciclopedia Britannica\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/ancient-Italic-people/Other-Italic-peoples#ref63581</ref>\n\nIn the seventh century BC, in addition to the Greeks, the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] also began to push in the northern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], until what is now call the [[Ligurian Sea]].\n\nAlthough they had intense commercial exchanges, they were competitors of the Greeks, with whom they often clashed. From 540 B.C. about the Etruscan presence in the Po Valley experienced a renewed expansion in the scenario following the Battle of Alalia resulted in a progressive limitation of Etruscan movements in the Upper Tyrrhenian Sea.<ref>La Battaglia del mare Sardo (540 a.C.) Archiviato il 26 febbraio 2013 in Internet Archive..</ref> The expansion to the north of the Apennines is characterized by that moment as aimed at identifying and controlling new trade routes\n\nTheir expansionist policy was different from that of the Greeks: their expansion was mainly by land, trying gradually to occupy the areas bordering them. Even though they were good sailors, they did not found far away colonies, but at the very least emporiums destined to support trade with the local populations. This created an ambivalence in the relations with the Ligurians; on the one hand they were excellent commercial partners for all the coastal emporiums, on the other hand, their expansionist policy led them to press on the Ligurian populations settled north of the Arno river, making them retreat into the mountain areas of the [[North Pennines|northern Apennines]].\n\nEven in this case, the Ligurian opposition prevented the Etruscans from going further; indeed, although traditionally the border between the Ligurian and Etruscan areas is considered the Magra river, it is testified that the Etruscan settlements north of the Arno (for example [[Pisa]]) were periodically attacked and plundered by the Ligurian tribes of the mountains.\n\nAs already mentioned, hostility to the borders did not prevent an intense commercial relationship, as evidenced by the large quantity of Etruscan ceramics found in the Ligurian sites. Of this period is the foundation of the oppida of Genua (nowadays [[Genoa]], about 500 BC), the urban core of the \"Castello\" (perhaps an ancient Ligurian oppidum) began<ref>Marco Milanese, ''Scavi nell'oppidum preromano di Genova'', L'Erma di Bretschneider, Roma 1987 testo on-line su GoogleBooks; Piera Melli , ''Una citt\u00e0 portuale del Mediterraneo tra il VII e il III secolo a.C.\", Genova, Fratelli Frilli ed., 2007.''</ref>, for flourishing trade, to expand towards today's Pr\u00e8 (the area of meadows) and the Rivo Torbido. Some scholars believe that Genoa was an Etruscan emporium, and that only later, the local Ligurian tribe took control (or merged with the Etruscans).<ref>Piera Melli , Una citt\u00e0 portuale del Mediterraneo tra il VII e il III secolo a.C.\", Genoa, Fratelli Frilli ed., 2007 (on-line text of the first chapter Archived on 28 February 2009 in the Internet Archive.). A marble funerary stele dedicated to Apollonia, found reused in the walls of the twelfth century was considered a proof of the Greek origin of the city: the stele, a work of the first half of the third century BC, must be considered rather arrived in Genoa along with many ancient artifacts in the Middle Ages.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the fifth century BC, the Etruscan power began to decline: attacked in the north by the Gauls, south by the Greeks and with the revolts of controlled cities (e.g. Rome), the Etruscan presence among the Ligurians came less and less, intensifying massilian and gallic influence\n\nFrom that moment on, Genoa, inhabited by the Ligurian Genuati, was considered by the Greeks, given its strong commercial character, \"the emporium of the Ligurians\": wood for shipbuilding, livestock, leather, honey, textiles were some of the Ligurian products of commercial exchange.\n\n=== First contacts with Romans ===\nIn the third century B.C., the Romans, having been right of the Etruscans and integrated their territories, found themselves in direct contact with the Ligurians. However, Roman expansionism was directed towards the rich territories of [[Gaul]] and the Iberian Peninsula (then under [[Carthaginian Iberia|Carthaginian control]]), and the territory of the Ligurians was on the road (they controlled the Ligurian coasts and the South-western Alps). \n\nAt the beginning the Romans had a rather condescending attitude: the Ligurian territory was considered poor, while the fame of its warriors was known (they had already met them as mercenaries), finally they were already engaged in the [[First Punic War]] and were not willing to open new fronts, so they tried first of all to make them allies. However, despite their efforts, only a few Ligurian tribes made alliance agreements with the Romans (the alliance with the Genuates is famous), the rest immediately proved hostile.\n\nThe hostilities were opened in 238 BC by a coalition of Ligurians and Gauls Boi, but the two peoples soon found themselves in disagreement and the military campaign came to a halt with the dissolution of the alliance. Meanwhile, a Roman fleet commanded by Quintus Fabius Maximus routed Ligurian ships on the coast (234-233 BC), allowing the Romans to control the coastal route to and from Gaul.\n\nIn in 222 B.C. the Insubres, during a war with Romans occupied the oppidum of Clastidium, that at that time, it was an important locality of the Anamari (or [[Marici (Ligures)|Marici]]), a Ligurian tibe that, probably for fear of the nearby warlike Insubres, had already accepted the alliance with Rome the year before. \n\nFor the first time the Roman army go beyond the Po, spreading Gallia Transpadana: the [[battle of Clastidium]], in 222 B.C., earned Rome the taking of the capital of the Insubres: Mediolanum (Milan). To consolidate its dominion, Rome created the colonies of Placentia, in the territory of the Boii, and [[Cremona]] in that of the Insubri.<ref>Demandt, p. 86</ref>\n\n=== Second Punic War ===\nWith the outbreak of the second Punic war (218 B.C.) the Ligurian tribes had different attitudes:\n\n* a part (the tribes of the [[Italian Riviera|west Riviera]] and the [[Apuani]]) allied with the Carthaginians, providing soldiers to Hannibal's troops when he arrived in Northern Italy (they hoped that the Carthaginian general would free them from the Roman neighbor);\n* another part (Genuates, [[Bagienni]] and the Taurini) took sides in support of the Romans.\n\nThe pro-carthage Ligurians took part in the [[Battle of the Trebia]], in which the Carthaginians won. Other Ligurians enlisted in the army of [[Hasdrubal Barca]], when he came down to Cisalpine Gaul (207 BC), in an attempt to rejoin the troops of his brother Hannibal. In the port of Savo (the present [[Savona]]), then capital of the Ligures Sabazi, the trireme ships of the Carthaginian fleet of General [[Mago Barca]], brother of Hannibal, destined to cut the Roman trade routes in the Tyrrhenian Sea, found shelter.\n\nTo the pro-Roman Ligurians, at the beginning it did not go as well. Taurini were on the road of [[Hannibal]] to enter in Italy and in 218 BC, they were attacked by him, who had allied with their long-standing enemies: the [[Insubres]]. The Taurini chief town (''Taurasia,'' now Turin), was captured by Hannibal's forces after a three-day siege.<ref>[[Polybius]] iii. 60, 8</ref>\n\nIn 205 BC, Genua was attacked and razed to the ground by Mago.<ref>Titus Livius, ''Ab Urbe Condita libri CXLII'' 21, 32,1 and 28, 46,7.</ref>\n\nWith the reversal of the fate of the Second Punic War, Mago (203 BC) is among the Ingauni, trying to block the Roman advance: suffered a serious defeat that cost him his life, in the same year was rebuilt Genua. Ligurian troops are still present, as Hannibal's chosen troop, at the battle of Zama in 202 BC, which decreed the defeat of Carthage.<ref>Polibius, ''Stories'', XV, 11.1</ref>\n\n=== Roman conquest of \"Cisalpine Ligurians\" ===\n[[File:Elmo guerriero pulica.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of the Pulica helmet, revovered into an Apuani grave|alt=]]\nIn 200 B.C. Ligurians and [[Boii]] sacked and destroyed the Roman colony of [[Piacenza|Placentia]], effectively controlling the most important ford of the Po Valley.<ref>In 200 the Gauls and Ligurians combined forces and sacked the Latin colony of Placentia in an attempt to drive the Romans out of their lands\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome/Roman-expansion-in-the-western-Mediterranean#ref298396</ref>\n\nDuring the same period the Romans were at war with the Apuani. The serious effort began in 182, when both consular armies and a proconsular army were sent against the Ligurians. The wars continued into the 150s, when victorious generals celebrated two triumphs over the Ligurians. Here also the Romans drove many natives off their land and settled colonies in their stead (''e.g.'', Luna and Luca in the 170s).<ref>During the same period the Romans were at war with the Ligurian tribes of the northern Apennines.

Ligurian tribes, Gauls and skidding Carthaginian troops, starting from the mountain territories, continued to fight with guerrilla tactics. Thus the Romans were forced into continuous military operations in northern Italy.\n\nIn 201 BC the Ingauni were forced to surrender.\n\nOnly in 197 B.C. the Romans, under the leadership of Minucius Rufus, succeeded in regaining control of the Placentia area by subduing the Celelates, the Cerdicates, the Ilvati and the Boi Gauls and occupying the oppida of Clastidium. \n\nGenua was rebuilt by the proconsul [[Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus|Spurius Lucretius]] and in 197 BC. Defeated Carthage, Rome aimed to expand northwards, and used Genua as a support base for raids, between 191 and 154 BC, against the Ligurian tribes of the hinterland, allied for decades with Carthage. \n\nA second phase of the conflict followed (197-155 B.C.), characterized by the fact that the Apuani Ligurians entrenched themselves on the Apennines, from where they periodically descended to plunder the surrounding territories. The Romans, for their part, organized continuous expeditions to the mountains, hoping to snide, surround and defeat the Ligurians (taking care not to be destroyed by ambushes). Throughout the war the Romans boasted 15 triumphs and at least one serious defeat.\n\nHistorically, the beginning of the campaign dates back to 193 BC on the initiative of the Ligurian conciliabula (federations), who organized a major raid going as far as the right bank of the river Arno. Roman campaigns followed (191, 188 and 187 B.C.), victorious but not decisive.\n\nWith the campaign of 186 B.C., the Romans were beaten by the Ligurians in the Magra valley. In the battle, which took place in a narrow and precipitous place, the Romans lost about 4000 soldiers, three eagle insignia of the second legion and eleven banners of the Latin allies. In addition, the consul Quintus Martius was also killed in the battle. It is thought that the place of the battle and the death of the consul gave rise to the place-name of Marciaso or that of the Canal of March on Mount Caprione in the town of Lerici and near the ruins of the city of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]], which was later founded by the Romans. This mountain had a strategic importance because it controlled the valley of Magra and the sea.\n\nIn 185 B.C., the Ingauni and the Intimeli also rebelled and managed to resist the Roman legions until 180 B.C. The Apuani, and those of hinterland side still resisted.\n\nWanting to \"dispose\" of Liguria for their next conquest of Gaul, however, the Romans prepared a large army of almost 36,000 soldiers, under the orders of the Roman proconsuls [[Publius Cornelius Cethegus (consul 181 BC)|Publius Cornelius Cethegus]] and [[Marcus Baebius Tamphilus]], with the aim of putting an end to Ligurian independence.\n\nIn 180 B.C. the Romans inflicted a very serious defeat on the Apuani Ligures, and deported 40,000 of them to the regions of [[Samnium]]. This deportation was followed by another one of 7,000 Ligurians in the following year. These were one of the few cases in which the Romans [[Deportation|deported]] defeated populations in such a high number. In 177 B.C. other groups of Liguri Apuani surrendered to the Roman forces, and eventually assimilated into Roman culture during the 2nd century BC<ref>{{cite thesis|first=William|last=Broadhead|year=2002|type=Ph.D.|title=Internal migration and the transformation of Republican Italy|institution=University College London|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317574/1/251994.pdf|page=15}}</ref>, while the military campaign continued further north.\n\nThe surviving Ligurian tribes, now isolated and in absolute inferiority, continued to fight.\n\nIn succession: Frinatiates (175 B.C.), [[Statielli]] (172 B.C.), and the Velleiates (158 B.C.), had to surrender. The last Apuani resistance was won only in 155 B.C. by the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus.\n\n=== Subjugation of \"transalpine\" and \"Capillati\" Ligures ===\nThe subjugation of the coastal Ligures and the annexation of the Alpes Maritimae took place in 14 BC, closely following the occupation of the central Alps in 15 BC.<ref>Dio LIV.22.3-4</ref>\n\nThe last Ligurian tribes (e.g. Vocontii and Salluvi) still autonomous, who occupied Provence, were subdued in 124 BC.<ref>Plinius the elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', III, 47.</ref>\n\n=== Under Roman rule ===\n==== The Roman province of Cisalpine Gaul ====\nThe Cisalpine Gaul was the part of modern Italy inhabited by [[Celts]] during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.

The Celto-Ligurian hypothesis became associated with the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] and \"expanded to cover much of Central Europe\".<ref>See, in particular {{cite book|first=Colin|last=McEvedy|title=The Penguin Atlas of Ancient History by Colin McEvedy|date= 1967 |page=29}}</ref>\n\n[[Julius Pokorny]] adapted the Celto-Ligurian hypothesis into one linking the Ligures to the [[Illyrians]], citing an array of similar evidence from Eastern Europe.

Rare were the [[Oppidum|oppidas]], to which corresponded the federal capitals of the individual tribes or important commercial emporiums.\n\nThe territory of a tribe was almost entirely public property, only a small percentage of the land (the cultivated) was \"private\", in the sense that, against payment of a small tax, was given in concession. Only late in life did the concept of private, heritable or marketable property develop.\n\nReflecting the decentralized character of the ethnic group, the Ligurians did not have a centralized political structure. Each tribe decided for itself, even in contrast with the other tribes; as evidence of this, are the opposing alliances that over time Ligurian tribes made against Greeks, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and Romans.\n\nWithin the tribes, an egalitarian and communal spirit prevails. If there is also a noble class, this is tempered by \"tribal rallies\" in which all the classes participate; there does not seem to be any pre-organized magistracy. There were no dynastic leaders either: the Ligurian \"[[king]]\" was elected as leader of a tribe or a federation of tribes; only in late period did a real dynastic aristocratic class begin to emerge. Originally there was no slavery: [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were massacred or [[Human sacrifice|sacrificed]].<ref>Livius mentions the fate of the population of Mutina, once it fell into the hands of the Ligures.</ref>\n\nThe stories of the foundation of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|Massalia]], give us some interesting information:\n\n* had a strong sense of hospitality;\n* the women chose each other's husbands, demonstrating an emancipation unknown to the eastern peoples.\n* Diodorus Siculus in the first century B.C. writes that women take part in the work of toil alongside men.<ref>Historical Library, V,39,1.</ref>\n\n=== Clothing ===\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] reports the use of a [[tunic]] tightened at the waist by a leather belt and closed by a clasp generally bronze; the legs were naked<ref name=\":1\" />. Other garments used were cloaks \"[[sagum]]\", and during the winter animal skins to shelter from the cold.<ref>Diodorus Siculis, Biblioteca, V, 39, 1-8</ref> Characteristic element was the fibula, used to close the clothes and the cloaks, made of [[amber]] (imported from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]) and glass paste, enriched with ornamental elements in bone or stone.  \n\n== Physical appearance ==\nLucan in his Pharsalia (c. 61 AD) described Ligurian tribes as being long-haired, and their hair a shade of auburn (a reddish-brown):{{quote|...Ligurian tribes, now shorn, in ancient days \nFirst of the long-haired nations, on whose necks<br> \nOnce flowed the auburn locks in pride supreme.<ref>Lucan, Pharsalia, I. 496, translated by Edward Ridley (1896).</ref>}}\n\n== Warfare ==\n[[File:Bologna Museo Civico Archeologico Etruskische bronzen helm - necropole benacci 26-04-2012 12-11-14.JPG|thumb|Montefortino type helmet ]]\n[[Diodorus Siculus]], describes the Ligurians as very fearsome enemies: although not particularly impressive from the physical point of view, strength, will and tenacity makes them the most dangerous warriors than the [[gauls]]. As proof of this, the Ligurian warriors were very much in demand as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] and several times the Mediterranean powers like Carthage and Syracuse, went to Liguria to recruit armies for their expeditions (for example, the elite troops of [[Hannibal]] were made up of a contingent of Ligurians).\n\n=== Tactics, unit tipes and equipment ===\nThe armament varied according to the class and the comfort of the owner, in general however the great mass of the Ligurian warriors was substantially [[light infantry]], armed in a poor way<ref>Diodorus Siculus, Library, V, 39, 1-8</ref><ref>Livius XXXIX I, 6</ref> The main weapon was the spear, with cusps that could exceed a [[cubit]] (about 45&nbsp;cm, or one and half foot ), followed by the sword, of [[Iron Age sword|Gallic shape]] (sometimes cheap because made with soft metals), very rarely the warriors were equipped with [[Bow and arrow|bows and arrows]]. \n\nThe protection was entrusted to an oblong [[shield]] of wood,<ref>Polibius XXIX 14, 4</ref> always of Celtic typology (but to difference of this last one without metallic boss)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adpvgnamparati.eu/|title=AD PUGNAM PARATI: Rievocazione Storica, Spettacolo, Sperimentazione|language=it-IT|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref> and a simple helmet, of [[Montefortino helmet|Montefortino]] type. \n\nThe horned helmets, recovered in the Apuani tribe area, were problaby used only for ceremonial purpose and they were worn by warchief, to underline their virility and military skills. The use of [[Armour|armor]] is not known: the seated warrior from the [[Roquepertuse|site of Roquepertuse]] seems to wears a leather armor, although the statue is attributable to the 5th century A.D. and the armor maybe was used only in this period.

Strabo says that the Salyes tribe located north of Massalia, have a substantial cavaly force, but, they were one of the several Celto-Ligurian tribes, and probably the cavalry reflect the Celtic element <ref name=\":1\">''Armies of the Macedonian and Punic Wars'', Duncan Head, 2012 Page 296 (https://books.google.it/books?id=-7n8CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA294&lpg=PA294&dq=ligures+warrior&source=bl&ots=1gcz-CPca-&sig=ACfU3U2IWz3f6FlupTDzRSNtwjrDZQvaRg&hl=it&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjF9dWTpurlAhUDKewKHfQvA1YQ6AEwBnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=ligures%20warrior&f=false)</ref>[[File:Roquepertuse. Statue de guerrier.jpg|thumb|Seated warrior from [[Roquepertuse]]|alt=]]\n\n=== Mercenaries ===\nThe Ligures seem to have been ready to engage as mercenary troops in the service of others. Ligurian auxiliaries are mentioned in the army of the Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar I of Carthage|Hamilcar I]] in 480 BC.<ref>Herodotus 7.165; Diodorus Siculus 11.1.</ref> Greek leaders in Sicily continued to recruit Ligurian mercenary forces from the same quarter as late as the time of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]].<ref name=\"dictionary\" /><ref>Diodorus Siculus 21.3.</ref>\n\nThe mercenary trade was a particular form of trade and income: as the Greek and Roman sources attest, from very ancient times the Ligurians served as mercenaries in the armies of the western Mediterranean. The enlistment took place by contingents (obviously not for individual soldiers), as it was essential to have well-functioning units. Centuries of war experiences in the wars between Massaliotes, Etruscans, Carthaginians, Gauls, provided the Ligurians with war skills such as to keep the Roman armies in check for several decades.\n\n=== Piracy ===\nIn ancient times, a side activity to the seafaring was [[piracy]], and the Ligurians were no exception. If they thought it was appropriate, they attacked and plundered ships sailing along the coast. The thing is not surprising: even in ancient times the fastest way to obtain goods is to steal them. After all, the continuous raids of the Ligurian tribes in the territories of the neighbouring peoples are well documented, and constitute an important voice in their economy. The Ingauni, a tribe of sailors located around Albingaunum (nowadays [[Albenga]]) were famous  to engage trade and piracy, hostiles to [[Roman Republic|Rome]]<ref>They were on Carthaginian side during the Second Punic War also.</ref>, they were subdued by [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Lucius Emilius Paullus Macedonicus]] in 181 BC.<ref>\"Ingauni\" on Enciclopedia Treccani\n\nhttp://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ingauni</ref>\n\n=== Under roman service ===\nAfter the Roman conquest, in the 171-168 some of they combated with Romans against Macedons, by the time of Gaius Marius they became commoner in Roman army.\n\nAccording to Plutarch the [[Battle of Pydna]], the decisive battle of [[Third Macedonian War]], started in the afternoon, for an artifice devised by Roman consul L.Emillius Paullus. In order to make the enemies move in battle first, he pushed before a horse without reins the Romans threw him against them, and the pursuit of the horse began the attack. According to another theory instead, the Thracians in Macedon service, attacked some Roman foragers  getting a little too close to enemy lines, and in response there was the immediate charge of 700 Ligurian auxiliares <ref>Plutarch, The Lives of Emilius Paul and Timoleon XVIII </ref>.\n\nBefore [[Battle of Pydna|Pydna]] the Romans used their Ligurian auxiliares with the velites for chasing off the [[Peltast|Macedonian skimishers]] (the peltasts)<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Sallustius]] and Plutarch say that during the [[Jugurthine War]] (from 112 to 105 BC)<ref>Salustio, Giugurtine War (In French) </ref> and the [[Cimbrian War]] (from 104 to 101 BC)<ref>Plutarch, ''Marius'', 20</ref> the Ligurians served as auxiliary troops in the Roman army. In the course of this last conflict they played an important role in the Battle of Aquae Sextae.\n\n''Ligures'' in its broad sense included all the [[Liguria|Ligurian]] peoples of north western Italy, south eastern Gaul and the western Alps, however because Regio Liguria was annexed to [[Roman Italy|Italia]], the inhabitants of this region became [[Roman citizens]], and would have been recruited into the legions. Therefore, the Alpine ''Ligures'', who were ''peregrini'' (non-citizens) i.e. the inhabitants of the Alpes Cottiae and Alpes Maritimae, were recruited like roman auxiliares  in the ''Ligurum'' cohorts\n\n== Religion ==\nAmong the most important testimonies, the sacred mountain sites ([[Mont B\u00e9go|Mont B\u00e8go]], [[Monte Beigua]]) and the development of [[Megalith|megalithicism]] (statues-stelae of Lunigiana) are worth mentioning.\n\nThe spectacular [[Mont B\u00e9go]] in [[Vall\u00e9e des merveilles]] is the most representative site of the numerous sacred sites covered with rock carvings, and in particular with cupels, gullies and ritual basins. The latter would indicate that a fundamental part of the rites of the ancient Ligurians, provided for the use of water (or milk, blood?). The site of  [[Mont B\u00e9go]] has an extension and spectacularity comparable to the sites of [[Val Camonica]]. Another important sacred centre is [[Monte Beigua|Mount Beigua]], but the reality is that many promontories in [[Northwest Italy|North-west Italy]] and the [[Alps]] present these types of sacred centres.\n\nAmong the more considerable Ligurian monuments are rock engravings and anthropomorphic sculptures analogous to those of southern France, found in Lunigiana and Corsica. Some of these artistic manifestations are repeated in territories farther east<ref>Ancient Italic people, The Ligurians, Enciclopedia Britannica\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/ancient-Italic-people/Other-Italic-peoples#ref63581</ref>\n\nThe other important evidence is the proliferation of megalithic events, the most spectacular and original of which is that of the stele statues in the Lunigiana. These particular oblong stones, stuck in the ground of the woods, ended with stylized human heads, and could be equipped with arms, sexual attributes and significant objects (e.g. daggers). Their real meaning has been lost in memory, today it is assumed that they represented:\n\n* gods;\n* ancestors and divinized heroes;\n* the birth from the womb to symbolize the origin of their race originated directly from the womb of the earth and nature.\n\nThe heads, so represented, for the Ligurians were the seat of the soul, the center of emotions and the point of the body where all the senses were concentrated, consequently the essence of the divine and hence its cult.\n[[File:Tipo B, stele di taponecco (licciana) 01.JPG|thumb|[[Statue menhir]] from [[Lunigiana]]]]\nIn general, it is believed that the Ligurian religion was rather primitive, addressed to supernatural tutelary gods, representing the great forces of nature, and from which you could get help and protection through their divination.\n\nThe proliferation of sacred centers near the peaks, would indicate the cult of majestic celestial numes, represented by the high peaks: in fact Beg- (from which Baginus and Baginatie), Penn- (later transformed by Romanization in Iuppiter Poeninus and in the Apenninus pater) and Alb- (from which Albiorix) are indicated as tutelary numes of the Ligurian peaks.\n\nNumbers such as Belenus and [[Borvo]], linked to the cult of water, and the cult of Matronae (hence the sanctuary of Mons Matrona, now [[Montgen\u00e8vre]]) are also mentioned.\n\nAmong the many engravings, significant is the presence of the figure of the bull, even if only stylized through the symbol of the horns, this would indicate the cult of a deity taurine, male and fertilizer, already known to Anatolian and Semitic cultures.\n\nAnother important deity was Cicnu (the [[swan]]), which perhaps represents the divinization of a mythical ancient king or, as for many northern cultures, the totemic animal associated with the cult of the sun.\n\nThanks to the long contact with the Celtic populations, probably the Ligurians acquired beliefs and myths coming from that world. Surely, starting from the seventh century BC, the funerary outfits are similar to those found in populations of Celtic culture.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Ligurian economy was based on primitive agriculture, sheep farming, hunting and the exploitation of forests. Diodorus Siculus writes about the Ligurians:\n\n\"''Since their country is mountainous and full of trees, some of them use all day to cut wood, using strong and heavy dark; others, who want to cultivate the land, must deal with breaking stones, because it is so dry soil that you can not pick tools remove a sod, that with it do not rise stones. However, even if they have to fight with so many misfortunes, by means of stubborn work they go beyond nature [...] they often give themselves to hunting, and finding quantities of savage, with it they make up for the lack of bladders; and so it comes, that flowing through their snow-covered mountains, and getting used to practicing then more difficult places of the thickets, they harden their bodies, and strengthen their muscles admirably. Some of them, due to the famine of food, drink water, and live of meat of domestic and wild animals.''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">(Diodorus Siculus, in Luca Ponte, Le genovesi)</ref>\n\nThanks to the contact with the bronze \"metal seekers\", the Ligurians also dedicated themselves to the extraction of minerals<ref>Examples of mining activities are witnessed in the Labiola mine.</ref> and metallurgy, even if most of the metal in circulation is of central European origin.\n\nThe commercial activity is important. Already in ancient times the Ligurians were known in the Mediterranean for the trade of the precious Baltic amber. With the development of the Celtic populations, the Ligurians found themselves controlling a crucial access to the sea, becoming (sometimes in spite of themselves) custodians of an important way of communication.\n\nAlthough they were not renowned navigators, they came to have a small maritime fleet, and their attitude to navigation is described as follows:\n\n''\"They sail for reason of shops on the sea of Sardinia and Libya, spontaneously exposing themselves to extreme dangers; they use smaller hulls than vulgar boats for this; nor are they practical of the comfort of other ships; and what is surprising is that they are not afraid to sustain the serious risks of storms''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Tribes==\n{{main|List of ancient Ligurian tribes}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ancient Ligurian tribes]]\n*[[Ancient peoples of Italy]]\n*[[Mont B\u00e9go|Mont B\u00e8go]]\n*[[Golasecca culture|Golasecca Culture]]\n*[[Cisalpine Gaul]]\n*[[Torrean civilization]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons category}}\n*ARSLAN E.

Later, in late times, they too began to use this term to differentiate themselves from other ethnic groups.\n\nOne opinion, it is that originally the Ligurians did not have a term to define their entire ethnicity, but only had names by which they defined themselves as members of a particular tribe. Only when they had to deal with united and organized peoples (Greeks, Etruscans, Romans) and had to federate to defend themselves would they have felt the need to recognize themselves ethnically through a single term.\n\n== Controversy and geographical area of ancient Liguria ==\n{{article d\u00e9taill\u00e9|Roman Italy}}\n[[File:Regio IX Liguria.jpg|thumb|Roman Liguria between the [[Po (river)|Po]], [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra (river)|Magra]] rivers.

The connection between Massalia and the Phoceans is mentioned in [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War|Peloponnesian War]]'';{{sfn|Duch\u00eane|Contrucci|1998|p=42}} he notes that the Phocaean project was opposed by the [[Carthaginians]], whose fleet was defeated.<ref>{{Thucydides|en|1|13|6|ref}}</ref> \n\nThe founding of Massalia has also been recorded as a legend. According to the legend, Protis, or Euxenes, a native of Phocae, while exploring for a new trading outpost or ''emporion'' to make his fortune, discovered the Mediterranean [[cove]] of the Lacydon, fed by a freshwater stream and protected by two rocky promontories.<ref>Duboi, Marius; Gaffarel, Paul; Samat, J.-B. (1913). ''Histoire de Marseille'' (in French). Marseille: Librairie P. Ruat.</ref> Protis was invited inland to a banquet held by Nannu, the chief of the local ligurian tribe of Segobrigi, for suitors seeking the hand of his daughter Gyptis in marriage. At the end of the banquet, Gyptis presented the ceremonial cup of wine to Protis, indicating her unequivocal choice. Following their marriage, they moved to the hill just to the north of the Lacydon; and from this settlement grew Massalia.<ref>Duboi, Marius; Gaffarel, Paul; Samat, J.-B. (1913). ''Histoire de Marseille'' (in French). Marseille: Librairie P. Ruat.</ref> [[Graham Robb|Robb]] gives greater weight to the Gyptis story, though he notes that the tradition was to offer water, not wine, to signal the choice of a marriage partner.<ref>Robb, Graham, ''The Discovery of Middle Earth'', p. 6</ref> Later, the natives would treacherously lay a plot to destroy the new colony, but the scheme was divulged and Conran, king of the natives, was killed in the ensuing battle.<ref>Duboi, Marius; Gaffarel, Paul; Samat, J.-B. (1913). ''Histoire de Marseille'' (in French). Marseille: Librairie P. Ruat.</ref> Probably the Greeks expressed the intention to expand the territory of the colony, and this is why Conran ( the son of Nannu),tried to destroy it. However, the resistance of the Ligurians had the effect of reducing the Greek claims, which renounced territorial expansion. The massaliotes ended up concentrating on the development of trade, first with the Ligurians, and then with the Gauls, until Massalia became the most important port in [[Gaul]].\n\n=== The arrival and the fusion with the Celts  ===\n[[File:Salyens villes map-fr.svg|thumb|239x239px|Tribal groups of ancient Provence and their settlements|alt=]]\nBetween the 8th and 5th centuries BC, tribes of Celtic peoples, probably coming from Central Europe, also began moving into Provence. They had weapons made of iron, which allowed them to easily defeat the local tribes, who were still armed with bronze weapons.\n\nLigurians and new-arrivals Celts spread throughout the area, sharing the territory of modern [[Provence]], [[Celts]] and Ligurians later started to inter-mixing between each other and form a Celto-Ligurian culture, with many tribes. Each tribe in its own alpine valley or settlement along a river, each with its own king and dynasty. Of these numerous Celto-Ligurian tribes, the Salluvi settled north of Massalia, in the area of Aix-en-Provence while Caturiges, Tricastins, and Cavares settled to the west of the [[Durance]] river.<ref>J. R. Palanque, ''Ligures, Celts et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34</ref> They built hilltop forts and settlements, later given the Latin name ''oppida''. Today the traces 165 ''[[Oppidum|oppida]]'' are found in the [[Var (department)|Var]], and as many as 285 in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]].<ref>J. R. Palanque, ''Ligures, Celts et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34.</ref>\n\nThey worshipped various aspects of nature, establishing sacred woods at Sainte-Baume and Gemenos, and healing springs at Glanum and Vern\u00e8gues. Later, in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the different tribes formed confederations; the Voconces in the area from the [[Is\u00e8re]] to the [[Vaucluse]]; the Cavares in the Comtat; and the Salyens, from the [[Rh\u00f4ne]] river to the Var. The tribes began to trade their local products, iron, silver, alabaster, marble, gold, resin, wax, honey and cheese; with their neighbours, first by trading routes along the Rh\u00f4ne river, and later [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] traders visited the coast. Etruscan [[amphorae]] from the 7th and 6th centuries BC have been found in Marseille, Cassis, and in hilltop oppida in the region.<ref>J. R. Palanque, ''Ligures, Celts et Grecs'', in ''Histoire de la Provence''. Pg. 34.</ref>\n\n=== The Corsi ===\n{{Main|Corsi people}}\n[[File:Corsica-Romana.jpg|thumb|Simplified map of the ancient tribes of Corsica ]]Corsi were an ancient people of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], to which they gave the name. They dwelt at the extreme north-east of Sardinia, in the region today known as [[Gallura]], <ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/3/3*.html Ptolemy's Geography online]</ref>\n\nAccording to historian [[Ettore Pais]] and archeologist Giovanni Ugas, the Corsi probably belonged to the [[Ligures|Ligurian]] people.<ref>[http://eprints.uniss.it/6480/1/Mastino_A_Corsica_e_Sardegna_in_et%C3%A0_antica.pdf Mastino, Attilio(2006) Corsica e Sardegna in et\u00e0 antica]{{in lang|it}}</ref>{{sfn|Ugas|2005|p=13-19}} Similar was also the opinion of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], who claimed that the ''Corsi'' from Corsica, where he had then been staying in exile, were of mixed origin, resulting from the continuous mingling of various ethnic groups of foreign origin, like the Ligures, the [[Greeks]] and the [[Iberians]].<ref>\"Haec ipsa insula saepe iam cultores mutauit.

The Greeks called the island first Kalliste and then Cyrnos, Cernealis, Corsis and Cirn\u00e9.\n\nIn 535 B.C., following the [[Battle of Alalia|Battle Alalia]], they were defeated by an Etruscan-Carthaginian coalition formed on a pact specifically stipulated and that, after the conflict, in case of victory, provided for the division of the two islands on which the influence had been conquered: Sardinia to the Carthaginians, Corsica to the Etruscans. In reality, according to [[Herodotus]], the Focei had won, but it would have been a [[pyrrhic victory]], given that of the 60 ships employed (half of the total armoury of the opposing fleets) 40 were sunk and the remaining rendered useless. The Massaliotes then left Corsica and the Carthaginians and Etruscans were able to give substance equally to the pact of partition. The Etruscans regained control over the eastern shores of the island, which they had already consolidated with the activity of the war marinas of Pisa, [[Volterra]], [[Populonia]], [[Tarquinia]] and Cere.\n\n=== Between Celts and Etruscans ===\n\n==== The Celto-Ligurian fusion in Western Alps and Po Valley ====\n{{see also||Canegrate culture|Golasecca culture}}\nStarting from the 12th century B.C., from the union of the previous [[Polada culture|cultures of Polada]] and [[Canegrate culture|Canegrate]], that is from the union of pre-existing Ligurian populations with the arrival of Celtic populations, at the same time as the birth of the [[Hallstatt culture]] in central Europe and the [[Villanovan culture|Villanova culture]] in central Italy, a new civilization developed that archaeologists call Golasecca from the name of the place where the first discoveries were found.\n\nThe People of Golasecca Culture inhabited a territory of about 20,000 km\u00b2, from the Alpine watershed to the Po, from Valsesia to the Serio, gravitating around three main centers: the area of Sesto Calende, Bellinzona, but especially the protourban center of Como.\n\nWith the arrival of Gallic populations from beyond the Alps, in the 4th century B.C. this Celtic-Ligurian civilization declined and came to an end.\n\nThe Etruscan expansion in the plain of the Po and the invasion of the Gauls confined the Ligurians between the Alps and the Apennines, where they offered such resistance to Roman penetration that they gained a reputation with the ancients for primitive fierceness.\n\n====== The Cultures of Canagrate, Polada and Golasecca ======\n[[File:Cultura di Canegrate map.svg|left|thumb|Areal of diffusion of Canagrate Culture]]\nThe [[Canegrate culture]] (13th century BC) may represent the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic<ref>Venceslas Kruta: ''La grande storia dei celti.

It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle [[Bronze Age]] (16th-15th century BC), when North Western Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artifacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the [[Tumulus culture]] ([[Central Europe]], 1600 BC - 1200 BC).<ref name=\":2\">\"The Golasecca civilization is therefore the expression of the oldest [[Celts]] of Italy and included several groups that had the name of Insubres, Laevi, Lepontii, Oromobii (o Orumbovii)\".

They coincide, in a significant way, with the territories occupied by those tribal groups whose names are reported by Latin and Greek historians and geographers<ref name=\":2\" />:\n\n*'''[[Insubres|Insubri]]''': in the area south of Lake Maggiore, in Varese and part of Novara with Golasecca, Sesto Calende, Castelletto sopra Ticino; from the fifth century BC this area remains suddenly depopulated, while the first settlement of Mediolanum (Milan) rises.\n*'''[[Lepontii|Leponti]]''': in the [[Canton of Ticino]], with Bellinzona and Sopra Ceneri; in the Ossola.\n*'''[[Orobii|Orobi]]''': in the area of Como and Bergamo.\n*'''[[Laevi]]''' and '''[[Marici (Ligures)|Marici]]''': in Lomellina (Pavia/Ticinum).\n\nThe Celts have not imposed themselves on the existing tribes, but have mixed with them. When the Etruscans and Romans arrived, north-west Italy was inhabited by a complex network of Celtic-Ligurian populations with some geographical differences: in general, to the north of the Po (named ''Gallia Transpadana'' later by Romans '')'', Celtic culture prevailed decisively, while to the south (''Gallia Cispadana'' named later'')'' the Ligurian imprint continued to leave important traces. \n\nLooking at North-Western Italy up to the Po river, while in modern Lombardy and eastern Piedmont the Golasecca culture emerged, in the westernmost part there are 2 principal tribal groups: the [[Taurini]] in the area of Turin and the [[Salassi]] in modern [[Ivrea]] and the [[Aosta Valley]].\n\n==== The Etruscan expansion and foundation of Genua ====\n[[File:Etruscan civilization map.png|thumb|Etruscan expansion in the south Po Valley, and in Corsica |alt=|left]]\nLigurian sepulchres of the Italian Riviera and of Provence, holding cremations, exhibit Etruscan and Celtic influences.<ref>Ancient Italic people, The Ligurians, Enciclopedia Britannica\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/ancient-Italic-people/Other-Italic-peoples#ref63581</ref>\n\nIn the seventh century BC, in addition to the Greeks, the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] also began to push in the northern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], until what is now call the [[Ligurian Sea]].\n\nAlthough they had intense commercial exchanges, they were competitors of the Greeks, with whom they often clashed. From 540 B.C. about the Etruscan presence in the Po Valley experienced a renewed expansion in the scenario following the Battle of Alalia resulted in a progressive limitation of Etruscan movements in the Upper Tyrrhenian Sea.<ref>La Battaglia del mare Sardo (540 a.C.) Archiviato il 26 febbraio 2013 in Internet Archive..</ref> The expansion to the north of the Apennines is characterized by that moment as aimed at identifying and controlling new trade routes\n\nTheir expansionist policy was different from that of the Greeks: their expansion was mainly by land, trying gradually to occupy the areas bordering them. Even though they were good sailors, they did not found far away colonies, but at the very least emporiums destined to support trade with the local populations. This created an ambivalence in the relations with the Ligurians; on the one hand they were excellent commercial partners for all the coastal emporiums, on the other hand, their expansionist policy led them to press on the Ligurian populations settled north of the Arno river, making them retreat into the mountain areas of the [[North Pennines|northern Apennines]].\n\nEven in this case, the Ligurian opposition prevented the Etruscans from going further; indeed, although traditionally the border between the Ligurian and Etruscan areas is considered the Magra river, it is testified that the Etruscan settlements north of the Arno (for example [[Pisa]]) were periodically attacked and plundered by the Ligurian tribes of the mountains.\n\nAs already mentioned, hostility to the borders did not prevent an intense commercial relationship, as evidenced by the large quantity of Etruscan ceramics found in the Ligurian sites. Of this period is the foundation of the oppida of Genua (nowadays [[Genoa]], about 500 BC), the urban core of the \"Castello\" (perhaps an ancient Ligurian oppidum) began<ref>Marco Milanese, ''Scavi nell'oppidum preromano di Genova'', L'Erma di Bretschneider, Roma 1987 testo on-line su GoogleBooks; Piera Melli , ''Una citt\u00e0 portuale del Mediterraneo tra il VII e il III secolo a.C.\", Genova, Fratelli Frilli ed., 2007.''</ref>, for flourishing trade, to expand towards today's Pr\u00e8 (the area of meadows) and the Rivo Torbido. Some scholars believe that Genoa was an Etruscan emporium, and that only later, the local Ligurian tribe took control (or merged with the Etruscans).<ref>Piera Melli , Una citt\u00e0 portuale del Mediterraneo tra il VII e il III secolo a.C.\", Genoa, Fratelli Frilli ed., 2007 (on-line text of the first chapter Archived on 28 February 2009 in the Internet Archive.). A marble funerary stele dedicated to Apollonia, found reused in the walls of the twelfth century was considered a proof of the Greek origin of the city: the stele, a work of the first half of the third century BC, must be considered rather arrived in Genoa along with many ancient artifacts in the Middle Ages.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the fifth century BC, the Etruscan power began to decline: attacked in the north by the Gauls, south by the Greeks and with the revolts of controlled cities (e.g. Rome), the Etruscan presence among the Ligurians came less and less, intensifying massilian and gallic influence\n\nFrom that moment on, Genoa, inhabited by the Ligurian Genuati, was considered by the Greeks, given its strong commercial character, \"the emporium of the Ligurians\": wood for shipbuilding, livestock, leather, honey, textiles were some of the Ligurian products of commercial exchange.\n\n=== First contacts with Romans ===\nIn the third century B.C., the Romans, having been right of the Etruscans and integrated their territories, found themselves in direct contact with the Ligurians. However, Roman expansionism was directed towards the rich territories of [[Gaul]] and the Iberian Peninsula (then under [[Carthaginian Iberia|Carthaginian control]]), and the territory of the Ligurians was on the road (they controlled the Ligurian coasts and the South-western Alps). \n\nAt the beginning the Romans had a rather condescending attitude: the Ligurian territory was considered poor, while the fame of its warriors was known (they had already met them as mercenaries), finally they were already engaged in the [[First Punic War]] and were not willing to open new fronts, so they tried first of all to make them allies. However, despite their efforts, only a few Ligurian tribes made alliance agreements with the Romans (the alliance with the Genuates is famous), the rest immediately proved hostile.\n\nThe hostilities were opened in 238 BC by a coalition of Ligurians and Gauls Boi, but the two peoples soon found themselves in disagreement and the military campaign came to a halt with the dissolution of the alliance. Meanwhile, a Roman fleet commanded by Quintus Fabius Maximus routed Ligurian ships on the coast (234-233 BC), allowing the Romans to control the coastal route to and from Gaul.\n\nIn in 222 B.C. the Insubres, during a war with Romans occupied the oppidum of Clastidium, that at that time, it was an important locality of the Anamari (or [[Marici (Ligures)|Marici]]), a Ligurian tibe that, probably for fear of the nearby warlike Insubres, had already accepted the alliance with Rome the year before. \n\nFor the first time the Roman army go beyond the Po, spreading Gallia Transpadana: the [[battle of Clastidium]], in 222 B.C., earned Rome the taking of the capital of the Insubres: Mediolanum (Milan). To consolidate its dominion, Rome created the colonies of Placentia, in the territory of the Boii, and [[Cremona]] in that of the Insubri.<ref>Demandt, p. 86</ref>\n\n=== Second Punic War ===\nWith the outbreak of the second Punic war (218 B.C.) the Ligurian tribes had different attitudes:\n\n* a part (the tribes of the [[Italian Riviera|west Riviera]] and the [[Apuani]]) allied with the Carthaginians, providing soldiers to Hannibal's troops when he arrived in Northern Italy (they hoped that the Carthaginian general would free them from the Roman neighbor);\n* another part (Genuates, [[Bagienni]] and the Taurini) took sides in support of the Romans.\n\nThe pro-carthage Ligurians took part in the [[Battle of the Trebia]], in which the Carthaginians won. Other Ligurians enlisted in the army of [[Hasdrubal Barca]], when he came down to Cisalpine Gaul (207 BC), in an attempt to rejoin the troops of his brother Hannibal. In the port of Savo (the present [[Savona]]), then capital of the Ligures Sabazi, the trireme ships of the Carthaginian fleet of General [[Mago Barca]], brother of Hannibal, destined to cut the Roman trade routes in the Tyrrhenian Sea, found shelter.\n\nTo the pro-Roman Ligurians, at the beginning it did not go as well. Taurini were on the road of [[Hannibal]] to enter in Italy and in 218 BC, they were attacked by him, who had allied with their long-standing enemies: the [[Insubres]]. The Taurini chief town (''Taurasia,'' now Turin), was captured by Hannibal's forces after a three-day siege.<ref>[[Polybius]] iii. 60, 8</ref>\n\nIn 205 BC, Genua was attacked and razed to the ground by Mago.<ref>Titus Livius, ''Ab Urbe Condita libri CXLII'' 21, 32,1 and 28, 46,7.</ref>\n\nWith the reversal of the fate of the Second Punic War, Mago (203 BC) is among the Ingauni, trying to block the Roman advance: suffered a serious defeat that cost him his life, in the same year was rebuilt Genua.

Ligurians and [[Boii]] sacked and destroyed the Roman colony of [[Piacenza|Placentia]], effectively controlling the most important ford of the Po Valley.<ref>In 200 the Gauls and Ligurians combined forces and sacked the Latin colony of Placentia in an attempt to drive the Romans out of their lands\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome/Roman-expansion-in-the-western-Mediterranean#ref298396</ref>\n\nDuring the same period the Romans were at war with the Apuani. The serious effort began in 182, when both consular armies and a proconsular army were sent against the Ligurians. The wars continued into the 150s, when victorious generals celebrated two triumphs over the Ligurians. Here also the Romans drove many natives off their land and settled colonies in their stead (''e.g.'', Luna and Luca in the 170s).<ref>During the same period the Romans were at war with the Ligurian tribes of the northern Apennines.

Ligurian tribes, Gauls and skidding Carthaginian troops, starting from the mountain territories, continued to fight with guerrilla tactics. Thus the Romans were forced into continuous military operations in northern Italy.\n\nIn 201 BC the Ingauni were forced to surrender.\n\nOnly in 197 B.C. the Romans, under the leadership of Minucius Rufus, succeeded in regaining control of the Placentia area by subduing the Celelates, the Cerdicates, the Ilvati and the Boi Gauls and occupying the oppida of Clastidium. \n\nGenua was rebuilt by the proconsul [[Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus|Spurius Lucretius]] and in 197 BC. Defeated Carthage, Rome aimed to expand northwards, and used Genua as a support base for raids, between 191 and 154 BC, against the Ligurian tribes of the hinterland, allied for decades with Carthage. \n\nA second phase of the conflict followed (197-155 B.C.), characterized by the fact that the Apuani Ligurians entrenched themselves on the Apennines, from where they periodically descended to plunder the surrounding territories. The Romans, for their part, organized continuous expeditions to the mountains, hoping to snide, surround and defeat the Ligurians (taking care not to be destroyed by ambushes). Throughout the war the Romans boasted 15 triumphs and at least one serious defeat.\n\nHistorically, the beginning of the campaign dates back to 193 BC on the initiative of the Ligurian conciliabula (federations), who organized a major raid going as far as the right bank of the river Arno. Roman campaigns followed (191, 188 and 187 B.C.), victorious but not decisive.\n\nWith the campaign of 186 B.C., the Romans were beaten by the Ligurians in the Magra valley. In the battle, which took place in a narrow and precipitous place, the Romans lost about 4000 soldiers, three eagle insignia of the second legion and eleven banners of the Latin allies. In addition, the consul Quintus Martius was also killed in the battle. It is thought that the place of the battle and the death of the consul gave rise to the place-name of Marciaso or that of the Canal of March on Mount Caprione in the town of Lerici and near the ruins of the city of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]], which was later founded by the Romans. This mountain had a strategic importance because it controlled the valley of Magra and the sea.\n\nIn 185 B.C., the Ingauni and the Intimeli also rebelled and managed to resist the Roman legions until 180 B.C. The Apuani, and those of hinterland side still resisted.\n\nWanting to \"dispose\" of Liguria for their next conquest of Gaul, however, the Romans prepared a large army of almost 36,000 soldiers, under the orders of the Roman proconsuls [[Publius Cornelius Cethegus (consul 181 BC)|Publius Cornelius Cethegus]] and [[Marcus Baebius Tamphilus]], with the aim of putting an end to Ligurian independence.\n\nIn 180 B.C. the Romans inflicted a very serious defeat on the Apuani Ligures, and deported 40,000 of them to the regions of [[Samnium]]. This deportation was followed by another one of 7,000 Ligurians in the following year. These were one of the few cases in which the Romans [[Deportation|deported]] defeated populations in such a high number. In 177 B.C. other groups of Liguri Apuani surrendered to the Roman forces, and eventually assimilated into Roman culture during the 2nd century BC<ref>{{cite thesis|first=William|last=Broadhead|year=2002|type=Ph.D.|title=Internal migration and the transformation of Republican Italy|institution=University College London|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1317574/1/251994.pdf|page=15}}</ref>, while the military campaign continued further north.\n\nThe surviving Ligurian tribes, now isolated and in absolute inferiority, continued to fight.\n\nIn succession: Frinatiates (175 B.C.), [[Statielli]] (172 B.C.), and the Velleiates (158 B.C.), had to surrender. The last Apuani resistance was won only in 155 B.C. by the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus.\n\n=== Subjugation of \"transalpine\" and \"Capillati\" Ligures ===\nThe subjugation of the coastal Ligures and the annexation of the Alpes Maritimae took place in 14 BC, closely following the occupation of the central Alps in 15 BC.<ref>Dio LIV.22.3-4</ref>\n\nThe last Ligurian tribes (e.g. Vocontii and Salluvi) still autonomous, who occupied Provence, were subdued in 124 BC.<ref>Plinius the elder, ''Naturalis Historia'', III, 47.</ref>\n\n=== Under Roman rule ===\n==== The Roman province of Cisalpine Gaul ====\nThe Cisalpine Gaul was the part of modern Italy inhabited by [[Celts]] during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.

Rare were the [[Oppidum|oppidas]], to which corresponded the federal capitals of the individual tribes or important commercial emporiums.\n\nThe territory of a tribe was almost entirely public property, only a small percentage of the land (the cultivated) was \"private\", in the sense that, against payment of a small tax, was given in concession. Only late in life did the concept of private, heritable or marketable property develop.\n\nReflecting the decentralized character of the ethnic group, the Ligurians did not have a centralized political structure. Each tribe decided for itself, even in contrast with the other tribes; as evidence of this, are the opposing alliances that over time Ligurian tribes made against Greeks, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and Romans.\n\nWithin the tribes, an egalitarian and communal spirit prevails. If there is also a noble class, this is tempered by \"tribal rallies\" in which all the classes participate; there does not seem to be any pre-organized magistracy. There were no dynastic leaders either: the Ligurian \"[[king]]\" was elected as leader of a tribe or a federation of tribes; only in late period did a real dynastic aristocratic class begin to emerge.

Statue de guerrier.jpg|thumb|Seated warrior from [[Roquepertuse]]|alt=]]\n\n=== Mercenaries ===\nThe Ligures seem to have been ready to engage as mercenary troops in the service of others. Ligurian auxiliaries are mentioned in the army of the Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar I of Carthage|Hamilcar I]] in 480 BC.<ref>Herodotus 7.165; Diodorus Siculus 11.1.</ref> Greek leaders in Sicily continued to recruit Ligurian mercenary forces from the same quarter as late as the time of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]].<ref name=\"dictionary\" /><ref>Diodorus Siculus 21.3.</ref>\n\nThe mercenary trade was a particular form of trade and income: as the Greek and Roman sources attest, from very ancient times the Ligurians served as mercenaries in the armies of the western Mediterranean. The enlistment took place by contingents (obviously not for individual soldiers), as it was essential to have well-functioning units. Centuries of war experiences in the wars between Massaliotes, Etruscans, Carthaginians, Gauls, provided the Ligurians with war skills such as to keep the Roman armies in check for several decades.\n\n=== Piracy ===\nIn ancient times, a side activity to the seafaring was [[piracy]], and the Ligurians were no exception. If they thought it was appropriate, they attacked and plundered ships sailing along the coast. The thing is not surprising: even in ancient times the fastest way to obtain goods is to steal them. After all, the continuous raids of the Ligurian tribes in the territories of the neighbouring peoples are well documented, and constitute an important voice in their economy. The Ingauni, a tribe of sailors located around Albingaunum (nowadays [[Albenga]]) were famous  to engage trade and piracy, hostiles to [[Roman Republic|Rome]]<ref>They were on Carthaginian side during the Second Punic War also.</ref>, they were subdued by [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Lucius Emilius Paullus Macedonicus]] in 181 BC.<ref>\"Ingauni\" on Enciclopedia Treccani\n\nhttp://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ingauni</ref>\n\n=== Under roman service ===\nAfter the Roman conquest, in the 171-168 some of they combated with Romans against Macedons, by the time of Gaius Marius they became commoner in Roman army.\n\nAccording to Plutarch the [[Battle of Pydna]], the decisive battle of [[Third Macedonian War]], started in the afternoon, for an artifice devised by Roman consul L.Emillius Paullus. In order to make the enemies move in battle first, he pushed before a horse without reins the Romans threw him against them, and the pursuit of the horse began the attack. According to another theory instead, the Thracians in Macedon service, attacked some Roman foragers  getting a little too close to enemy lines, and in response there was the immediate charge of 700 Ligurian auxiliares <ref>Plutarch, The Lives of Emilius Paul and Timoleon XVIII </ref>.\n\nBefore [[Battle of Pydna|Pydna]] the Romans used their Ligurian auxiliares with the velites for chasing off the [[Peltast|Macedonian skimishers]] (the peltasts)<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Sallustius]] and Plutarch say that during the [[Jugurthine War]] (from 112 to 105 BC)<ref>Salustio, Giugurtine War (In French) </ref> and the [[Cimbrian War]] (from 104 to 101 BC)<ref>Plutarch, ''Marius'', 20</ref> the Ligurians served as auxiliary troops in the Roman army. In the course of this last conflict they played an important role in the Battle of Aquae Sextae.\n\n''Ligures'' in its broad sense included all the [[Liguria|Ligurian]] peoples of north western Italy, south eastern Gaul and the western Alps, however because Regio Liguria was annexed to [[Roman Italy|Italia]], the inhabitants of this region became [[Roman citizens]], and would have been recruited into the legions. Therefore, the Alpine ''Ligures'', who were ''peregrini'' (non-citizens) i.e. the inhabitants of the Alpes Cottiae and Alpes Maritimae, were recruited like roman auxiliares  in the ''Ligurum'' cohorts\n\n== Religion ==\nAmong the most important testimonies, the sacred mountain sites ([[Mont B\u00e9go|Mont B\u00e8go]], [[Monte Beigua]]) and the development of [[Megalith|megalithicism]] (statues-stelae of Lunigiana) are worth mentioning.\n\nThe spectacular [[Mont B\u00e9go]] in [[Vall\u00e9e des merveilles]] is the most representative site of the numerous sacred sites covered with rock carvings, and in particular with cupels, gullies and ritual basins. The latter would indicate that a fundamental part of the rites of the ancient Ligurians, provided for the use of water (or milk, blood?). The site of  [[Mont B\u00e9go]] has an extension and spectacularity comparable to the sites of [[Val Camonica]]. Another important sacred centre is [[Monte Beigua|Mount Beigua]], but the reality is that many promontories in [[Northwest Italy|North-west Italy]] and the [[Alps]] present these types of sacred centres.\n\nAmong the more considerable Ligurian monuments are rock engravings and anthropomorphic sculptures analogous to those of southern France, found in Lunigiana and Corsica. Some of these artistic manifestations are repeated in territories farther east<ref>Ancient Italic people, The Ligurians, Enciclopedia Britannica\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/ancient-Italic-people/Other-Italic-peoples#ref63581</ref>\n\nThe other important evidence is the proliferation of megalithic events, the most spectacular and original of which is that of the stele statues in the Lunigiana. These particular oblong stones, stuck in the ground of the woods, ended with stylized human heads, and could be equipped with arms, sexual attributes and significant objects (e.g. daggers). Their real meaning has been lost in memory, today it is assumed that they represented:\n\n* gods;\n* ancestors and divinized heroes;\n* the birth from the womb to symbolize the origin of their race originated directly from the womb of the earth and nature.\n\nThe heads, so represented, for the Ligurians were the seat of the soul, the center of emotions and the point of the body where all the senses were concentrated, consequently the essence of the divine and hence its cult.\n[[File:Tipo B, stele di taponecco (licciana) 01.JPG|thumb|[[Statue menhir]] from [[Lunigiana]]]]\nIn general, it is believed that the Ligurian religion was rather primitive, addressed to supernatural tutelary gods, representing the great forces of nature, and from which you could get help and protection through their divination.\n\nThe proliferation of sacred centers near the peaks, would indicate the cult of majestic celestial numes, represented by the high peaks: in fact Beg- (from which Baginus and Baginatie), Penn- (later transformed by Romanization in Iuppiter Poeninus and in the Apenninus pater) and Alb- (from which Albiorix) are indicated as tutelary numes of the Ligurian peaks.\n\nNumbers such as Belenus and [[Borvo]], linked to the cult of water, and the cult of Matronae (hence the sanctuary of Mons Matrona, now [[Montgen\u00e8vre]]) are also mentioned.\n\nAmong the many engravings, significant is the presence of the figure of the bull, even if only stylized through the symbol of the horns, this would indicate the cult of a deity taurine, male and fertilizer, already known to Anatolian and Semitic cultures.\n\nAnother important deity was Cicnu (the [[swan]]), which perhaps represents the divinization of a mythical ancient king or, as for many northern cultures, the totemic animal associated with the cult of the sun.\n\nThanks to the long contact with the Celtic populations, probably the Ligurians acquired beliefs and myths coming from that world. Surely, starting from the seventh century BC, the funerary outfits are similar to those found in populations of Celtic culture.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Ligurian economy was based on primitive agriculture, sheep farming, hunting and the exploitation of forests. Diodorus Siculus writes about the Ligurians:\n\n\"''Since their country is mountainous and full of trees, some of them use all day to cut wood, using strong and heavy dark; others, who want to cultivate the land, must deal with breaking stones, because it is so dry soil that you can not pick tools remove a sod, that with it do not rise stones. However, even if they have to fight with so many misfortunes, by means of stubborn work they go beyond nature [...] they often give themselves to hunting, and finding quantities of savage, with it they make up for the lack of bladders; and so it comes, that flowing through their snow-covered mountains, and getting used to practicing then more difficult places of the thickets, they harden their bodies, and strengthen their muscles admirably. Some of them, due to the famine of food, drink water, and live of meat of domestic and wild animals.''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">(Diodorus Siculus, in Luca Ponte, Le genovesi)</ref>\n\nThanks to the contact with the bronze \"metal seekers\", the Ligurians also dedicated themselves to the extraction of minerals<ref>Examples of mining activities are witnessed in the Labiola mine.</ref> and metallurgy, even if most of the metal in circulation is of central European origin.\n\nThe commercial activity is important. Already in ancient times the Ligurians were known in the Mediterranean for the trade of the precious Baltic amber. With the development of the Celtic populations, the Ligurians found themselves controlling a crucial access to the sea, becoming (sometimes in spite of themselves) custodians of an important way of communication.\n\nAlthough they were not renowned navigators, they came to have a small maritime fleet, and their attitude to navigation is described as follows:\n\n''\"They sail for reason of shops on the sea of Sardinia and Libya, spontaneously exposing themselves to extreme dangers; they use smaller hulls than vulgar boats for this; nor are they practical of the comfort of other ships; and what is surprising is that they are not afraid to sustain the serious risks of storms''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Tribes==\n{{main|List of ancient Ligurian tribes}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ancient Ligurian tribes]]\n*[[Ancient peoples of Italy]]\n*[[Mont B\u00e9go|Mont B\u00e8go]]\n*[[Golasecca culture|Golasecca Culture]]\n*[[Cisalpine Gaul]]\n*[[Torrean civilization]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons category}}\n*ARSLAN E.
