{"title_page": "John Stinton", "text_new": "[[Image:John Stinton (jnr)00.jpg|thumb|''\"Highland cattle in a stream\"'']]\n'''John Stinton (jnr)''' (1854\u20131956) was a British \u2018[[Royal Worcester]]\u2019 painter best known for his \u2018Highland Cattle\u2019 scenes.\n\nJohn Stinton (jnr) was one of a long line of the Stinton family who painted for the [[Worcester]] firm for some 160 years. The family tradition started with Henry Stinton who was employed from 1805 at the Grainger family's factory at St.Martins Gate in [[Worcester]] and would later become part of the \u2018Royal Worcester\u2019 group. John Stinton (snr) born in 1829, was Henry Stinton's son and started his apprenticeship at the Grainger factory when eleven years old, remaining there until his retirement in 1895. John (snr) was an accomplished artist and soon became a respected member of the Grainger staff. He discovered that [[oil of cloves]] would prevent his paints from drying out too quickly. John (snr)produced five sons, three following in their father's footsteps and becoming painters at the Worcester factories.\n\nJohn Stinton was the eldest son, but did not take up [[china painting]] until the rather late age of thirty five. Besides Highland cattle, he depicted English cattle and produced many fine images of British castles on his plates and a large number of watercolour landscapes. He was an enthusiastic gardener, and built a heated greenhouse where he grew the tobacco for his constant pipe-smoking.\n\nFour of John Stinton (jnr)'s children followed him into ceramic painting: '''Arthur Stinton''', eldest son and born in 1878, joined the Grainger factory shortly after its amalgamation with Royal Worcester and then went on to the Locke factory where his uncle Walter was employed as a flower painter. '''Annie Stinton''', born in 1882, also joined the Grainger factory and went on to the Royal Worcester works. '''Kate Stinton''' also born in 1882 worked at the Royal Worcester factory. '''Harry Stinton''' born in 1883 also painted Highland cattle scenes. He was a sickly child but grew to be a respected figure after joining the firm in 1896.<ref>[http://www.antique-marks.com/royal-worcester-stinton.html The Royal Worcester Stinton Artists] (antique-marks.com).</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stinton (jnr), John}}\n[[Category:1854 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century English painters]]\n[[Category:English male painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century English painters]]\n[[Category:Porcelain painters]]\n[[Category:Landscape artists]]\n[[Category:Animal artists]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:John Stinton (jnr)00.jpg|thumb|''\"Highland cattle in a stream\"'']]\n'''John Stinton (jnr)''' (1854\u20131956) was a British \u2018[[Royal Worcester]]\u2019 painter best known for his \u2018Highland Cattle\u2019 scenes.\n\nJohn Stinton (jnr) was one of a long line of the Stinton family who painted for the [[Worcester]] firm for some 160 years.
