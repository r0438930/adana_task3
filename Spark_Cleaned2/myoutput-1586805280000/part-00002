During prewar and early war field exercises, it was found that the M1 Garand impeded these soldiers' mobility, as a slung rifle would frequently catch on brush, bang the helmet and tilt it over the eyes. Many soldiers found the rifle slid off the shoulder unless slung diagonally across the back, where it prevented the wearing of standard field packs and haversacks.\n\nAdditionally, Germany's use of glider-borne and paratroop forces to launch surprise \u2018blitzkrieg\u2019 attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon to equip support troops.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/><ref name=\"Weeks\">{{cite book|author1=Weeks, John S.|title=World War II Small Arms|url=https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week|url-access=registration|publisher=Chartwell House|isbn=978-0-88365-403-3|date=1 May 1989|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week/page/130 130]|archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> This request called for a compact, lightweight defensive weapon with greater range, accuracy and firepower than handguns, while weighing half as much as the [[Thompson submachine gun]] or the [[M1 rifle]].<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\">{{cite book |author1=George, John|title=Shots Fired In Anger |edition=2nd Revised & Enlarged |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Rifle Association of America|isbn=978-0935998429 |date=1981|page=394}}</ref> The U.S. Army decided that a carbine would adequately fulfill all of these requirements, but specified that the new arm should weigh no more than five pounds and have an effective range of 300 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ozvYaxr6iQ|title=M1 Carbine at 300 Yards|first=|last= |date=2 October 2012|website=YouTube|format=Video}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruth\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L.|title=M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production|publisher=The Gun Room Press|url=https://www.abebooks.com/M1-CARBINE-DESIGN-DEVELOPMENT-PRODUCTION-Ruth/22379562692/bd |date=1988 |isbn=0-88227-020-6|quote=contains many Ordnance documents related to the \"Light Rifle\" specification that led to the M1 carbine}}</ref> Paratroopers were also added to the list of intended users and a folding-stock version would also be developed.\n\n===Designing the M1 carbine===\nIn 1938, the Chief of Infantry requested that the Ordnance Department develop a \"light rifle\" or carbine, though the formal requirement for the weapon type was not approved until 1940. This led to a competition in 1941 by major U.S. firearm companies and designers.\n\n[[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] at first did not submit a carbine design, as it was occupied in developing the .30-06 Winchester M2 military rifle. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan \"Ed\" Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer [[John Browning]]. A couple of months after Ed Browning's death in May 1939, Winchester hired [[David Marshall Williams|David Marshall \"Carbine\" Williams]] who had begun work on a [[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|short-stroke gas piston]] design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm. Winchester, after Williams' release, had hired Williams on the strength of recommendations of firearms industry leaders and hoped Williams would be able to complete various designs left unfinished by Ed Browning, including the Winchester .30-06 M2 rifle. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston in the existing design. After the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] semi-automatic rifle trials in 1940, Browning's rear-locking tilting bolt design proved unreliable in sandy conditions. As a result, the rifle was redesigned to incorporate a Garand-style [[rotating bolt]] and operating rod, retaining Williams' short-stroke piston. By May 1941, Williams had shaved the M2 rifle prototype from about {{convert|9.5|lb|abbr=on}} to a mere {{convert|7.5|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nOrdnance found unsatisfactory the first series of prototype carbines submitted by several firearms companies and some independent designers.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/>  Winchester had contacted the Ordnance Corps to examine their rifle M2 design. Major Ren\u00e9 Studler of Ordnance believed the rifle design could be scaled down to a carbine which would weigh 4.5 to 4.75&nbsp;lb {{nowrap|(2.0\u20132.2 kg)}} and demanded a prototype as soon as possible. The first model was developed at Winchester in 13 days by William C. Roemer, Fred Humeston and three other Winchester engineers under supervision of Edwin Pugsley, and was essentially Williams' last version of the .30-06 M2 scaled down to the .30 SL cartridge.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/4/7/carbine-williams-myth-reality/|author1=Canfield, Bruce N.|title='Carbine' Williams: Myth & Reality|magazine=The American Rifleman|publisher=NRA Publications|date=7 April 2016 |format=February 2009 Reprint}}</ref> This patchwork prototype was cobbled together using the trigger housing and lockwork of a Winchester M1905 rifle and a modified Garand operating rod.

Williams participated in the finishing of this prototype. The second prototype competed successfully against all remaining carbine candidates in September 1941, and Winchester was notified of their success the very next month. Standardization as the M1 carbine was approved on October 22, 1941.  This story was the loose basis for the 1952 movie ''[[Carbine Williams]]'' starring [[James Stewart]]. Contrary to the movie, Williams had little to do with the carbine's development, with the exception of his short-stroke gas piston design. Williams worked on his own design apart from the other Winchester staff, but it was not ready for testing until December 1941, two months after the Winchester M1 carbine had been adopted and type-classified. Winchester supervisor Edwin Pugsley conceded that Williams' final design was \"an advance on the one that was accepted\", but noted that Williams' decision to go it alone was a distinct impediment to the project,<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/> and Williams' additional design features were not incorporated into M1 production. In a 1951 memo written in fear of a patent infringement lawsuit by Williams, Winchester noted his patent for the short-stroke piston may have been improperly granted as a previous patent covering the same principle of operation was overlooked by the patent office.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/>\n\nIn 1973 the senior technical editor at the NRA contacted Edwin Pugsley for \"a technical last testament\" on M1 carbine history shortly before his death 19 Nov 1975. According to Pugsley, \"The carbine was invented by no single man,\" but was the result of a team effort including Bill Roemer, Marsh Williams, Fred Humeston, Cliff Warner, at least three other Winchester engineers, and Pugsley himself. Ideas were taken and modified from the Winchester M2 Browning rifle (Williams' gas system), the Winchester 1905 rifle (fire control group), M1 Garand (buttstock dimensions and bolt and operating slide principles), and a percussion shotgun in Pugsley's collection (hook breech and barrel band assembly/disassembly).<ref>E.H.

As a result, the .30 carbine cartridge is approximately 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. A standard .30 carbine ball bullet weighs 110 grains (7.1&nbsp;g), a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6&nbsp;g) and has a muzzle velocity of 1,990&nbsp;ft/s (610&nbsp;m/s) giving it 967&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf (1,311 joules) of energy, when fired from the M1 carbine's 18\" barrel.\n\nBy comparison, the [[.30-06]] [[M1 Garand]] is almost 3 times more powerful than the M1 carbine. However, the carbine is twice as powerful as the [[.45ACP]] caliber submachine guns in common use at the time. As a result, the carbine offers much better range, accuracy and penetration than those submachine guns.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> The M1 is also half the weight of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] and fires a lighter cartridge. Therefore, soldiers armed with the carbine can carry much more ammunition than those armed with a Tommy gun.\n\nCategorizing the M1 carbine series has been the subject of much debate. Although commonly compared to the later German [[Sturmgewehr 44|StG44]] and Russian [[AK-47]], the M1 and M2 carbines are under-powered and outclassed by comparison.<ref name=\"Rottman_Green\"/> The carbine instead falls somewhere between the submachine gun and the assault rifle, and could be called a precursor of the [[personal defense weapon]] since it fulfilled a similar role.\n\nOne characteristic of .30 caliber carbine ammunition is that from the beginning of production, [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|non-corrosive primers]] were specified. This was the first major use of this type of primer in a military firearm.  Because the rifle had a closed gas system, not normally disassembled, corrosive primers would have led to a rapid deterioration of the gas system.<ref name=\"The_AmericanRifleman_to_War\">{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Joseph B. |title=The American rifleman goes to war: The guns, troops, and training of World War II as reported in NRA's magazine |date=1992 |publisher=National Rifle Association of America |page=20 |edition=First |isbn=0935998632 }}</ref>  The use of non-corrosive primers was a novelty in service ammunition at this time.<ref name=\"Dunlap\">{{cite book |author1=Dunlap, Roy F. |title=Ordnance Went Up Front|publisher=R&R Books |date=1993 |pages=240,293\u2013297|edition=1st|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30503157727&tab=1&searchurl=sortby%3D17%26tn%3Dordnance%2Bwent%2Bup%2Bfront&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-seller6}}</ref>  Some failures to fire were reported in early lots of .30 caliber carbine ammunition, attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 pp. 191-195\"/>\n\n===Sights, range & accuracy===\nThe M1 carbine entered service with a simple flip sight, which had two settings: 150 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"FM23-7\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM23-7.PDF|title=BASIC FIELD MANUAL - U.S. CARBINE, CALIBER .30, Ml|date=20 May 1942|publisher=War Department |format=FM 23-7}}</ref> However, field reports indicated that this sight was inadequate, and in 1944, it was replaced by a sliding ramp-type adjustable sight with four settings: 100, 200, 250 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> This new rear sight was also adjustable for windage.\n\nAt {{convert|100|yd}}, the M1 carbine can deliver groups between 3 and 5 inches, sufficient for its intended purpose as a close-range defensive weapon.

This field adaptation was never officially approved, but proved an efficient method to supply extra ammunition in combat.  After the introduction of the 30-round magazine, it was common for troops to tape two 30-round magazines together, a practice that became known as \"[[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|Jungle style]]\". This led the military to introduce the \"Holder, Magazine T3-A1\" also called the \"Jungle Clip\", a metal clamp that held two magazines together without the need for tape.\n\nThe 30-round magazines introduced for use with the selective-fire M2 carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 carbine which was designed to retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier (when loaded) 30-round magazine would not be properly seated in the M1 carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 carbine (and late production M1 carbines) if they are to be used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.thecmp.org/showthread.php?t=5377 |title=Carbine magazine catches |publisher=Civilian Marksmanship Program|date=January 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitial combat reports noted that M1 carbine's magazine release button was often mistaken for the safety button while under fire.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>  When this occurred, pressing the mag release caused the loaded magazine to drop into the dirt, while the safety remained in the off position. As a result, the push-button safety was redesigned using a rotating lever.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/><ref name=\"M1_Warrior\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/blogs/history-books/m1-carbine-americas-unlikely-warrior/|magazine=Guns & Ammo|title=M1 Carbine: America's Unlikely Warrior|author1=James, Garry|date=6 October 2014|quote=The M1 carbine (M1A1 shown) was one of America's most widely used arms in three major conflicts and a popular lend/lease item to Allied countries.}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nOriginally the M1 carbine did not have a bayonet lug, but it was often issued with an [[M3 fighting knife]] or a bayonet converted into a fighting knife. Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug attached to the barrel band starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rjmilitaria.com/m1carbineb.htm|title= Collecting The M1 carbine|publisher=RJ Militaria|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. After the war, the bayonet lug was added to many M1 carbines during the arsenal refurbishing process. By the start of the [[Korean War]], the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the standard [[M4 bayonet]], which was based on the earlier [[M3 fighting knife]] and formed the basis for the later [[M5 bayonet|M5]], [[M6 bayonet|M6]] and [[M7 bayonet]]-knives.\n\nA folding-stock version of the carbine (the M1A1) was also developed after a request for a compact and light infantry arm for airborne troops. The Inland Division of General Motors manufactured 140,000 of them in two product runs in late 1942.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/> They were originally issued to the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions but were later issued to all U.S. Army airborne units and the  U.S. Marine Corps.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/>  The folding-stock M1A1 is an unusual design in that the stock is not locked in the open or closed position, but is instead held in place by a spring-loaded cam.\n\nAs carbines were reconditioned, parts such as the magazine catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after World War II, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits.<ref name=\"Firearm_ID\">{{cite book |title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification |author1=Walker, Robert E.|publisher=CRC Press|edition=1st |page= 254|isbn=978-1466502062|date=2012-11-26}}</ref> The conversion included a modified sear, slide, and trigger housing, and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.\n\nDuring World War II, the T23 (M3) [[Flash suppressor|flash hider]] was designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the carbine, but was not introduced into service until the advent of the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L. |title=War Baby: The U.S. Caliber .30 Carbine, Vol. 1|publisher=Collector Grade Publications |isbn=978-0-88935-117-2 |edition=1st Limited|date=1992|pages= 621\u2013623}}</ref>  With the exception of T23 hiders mounted on M3 carbines, few if any T23 flash-hider attachments saw service during the war, though unit armorers occasionally hand-built improvised compensator/flash-hiders of their own design.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\"/><ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\nThe M1 carbine was used with the [[M8 grenade launcher]], which was developed in early 1944. It was fired with the .30 caliber carbine M6 Grenade Blank cartridge to launch [[22 mm grenade|22 mm rifle grenades]]. Stress from firing rifle grenades would eventually crack the carbine's stock. It also could not use the M8 launcher with an M7 auxiliary \"booster\" charge (to extend its range) without breaking the stock. This made it a type of emergency-issue weapon.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Battle of the Bulge.jpg|thumb|American infantrymen of the 290th Regiment fight in fresh snowfall near Amonines, Belgium.

Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see [[M1_carbine#Military contractors|\u00a7 Military contractors]] below). The largest producer was the Inland division of [[General Motors]], but many others were made by contractors as diverse as [[IBM]], the Underwood Typewriter Company, and [[Rock-Ola|Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation]]. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota.  When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies.  Some of the strangest combinations were the M1's made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark UN-QUALITY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111230959/http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|url-status=dead|archivedate=11 November 2013|title=UN-QUALITY Stamp|date=11 November 2013|format=Photo}}</ref> The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood.

At the beginning of World War II the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] at approximately $225. The .30 Caliber carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter, faster and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II.\n\n==U.S. combat use==\n===World War II===\n\n[[File:USMC M1 Carbine.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Marine in combat at Guam.]]\n[[File:First Iwo Jima Flag Raising.jpg|thumb|M1 carbine at first Iwo Jima flag raising.]]\n\nThe M1 carbine with its reduced-power .30 cartridge was not originally intended to serve as a primary weapon for combat infantrymen, nor was it comparable to more powerful assault rifles developed late in the war. However, it was markedly superior to the .45 caliber submachineguns in use at the time in both accuracy and penetration,<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> and its lighter .30 caliber cartridge allowed soldiers to carry more ammunition.

September 20, 1950. The M1 carbine in the foreground has the bayonet mounted.]]\nInitially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a [[selective-fire|select-fire]] capability, but the requirement for rapid production of the new carbine resulted in the omission of this feature from the Light Rifle Program. On 26 October 1944, in response to the Germans' widespread use of automatic weapons, especially the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]], the select-fire '''M2 carbine''' was introduced, along with a new 30-round magazine. The M2 had a fully automatic rate-of-fire of about 850\u2013900 rounds-per-minute. Although actual M2 production began late in the war (April 1945), U.S. Ordnance issued conversion-part kits to allow field conversion of semi-auto M1 carbines to the selective-fire M2 configuration. These converted M1/M2 select-fire carbines saw limited combat service in Europe, primarily during the final Allied advance into Germany. In the Pacific, both converted and original M2 carbines saw limited use in the last days of the fighting in the Philippines.<ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\n====Infrared sight versions====\nThe '''M3 carbine''' was an M2 carbine  with the M2 infrared night sight or ''[[Sniperscope#Generation 0|sniperscope]]''.<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> The M3 did not have [[iron sights]].<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> It was first used in combat by Army units during the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]], about 150 M3 carbines were used on Okinawa. For the first time, U.S. soldiers had a weapon that allowed them to visually detect Japanese infiltrating into American lines at night, even during complete darkness. A team of two or three soldiers was used to operate the weapon and provide support.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  At night, the scope would be used to detect Japanese patrols and assault units moving forward.  At that point, the operator would fire a burst of automatic fire at the greenish images of enemy soldiers.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  The M3 carbine had an effective range of about 70 yards (64 meters), limited by the visual capabilities of the sight.<ref name=\"Article\">{{cite web |title=M3 Infra Red Night Sight |url=http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005050126/http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Fog and rain further reduced the weapon's effective range.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/><ref name=\"Article\"/> However, it is estimated that fully 30% of Japanese casualties inflicted by rifle and carbine fire during the Okinawan campaign were caused by the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>\n\nThe system was refined over time, and by the Korean War the improved M3 infrared night sight was in service. The M3 sight has a longer effective range than its predecessor, about 125 yards (114 meters). However, it still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and infrared light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. M3 operators would not only use their carbines to dispatch individual targets, but also used tracer ammo to identify troop concentrations for machine gunners to decimate.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were surplussed to the public.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Korean War HA-SN-98-07010.jpg|thumb|right| M1 carbine in action during Korean War.

Certain provincial police units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) still use government-issue M1 carbines as well as some operating units of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). In many provinces of the Philippines, M1 carbines are still highly valued as a light small arm. Elements of the New People's Army and Islamic Secessionist movement value the carbine as a lightweight weapon and preferred choice for mountain and ambush operations.\n\nThe M1 carbine has become one of the most recognized firearms in Philippine society, with the Marikina City-based company ARMSCOR Philippines still continuing to manufacture .30 caliber ammunition for the Philippine market.\n\n=== Latin America ===\nThe M1 and M2 carbines were widely used by military, police, and security forces and their opponents during the many guerrilla and civil wars throughout [[Latin America]] until the 1990s, when they were mostly replaced by more modern designs.

Fully automatic capability was incorporated into the design of the M2 (an improved, selective-fire version of the M1), introduced in 1944.  The M2 featured the late M1 improvements to the rear sight, addition of a bayonet lug, and other minor changes.\n\nResearch into a conversion kit for selective fire began May 1944; the first kit was developed by Inland engineers, and known as the T4. Inland was awarded a contract for 500 T4 carbines in September 1944. Although the conversion was seen as satisfactory, the heavier 30-round magazine\nput greater strain on the magazine catch, necessitating the development of a sturdier catch. The slide, sear, and stock design also had to be modified. On fully automatic fire, the T4 model could fire about 750 rounds per minute, but generated a manageable recoil.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nAlthough some carbines were marked at the factory as M2, the only significant difference between an M1 and M2 carbine is in the fire control group. The military issued field conversion kits (T17 and T18) to convert an M1 to an M2. Legally a carbine marked M2 is always a machine gun for [[National Firearms Act of 1934|national firearms registry]] purposes.\n\nThese M2 parts including the heavier M2 stock were standardized for arsenal rebuild of M1 and M1A1 carbines.\n\nA modified round bolt replaced the original flat top bolt to save machining steps in manufacture.  Many sources erroneously refer to this round bolt as an 'M2 bolt' but it was developed as a standard part for new manufacture M1 and later M2 carbines and as a replacement part, with priority given to use on M1A1 and M2 carbines.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/> The slightly heavier round bolt did moderate the cyclic rate of the M2 on full automatic.<ref name=\"Small_Arms\">{{cite book |author1=Smith, W.H.B. |title=Small Arms of the World|publisher=Stackpole |date=May 1990|edition=12th|isbn=978-0880296014|quote=illustrates an M2 carbine in an M1A1 stock on p.642 and a parts breakdown of the M2 on p.646 is shown with a flat top bolt}}</ref>\n\nDespite being in demand, very few M2 carbines saw use during World War II, and then mostly in the closing days against Japan.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> The M2 carbine was logistically compatible with the millions of M1 carbines in U.S. service, and offered longer range, better accuracy and better penetration than (pistol caliber) [[submachine gun]]s like the [[M1 Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompsons]] and [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Guns]].<ref>America's Favorite Gun. by Gold V. Sanders. Popular Science Aug 1944. pp. 84\u201387, 221</ref> Therefore, after World War II, the M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine-guns in U.S. service, until it was itself replaced by the M16 rifle.<ref name=\"The M16 2011. page 6\"/>\n\nThe M2 model was the most widely used Carbine variant during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> A detailed study of the effectiveness of the M2 in the war was assembled by [[S. L. A. Marshall]]. He found that many troops complained on the lack of effective range of the gun, which allowed the enemy to get close enough to throw [[hand grenade]]s. A more detailed analysis showed however that most troops who complained actually tended to run low on ammo, because they fired their M2 on fully automatic too soon. Troops who fired their guns on semi-automatic at distance generally complained less about the M2's effectiveness. Generally, the more seasoned troops used the latter approach. The carbine was usually given to second line troops (administrative, support, etc.), who had little combat experience and also did not have much training in [[small unit tactics|small-unit tactics]], but who usually had to engage the enemy at some critical moment, like a breakthrough or ambush. Marshall noted that almost all killing shots with carbines in Korea were at ranges of 50 yards or less. It was unsurprising therefore that the M2 was a preferred weapon for [[night combat|night patrols]]. The M2 was also used in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]] by special forces, [[ARVN]] advisers, and air crews.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nContemporary authors have struggled to categorize the M2 carbine. On one hand, it is more powerful than a submachine gun and is considered by some to be an [[assault rifle]], even though it fires a projectile considerably less powerful than the [[StG 44]]'s [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]]. On the other hand, the M2 can also be considered a precursor of the modern [[personal defense weapon]] (PDW) concept, even though contemporary guns in that category, like the [[FN P90]], fire substantially different cartridges like the [[5.7\u00d728mm]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\n===Carbine, Cal. 30, M2A2===\n* Arsenal-refurbished (overstamped M2) model\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M3===\n* M2 with mounting (T3 mount) for an early active (infrared) night vision sight\n* About 3,000 produced\n* Three versions of night sight (M1, M2, M3)\n\n[[File:M3 Sniperscope.jpg|thumb|right|Original Korean War era USMC M3 Night Vision Scope]]\n\nThe M3 carbine was an M2 carbine fitted with a mount designed to accept an infrared sight for use at night.  It was initially used with the M1 [[Image intensifier#Generation 0|sniperscope]], and an active [[infrared]] sight, and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa.  Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, and by the time of the [[Korean War]], the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope.\n\nThe M2 sniper scope extended the effective nighttime range of the M3 carbine to 100 yards.  In the later stages of the Korean War, an improved version of the M3 carbine, with a revised mount, a forward pistol grip, and a new M3 sniperscope design was used in the latter stages of Korea and briefly in Vietnam.  The M3 sniperscope had a large active infrared spotlight mounted on top of the scope body itself, allowing use in the prone position. The revised M3/M3 had an effective range of around 125 yards.<ref name=\"Article\"/> Eventually, the M3 carbine and its M3 sniperscope would be superseded by passive-design night vision scopes with extended visible ranges; the improved scopes in turn required the use of rifle-caliber weapons with flatter trajectories and increased hit probability.\n\n==Derivatives==\n===Ingram SAM===\n\nThe [[Military Armament Corporation|Ingram]] SAM rifles are M1 carbine derivatives in [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (SAM-1), [[7.62\u00d739mm]] (SAM-2) and [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (SAM-3). The 5.56\u00d745mm versions accept M16 magazines, the 7.62\u00d739mm accept AK magazines and the 7.62\u00d751mm versions use FN FAL magazines. They did not catch on in competition against the Ruger Mini-14 in both the police and civilian markets.

The new Inland M1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA.  The M1 carbine is modeled after the last production model that Inland manufactured in 1945 and features a type 3 bayonet lug / barrel band, adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and \"low wood\" walnut stock, and a 15-round magazine.  A 30-round mag catch was utilized to allow high-capacity magazines. A \"1944\" M1 Carbine is also available that has the same features as the 1945 only with a Type 2 barrel Band and 10-round magazine and is available for sale in most states with magazine capacity & bayonet lug restrictions. The M1A1 is modeled after a late production 1944 M1A1 Paratrooper model with a folding \"low wood\" walnut stock, Type two barrel band, and includes the same adjustable sights which were actually introduced in 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/inland-manufacturing-m1-carbines|title=Inland Manufacturing Releases 'American Classic' M1 Carbines|author=Robert A.

Although not banned by name, make or model, M1 Carbines may in some cases be classified as contraband assault weapon under the 2013 NY SAFE act if they feature bayonet lugs, pistol grips, folding stocks and flash suppressors. 10-round magazines are available in states that restrict magazine capacity for civilian firearms.\n\nThe M1 carbine was also used by various law enforcement agencies and prison guards, and was prominently carried by riot police during the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s; until it was replaced in those roles by more modern .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles such as the [[Ruger Mini-14]] and the [[Colt AR-15]] type rifles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe ease of use and great adaptability of the weapon led to it being used by [[Malcolm X]] and [[Patty Hearst]].

During prewar and early war field exercises, it was found that the M1 Garand impeded these soldiers' mobility, as a slung rifle would frequently catch on brush, bang the helmet and tilt it over the eyes. Many soldiers found the rifle slid off the shoulder unless slung diagonally across the back, where it prevented the wearing of standard field packs and haversacks.\n\nAdditionally, Germany's use of glider-borne and paratroop forces to launch surprise \u2018blitzkrieg\u2019 attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon to equip support troops.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/><ref name=\"Weeks\">{{cite book|author1=Weeks, John S.|title=World War II Small Arms|url=https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week|url-access=registration|publisher=Chartwell House|isbn=978-0-88365-403-3|date=1 May 1989|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week/page/130 130]|archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> This request called for a compact, lightweight defensive weapon with greater range, accuracy and firepower than handguns, while weighing half as much as the [[Thompson submachine gun]] or the [[M1 rifle]].<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\">{{cite book |author1=George, John|title=Shots Fired In Anger |edition=2nd Revised & Enlarged |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Rifle Association of America|isbn=978-0935998429 |date=1981|page=394}}</ref> The U.S. Army decided that a carbine would adequately fulfill all of these requirements, but specified that the new arm should weigh no more than five pounds and have an effective range of 300 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ozvYaxr6iQ|title=M1 Carbine at 300 Yards|first=|last= |date=2 October 2012|website=YouTube|format=Video}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruth\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L.|title=M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production|publisher=The Gun Room Press|url=https://www.abebooks.com/M1-CARBINE-DESIGN-DEVELOPMENT-PRODUCTION-Ruth/22379562692/bd |date=1988 |isbn=0-88227-020-6|quote=contains many Ordnance documents related to the \"Light Rifle\" specification that led to the M1 carbine}}</ref> Paratroopers were also added to the list of intended users and a folding-stock version would also be developed.\n\n===Designing the M1 carbine===\nIn 1938, the Chief of Infantry requested that the Ordnance Department develop a \"light rifle\" or carbine, though the formal requirement for the weapon type was not approved until 1940. This led to a competition in 1941 by major U.S. firearm companies and designers.\n\n[[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] at first did not submit a carbine design, as it was occupied in developing the .30-06 Winchester M2 military rifle. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan \"Ed\" Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer [[John Browning]]. A couple of months after Ed Browning's death in May 1939, Winchester hired [[David Marshall Williams|David Marshall \"Carbine\" Williams]] who had begun work on a [[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|short-stroke gas piston]] design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm. Winchester, after Williams' release, had hired Williams on the strength of recommendations of firearms industry leaders and hoped Williams would be able to complete various designs left unfinished by Ed Browning, including the Winchester .30-06 M2 rifle. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston in the existing design. After the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] semi-automatic rifle trials in 1940, Browning's rear-locking tilting bolt design proved unreliable in sandy conditions. As a result, the rifle was redesigned to incorporate a Garand-style [[rotating bolt]] and operating rod, retaining Williams' short-stroke piston. By May 1941, Williams had shaved the M2 rifle prototype from about {{convert|9.5|lb|abbr=on}} to a mere {{convert|7.5|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nOrdnance found unsatisfactory the first series of prototype carbines submitted by several firearms companies and some independent designers.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/>  Winchester had contacted the Ordnance Corps to examine their rifle M2 design. Major Ren\u00e9 Studler of Ordnance believed the rifle design could be scaled down to a carbine which would weigh 4.5 to 4.75&nbsp;lb {{nowrap|(2.0\u20132.2 kg)}} and demanded a prototype as soon as possible. The first model was developed at Winchester in 13 days by William C. Roemer, Fred Humeston and three other Winchester engineers under supervision of Edwin Pugsley, and was essentially Williams' last version of the .30-06 M2 scaled down to the .30 SL cartridge.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/4/7/carbine-williams-myth-reality/|author1=Canfield, Bruce N.|title='Carbine' Williams: Myth & Reality|magazine=The American Rifleman|publisher=NRA Publications|date=7 April 2016 |format=February 2009 Reprint}}</ref> This patchwork prototype was cobbled together using the trigger housing and lockwork of a Winchester M1905 rifle and a modified Garand operating rod.

Williams participated in the finishing of this prototype. The second prototype competed successfully against all remaining carbine candidates in September 1941, and Winchester was notified of their success the very next month. Standardization as the M1 carbine was approved on October 22, 1941.  This story was the loose basis for the 1952 movie ''[[Carbine Williams]]'' starring [[James Stewart]]. Contrary to the movie, Williams had little to do with the carbine's development, with the exception of his short-stroke gas piston design. Williams worked on his own design apart from the other Winchester staff, but it was not ready for testing until December 1941, two months after the Winchester M1 carbine had been adopted and type-classified. Winchester supervisor Edwin Pugsley conceded that Williams' final design was \"an advance on the one that was accepted\", but noted that Williams' decision to go it alone was a distinct impediment to the project,<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/> and Williams' additional design features were not incorporated into M1 production. In a 1951 memo written in fear of a patent infringement lawsuit by Williams, Winchester noted his patent for the short-stroke piston may have been improperly granted as a previous patent covering the same principle of operation was overlooked by the patent office.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/>\n\nIn 1973 the senior technical editor at the NRA contacted Edwin Pugsley for \"a technical last testament\" on M1 carbine history shortly before his death 19 Nov 1975. According to Pugsley, \"The carbine was invented by no single man,\" but was the result of a team effort including Bill Roemer, Marsh Williams, Fred Humeston, Cliff Warner, at least three other Winchester engineers, and Pugsley himself. Ideas were taken and modified from the Winchester M2 Browning rifle (Williams' gas system), the Winchester 1905 rifle (fire control group), M1 Garand (buttstock dimensions and bolt and operating slide principles), and a percussion shotgun in Pugsley's collection (hook breech and barrel band assembly/disassembly).<ref>E.H.

As a result, the .30 carbine cartridge is approximately 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. A standard .30 carbine ball bullet weighs 110 grains (7.1&nbsp;g), a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6&nbsp;g) and has a muzzle velocity of 1,990&nbsp;ft/s (610&nbsp;m/s) giving it 967&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf (1,311 joules) of energy, when fired from the M1 carbine's 18\" barrel.\n\nBy comparison, the [[.30-06]] [[M1 Garand]] is almost 3 times more powerful than the M1 carbine. However, the carbine is twice as powerful as the [[.45ACP]] caliber submachine guns in common use at the time. As a result, the carbine offers much better range, accuracy and penetration than those submachine guns.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> The M1 is also half the weight of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] and fires a lighter cartridge. Therefore, soldiers armed with the carbine can carry much more ammunition than those armed with a Tommy gun.\n\nCategorizing the M1 carbine series has been the subject of much debate. Although commonly compared to the later German [[Sturmgewehr 44|StG44]] and Russian [[AK-47]], the M1 and M2 carbines are under-powered and outclassed by comparison.<ref name=\"Rottman_Green\"/> The carbine instead falls somewhere between the submachine gun and the assault rifle, and could be called a precursor of the [[personal defense weapon]] since it fulfilled a similar role.\n\nOne characteristic of .30 caliber carbine ammunition is that from the beginning of production, [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|non-corrosive primers]] were specified. This was the first major use of this type of primer in a military firearm.  Because the rifle had a closed gas system, not normally disassembled, corrosive primers would have led to a rapid deterioration of the gas system.<ref name=\"The_AmericanRifleman_to_War\">{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Joseph B. |title=The American rifleman goes to war: The guns, troops, and training of World War II as reported in NRA's magazine |date=1992 |publisher=National Rifle Association of America |page=20 |edition=First |isbn=0935998632 }}</ref>  The use of non-corrosive primers was a novelty in service ammunition at this time.<ref name=\"Dunlap\">{{cite book |author1=Dunlap, Roy F. |title=Ordnance Went Up Front|publisher=R&R Books |date=1993 |pages=240,293\u2013297|edition=1st|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30503157727&tab=1&searchurl=sortby%3D17%26tn%3Dordnance%2Bwent%2Bup%2Bfront&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-seller6}}</ref>  Some failures to fire were reported in early lots of .30 caliber carbine ammunition, attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 pp. 191-195\"/>\n\n===Sights, range & accuracy===\nThe M1 carbine entered service with a simple flip sight, which had two settings: 150 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"FM23-7\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM23-7.PDF|title=BASIC FIELD MANUAL - U.S. CARBINE, CALIBER .30, Ml|date=20 May 1942|publisher=War Department |format=FM 23-7}}</ref> However, field reports indicated that this sight was inadequate, and in 1944, it was replaced by a sliding ramp-type adjustable sight with four settings: 100, 200, 250 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> This new rear sight was also adjustable for windage.\n\nAt {{convert|100|yd}}, the M1 carbine can deliver groups between 3 and 5 inches, sufficient for its intended purpose as a close-range defensive weapon.

This field adaptation was never officially approved, but proved an efficient method to supply extra ammunition in combat.  After the introduction of the 30-round magazine, it was common for troops to tape two 30-round magazines together, a practice that became known as \"[[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|Jungle style]]\". This led the military to introduce the \"Holder, Magazine T3-A1\" also called the \"Jungle Clip\", a metal clamp that held two magazines together without the need for tape.\n\nThe 30-round magazines introduced for use with the selective-fire M2 carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 carbine which was designed to retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier (when loaded) 30-round magazine would not be properly seated in the M1 carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 carbine (and late production M1 carbines) if they are to be used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.thecmp.org/showthread.php?t=5377 |title=Carbine magazine catches |publisher=Civilian Marksmanship Program|date=January 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitial combat reports noted that M1 carbine's magazine release button was often mistaken for the safety button while under fire.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>  When this occurred, pressing the mag release caused the loaded magazine to drop into the dirt, while the safety remained in the off position. As a result, the push-button safety was redesigned using a rotating lever.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/><ref name=\"M1_Warrior\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/blogs/history-books/m1-carbine-americas-unlikely-warrior/|magazine=Guns & Ammo|title=M1 Carbine: America's Unlikely Warrior|author1=James, Garry|date=6 October 2014|quote=The M1 carbine (M1A1 shown) was one of America's most widely used arms in three major conflicts and a popular lend/lease item to Allied countries.}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nOriginally the M1 carbine did not have a bayonet lug, but it was often issued with an [[M3 fighting knife]] or a bayonet converted into a fighting knife. Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug attached to the barrel band starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rjmilitaria.com/m1carbineb.htm|title= Collecting The M1 carbine|publisher=RJ Militaria|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. After the war, the bayonet lug was added to many M1 carbines during the arsenal refurbishing process. By the start of the [[Korean War]], the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the standard [[M4 bayonet]], which was based on the earlier [[M3 fighting knife]] and formed the basis for the later [[M5 bayonet|M5]], [[M6 bayonet|M6]] and [[M7 bayonet]]-knives.\n\nA folding-stock version of the carbine (the M1A1) was also developed after a request for a compact and light infantry arm for airborne troops. The Inland Division of General Motors manufactured 140,000 of them in two product runs in late 1942.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/> They were originally issued to the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions but were later issued to all U.S. Army airborne units and the  U.S. Marine Corps.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/>  The folding-stock M1A1 is an unusual design in that the stock is not locked in the open or closed position, but is instead held in place by a spring-loaded cam.\n\nAs carbines were reconditioned, parts such as the magazine catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after World War II, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits.<ref name=\"Firearm_ID\">{{cite book |title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification |author1=Walker, Robert E.|publisher=CRC Press|edition=1st |page= 254|isbn=978-1466502062|date=2012-11-26}}</ref> The conversion included a modified sear, slide, and trigger housing, and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.\n\nDuring World War II, the T23 (M3) [[Flash suppressor|flash hider]] was designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the carbine, but was not introduced into service until the advent of the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L. |title=War Baby: The U.S. Caliber .30 Carbine, Vol. 1|publisher=Collector Grade Publications |isbn=978-0-88935-117-2 |edition=1st Limited|date=1992|pages= 621\u2013623}}</ref>  With the exception of T23 hiders mounted on M3 carbines, few if any T23 flash-hider attachments saw service during the war, though unit armorers occasionally hand-built improvised compensator/flash-hiders of their own design.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\"/><ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\nThe M1 carbine was used with the [[M8 grenade launcher]], which was developed in early 1944. It was fired with the .30 caliber carbine M6 Grenade Blank cartridge to launch [[22 mm grenade|22 mm rifle grenades]]. Stress from firing rifle grenades would eventually crack the carbine's stock. It also could not use the M8 launcher with an M7 auxiliary \"booster\" charge (to extend its range) without breaking the stock. This made it a type of emergency-issue weapon.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Battle of the Bulge.jpg|thumb|American infantrymen of the 290th Regiment fight in fresh snowfall near Amonines, Belgium. Soldier in foreground is armed with an M1 carbine.]]\n\nA total of over 6.1 million M1 carbines of various models was manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II (compared with about 5.4 million M1 rifles and about 1.3 million Thompson submachine guns). Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see [[M1_carbine#Military contractors|\u00a7 Military contractors]] below). The largest producer was the Inland division of [[General Motors]], but many others were made by contractors as diverse as [[IBM]], the Underwood Typewriter Company, and [[Rock-Ola|Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation]]. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota.  When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies.  Some of the strangest combinations were the M1's made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark UN-QUALITY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111230959/http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|url-status=dead|archivedate=11 November 2013|title=UN-QUALITY Stamp|date=11 November 2013|format=Photo}}</ref> The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood.

At the beginning of World War II the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] at approximately $225. The .30 Caliber carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter, faster and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II.\n\n==U.S. combat use==\n===World War II===\n\n[[File:USMC M1 Carbine.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Marine in combat at Guam.]]\n[[File:First Iwo Jima Flag Raising.jpg|thumb|M1 carbine at first Iwo Jima flag raising.]]\n\nThe M1 carbine with its reduced-power .30 cartridge was not originally intended to serve as a primary weapon for combat infantrymen, nor was it comparable to more powerful assault rifles developed late in the war. However, it was markedly superior to the .45 caliber submachineguns in use at the time in both accuracy and penetration,<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> and its lighter .30 caliber cartridge allowed soldiers to carry more ammunition.

September 20, 1950. The M1 carbine in the foreground has the bayonet mounted.]]\nInitially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a [[selective-fire|select-fire]] capability, but the requirement for rapid production of the new carbine resulted in the omission of this feature from the Light Rifle Program. On 26 October 1944, in response to the Germans' widespread use of automatic weapons, especially the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]], the select-fire '''M2 carbine''' was introduced, along with a new 30-round magazine. The M2 had a fully automatic rate-of-fire of about 850\u2013900 rounds-per-minute. Although actual M2 production began late in the war (April 1945), U.S. Ordnance issued conversion-part kits to allow field conversion of semi-auto M1 carbines to the selective-fire M2 configuration. These converted M1/M2 select-fire carbines saw limited combat service in Europe, primarily during the final Allied advance into Germany. In the Pacific, both converted and original M2 carbines saw limited use in the last days of the fighting in the Philippines.<ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\n====Infrared sight versions====\nThe '''M3 carbine''' was an M2 carbine  with the M2 infrared night sight or ''[[Sniperscope#Generation 0|sniperscope]]''.<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> The M3 did not have [[iron sights]].<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> It was first used in combat by Army units during the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]], about 150 M3 carbines were used on Okinawa. For the first time, U.S. soldiers had a weapon that allowed them to visually detect Japanese infiltrating into American lines at night, even during complete darkness. A team of two or three soldiers was used to operate the weapon and provide support.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  At night, the scope would be used to detect Japanese patrols and assault units moving forward.  At that point, the operator would fire a burst of automatic fire at the greenish images of enemy soldiers.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  The M3 carbine had an effective range of about 70 yards (64 meters), limited by the visual capabilities of the sight.<ref name=\"Article\">{{cite web |title=M3 Infra Red Night Sight |url=http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005050126/http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Fog and rain further reduced the weapon's effective range.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/><ref name=\"Article\"/> However, it is estimated that fully 30% of Japanese casualties inflicted by rifle and carbine fire during the Okinawan campaign were caused by the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>\n\nThe system was refined over time, and by the Korean War the improved M3 infrared night sight was in service. The M3 sight has a longer effective range than its predecessor, about 125 yards (114 meters). However, it still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and infrared light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. M3 operators would not only use their carbines to dispatch individual targets, but also used tracer ammo to identify troop concentrations for machine gunners to decimate.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were surplussed to the public.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Korean War HA-SN-98-07010.jpg|thumb|right| M1 carbine in action during Korean War.

The \"(a)\" came from the country name in German; in this case, ''Amerika''. It was also used by German police and border guards in [[Bavaria]] after World War II and into the 1950s. The carbines were stamped according to the branch they were in service with; for instance, those used by the border guard were stamped \"''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]''\". Some of these weapons were modified with different sights, finishes, and sometimes new barrels.\n\n===Japanese GSDF===\nA variant was produced shortly after World War II by the Japanese manufacturer Howa Machinery, under U.S. supervision. These were issued to all branches of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], and large numbers of them found their way to [[Southeast Asia]] during the Vietnam War. Howa also made replacement parts for US-made M1 carbines issued to Japanese police and military.\n\n=== Israel Defense Forces ===\nThe M1 carbine was also used by the Israeli [[Palmach]]-based [[special forces]] in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. And, because of their compact size and semi-auto capabilities, they continued to be used by [[Israeli Defence Forces]] after the creation of Israel. The [[Israeli police]] still use the M1 carbine as a standard long gun for non-combat elements and [[Mash'az]] volunteers.\n\n=== French Army ===\nThe U.S. provided France with 269,644 [[M1 carbines|M1 and M2 carbines]] from World War II to 1963.<ref name=\"bmc\" /> The carbines were used by the French Paratroopers and [[French Foreign Legion|Legionnaires]], as well specialists (drivers, radio operators, engineers), during the [[Indo-China War]],<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |author1=McNab, Chris |editor1-first=Charles C. |editor1-last=Unwin |editor2-first=Mike R. |editor2-last=Vanessa U. |title=20th Century Military Uniforms |date=31 July 2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|ref=harv|page=84}}</ref> the [[Algerian War]]<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|trans-title=|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-14-15-texte-integral|first=Jean|last=Huon}}</ref> and the [[Suez Crisis]].\n[[File:Female South Vietnamese Popular Force members on patrol in B\u1ebfn C\u00e1t District.JPEG|thumb|right|South Vietnamese Popular Force members on patrol with M1 carbines.]]\n[[File:Photo taken by Phillip Kemp from cockpit after sling-loading water drums to outpost..jpg|thumb|ROK troops armed with M1 carbines during the Vietnam War.]]\n[[File:CheMuleFull.jpg|thumb|[[Che Guevara]] atop a mule in [[Santa Clara Province|Las Villas province]], [[Cuba]], in November 1958, with an M2 Carbine.]]\n\n=== South Vietnam ===\nThe U.S. provided the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] with 793,994 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1973.<ref name=\"bmc\" /> Along with tens of thousands of carbines left behind by the French after the [[First Indochina War]], the M1 and M2 carbines were the most widely issued small arm during the early stages in the Vietnam War and remained in service in large numbers until the [[fall of Saigon]].

Over time, the [[SKS]] and eventually the [[AK-47]] would replace the carbine to become the dominant weapons used by the Viet Cong.\n\n=== South Korea ===\nThe [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces]] received 1,015,568 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1972.<ref name=\"bmc\"/> Along with hundreds of thousands of Carbines and M1 Garands provided by the United States Army before, during and shortly after the [[Korean war]], South Korea would become the largest single recipient of American M1 and M2 carbines.\n\nSouth Korea also took an active role in the Vietnam War. From 1964 to 1973, South Korea sent more than 300,000 troops to South Vietnam armed primarily with M1 and M2 carbines, as well as M1 Garands.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nThe government of the [[Philippines]] still issues M1 carbines to the infantrymen of the Philippine Army's [[2nd Infantry (Jungle Fighter) Division|2nd Infantry Division]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} assigned in Luzon Island  (some units are issued just M14 automatic rifles and M1 carbines) and the Civilian Auxiliary Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) and Civilian Volunteer Organizations (CVO)spread throughout the Philippines. Certain provincial police units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) still use government-issue M1 carbines as well as some operating units of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). In many provinces of the Philippines, M1 carbines are still highly valued as a light small arm. Elements of the New People's Army and Islamic Secessionist movement value the carbine as a lightweight weapon and preferred choice for mountain and ambush operations.\n\nThe M1 carbine has become one of the most recognized firearms in Philippine society, with the Marikina City-based company ARMSCOR Philippines still continuing to manufacture .30 caliber ammunition for the Philippine market.\n\n=== Latin America ===\nThe M1 and M2 carbines were widely used by military, police, and security forces and their opponents during the many guerrilla and civil wars throughout [[Latin America]] until the 1990s, when they were mostly replaced by more modern designs. A notable user was [[Che Guevara]] who used them during the [[Cuban Revolution]] and in [[Bolivia]] where he was executed by a Bolivian soldier armed with an M2 carbine.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Death of Che Guevara: Declassified| publisher=The National Security Archive| url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/| accessdate=2016-01-24}}</ref> Guevara's fellow revolutionary [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] also used an M2 carbine that he modified with the pistol grip and foregrip from a [[Thompson submachine gun]].

The M2 featured the late M1 improvements to the rear sight, addition of a bayonet lug, and other minor changes.\n\nResearch into a conversion kit for selective fire began May 1944; the first kit was developed by Inland engineers, and known as the T4. Inland was awarded a contract for 500 T4 carbines in September 1944. Although the conversion was seen as satisfactory, the heavier 30-round magazine\nput greater strain on the magazine catch, necessitating the development of a sturdier catch. The slide, sear, and stock design also had to be modified. On fully automatic fire, the T4 model could fire about 750 rounds per minute, but generated a manageable recoil.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nAlthough some carbines were marked at the factory as M2, the only significant difference between an M1 and M2 carbine is in the fire control group. The military issued field conversion kits (T17 and T18) to convert an M1 to an M2. Legally a carbine marked M2 is always a machine gun for [[National Firearms Act of 1934|national firearms registry]] purposes.\n\nThese M2 parts including the heavier M2 stock were standardized for arsenal rebuild of M1 and M1A1 carbines.\n\nA modified round bolt replaced the original flat top bolt to save machining steps in manufacture.  Many sources erroneously refer to this round bolt as an 'M2 bolt' but it was developed as a standard part for new manufacture M1 and later M2 carbines and as a replacement part, with priority given to use on M1A1 and M2 carbines.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/> The slightly heavier round bolt did moderate the cyclic rate of the M2 on full automatic.<ref name=\"Small_Arms\">{{cite book |author1=Smith, W.H.B. |title=Small Arms of the World|publisher=Stackpole |date=May 1990|edition=12th|isbn=978-0880296014|quote=illustrates an M2 carbine in an M1A1 stock on p.642 and a parts breakdown of the M2 on p.646 is shown with a flat top bolt}}</ref>\n\nDespite being in demand, very few M2 carbines saw use during World War II, and then mostly in the closing days against Japan.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> The M2 carbine was logistically compatible with the millions of M1 carbines in U.S. service, and offered longer range, better accuracy and better penetration than (pistol caliber) [[submachine gun]]s like the [[M1 Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompsons]] and [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Guns]].<ref>America's Favorite Gun. by Gold V. Sanders. Popular Science Aug 1944. pp. 84\u201387, 221</ref> Therefore, after World War II, the M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine-guns in U.S. service, until it was itself replaced by the M16 rifle.<ref name=\"The M16 2011. page 6\"/>\n\nThe M2 model was the most widely used Carbine variant during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> A detailed study of the effectiveness of the M2 in the war was assembled by [[S. L. A. Marshall]]. He found that many troops complained on the lack of effective range of the gun, which allowed the enemy to get close enough to throw [[hand grenade]]s. A more detailed analysis showed however that most troops who complained actually tended to run low on ammo, because they fired their M2 on fully automatic too soon. Troops who fired their guns on semi-automatic at distance generally complained less about the M2's effectiveness. Generally, the more seasoned troops used the latter approach. The carbine was usually given to second line troops (administrative, support, etc.), who had little combat experience and also did not have much training in [[small unit tactics|small-unit tactics]], but who usually had to engage the enemy at some critical moment, like a breakthrough or ambush. Marshall noted that almost all killing shots with carbines in Korea were at ranges of 50 yards or less. It was unsurprising therefore that the M2 was a preferred weapon for [[night combat|night patrols]]. The M2 was also used in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]] by special forces, [[ARVN]] advisers, and air crews.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nContemporary authors have struggled to categorize the M2 carbine. On one hand, it is more powerful than a submachine gun and is considered by some to be an [[assault rifle]], even though it fires a projectile considerably less powerful than the [[StG 44]]'s [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]]. On the other hand, the M2 can also be considered a precursor of the modern [[personal defense weapon]] (PDW) concept, even though contemporary guns in that category, like the [[FN P90]], fire substantially different cartridges like the [[5.7\u00d728mm]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\n===Carbine, Cal. 30, M2A2===\n* Arsenal-refurbished (overstamped M2) model\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M3===\n* M2 with mounting (T3 mount) for an early active (infrared) night vision sight\n* About 3,000 produced\n* Three versions of night sight (M1, M2, M3)\n\n[[File:M3 Sniperscope.jpg|thumb|right|Original Korean War era USMC M3 Night Vision Scope]]\n\nThe M3 carbine was an M2 carbine fitted with a mount designed to accept an infrared sight for use at night.  It was initially used with the M1 [[Image intensifier#Generation 0|sniperscope]], and an active [[infrared]] sight, and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa.  Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, and by the time of the [[Korean War]], the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope.\n\nThe M2 sniper scope extended the effective nighttime range of the M3 carbine to 100 yards.  In the later stages of the Korean War, an improved version of the M3 carbine, with a revised mount, a forward pistol grip, and a new M3 sniperscope design was used in the latter stages of Korea and briefly in Vietnam.  The M3 sniperscope had a large active infrared spotlight mounted on top of the scope body itself, allowing use in the prone position. The revised M3/M3 had an effective range of around 125 yards.<ref name=\"Article\"/> Eventually, the M3 carbine and its M3 sniperscope would be superseded by passive-design night vision scopes with extended visible ranges; the improved scopes in turn required the use of rifle-caliber weapons with flatter trajectories and increased hit probability.\n\n==Derivatives==\n===Ingram SAM===\n\nThe [[Military Armament Corporation|Ingram]] SAM rifles are M1 carbine derivatives in [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (SAM-1), [[7.62\u00d739mm]] (SAM-2) and [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (SAM-3). The 5.56\u00d745mm versions accept M16 magazines, the 7.62\u00d739mm accept AK magazines and the 7.62\u00d751mm versions use FN FAL magazines.

The new Inland M1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA.  The M1 carbine is modeled after the last production model that Inland manufactured in 1945 and features a type 3 bayonet lug / barrel band, adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and \"low wood\" walnut stock, and a 15-round magazine.  A 30-round mag catch was utilized to allow high-capacity magazines. A \"1944\" M1 Carbine is also available that has the same features as the 1945 only with a Type 2 barrel Band and 10-round magazine and is available for sale in most states with magazine capacity & bayonet lug restrictions.

Although not banned by name, make or model, M1 Carbines may in some cases be classified as contraband assault weapon under the 2013 NY SAFE act if they feature bayonet lugs, pistol grips, folding stocks and flash suppressors. 10-round magazines are available in states that restrict magazine capacity for civilian firearms.\n\nThe M1 carbine was also used by various law enforcement agencies and prison guards, and was prominently carried by riot police during the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s; until it was replaced in those roles by more modern .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles such as the [[Ruger Mini-14]] and the [[Colt AR-15]] type rifles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe ease of use and great adaptability of the weapon led to it being used by [[Malcolm X]] and [[Patty Hearst]].

An M1 was also the weapon used in the 1947 assassination of notorious American mobster [[Bugsy Siegel | Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]].\n\n==Related equipment and accessories==\n===Ammunition types===\n{{Main|.30 Carbine}}\nThe ammunition used by the military with the carbine include:<ref>''TM 9-1305-200/TO 11A13-1-101 Small-Arms Ammunition'', 1961, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Ball, M1\n* Cartridge, Grenade, Caliber .30, M6 (also authorized for other blank firing uses, due to a lack of a dedicated blank cartridge)\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Dummy, M13\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Ball, Test, High Pressure, M18\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Tracer, M16 (also rated as having an incendiary effect)\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Tracer, M27 (dimmer illumination and no incendiary effect)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of U.S. Army weapons by supply catalog designation]] SNL B-28\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Barnes, Frank C., ''Cartridges of the World'', Iola, WI: DBI Books Inc., {{ISBN|0-87349-033-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87349-033-7}}, (6th ed., 1989).\n* {{cite magazine|author=Canfield, Bruce N. |title=A New Lease on Life: The Post-World War II M1 Carbine |magazine=American Rifleman |date=June 2007}}\n* Dunlap, Roy F.
