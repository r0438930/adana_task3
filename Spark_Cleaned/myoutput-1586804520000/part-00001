In 1785, Fulton bought a farm at [[Hopewell Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania|Hopewell Township]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]] near [[Pittsburgh]] for \u00a380 <!-- according to {{Inflation|UK|80|1785}}, \u00a380 = \u00a39,956 in 2018 pounds --> (equivalent to ${{To USD|9956|GBR|round=yes}} in 2018),{{Inflation/fn|UK}} and moved his mother and family into it.\n\n== Work ==\n=== Career in Europe (1786\u20131806) ===\n[[File:Fulton's submarine design.jpg|alt=Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.|thumb|Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.]]\nAt the age of 23, Fulton traveled to Europe, where he would live for the next twenty years. He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist [[Benjamin West]]; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.<ref name=buckman/>\n\nFulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for [[tugboat]] [[canal]]s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also  began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a [[Dredging|dredging machine]] and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to [[Manchester]] to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], a cotton manufacturer and early [[socialist]]. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.<ref>Boyes, Graham. ''The Peak Forest Canal''. {{ISBN|9780901461599}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Fulton por HOUDON, Jean-Antoine 1803.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Robert Fulton by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], 1803.]]\n\nAs early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments. The first [[steamship]]s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by [[Claude de Jouffroy]] in France. Called ''Palmip\u00e8de'', it was tested on the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built {{ship||Phyroscaphe}}, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the [[Sa\u00f4ne]]. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787. [[William Symington]] had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.\n\nIn Britain, Fulton met the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton]], whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''Bonaparte'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on {{ship||Charlotte Dundas}}, constructed by Symington. \n\n[[File:Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment 9 August 1803.jpg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of August 9, 1803.]]\n\nIn 1797 Fulton went to [[Paris]], where he was well known as an inventor. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], an inventor from [[Virginia]] with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786 ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]]. Fulton also exhibited the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost (painter)|Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]]'s ''Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries'' (1800), on what is still called ''Rue des Panoramas'' (Panorama Street) today.<ref name=sutcliffe63>[[#sutcliffe|Sutcliffe, 1909]], p. 63.</ref> While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually he approached the [[Minister of Marine (France)|Minister of Marine]] and in 1800 was granted permission to build.<ref name=\"Burgess1\">{{cite book|author=Burgess, Robert Forrest|title=Ships Beneath the Sea|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsbeneathseaa00burg|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-008958-7|url-access=registration|author-link=Robert Forrest Burgess}}</ref> The shipyard Perrier in [[Rouen]] built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the [[Seine River]] in the same city.\n\n[[File:Plaque comm\u00e9morative \u00e0 Robert Fulton, Rouen.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Robert Fulton in the port of [[Rouen]], made in 1918 to thank the United States for their involvement in the First World War]]\n\nIn France, Fulton met [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], who was appointed [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, with an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current.\n\nIn 1804, Fulton [[allegiance|switched allegiance]] and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly ignored.<ref name=\"Best\"/>\n\n=== Career in the United States (1806\u20131815) ===\nIn 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later known as ''Clermont''). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between [[New York City]] and up the Hudson River to the state capital [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. ''Clermont'' made the {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the [[maiden voyage]] included a lawyer Jones and his family from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] nurse on a steamboat hospital in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Alice Crary Sutcliffe, ''Robert Fulton and the 'Claremont' ''</ref>\n\nFrom 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]], appointed by the [[Governor of New York]].\n\nFulton's final design was the [[floating battery]] {{ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}. This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.\n\nFrom October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]] (1767\u20131854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, {{ship||New Orleans|steamboat|2}}, sturdy enough to take down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. It traveled from industrial [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was built, with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; past the \"[[Falls of the Ohio]]\" at [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; to near [[Cairo, Illinois]], and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to New Orleans some {{convert|90|mi}} by river from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]]. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.\n\nFulton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf|title=MemberListF|work=American Antiquarian Society}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786\u20131824), the daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era.<ref name=Reynolds1911>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ/page/n370 302]\u2013303}}</ref><ref name=Lancaster1909>{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227\u2013228}}</ref>  Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician.<ref name=\"Philip2003\"/>  Together, they had four children:<ref name=\"LCHS1909\">{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society: January 8, 1909.

He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist [[Benjamin West]]; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.<ref name=buckman/>\n\nFulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for [[tugboat]] [[canal]]s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also  began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a [[Dredging|dredging machine]] and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to [[Manchester]] to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], a cotton manufacturer and early [[socialist]]. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.<ref>Boyes, Graham. ''The Peak Forest Canal''. {{ISBN|9780901461599}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Fulton por HOUDON, Jean-Antoine 1803.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Robert Fulton by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], 1803.]]\n\nAs early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments. The first [[steamship]]s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by [[Claude de Jouffroy]] in France. Called ''Palmip\u00e8de'', it was tested on the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built {{ship||Phyroscaphe}}, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the [[Sa\u00f4ne]]. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787. [[William Symington]] had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.\n\nIn Britain, Fulton met the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton]], whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''Bonaparte'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on {{ship||Charlotte Dundas}}, constructed by Symington. \n\n[[File:Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment 9 August 1803.jpg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of August 9, 1803.]]\n\nIn 1797 Fulton went to [[Paris]], where he was well known as an inventor. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], an inventor from [[Virginia]] with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786 ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]]. Fulton also exhibited the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost (painter)|Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]]'s ''Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries'' (1800), on what is still called ''Rue des Panoramas'' (Panorama Street) today.<ref name=sutcliffe63>[[#sutcliffe|Sutcliffe, 1909]], p. 63.</ref> While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually he approached the [[Minister of Marine (France)|Minister of Marine]] and in 1800 was granted permission to build.<ref name=\"Burgess1\">{{cite book|author=Burgess, Robert Forrest|title=Ships Beneath the Sea|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsbeneathseaa00burg|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-008958-7|url-access=registration|author-link=Robert Forrest Burgess}}</ref> The shipyard Perrier in [[Rouen]] built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the [[Seine River]] in the same city.\n\n[[File:Plaque comm\u00e9morative \u00e0 Robert Fulton, Rouen.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Robert Fulton in the port of [[Rouen]], made in 1918 to thank the United States for their involvement in the First World War]]\n\nIn France, Fulton met [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], who was appointed [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, with an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current.\n\nIn 1804, Fulton [[allegiance|switched allegiance]] and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly ignored.<ref name=\"Best\"/>\n\n=== Career in the United States (1806\u20131815) ===\nIn 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later known as ''Clermont''). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between [[New York City]] and up the Hudson River to the state capital [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. ''Clermont'' made the {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the [[maiden voyage]] included a lawyer Jones and his family from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] nurse on a steamboat hospital in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Alice Crary Sutcliffe, ''Robert Fulton and the 'Claremont' ''</ref>\n\nFrom 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]], appointed by the [[Governor of New York]].\n\nFulton's final design was the [[floating battery]] {{ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}. This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.\n\nFrom October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]] (1767\u20131854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, {{ship||New Orleans|steamboat|2}}, sturdy enough to take down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. It traveled from industrial [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was built, with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; past the \"[[Falls of the Ohio]]\" at [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; to near [[Cairo, Illinois]], and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to New Orleans some {{convert|90|mi}} by river from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]]. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.\n\nFulton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf|title=MemberListF|work=American Antiquarian Society}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786\u20131824), the daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era.<ref name=Reynolds1911>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ/page/n370 302]\u2013303}}</ref><ref name=Lancaster1909>{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227\u2013228}}</ref>  Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician.<ref name=\"Philip2003\"/>  Together, they had four children:<ref name=\"LCHS1909\">{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society: January 8, 1909.
