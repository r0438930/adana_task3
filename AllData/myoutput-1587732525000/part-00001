In 1996, Larson was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges not directly related to Sue. After a lengthy civil case, the court decreed that Maurice Williams retained ownership, because as a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] he was protected by the law against an impulsive selling of [[real property]], and the remains were returned in 1995.\n\nWilliams then decided to sell the remains, and contracted with [[Sotheby's]] to auction the property.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013.

The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur. A subsequent study found these to be areas of parasitic infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of ''[[Trichomonas gallinae]]'', a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=EDS|last2=Salisbury|first2=SW|last3=Horner|first3=JR|last4=Varricci|first4=DJ|last5=Hansen|first5=Davis Marinus|display-authors=etal|title=Common Avian Infection Plagued the Tyrant Dinosaurs|journal=PLOS One|language=English|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007288|date=September 30, 2009|pmc=2748709|pmid=19789646|volume=4|issue=9|page=e7288}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=John Jr. |title=Throat infection may have brought down T. rex |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/30/science/sci-dinosaur-parasite30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound.

In 1996, Larson was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges not directly related to Sue. After a lengthy civil case, the court decreed that Maurice Williams retained ownership, because as a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] he was protected by the law against an impulsive selling of [[real property]], and the remains were returned in 1995.\n\nWilliams then decided to sell the remains, and contracted with [[Sotheby's]] to auction the property.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013.

Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur.

The cast skull was also lighter, allowing it to be displayed on the mount without the use of a steel upright under the head. The original skull is exhibited in a case that can be opened to allow researchers access for study. Originally, the Field Museum had plans to incorporate SUE into their preexisting dinosaur exhibit on the second floor, but had little left in their budget to do so after purchasing it. Instead, the ''T.rex'' was put on display near the entrance on the first floor of the museum where it would remain for the next 18 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.wttw.com/2018/12/19/look-inside-sue-t-rex-s-new-private-suite-field-museum|title=A Look Inside Sue the T.
