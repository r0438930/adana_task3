However, immigration throughout the 20th century has brought other Catholics and [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s from various regions to Argentina.

The Church\u2019s place in Argentine national identity, which spans across the ideological spectrum, stems from the perpetual ability of Argentines on different sides of political and social divides to find some level of support in the Church.<ref name=\"georgetown1\">{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/argentina |title=Argentina |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> The Church solidified its hold on the territory of modern-day Argentina during the period of Spanish colonial rule from the 16th to early 19th centuries.

The [[Pachamama]] worship is still widespread throughout Salta and Jujuy along with Catholic beliefs, without opposition from the Catholic bishops.\n\nThe church in Argentina is divided into [[diocese]]s and [[archdiocese]]s. Buenos Aires, for example, is an archdiocese owing to is size and historical significance as the capital of the nation. [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]], the seat of the archbishop, houses the remains of General [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] in a mausoleum.\n\nThere are nine Catholic universities in Argentina: [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]] (Buenos Aires), the [[Universidad del Salvador]] (Buenos Aires), the [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de C\u00f3rdoba]], the Universidad de La Plata, the Universidad de Salta, the Universidad de Santa Fe, the Universidad de Cuyo, and the Universidad de Santiago del Estero. [[Religious orders]] run and sponsor hundreds of primary and secondary schools throughout the country, with and without government funding.\n\nCardinal [[Archbishop of Buenos Aires]] Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina was elected to the papacy, as [[Pope Francis]], on 13 March 2013.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} https://www.humanite.fr/monde/habemus-papam-et-130-000-tweets-la-minute-517427 Habemus Papam et 130 000 Tweets la minute</ref>\n\n===Other Christian denominations===\n[[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches have been gaining ground since the 1980s.

However, after the creation of Israel, Sephardi tensions amongst Muslims in Latin American countries began to rise resulting in the remaining Sephardi populations, found mainly in Morocco, migrating to Argentina. [[Buenos Aires]] holds almost the entire Sephardic Jewish population in Argentina, home to roughly 50,000.  In Argentina, Sephardi Jews remained separate of [[Ashkenazi Jews]], who in the later half of the 20th century, made up most of the Jewish population in Latin America.

The [[Pachamama]] worship is still widespread throughout Salta and Jujuy along with Catholic beliefs, without opposition from the Catholic bishops.\n\nThe church in Argentina is divided into [[diocese]]s and [[archdiocese]]s. Buenos Aires, for example, is an archdiocese owing to is size and historical significance as the capital of the nation. [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]], the seat of the archbishop, houses the remains of General [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] in a mausoleum.\n\nThere are nine Catholic universities in Argentina: [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]] (Buenos Aires), the [[Universidad del Salvador]] (Buenos Aires), the [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de C\u00f3rdoba]], the Universidad de La Plata, the Universidad de Salta, the Universidad de Santa Fe, the Universidad de Cuyo, and the Universidad de Santiago del Estero.

This requirement was removed from the text in the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|1994 constitutional reform]], since the president no longer designates Argentine bishops. The old 1853 text also included a goal \"to keep a pacific relationship with the Indians and promote their conversion to Catholicism\", which was deleted in the reform.\n\nThe federal state pays a salary to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[bishop]]s. Each bishop receives a monthly salary that is set by law to the equivalent of 80% of that a judge, about 4,300 pesos or 1,430 USD.<ref name=\"constitution\"/> Older seminarists and retired priests receive minor pensions, and parishes in conflictive and border areas are subsidized with 335 pesos per month (112 USD).

One of the most famous is the veneration of ''La [[Difunta Correa]]'' (\"The Deceased Correa\"). Many other beliefs in advocations of the Virgin, saints and other religious characters exist throughout the country, which are locally or regionally popular and church-endorsed.\n\nAnother popular cult is that of the [[Gauchito Gil]] (\"the little [[gaucho]] Gil\", Antonio Mamerto Gil N\u00fa\u00f1ez), born in the province of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] (allegedly in 1847).
