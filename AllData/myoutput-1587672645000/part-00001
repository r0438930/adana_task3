Lewis]] in ''Authoritarian Regimes in Latin America'', all opposition newspaper had been closed down and all radio and television stations were in state control.<ref name=\"Lewis\"/> Lewis states that moderate teachers and professors were purged, about 20,000 [[dissident]]s were held and tortured in prisons.<ref name=\"Lewis\"/>\n\n[[Homosexual]]s as well as other \"deviant\" groups who were barred from military conscription, were forced to conduct their compulsory military service in camps called \"[[Military Units to Aid Production]]\" in the 1960s, and were subjected to political \"[[:wikt:reeducation|reeducation]]\".<ref name=\"Hirschfeld-since1898\"/><ref name=\"Machos, Maricones, and Gays\"/><ref name=\"World Police Encyclopedia\"/> Some of Castro's military commanders brutalized the inmates.<ref name=\"Machos, Maricones, and Gays1\"/>\n\nIn nearly all areas of government, loyalty to the regime became the primary criterion for all appointments.<ref name=\"Staten-Cuba\"/>\n\n====Government authority====\n* The media is operated under the [[Cuban Communist Party]]\u2019s [[Department of Revolutionary Orientation]], which \"develops and coordinates propaganda strategies\".<ref name=\"10 most censored countries \u2013 The Committee to Protect Journalists\"/>\n* A [[Human Rights Watch]] 1999 report on Cuba notes that Cuba has penalties for anyone who \"threatens, libels or slanders, defames, affronts (injuria) or in any other way insults (ultraje) or offends, with the spoken word or in writing, the dignity or decorum of an authority, public functionary, or his agents or auxiliaries\".

These negotiations resulted in a July 2010 agreement that all remaining prisoners of the 'Group of 75' would be freed. Spain offered to receive those prisoners who would agree to be released and immediately exiled together with their families. Of the 79 prisoners of conscience 56 were still behind bars at the time of the agreement. Of the total group, 21 are still living in Cuba today whereas the others are in exile, most of them in Spain.

The youngest sector of Cuban society is the one least committed to the dictatorship but at the same time the most apolitical, the one most permeated with political skepticism, escapism, and other similar 'isms.'

The signers include blogger Yoani Sanchez and hunger striker Guillermo Farinas, as well as Elizardo Sanchez, head of Cuba's most prominent human rights group and [[Miriam Leiva (journalist)|Miriam Leiva]], who helped found the Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White, a group of wives and mothers of jailed dissidents. The letter supports a bill introduced on 23 February by Rep. Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat, that would bar the president from prohibiting travel to Cuba or blocking transactions required to make such trips. It also would bar the White House from stopping direct transfers between US and Cuban banks. The signers stated that:\n\n<blockquote>We share the opinion that the isolation of the people of Cuba benefits the most inflexible interests of its government, while any opening serves to inform and empower the Cuban people and helps to further strengthen our civil society.<ref name=\"google\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Center for Democracy in the Americas]], a Washington-based group supporting the bill, issued a press release stating that \"74 of Cuba's most prominent political dissidents have endorsed the Peterson-Moran legislation to end the travel ban and expand food exports to Cuba because in their words it is good for human rights, good for alleviating hunger, and good for spreading information and showing solidarity with the Cuban people. Their letter answers every argument the pro-embargo forces use to oppose this legislation. This, itself, answers the question 'who is speaking for the Cuban people in this debate?' - those who want to send food and Americans to visit the island and stand with ordinary Cubans, or those who don't.

And el castrismo, without doubt, has taken note. Will they succeed in sparking a popular movement, or at least consciousness of the need for democracy in Cuba? Who knows. The youngest sector of Cuban society is the one least committed to the dictatorship but at the same time the most apolitical, the one most permeated with political skepticism, escapism, and other similar 'isms.' It would seem, however, that after 50 years of dictatorship, public rejection of that regime is taking on more original and independent forms. Finally, a breeze of fresh, hopeful air.}}\n\nOn 29 March 2009, [[Yoani S\u00e1nchez]], at Tania Bruguera's performance where a podium with an open mic was staged for people to have one minute of uncensored public speech, S\u00e1nchez was among people to publicly criticize censorship and said that \"the time has come to jump over the wall of control\". The government condemned the event.<ref name=\"reuters3\"/><ref name=\"miamiherald\"/>\n\nYoani S\u00e1nchez is under permanent surveillance by Cuba's police force, which camps outside her home.<ref name=\"Yoani sends a thank you note to her spies\"/>\n\n===June 2010 letter to United States Congress===\n{{See also|Cuban Hunger Strike to Free Political Prisoners \u2013 Cuba 2010}}\n\nOn Thursday, 10 June 2010, seventy-four of Cuba's dissidents signed a letter to the United States Congress in support of a bill that would lift the US travel ban for Americans wishing to visit Cuba. The signers include blogger Yoani Sanchez and hunger striker Guillermo Farinas, as well as Elizardo Sanchez, head of Cuba's most prominent human rights group and [[Miriam Leiva (journalist)|Miriam Leiva]], who helped found the Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White, a group of wives and mothers of jailed dissidents. The letter supports a bill introduced on 23 February by Rep. Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat, that would bar the president from prohibiting travel to Cuba or blocking transactions required to make such trips. It also would bar the White House from stopping direct transfers between US and Cuban banks. The signers stated that:\n\n<blockquote>We share the opinion that the isolation of the people of Cuba benefits the most inflexible interests of its government, while any opening serves to inform and empower the Cuban people and helps to further strengthen our civil society.<ref name=\"google\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Center for Democracy in the Americas]], a Washington-based group supporting the bill, issued a press release stating that \"74 of Cuba's most prominent political dissidents have endorsed the Peterson-Moran legislation to end the travel ban and expand food exports to Cuba because in their words it is good for human rights, good for alleviating hunger, and good for spreading information and showing solidarity with the Cuban people. Their letter answers every argument the pro-embargo forces use to oppose this legislation. This, itself, answers the question 'who is speaking for the Cuban people in this debate?' - those who want to send food and Americans to visit the island and stand with ordinary Cubans, or those who don't. If Cuba's best known bloggers, dissidents, hunger strikers, and other activists for human rights want this legislation enacted, what else needs be said?\"<ref name=\"74 of Cuba's Leading Dissidents Urge Congress to End Travel Ban and Increase Food Sales to Cuba\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/74-of-cubas-leading-dissidents-urge-congress-to-end-travel-ban-and-increase-food-sales-to-cuba-96047859.html |title=74 of Cuba's Leading Dissidents Urge Congress to End Travel Ban and Increase Food Sales to Cuba |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212133110/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/74-of-cubas-leading-dissidents-urge-congress-to-end-travel-ban-and-increase-food-sales-to-cuba-96047859.html |archivedate=12 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"democracyinamericascivil\"/> The Center also hosts English<ref name=\"democracyinamericas\"/> as well as the Spanish<ref name=\"democracyinamericas4\"/> version of the letter signed by the 74 dissidents.\n\n===Notable people===\n[[File:Radio Republica.jpg|thumb|[[Antonio Rodiles]], [[Jorge Luis Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez]] and [[Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat]] in 2017]]\n* [[Manuel V\u00e1zquez Portal]], a poet, writer, and a journalist, received the 2003 [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards|CPJ International Press Freedom Award]].\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Maseda Guti\u00e9rrez]], a jailed nuclear engineer and journalist, received the 2008 [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards|CPJ International Press Freedom Award]].\n* [[Jorge Luis Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez]] (known as Ant\u00fanez) was jailed for criticizing communism and spent 17 years in jail until released in 2007.
