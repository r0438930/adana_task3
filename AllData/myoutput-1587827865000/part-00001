The game was the 83rd edition of the annual [[Rose Bowl Game]], held on [[New Year's Day]] in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The game resulted in a dramatic 20&ndash;17 victory for the Buckeyes when [[Joe Germaine]] led a [[Hurry-up offense#Two-minute drill|last-minute]] touchdown drive. Joe Germaine was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game.<ref name=\"ROSEBOWLPROGRAM\">[http://www.bowlprograms.com/rosebowl/?pg=182 2008 Rose Bowl Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306033551/http://www.bowlprograms.com/rosebowl/?pg=182 |date=March 6, 2008 }}, [[2008 Rose Bowl]]. Accessed January 26, 2008.</ref> The loss remains infamous among Arizona State fans, as the loss cost them a chance at winning their only national championship. Had they won, they would've been the only undefeated team in the nation, and as a result, would've likely given the Devils at least a share of the national championship.\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Ohio State===\n{{see also|1996 Ohio State Buckeyes football team}}\nThe Buckeyes had rolled through the regular season using a two-quarterback system; [[Stanley Jackson (American football)|Stanley Jackson]] and [[Joe Germaine]] split time in each game at QB.  The Buckeye offensive attack was led by [[Outland Trophy]]- and [[Lombardi Award]]-winning tackle [[Orlando Pace]] (who would go on to be the #1 pick in the [[1997 NFL Draft|ensuing]] [[NFL Draft]]) and true freshman wide receiver [[David Boston]], a budding star.  The Buckeyes\u2019 only loss was in the [[Regular season|regular-season]] finale against [[Ohio State-Michigan rivalry|archrival]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], which spoiled their undefeated season and national title hopes; however, OSU had clinched a berth in the Rose Bowl one week before The Game with a win over [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]].  The defense was led by the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, lockdown cornerback [[Shawn Springs]], and true freshman middle linebacker [[Andy Katzenmoyer]].\n\n===Arizona State===\n{{see also|1996 Arizona State Sun Devils football team}}\nThe Sun Devils, meanwhile, were undefeated, ranked <nowiki>#</nowiki>2 in the nation, and had hopes of capturing the school's first national championship in football.  Leading the way for ASU were senior quarterback [[Jake Plummer]], [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] [[Terry Battle]], and a stingy defense led by end [[Derrick Rodgers]] and linebacker [[Pat Tillman]].  Perhaps ASU's most impressive regular-season victory came against [[1996 Fiesta Bowl|defending national champion]] [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], when ASU's defense held the \u2019Huskers scoreless; Arizona State won by a score of 19&ndash;0.\n\n==Game summary==\n===First quarter===\nThe Buckeyes scored first midway through the opening period when [[quarterback]] [[Stanley Jackson (American football)|Stanley Jackson]] threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to [[true freshman]] [[wide receiver|wideout]] [[David Boston]], capping a drive that saw Jackson [[Quarterback scramble|scramble]] for some twenty yards on a third down. [[Josh Jackson (American football kicker)|Josh Jackson]]\u2019s PAT was good, making it 7&ndash;0 in favor of the Buckeyes.  No other scoring ensued in the period, and the Buckeyes led after one, 7&ndash;0.\n\n===Second quarter===\nShortly before halftime, the Sun Devils finally answered via a 25-yard pass play from [[Jake Plummer]] to [[Ricky Boyer]], tying the game after [[Robert Nycz]]\u2019s extra point. [[Instant replay|Replays]] seemed to show that Boyer had trapped the ball against the [[end zone]] turf, but the touchdown stood.  Neither team could manage any more points before [[halftime]], and the game went to the break, still tied at 7&ndash;7.\n\n===Third quarter===\nAfter halftime, the Sun Devils would add a 37-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by Nycz to take a 10-7 lead on the opening drive of the second half.<br/>\nThe Buckeyes countered only two plays later, when [[Joe Germaine]] hit [[Dimitrious Stanley]] on a [[Post route|post pattern]].  ASU corner [[Jason Simmons]] slipped and fell on the turf, and Stanley was off to the races.  72 yards and an [[Point after touchdown|extra point]] later, the Buckeyes were back on top with a 14&ndash;10 lead. <br/>\nNo more scoring ensued in the third, and the teams went to the fourth quarter with the game very much up for grabs.\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nLate in the fourth quarter, the Buckeyes looked to put the game away. [[Pepe Pearson]] broke a long run, leading the Buckeyes from inside their own five-yard line deep into ASU territory.  However, the drive stalled only three plays later, and OSU had to settle for a Josh Jackson field goal attempt.<br/>\nThat was not to be, as ASU's [[Brent Burnstein]] blocked the kick.  ASU [[Defensive end]] [[Derrick Rodgers]] took what appeared to be a lateral and ran the ball into the end zone, but the play was called back:  Rodgers had taken an illegal ''forward'' lateral.  The Sun Devils, however, had the ball with less than five minutes to play.<br/>\nJake Plummer, who had built a reputation over his college career for leading late comeback drives, did just that.  The key play was a fourth down conversion when Plummer hit wideout [[Lenzie Jackson]] for a big gain.  With just over a minute remaining, Plummer [[Quarterback scramble|scrambled]] for eleven yards and a touchdown on third-and-goal, and ASU took the lead, 17&ndash;14.<br/>\nHowever, Germaine was not done.  He led the Buckeyes on a remarkable [[Hurry-up offense#Two-minute drill|last-minute drive]].  Dimitrious Stanley caught two third-down passes from Germaine, and then, with the help of two pass interference penalties against ASU, the Bucks had the ball on the Devils\u2019 five-yard line.  Germaine then flipped a pass to the aforementioned Boston, who was left undefended on a zig-out route &mdash; ASU [[redshirt freshman]] corner [[Courtney Jackson]] had blown the coverage.  Boston walked into the end zone untouched, and the Buckeyes, with 19 seconds left, retook the lead, 20&ndash;17. On the next play, Burnstein blocked Josh Jackson's extra point, leaving the Sun Devils within a field goal.\n\nUltimately, Lenzie Jackson would be tackled in bounds by OSU's Antoine Winfield after catching a pass from Plummer on the second play of the ensuing drive, and time ran out.  The Buckeyes had won the Rose Bowl &mdash; their first victory in the Rose Bowl since [[Archie Griffin]]\u2019s sophomore season.\n\n==Scoring summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Scoring play\n!

The previously-third-ranked [[1996 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] would end up winning the national championship after defeating the then-top-ranked [[1996 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]] 52&ndash;20 in the [[1997 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. FSU had defeated the Gators earlier in the [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|season]] by a score of 24&ndash;21. Had the Sun Devils won the game, they would likely had a claim to at least the AP national championship, since they would have been the only undefeated team in the nation.  They ultimately finished fourth in both polls, behind Florida, Ohio State and Florida State.\n\nBuckeye quarterback Joe Germaine, who was named the game's Most Valuable Player, would go on to be named the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football|Big Ten's Most Valuable Player]] during his senior season of [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]].  Many of the players on both teams\u2019 rosters would go on to pro careers:  notably, [[Jake Plummer]], [[Pat Tillman]], [[Derek Smith (linebacker)|Derek Smith]], [[Jason Simmons]], [[Scott Von Der Ahe]], [[Steve Bush]], and [[Derrick Rodgers]] of Arizona State, and [[Mike Vrabel]], [[Shawn Springs]], [[Orlando Pace]], [[Antoine Winfield Sr.|Antoine Winfield]], [[Rob Kelly (American football)|Rob Kelly]] and [[Damon Moore]] of Ohio State.\n\n==Game notes==\n* The game was played in the rain\n* Ohio State head coach [[John Cooper (coach)|John Cooper]] became the first coach to lead a Big Ten and a Pac-10 team to Rose Bowl victories.  Previously, Cooper had led the Sun Devils to their only [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] victory, defeating [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] in the [[1987 Rose Bowl]] by a score of 22&ndash;15.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{1996 bowl game navbox}}\n{{Rose Bowl navbox}}\n{{Arizona State Sun Devils bowl game navbox}}\n{{Ohio State Buckeyes bowl game navbox}}\n\n[[Category:1996\u201397 NCAA football bowl games|Rose Bowl]]\n[[Category:Rose Bowl Game]]\n[[Category:Arizona State Sun Devils football bowl games]]\n[[Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football bowl games]]\n[[Category:January 1997 sports events in the United States]]\n[[Category:1997 in sports in California|Rose]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NCAA football yearly game\n |Game Name=Rose Bowl\n |Date Game Played=January 1\n |Year Game Played=1997\n |Football Season=1996\n |Optional Subheader = 83rd Rose Bowl Game\n |Home School=Arizona State University\n |Home Name Short=Arizona State\n |Home Nickname=Sun Devils\n<!-- Note: Standard format is for the won-loss record be from prior to the game, not after.
