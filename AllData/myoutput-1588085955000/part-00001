The southern border of Media, in that period, is named as the [[Elam]]ite region of Sima\u0161ki in present-day [[Lorestan Province]]. To the west and northwest, Media was bounded by the [[Zagros Mountains]] and from the east by the [[Dasht-e Kavir]] desert.

This allowed new peoples to pass through and settle. In addition [[Elam]], the dominant power in Iran, was suffering a period of severe weakness, as was [[Babylonia]] to the west.\n\nIn western and northwestern Iran and in areas further west prior to Median rule, there is evidence of the earlier political activity of the powerful societies of Elam, Mannaea, [[Assyria]] and [[Urartu]] .<ref name=\"dandamaev-lukonin-2-3\" /> There are various and up-dated opinions on the positions and activities of Iranian tribes in these societies and prior to the \"major Iranian state formations\" in the late 7th century BC.<ref name=\"dandamaev-lukonin-2-3\" /> One opinion (of Herzfeld, ''et al.'') is that the ruling class were \"Iranian migrants\" but the society was \"autonomous\" while another opinion (of Grantovsky, ''et al.'') holds that both the ruling class and basic elements of the population were Iranian.<ref>{{harv|Dandamaev|Lukonin|Kohl|Dadson|2004|p=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rhyton media.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Rhyton]] in the shape of a ram's head, gold \u2013 western Iran \u2013 Median, late 7th\u2013early 6th century BC]]\n[[File:Empire neo babylonien.png|thumb|right|The neighboring [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] at its greatest extent after the destruction of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n[[File:Median Empire Protoma.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Protoma in the form of a bull's head, 8th century BC, gold and filigree, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]]]]\n\n===Rise and fall===\nFrom the 10th to the late 7th centuries BC, the western parts of Media fell under the domination of the vast [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] based in northern [[Mesopotamia]], which stretched from [[Cyprus]] in the west, to parts of western Iran in the east, and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the north of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Assyrian kings such as [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]], [[Ashurbanipal]] and [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] imposed ''Vassal Treaties'' upon the Median rulers, and also protected them from predatory raids by marauding [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]].<ref>[[Georges Roux]], ''Ancient Iraq'', 1992{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Sinsharishkun]] (622\u2013612 BC), the Assyrian empire, which had been in a state of constant civil war since 626 BC, began to unravel. Subject peoples, such as the Medes, Babylonians, [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Egyptians]], Scythians, Cimmerians, [[Lydians]] and [[Arameans]] quietly ceased to pay tribute to Assyria.\n\nNeo-Assyrian dominance over the Medians came to an end during the reign of Median King [[Cyaxares]], who, in alliance with King [[Nabopolassar]] of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], attacked and destroyed the strife-riven empire between 616 and 609 BC.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Assyria/ Encyclopaedia Britannica] \"The last great Assyrian ruler was Ashurbanipal, but his last years and the period following his death, in 627 BCE, are obscure. The state was finally destroyed by a Chaldean-Median coalition in 612\u2013609 bce.\"</ref> The newfound alliance helped the Medes to capture [[Nineveh]] in 612 BC, which resulted in the eventual collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire by 609 BC. The Medes were subsequently able to establish their Median Kingdom (with [[Ecbatana]] as their royal capital) beyond their original homeland and had eventually a territory stretching roughly from northeastern Iran to the [[K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River]] in [[Anatolia]]. After the fall of Assyria between 616 BC and 609 BC, a unified Median state was formed, which together with Babylonia, [[Lydia]], and [[ancient Egypt]] became one of the four major powers of the [[ancient Near East]].\n\n[[Cyaxares]] was succeeded by his son King [[Astyages]]. In 553 BC, his maternal grandson [[Cyrus the Great]], the King of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]]/Persia, a Median vassal, [[Persian Revolt|revolted]] against Astyages. In 550 BC, Cyrus finally won a [[decisive victory]] resulting in Astyages' capture by his own dissatisfied nobles, who promptly turned him over to the triumphant Cyrus.<ref>{{cite book|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|first= Pierre|last= Briant|publisher= Eisenbrauns|year= 2006|page= 31}}</ref> After Cyrus's victory against Astyages, the Medes were subjected to their close kin, the Persians.<ref>Herodotus, ''The Histories'', p. 93.{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref> In the new empire they retained a prominent position; in honour and war, they stood next to the Persians; their court ceremony was adopted by the new sovereigns, who in the summer months resided in [[Ecbatana]]; and many noble Medes were employed as officials, [[satrap]]s and generals.\n\n===Median dynasty===\nThe list of Median rulers and their period of reign is compiled according to two sources. Firstly, Herodotus who calls them \"kings\" and associates them with the same family. Secondly, the Babylonian Chronicle which in \"Gadd's Chronicle on the Fall of Nineveh\" gives its own list. A combined list stretching over 150 years is thus:\n\n* [[Deioces]] (700\u2013647 BC)\n* [[Phraortes]] (647\u2013625 BC)\n* [[Scythians|Scythian]] rule (624\u2013597 BC)\n* [[Cyaxares]] (624\u2013585 BC)\n* [[Astyages]] (585\u2013549 BC)<ref name=\"Diakonoff1985\">{{harv|Diakonoff|1985|p=112}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all of these dates and personalities given by Herodotus match the other near eastern sources.<ref name=\"Diakonoff1985\" />\n\nIn Herodotus (book 1, chapters 95\u2013130), [[Deioces]] is introduced as the founder of a centralised Median state. He had been known to the Median people as \"a just and incorruptible man\" and when asked by the Median people to solve their possible disputes he agreed and put forward the condition that they make him \"king\" and build a great city at Ecbatana as the capital of the Median state.<ref>{{harv|Young|1988|p=16}}</ref> Judging from the contemporary sources of the region and disregarding<ref>{{harv|Young|1988|p=19}}</ref> the account of Herodotus puts the formation of a unified Median state during the reign of [[Cyaxares]] or later.<ref>{{harv|Young|1988|p=21}}</ref>\n\n==Culture and society==\nGreek references to \"Median\" people make no clear distinction between the \"Persians\" and the \"Medians\"; in fact for a Greek to become \"too closely associated with Iranian culture\" was \"to become Medianized, not Persianized\".<ref name=\"Young-p449\" /> The Median Kingdom was a short-lived Iranian state and the textual and archaeological sources of that period are rare and little could be known from the Median culture which nevertheless made a \"profound, and lasting, contribution to the greater world of Iranian culture\".<ref name=Young-p450>{{harv|Young|1997|p=450}}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Median language}}\nMedian people spoke the Median language, which was an Old Iranian language. [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'' (finished in the early first century) mentions the affinity of Median with other [[Iranian languages]]: \"The name of'' [[Ariana]] ''is further extended to a part of Persia and of Media, as also to the [[Bactria]]ns and [[Sogdia]]ns on the north; for these speak approximately the same language, but with slight variations\".<ref>Geography, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D8 Strab. 15.2.8]</ref>\n\nNo original deciphered text has been proven to have been written in the Median language. It is suggested that similar to the later Iranian practice of keeping archives of written documents in Achaemenid Iran, there was also a maintenance of archives by the Median government in their capital Ecbatana. There are examples of \"Median literature\" found in later records. One is according to Herodotus that the Median king Deioces, appearing as a judge, made judgement on causes submitted in writing. There is also a report by Dinon on the existence of \"Median court poets\".<ref>{{harv|Gershevitch|1968|p=2}}</ref> Median literature is part of the \"Old Iranian literature\" (including also Saka, Old Persian, Avestan) as this Iranian affiliation of them is explicit also in ancient texts, such as Herodotus's account<ref name=\"Herodotus-vii-62\"/> that many peoples including Medes were \"universally called Iranian\".<ref>{{harv|Gershevitch|1968|p=1}}</ref>\n\nWords of Median origin appear in various other Iranian dialects, including [[Old Persian]].

Primary sources pointing to religious affiliations of Medes found so far include the archaeological discoveries in Tepe Nush-e Jan, personal names of Median individuals, and the Histories of Herodotus. The archaeological source gives the earliest of the temple structures in Iran and the \"stepped fire altar\" discovered there is linked to the common Iranian legacy of the \"cult of fire\". Herodotus mentions [[Magi#In Iranian sources|Median Magi]] as a Median tribe providing priests for both the Medes and the Persians. They had a \"priestly caste\" which passed their functions from father to son. They played a significant role in the court of the Median king Astyages who had in his court certain Medians as \"advisers, dream interpreters, and soothsayers\".\n\nClassical historians \"unanimously\" regarded the Magi as priests of the Zoroastrian faith. From the personal names of Medes as recorded by Assyrians (in 8th and 9th centuries BC) there are examples of the use of the Indo-Iranian word ''arta-'' (lit. \"truth\") which is familiar from both Avestan and Old Persian and also examples of [[theophoric name]]s containing ''Ma\u017edakku'' and also the name \"Ahura Mazd\u0101\".<ref name=EIR-MediaReligion>{{harv|Dandamayev|Medvedskaya|2006|loc=Median Religion}}</ref> Scholars disagree whether these are indications of Zoroastrian religion amongst the Medes. [[Diakonoff]] believes that \"Astyages and perhaps even Cyaxares had already embraced a religion derived from the teachings of Zoroaster\" and [[Mary Boyce]] believes that \"the existence of the Magi in Media with their own traditions and forms of worship was an obstacle to Zoroastrian proselytizing there\".<ref name=EIR-MediaReligion/> Boyce wrote that the Zoroastrian traditions in the Median city of Ray probably goes back to the 8th century BC.<ref>{{harv|Boyce|Grenet|1991|p=81}}</ref> It is suggested that from the 8th century BC, a form of \"Mazdaism with common Iranian traditions\" existed in Media and the strict [[Zoroastrianism|reforms of Zarathustra]] began to spread in western Iran during the reign of the last Median kings in the 6th century BC.<ref name=EIR-MediaReligion/>\n\nIt has also been suggested{{by whom|date=November 2016}} that [[Mithra]] is a Median name and Medes may have practised [[Mithraism]] and had Mithra as their supreme deity.<ref>{{harv|Soudavar|2003|p=84}}</ref>\n\n==Kurds and Medes==\n{{main|Origin of the Kurds}}\n\nRussian historian and linguist [[Vladimir Minorsky]] suggested that the Medes, who widely inhabited the land where currently the [[Kurds]] form a majority, might have been forefathers of the modern Kurds. He also states that the Medes who invaded the region in the eighth century BC, linguistically resembled the Kurds. This view was accepted by many Kurdish nationalists in the twentieth century.

The southern border of Media, in that period, is named as the [[Elam]]ite region of Sima\u0161ki in present-day [[Lorestan Province]]. To the west and northwest, Media was bounded by the [[Zagros Mountains]] and from the east by the [[Dasht-e Kavir]] desert. This region of Media was ruled by the Assyrians and for them the region fell \"along the [[Great Khorasan Road]] from just east of Harhar to Alwand, and probably beyond.\"<ref name=\"Levine 1974 119\">{{harv|Levine|1974|p=119}}</ref> The location of Harhar is suggested to be \"the central or eastern\" [[Mahidasht District]] in [[Kermanshah Province]].<ref>{{harv|Levine|1974|p=117}}</ref>\n\nIts borders were limited in the north by the non-Iranian states of Gizilbunda and [[Mannea]], and to its south by [[Ellipi]] and [[Elam]].<ref name=\"Levine 1974 119\"/><ref name=\"Iranica\"/> Gizilbunda was located in the [[Qaflankuh Mountain Range|Qaflankuh Mountains]], and Ellipi was located in the south of modern Lorestan Province.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> On the east and southeast of Media, as described by the Assyrians, another land with the name of \"Patu\u0161arra\" appears. This land was located near a mountain range which the Assyrians call \"Bikni\" and describe as \"Lapis Lazuli Mountain\". There are differing opinions on the location of this mountain. [[Mount Damavand]] of [[Tehran]] and [[Alvand]] of Hamadan are two proposed sites. This location is the most remote eastern area that the Assyrians knew of or reached during their expansion until the beginning of the 7th century BC.<ref>{{harv|Levine|1974|pp=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nIn Achaemenid sources, specifically from the [[Behistun Inscription]] (2.76, 77\u201378), the capital of Media is [[Ecbatana]], called \"Hamgmat\u0101na-\" in Old Persian ([[Elamite language|Elamite]]:''Agmadana-''; Babylonian: ''Agamtanu-'') corresponding to modern-day [[Hamadan]].<ref>{{harv|Levine|1974|p=118}}</ref>\n\nThe other cities existing in Media were [[Laodicea (Mesopotamia)|Laodicea]] (modern [[Nahavand]])<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ayatollahi|first=Habibollah|title=The Book of Iran: The History of Iranian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Al0jpyRDGe8C&pg=PA93|year=2003|publisher=Alhoda UK|isbn=978-964-94491-4-2}}, page 93</ref> and the mound that was the largest city of the Medes, Rhages (present-day [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]).

This allowed new peoples to pass through and settle. In addition [[Elam]], the dominant power in Iran, was suffering a period of severe weakness, as was [[Babylonia]] to the west.\n\nIn western and northwestern Iran and in areas further west prior to Median rule, there is evidence of the earlier political activity of the powerful societies of Elam, Mannaea, [[Assyria]] and [[Urartu]] .<ref name=\"dandamaev-lukonin-2-3\" /> There are various and up-dated opinions on the positions and activities of Iranian tribes in these societies and prior to the \"major Iranian state formations\" in the late 7th century BC.<ref name=\"dandamaev-lukonin-2-3\" /> One opinion (of Herzfeld, ''et al.'') is that the ruling class were \"Iranian migrants\" but the society was \"autonomous\" while another opinion (of Grantovsky, ''et al.'') holds that both the ruling class and basic elements of the population were Iranian.<ref>{{harv|Dandamaev|Lukonin|Kohl|Dadson|2004|p=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rhyton media.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Rhyton]] in the shape of a ram's head, gold \u2013 western Iran \u2013 Median, late 7th\u2013early 6th century BC]]\n[[File:Empire neo babylonien.png|thumb|right|The neighboring [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] at its greatest extent after the destruction of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n[[File:Median Empire Protoma.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Protoma in the form of a bull's head, 8th century BC, gold and filigree, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]]]]\n\n===Rise and fall===\nFrom the 10th to the late 7th centuries BC, the western parts of Media fell under the domination of the vast [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] based in northern [[Mesopotamia]], which stretched from [[Cyprus]] in the west, to parts of western Iran in the east, and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the north of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Assyrian kings such as [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]], [[Ashurbanipal]] and [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] imposed ''Vassal Treaties'' upon the Median rulers, and also protected them from predatory raids by marauding [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]].<ref>[[Georges Roux]], ''Ancient Iraq'', 1992{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Sinsharishkun]] (622\u2013612 BC), the Assyrian empire, which had been in a state of constant civil war since 626 BC, began to unravel. Subject peoples, such as the Medes, Babylonians, [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Egyptians]], Scythians, Cimmerians, [[Lydians]] and [[Arameans]] quietly ceased to pay tribute to Assyria.\n\nNeo-Assyrian dominance over the Medians came to an end during the reign of Median King [[Cyaxares]], who, in alliance with King [[Nabopolassar]] of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], attacked and destroyed the strife-riven empire between 616 and 609 BC.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Assyria/ Encyclopaedia Britannica] \"The last great Assyrian ruler was Ashurbanipal, but his last years and the period following his death, in 627 BCE, are obscure. The state was finally destroyed by a Chaldean-Median coalition in 612\u2013609 bce.\"</ref> The newfound alliance helped the Medes to capture [[Nineveh]] in 612 BC, which resulted in the eventual collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire by 609 BC. The Medes were subsequently able to establish their Median Kingdom (with [[Ecbatana]] as their royal capital) beyond their original homeland and had eventually a territory stretching roughly from northeastern Iran to the [[K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River]] in [[Anatolia]]. After the fall of Assyria between 616 BC and 609 BC, a unified Median state was formed, which together with Babylonia, [[Lydia]], and [[ancient Egypt]] became one of the four major powers of the [[ancient Near East]].\n\n[[Cyaxares]] was succeeded by his son King [[Astyages]]. In 553 BC, his maternal grandson [[Cyrus the Great]], the King of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]]/Persia, a Median vassal, [[Persian Revolt|revolted]] against Astyages. In 550 BC, Cyrus finally won a [[decisive victory]] resulting in Astyages' capture by his own dissatisfied nobles, who promptly turned him over to the triumphant Cyrus.<ref>{{cite book|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|first= Pierre|last= Briant|publisher= Eisenbrauns|year= 2006|page= 31}}</ref> After Cyrus's victory against Astyages, the Medes were subjected to their close kin, the Persians.<ref>Herodotus, ''The Histories'', p. 93.{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref> In the new empire they retained a prominent position; in honour and war, they stood next to the Persians; their court ceremony was adopted by the new sovereigns, who in the summer months resided in [[Ecbatana]]; and many noble Medes were employed as officials, [[satrap]]s and generals.\n\n===Median dynasty===\nThe list of Median rulers and their period of reign is compiled according to two sources. Firstly, Herodotus who calls them \"kings\" and associates them with the same family. Secondly, the Babylonian Chronicle which in \"Gadd's Chronicle on the Fall of Nineveh\" gives its own list. A combined list stretching over 150 years is thus:\n\n* [[Deioces]] (700\u2013647 BC)\n* [[Phraortes]] (647\u2013625 BC)\n* [[Scythians|Scythian]] rule (624\u2013597 BC)\n* [[Cyaxares]] (624\u2013585 BC)\n* [[Astyages]] (585\u2013549 BC)<ref name=\"Diakonoff1985\">{{harv|Diakonoff|1985|p=112}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all of these dates and personalities given by Herodotus match the other near eastern sources.<ref name=\"Diakonoff1985\" />\n\nIn Herodotus (book 1, chapters 95\u2013130), [[Deioces]] is introduced as the founder of a centralised Median state. He had been known to the Median people as \"a just and incorruptible man\" and when asked by the Median people to solve their possible disputes he agreed and put forward the condition that they make him \"king\" and build a great city at Ecbatana as the capital of the Median state.<ref>{{harv|Young|1988|p=16}}</ref> Judging from the contemporary sources of the region and disregarding<ref>{{harv|Young|1988|p=19}}</ref> the account of Herodotus puts the formation of a unified Median state during the reign of [[Cyaxares]] or later.<ref>{{harv|Young|1988|p=21}}</ref>\n\n==Culture and society==\nGreek references to \"Median\" people make no clear distinction between the \"Persians\" and the \"Medians\"; in fact for a Greek to become \"too closely associated with Iranian culture\" was \"to become Medianized, not Persianized\".<ref name=\"Young-p449\" /> The Median Kingdom was a short-lived Iranian state and the textual and archaeological sources of that period are rare and little could be known from the Median culture which nevertheless made a \"profound, and lasting, contribution to the greater world of Iranian culture\".<ref name=Young-p450>{{harv|Young|1997|p=450}}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Median language}}\nMedian people spoke the Median language, which was an Old Iranian language.

It is suggested that similar to the later Iranian practice of keeping archives of written documents in Achaemenid Iran, there was also a maintenance of archives by the Median government in their capital Ecbatana. There are examples of \"Median literature\" found in later records. One is according to Herodotus that the Median king Deioces, appearing as a judge, made judgement on causes submitted in writing.

Primary sources pointing to religious affiliations of Medes found so far include the archaeological discoveries in Tepe Nush-e Jan, personal names of Median individuals, and the Histories of Herodotus. The archaeological source gives the earliest of the temple structures in Iran and the \"stepped fire altar\" discovered there is linked to the common Iranian legacy of the \"cult of fire\". Herodotus mentions [[Magi#In Iranian sources|Median Magi]] as a Median tribe providing priests for both the Medes and the Persians. They had a \"priestly caste\" which passed their functions from father to son. They played a significant role in the court of the Median king Astyages who had in his court certain Medians as \"advisers, dream interpreters, and soothsayers\".\n\nClassical historians \"unanimously\" regarded the Magi as priests of the Zoroastrian faith. From the personal names of Medes as recorded by Assyrians (in 8th and 9th centuries BC) there are examples of the use of the Indo-Iranian word ''arta-'' (lit. \"truth\") which is familiar from both Avestan and Old Persian and also examples of [[theophoric name]]s containing ''Ma\u017edakku'' and also the name \"Ahura Mazd\u0101\".<ref name=EIR-MediaReligion>{{harv|Dandamayev|Medvedskaya|2006|loc=Median Religion}}</ref> Scholars disagree whether these are indications of Zoroastrian religion amongst the Medes. [[Diakonoff]] believes that \"Astyages and perhaps even Cyaxares had already embraced a religion derived from the teachings of Zoroaster\" and [[Mary Boyce]] believes that \"the existence of the Magi in Media with their own traditions and forms of worship was an obstacle to Zoroastrian proselytizing there\".<ref name=EIR-MediaReligion/> Boyce wrote that the Zoroastrian traditions in the Median city of Ray probably goes back to the 8th century BC.<ref>{{harv|Boyce|Grenet|1991|p=81}}</ref> It is suggested that from the 8th century BC, a form of \"Mazdaism with common Iranian traditions\" existed in Media and the strict [[Zoroastrianism|reforms of Zarathustra]] began to spread in western Iran during the reign of the last Median kings in the 6th century BC.<ref name=EIR-MediaReligion/>\n\nIt has also been suggested{{by whom|date=November 2016}} that [[Mithra]] is a Median name and Medes may have practised [[Mithraism]] and had Mithra as their supreme deity.<ref>{{harv|Soudavar|2003|p=84}}</ref>\n\n==Kurds and Medes==\n{{main|Origin of the Kurds}}\n\nRussian historian and linguist [[Vladimir Minorsky]] suggested that the Medes, who widely inhabited the land where currently the [[Kurds]] form a majority, might have been forefathers of the modern Kurds. He also states that the Medes who invaded the region in the eighth century BC, linguistically resembled the Kurds. This view was accepted by many Kurdish nationalists in the twentieth century. However, [[Martin van Bruinessen]], a Dutch scholar, argues against the attempt to take the Medes as ancestors of the Kurds.<ref name=\"Ozoglu25\">Hakan \u00d6zo\u011flu, ''Kurdish notables and the Ottoman state: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries'', SUNY Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CttLWEaTrJUC&pg=PA25&dq=%22many+Kurdish+nationalists+in+the+twentieth+century%22&hl=en&ei=0TQ_TpexHKWImQXU-dSSCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22many%20Kurdish%20nationalists%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century%22&f=false p. 25.]</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Though some Kurdish intellectuals claim that their people are descended from the Medes, there is no evidence to permit such a connection across the considerable gap in time between the political dominance of the Medes and the first attestation of the Kurds\" - van Bruinessen</blockquote>\n\nContemporary linguistic evidence has challenged the previously suggested view that the Kurds are descendants of the Medes.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cxr_vqpwVUkC&pg=PA61&dq=%22kurds+are+descendants%22#v=onepage&q=%22kurds%20are%20descendants%22&f=false|title=Turkey Foreign Policy and Government Guide|work=google.com|date=April 2003|isbn=9780739762820}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EzzYk_gzpJ0C&pg=PA59&dq=%22kurds+are+descendants%22#v=onepage&q=%22kurds%20are%20descendants%22&f=false|title=Turkey|work=google.com|isbn=9781419191268|last1=Division|first1=Federal Research|year=2004}}</ref> [[Gernot Windfuhr]], professor of Iranian Studies, identified the [[Kurdish languages]] as [[Parthian language|Parthian]], albeit with a [[Median language|Median]] substratum.<ref>Windfuhr, Gernot (1975), \"Isoglosses: A Sketch on Persians and Parthians, Kurds and Medes\", Monumentum H.S.
