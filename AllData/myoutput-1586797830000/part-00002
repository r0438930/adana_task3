Che Why]] and [[Supercluster (band)|Supercluster]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nHay was born on January 28, 1950, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] to a postal worker and housewife. He attended [[Aquinas College (Michigan)|Aquinas College]] (Grand Rapids) and worked as a school teacher and as a statistician prior to divorcing his first wife and  moving to [[Kennebunkport, Maine]].\n\n===As musician===\n\nHay was convinced by [[Ken Starratt]] to move to [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], Georgia, from Maine after making a trip to Athens in the late 1970s and surveying the blossoming music scene. Bob met other local musicians including roommate \"Big\" Al Walsh, [[Mig Little]] and [[Diana Torell]] and formed the band the Squalls. They were well known for switching instruments and singing duties during their shows. In 1986, they were featured in the movie ''[[Athens, GA: Inside Out]]''. The Squalls underwent various lineup changes after Mig Little left the band. They were joined by [[Mark Cooper Smith]], Juan Molina, Paul Hammond and others at various times during their career. The Squalls made a self-released e.p. and single, as well as two albums for [[Dog Gone It Records]]-a label owned by [[Jefferson Holt]], the manager for [[R.E.M.|REM]]. The Squalls made several trips up and down the East coast of the U.S. and a trip through the mid-West before disbanding.\n\nHay never stopped jamming with his friends and briefly performed with a project called the Yams who learned covers of songs in hopes of playing bars and fraternity parties. This is where he began his association with multi-instrumentalist [[Bill David]], a local musician with deep roots in the community.\n\nBob Hay & the Jolly Beggars began as a solo project. Hay became fascinated with the works of [[Robert Burns]], the 18th century Scottish bard, after a random comment which was made during a jam session. He found songs by Robert Burns at the [[University of Georgia]] library and began to learn and arrange them. Other former members of the Squalls, including Ken Starratt's youngest son Gabriel Fricks-Starratt, became interested and joined. They have released 3 CDs and perform sporadically in and around Athens, Georgia.\n\nNoogeez was dreamed up by Ken Starratt as a way to use Bob's older Squalls material in a kid-friendly format. 2 videos have been made so far using this material. Members of this band include  Ken and [[Jorma Starratt]], Ken's son.  Their first video, \"Kathy\", won the audience choice award during the 2007 [[Athfest]] [[Sprocket]]s competition.\n\n''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi7Wtx336nU A.
