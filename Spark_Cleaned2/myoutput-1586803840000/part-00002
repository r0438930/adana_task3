In Kosovo the ethnic cleansing was carried out by Serbs \u2013 the opponents of secession; In Abkhazia it was committed by the secessionists. While the right of return of refugees to Kosovo was a precondition for self-determination, in Abkhazia the self-determination is linked with the refusal to allow the return of internally displaced people. Abkhaz separatists rejected several peace plans proposed by Georgia, the [[United Nations]], and [[Germany]]; while in Kosovo it was Serbia that rejected peace efforts. After the war, Kosovo was ruled by U.N. administration; while Abkhazia denies international organizations entry.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/09/16/abkhazias_independence_farce |title=Abkhazia's Independence Farce |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen F.

This illustrated the region\u2019s limited political autonomy, which was underlined by the unchallengeable presence of the Russian military. That court decision supported the contention that South Ossetia is a not a real state, but a Russian vassal. South Ossetia's borders are controlled by Russia. There is no South Ossetian foreign policy. South Ossetia does not have the functions of a state to provide for its citizens. There is little popular support for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/stephen-f-jones/south-ossetia%E2%80%99s-unwanted-independence |title=South Ossetia's unwanted independence |date=10 June 2014 |publisher=openDemocracy}}</ref>\n\n=== Other events ===\nAbkhazia said it would not take part in the \"Geneva Talks on Security and Stability in the Caucasus\" in June 2010 because of concerns over the objectivity of the co-chairmen who were representatives of the UN, the EU, and OSCE.

In Kosovo the ethnic cleansing was carried out by Serbs \u2013 the opponents of secession; In Abkhazia it was committed by the secessionists. While the right of return of refugees to Kosovo was a precondition for self-determination, in Abkhazia the self-determination is linked with the refusal to allow the return of internally displaced people. Abkhaz separatists rejected several peace plans proposed by Georgia, the [[United Nations]], and [[Germany]]; while in Kosovo it was Serbia that rejected peace efforts. After the war, Kosovo was ruled by U.N. administration; while Abkhazia denies international organizations entry.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/09/16/abkhazias_independence_farce |title=Abkhazia's Independence Farce |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen F.

This illustrated the region\u2019s limited political autonomy, which was underlined by the unchallengeable presence of the Russian military. That court decision supported the contention that South Ossetia is a not a real state, but a Russian vassal. South Ossetia's borders are controlled by Russia. There is no South Ossetian foreign policy. South Ossetia does not have the functions of a state to provide for its citizens. There is little popular support for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/stephen-f-jones/south-ossetia%E2%80%99s-unwanted-independence |title=South Ossetia's unwanted independence |date=10 June 2014 |publisher=openDemocracy}}</ref>\n\n=== Other events ===\nAbkhazia said it would not take part in the \"Geneva Talks on Security and Stability in the Caucasus\" in June 2010 because of concerns over the objectivity of the co-chairmen who were representatives of the UN, the EU, and OSCE.
