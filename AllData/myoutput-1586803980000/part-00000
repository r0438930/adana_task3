[[List of awards and nominations received by Amy Adams|Her accolades]] include two [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], and nominations for six [[Academy Awards]] and seven [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\nBorn in [[Vicenza|Vicenza, Italy]], and raised in [[Castle Rock, Colorado]], Adams is the fourth of seven siblings. She trained to be a ballerina, but at age 18, she found musical theater a better fit, and from 1994 to 1998, she worked in [[dinner theater]]. She made her feature film debut with a supporting part in the 1999 satire ''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous (film)|Drop Dead Gorgeous]]''. After moving to Los Angeles, she made guest appearances in television and took on \"mean girl\" parts in small-scale features. Her first major role came in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2002 biopic ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', opposite [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], but she was unemployed for a year afterward. Her breakthrough came in the part of a loquacious pregnant woman in the 2005 independent film ''[[Junebug (film)|Junebug]]''.\n\nThe 2007 musical ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'', in which Adams played a cheerful princess, was her first major success as a leading lady. She followed it by playing na\u00efve, optimistic women in a series of films such as the 2008 drama ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]''. She subsequently played stronger parts to positive reviews in the sports film ''[[The Fighter]]'' (2010) and the psychological drama ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' (2012). In 2013, she began portraying [[Lois Lane]] in superhero films set in the [[DC Extended Universe]]. She won two consecutive [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress]] for playing a seductive con artist in the crime film ''[[American Hustle]]'' (2013) and the painter [[Margaret Keane]] in the biopic ''[[Big Eyes]]'' (2014). Further acclaim came for playing a linguist in the science fiction film ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'' (2016), a self-harming reporter in the miniseries ''[[Sharp Objects (miniseries)|Sharp Objects]]'' (2018), and [[Lynne Cheney]] in the satirical film ''[[Vice (2018 film)|Vice]]'' (2018).\n\nAdams's stage roles include [[the Public Theater]]'s revival of ''[[Into the Woods]]'' in 2012, in which she played the Baker's Wife. In 2014, she was named one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and featured in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] list. She is married to actor and artist Darren Le Gallo, with whom she has a daughter.\n\n==Early life==\nAmy Lou Adams was born on August 20, 1974, to American parents Richard and Kathryn Adams, when her father was stationed with the [[United States Army]] at the [[Caserma Ederle]] military complex in [[Vicenza]], Italy.<ref name=\"biography-com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/amy-adams-20883223 |title=Amy Adams Biography: Actress (1974) |publisher=[[Biography (TV program)|Biography]] |access-date=December 23, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113135641/http://www.biography.com/people/amy-adams-20883223 |archive-date=January 13, 2015 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"VF-2008nov\">{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Shnayerson|author-link=Michael Shnayerson|title=Some Enchanted Amy|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/11/amyadams200811|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=December 18, 2008|access-date=December 31, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218105250/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/11/amyadams200811|archive-date=December 18, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the middle of seven children, with four brothers and two sisters.<ref name=\"TDT-2007nov16\">{{cite news|first=Naomi |last=West |title=Amy Adams: Happily ever after |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669358/Amy-Adams-Happily-ever-after.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=November 16, 2007 |access-date=December 31, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214212134/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669358/Amy-Adams-Happily-ever-after.html |archive-date=February 14, 2009 |df=}}</ref> After moving from one army base to another, Adams's family settled in [[Castle Rock, Colorado]], when she was eight.<ref name=\"VF-2008nov\"/> After leaving the army, her father sang professionally in nightclubs and restaurants.<ref name=\"TDT-2007nov16\"/><ref name=\"esquire\">{{cite news|last=Bilmes|first=Alex|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film/news/a5469/amy-adams-interview-esquire-american-hustle/|title=Amy Adams Interview: Esquire Meets The Star Of 'American Hustle'|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=December 18, 2013|access-date=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921144022/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film/news/a5469/amy-adams-interview-esquire-american-hustle/|archive-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> Adams has described going to her father's shows and drinking [[Shirley Temple (drink)|Shirley Temples]] at the bar as among her fondest childhood memories.<ref name=\"TOCR-2007nov17\">{{cite news|first=Barry |last=Koltnow |title='Enchanted' with Amy Adams. |url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/entertainment/abox/article_1924507.php |work=[[The Orange County Register]] |date=November 17, 2007 |access-date=December 31, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120052642/http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/entertainment/abox/article_1924507.php |archive-date=November 20, 2007 |df=}}</ref> The family was poor;

She made her feature film debut with a supporting part in the 1999 satire ''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous (film)|Drop Dead Gorgeous]]''. After moving to Los Angeles, she made guest appearances in television and took on \"mean girl\" parts in small-scale features.

Her breakthrough came in the part of a loquacious pregnant woman in the 2005 independent film ''[[Junebug (film)|Junebug]]''.\n\nThe 2007 musical ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'', in which Adams played a cheerful princess, was her first major success as a leading lady. She followed it by playing na\u00efve, optimistic women in a series of films such as the 2008 drama ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]''. She subsequently played stronger parts to positive reviews in the sports film ''[[The Fighter]]'' (2010) and the psychological drama ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' (2012). In 2013, she began portraying [[Lois Lane]] in superhero films set in the [[DC Extended Universe]]. She won two consecutive [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress]] for playing a seductive con artist in the crime film ''[[American Hustle]]'' (2013) and the painter [[Margaret Keane]] in the biopic ''[[Big Eyes]]'' (2014). Further acclaim came for playing a linguist in the science fiction film ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'' (2016), a self-harming reporter in the miniseries ''[[Sharp Objects (miniseries)|Sharp Objects]]'' (2018), and [[Lynne Cheney]] in the satirical film ''[[Vice (2018 film)|Vice]]'' (2018).\n\nAdams's stage roles include [[the Public Theater]]'s revival of ''[[Into the Woods]]'' in 2012, in which she played the Baker's Wife.
