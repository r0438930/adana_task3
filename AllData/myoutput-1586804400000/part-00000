With a distinct vocal range, songwriting and producing talent, B\u00e1rbara has defined the modern [[Grupero]] performance and is one of the few regional Mexican acts to garner an international following that extends beyond M\u00e9xico and the United States.\n\nIn the past two decades, B\u00e1rbara has released eleven [[studio albums]], eighteen [[compilation album]]s, over thirty music videos, and four music video DVDs.

She was particularly influenced and inspired by her older sister, Viviana Ugalde, who was a popular singer locally. Today, Ugalde represents B\u00e1rbara as part of her management team.<ref name=\"tvazteca.com\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1pkMZQ80bc Ana B\u00e1rbara \u2013 Historias engarzadas]. tvazteca.com.

She also earned the ''El Rostro Bonito de El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico'' (\"The Heraldo's Beautiful Face\") award. As a result, she was invited to perform for [[Pope John Paul II]] during a Mass at The Vatican. When Mass neared its close; however, she still hadn't been given an opportunity to sing, so she interrupted the proceedings, commanded the attention of the Pope, and began to sing. After mass [[Pope John Paul II]] approached her, blessed her, and wished her luck in her career.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In 1994, she was noticed by record executives from [[Fonovisa]], one of the top labels in the [[regional Mexican]] market. After signing with Fonovisa, she created artistic stage name \"Ana B\u00e1rbara\" and launched her self-titled debut album ''[[Ana B\u00e1rbara (Ana B\u00e1rbara album)|Ana B\u00e1rbara]]''. The album was produced and largely written by An\u00edbal Pastor; it also included songwriting from fellow Mexican singer [[Joan Sebastian]]. Songs like ''Sac\u00fademe'' and ''Nada'' helped B\u00e1rbara establish herself as a Grupero star.<ref>[http://www.fonovisa.com Fonovisa]. Fonovisa.

''La Trampa'' catapulted her popularity and immediately became a commercial and radio hit. B\u00e1rbara received industry accolades as well as invitations to tour and open for some of the biggest regional Mexican artists, such as [[Vicente Fernandez]] and [[Los Tigres del Norte]]. She has appeared on important Latin American television shows such as ''[[Sabado Gigante]]'' and ''[[Siempre en Domingo]]''. Consecutive hits and popular music videos, such as ''Me Asusta Pero Me Gusta'' and ''La Trampa'', topped [[Hot Latin Tracks|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks]] and established her as ''La Reina Grupera'' (The Queen of Grupero Music).\n\n===International stardom===\nBy the summer of 1996, B\u00e1rbara broke through to mainstream international success with third album ''Ay, Amor''. The album solidified her as a successful Latin recording artist and also became her best album debut on the Latin ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual\">[http://www.laopinion.com/ana-barbara-baila-sensual-fans Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual]. Terra.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> ''Ay, Amor'' offered a wider appeal to her music by offering some alternate takes on Grupero, and even some ranchero flavored ballads like ''No Ha Sido Facil'', and ''Entre Ella y Yo''.<ref name=\"Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual\"/> Her attractive appearance and sensual dancing style captivated [[Latin America]] audiences during promotional tours with hit singles and music videos of ''No Llorar\u00e9'' and ''Ya No Te Creo Nada''. In 1997 she released her first and only calendar. ''[[Coors Light]]'' beer also selected B\u00e1rbara as their Hispanic promotional figure for marketing and advertising. Later that year she returned to [[Miami]], Florida for the annual ''Calle 8 Music Festival'' where she was crowned \"Queen\" of the 1997 parade. In 1998, she released her fourth studio album produced by Mexican singer-songwriter [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]]. The album, titled ''Los Besos No Se Dan En La Camisa'', was largely a ballads album with only one Grupero-style song. It included a duet and background vocals by Sol\u00eds, as well as a 1982 [[Los Bukis]] cover of \"Como Me Haces Falta\", which quickly became a popular hit. The song also dominated airwaves across [[Latin America]], [[M\u00e9xico]], and the [[United States]]. Ana B\u00e1rbara kept up the momentum of her previous release as her popularity continued to grow. In 1999, she released fifth studio album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n,'' produced by An\u00edbal Pastor.  One of his two songwriting credits, \"Enga\u00f1ada\", became the album's lead single and most popular hit. ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n'' was also notable in songwriting terms because it marked Ana B\u00e1rbara's debut as a songwriter.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In the same year she also debuted as an actress, starring in the made-for-TV film ''Todo Contigo,'' via Hispanic networks [[Televisa]] and [[Univision]]. The film's song \"Todo Contigo\" was included in album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n.'' Music videos like \"Quise Olvidar\" grew in popularity on television shows like ''Onda Max'' and other [[music video]] television networks. The following year B\u00e1rbara became the first solo grupero act recognized by The [[Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences]] for album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n,'' which received a Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Grupero Album|Best Grupero Album]].\n\nIn 2000, B\u00e1rbara took a short maternity leave when her first child, Emiliano, was born. She returned in 2001 with her sixth studio album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia.'' The Mariachi-ballad effort was a challenge to her custom Grupero style; however, industry critics who had written off B\u00e1rbara as simply \"a grupero novelty built chiefly upon sex appeal\" consequently took her and her music a bit more seriously. In the fall, she received her second Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album|Best Ranchero Album]]. She  participated in \"[[El \u00daltimo Adi\u00f3s]] (The Last Goodbye)\", a song written in memory of the [[9/11]] attacks, which included other artists, such as [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]], [[Thal\u00eda]], and [[Ricky Martin]], among others. As B\u00e1rbara promoted her album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia'', she began preparations for a Grupero-style album.<ref name=AllMusicBio/>\n\nAfter several years as a recording artist, B\u00e1rbara began to produce her own material. She took control of the direction of her music and began to compose, arrange, and select her own lyrics and melodies, yet followed patterns of earlier albums.\n\nIn September 2003, ''Te Atrapar\u00e9...Bandido'' was released; it became one of her most successful albums to date. Soon record executives pushed for a follow-up album, and in May 2005 she produced and released ''Loca de Amar''.  She continued booking success with popular chart-topping singles like ''Bandido'', ''Deja'', ''Loca'', and ''Lo Busqu\u00e9'', which dominated airwaves across South America, Mexico, and the United States, as well as on ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks.\n\n===Selena tribute concert===\nIn April 2005, she participated in ''[[Selena \u00a1VIVE!]]'', an anniversary tribute concert held in honor of Latin music icon [[Selena]]. The star-studded event was held on April 7, 2005 at [[Reliant Stadium]] in Houston, Texas and included mainstream acts, such as [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Ana Gabriel]], [[Alejandra Guzman]], [[Olga Tanon]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], and [[Banda el Recodo]], among others. The iconic tribute was produced by Spanish-language network [[Univision]], and made history by becoming the most watched Spanish-language television special in the US. B\u00e1rbara produced and co-wrote a new version of \"[[La Carcacha]]\", which mixed Selena's original version with her Grupero signature style.\n\n===2005 Latin Grammy recognition===\n[[File:Ana B\u00e1rbara 2005.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Ana B\u00e1rbara in the z\u00f3calo of Cholula, [[Puebla]] in 2005.

With a distinct vocal range, songwriting and producing talent, B\u00e1rbara has defined the modern [[Grupero]] performance and is one of the few regional Mexican acts to garner an international following that extends beyond M\u00e9xico and the United States.\n\nIn the past two decades, B\u00e1rbara has released eleven [[studio albums]], eighteen [[compilation album]]s, over thirty music videos, and four music video DVDs.

She was particularly influenced and inspired by her older sister, Viviana Ugalde, who was a popular singer locally. Today, Ugalde represents B\u00e1rbara as part of her management team.<ref name=\"tvazteca.com\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1pkMZQ80bc Ana B\u00e1rbara \u2013 Historias engarzadas]. tvazteca.com.

She also earned the ''El Rostro Bonito de El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico'' (\"The Heraldo's Beautiful Face\") award. As a result, she was invited to perform for [[Pope John Paul II]] during a Mass at The Vatican. When Mass neared its close; however, she still hadn't been given an opportunity to sing, so she interrupted the proceedings, commanded the attention of the Pope, and began to sing. After mass [[Pope John Paul II]] approached her, blessed her, and wished her luck in her career.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In 1994, she was noticed by record executives from [[Fonovisa]], one of the top labels in the [[regional Mexican]] market. After signing with Fonovisa, she created artistic stage name \"Ana B\u00e1rbara\" and launched her self-titled debut album ''[[Ana B\u00e1rbara (Ana B\u00e1rbara album)|Ana B\u00e1rbara]]''. The album was produced and largely written by An\u00edbal Pastor; it also included songwriting from fellow Mexican singer [[Joan Sebastian]]. Songs like ''Sac\u00fademe'' and ''Nada'' helped B\u00e1rbara establish herself as a Grupero star.<ref>[http://www.fonovisa.com Fonovisa]. Fonovisa. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> B\u00e1rbara released her second album titled ''[[La Trampa (Ana B\u00e1rbara album)|La Trampa]]'' in July 1995, also produced by An\u00edbal Pastor. ''La Trampa'' catapulted her popularity and immediately became a commercial and radio hit. B\u00e1rbara received industry accolades as well as invitations to tour and open for some of the biggest regional Mexican artists, such as [[Vicente Fernandez]] and [[Los Tigres del Norte]]. She has appeared on important Latin American television shows such as ''[[Sabado Gigante]]'' and ''[[Siempre en Domingo]]''. Consecutive hits and popular music videos, such as ''Me Asusta Pero Me Gusta'' and ''La Trampa'', topped [[Hot Latin Tracks|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks]] and established her as ''La Reina Grupera'' (The Queen of Grupero Music).\n\n===International stardom===\nBy the summer of 1996, B\u00e1rbara broke through to mainstream international success with third album ''Ay, Amor''. The album solidified her as a successful Latin recording artist and also became her best album debut on the Latin ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual\">[http://www.laopinion.com/ana-barbara-baila-sensual-fans Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual]. Terra.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-22.</ref> ''Ay, Amor'' offered a wider appeal to her music by offering some alternate takes on Grupero, and even some ranchero flavored ballads like ''No Ha Sido Facil'', and ''Entre Ella y Yo''.<ref name=\"Ana B\u00e1rbara, b\u00e1rbaramente sensual\"/> Her attractive appearance and sensual dancing style captivated [[Latin America]] audiences during promotional tours with hit singles and music videos of ''No Llorar\u00e9'' and ''Ya No Te Creo Nada''. In 1997 she released her first and only calendar. ''[[Coors Light]]'' beer also selected B\u00e1rbara as their Hispanic promotional figure for marketing and advertising. Later that year she returned to [[Miami]], Florida for the annual ''Calle 8 Music Festival'' where she was crowned \"Queen\" of the 1997 parade. In 1998, she released her fourth studio album produced by Mexican singer-songwriter [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]]. The album, titled ''Los Besos No Se Dan En La Camisa'', was largely a ballads album with only one Grupero-style song. It included a duet and background vocals by Sol\u00eds, as well as a 1982 [[Los Bukis]] cover of \"Como Me Haces Falta\", which quickly became a popular hit. The song also dominated airwaves across [[Latin America]], [[M\u00e9xico]], and the [[United States]]. Ana B\u00e1rbara kept up the momentum of her previous release as her popularity continued to grow. In 1999, she released fifth studio album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n,'' produced by An\u00edbal Pastor.  One of his two songwriting credits, \"Enga\u00f1ada\", became the album's lead single and most popular hit. ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n'' was also notable in songwriting terms because it marked Ana B\u00e1rbara's debut as a songwriter.<ref name=AllMusicBio/> In the same year she also debuted as an actress, starring in the made-for-TV film ''Todo Contigo,'' via Hispanic networks [[Televisa]] and [[Univision]]. The film's song \"Todo Contigo\" was included in album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n.'' Music videos like \"Quise Olvidar\" grew in popularity on television shows like ''Onda Max'' and other [[music video]] television networks. The following year B\u00e1rbara became the first solo grupero act recognized by The [[Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences]] for album ''Tu Decisi\u00f3n,'' which received a Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Grupero Album|Best Grupero Album]].\n\nIn 2000, B\u00e1rbara took a short maternity leave when her first child, Emiliano, was born. She returned in 2001 with her sixth studio album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia.'' The Mariachi-ballad effort was a challenge to her custom Grupero style; however, industry critics who had written off B\u00e1rbara as simply \"a grupero novelty built chiefly upon sex appeal\" consequently took her and her music a bit more seriously. In the fall, she received her second Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album|Best Ranchero Album]]. She  participated in \"[[El \u00daltimo Adi\u00f3s]] (The Last Goodbye)\", a song written in memory of the [[9/11]] attacks, which included other artists, such as [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]], [[Thal\u00eda]], and [[Ricky Martin]], among others. As B\u00e1rbara promoted her album, ''Te Regalo La Lluvia'', she began preparations for a Grupero-style album.<ref name=AllMusicBio/>\n\nAfter several years as a recording artist, B\u00e1rbara began to produce her own material. She took control of the direction of her music and began to compose, arrange, and select her own lyrics and melodies, yet followed patterns of earlier albums.\n\nIn September 2003, ''Te Atrapar\u00e9...Bandido'' was released; it became one of her most successful albums to date. Soon record executives pushed for a follow-up album, and in May 2005 she produced and released ''Loca de Amar''.  She continued booking success with popular chart-topping singles like ''Bandido'', ''Deja'', ''Loca'', and ''Lo Busqu\u00e9'', which dominated airwaves across South America, Mexico, and the United States, as well as on ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks.\n\n===Selena tribute concert===\nIn April 2005, she participated in ''[[Selena \u00a1VIVE!]]'', an anniversary tribute concert held in honor of Latin music icon [[Selena]]. The star-studded event was held on April 7, 2005 at [[Reliant Stadium]] in Houston, Texas and included mainstream acts, such as [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Ana Gabriel]], [[Alejandra Guzman]], [[Olga Tanon]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], and [[Banda el Recodo]], among others. The iconic tribute was produced by Spanish-language network [[Univision]], and made history by becoming the most watched Spanish-language television special in the US. B\u00e1rbara produced and co-wrote a new version of \"[[La Carcacha]]\", which mixed Selena's original version with her Grupero signature style.\n\n===2005 Latin Grammy recognition===\n[[File:Ana B\u00e1rbara 2005.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Ana B\u00e1rbara in the z\u00f3calo of Cholula, [[Puebla]] in 2005.
