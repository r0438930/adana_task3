{"title_page": "History of Trinidad and Tobago", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Culture of Trinidad and Tobago}}\nThe '''history of Trinidad and Tobago''' begins with the settlements of the islands by [[Amerindian]]s, specifically the [[Island Caribs|Island Carib]] and [[Arawak]] peoples. Both islands were visited by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] in 1498 and claimed in the name of Spain. Trinidad remained in [[Spain|Spanish]] hands until 1797, but it was largely settled by French colonists. Tobago changed hands between the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]], [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]], and [[Courland colonization of the Americas|Courlanders]], but eventually ended up in British hands following the second [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]]. In 1889 the two islands were incorporated into a single [[British Empire|crown colony]].<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11332/ |title = Railroad Map of Trinidad |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1925 |accessdate = 25 October 2013 }}</ref> Trinidad and Tobago obtained its independence\nfrom the British Empire in 1962 and became a [[republic]] in 1976.\n\n==Pre-Columbian period==\n\n[[File:Tobago jade ceremonial ax.jpg|thumb|Green stone ceremonial axe. From [[shell midden]], Mt Irvine Bay, Tobago, 1957]]\n\nHuman settlement in [[Trinidad]] dates back at least 7,000 years. The earliest settlers, termed Archaic or [[Ortoiroid people|Ortoiroid]], are believed to have settled Trinidad and Tobago from northeastern South America around 4000 BCE. Twenty-nine Archaic sites have been identified, mostly in south Trinidad and Tobago; this includes the 7,000-year-old [[Banwari Trace]] site which is the oldest discovered human settlement in the eastern Caribbean.  Archaic populations were pre-ceramic, and dominated the area until about 200 BCE.<ref name=\"Reid 2008\">{{Cite book|title=Archaeology and geoinformatics : case studies from the Caribbean|last=Reid|first=Basil|publisher=University of Alabama Press|others=Reid, Basil A., 1961-|year=2008|isbn=9780817380533|location=Tuscaloosa|pages=33\u201373|chapter=Developing Weights-of-Evidence Predictive Models for the Cultural Resource Management of Pre-Columbian Sites in Trinidad|oclc=567999135}}</ref>\n\nAround 250 BCE the first ceramic-using people in the Caribbean, the [[Saladoid]] people, entered Trinidad and Tobago.  The earliest evidence of these people come from around 2100 BCE along the banks of the [[Orinoco]] River in [[Venezuela]]. From Trinidad and Tobago, they are believed to have moved north into the remaining islands of the Caribbean. Thirty-seven Saladoid sites have been identified in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and are located all over the island.<ref name=\"Reid 2008\"/>\n\nAfter 250 CE a third group, called the [[Barrancoid]] people settled in southern Trinidad and Tobago after migrating up the Orinoco River toward the sea. The oldest Barrancoid settlement appears to have been at [[Erin, Trinidad and Tobago|Erin]], on the south coast.<ref name=\"Reid 2008\"/>\n\nFollowing the collapse of Barrancoid communities along the Orinoco around 650 CE, a new group, called the Arauquinoid expanded up the river to the coast. The cultural artefacts of this group were only partly adopted in Trinidad and Tobago and adjacent areas of northeast Venezuela, and as a result, this culture is called Guayabitoid in these areas.<ref name=\" Reid 2008\"/>\n\nAround 1300 CE a new group appears to have settled in Trinidad and Tobago and introduced new cultural attributes which largely replaced the Guayabitoid culture. Termed the Mayoid cultural tradition, this represents the native tribes which were present in Trinidad and Tobago at the time of European arrival. Their distinct pottery and artefacts survive until 1800, but after this time they were largely assimilated into mainstream Trinidad and Tobago society. These included the Nepoya and Suppoya (who were probably [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking) and the Yao (who were probably [[Carib language|Carib]]-speaking). They have generally been called [[Arawak people|Arawak]]s and [[Island Caribs|Carib]]s. These were largely wiped out by the Spanish colonisers under the [[encomienda]] system. Under this system which was basically a form of slavery, Spanish encomederos forced the Amerindians to work for them in exchange for Spanish \"protection\" and conversion to Christianity. The survivors were first organised into [[Spanish missions in Trinidad|Missions]] by the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friars]], and then gradually assimilated.<ref name=\"Reid 2008\"/>\n\n==Spanish period==\n{{Main|Spanish West Indies}}\n\n===The arrival of Columbus===\nThe first ever contact with Europeans occurred when Christopher Columbus, who was on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] of exploration, arrived at noon on 31 July 1498.<ref>Carmichael (1961).</ref> He landed at a harbor he called Point Galera, while naming the island Trinidad, before proceeding into the [[Gulf of Paria]] via the [[Columbus Channel|Serpent's Mouth]] and the Caribbean Sea via [[Bocas del Dragon|Dragon's Mouth]].<ref name=\"Eric\">{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Eric|title=History of the People of Trinidad and Tobago|date=1942|publisher=Eworld Inc.|location=Buffalo|isbn=9781617590108|pages=1\u20134}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}\n\n===Colonial settlement of Trinidad===\nTrinidad is reported to have been densely populated at the beginning of the colonial period. Although in 1510 Trinidad was said to have the only \"peaceful Indians\" along the whole South American coast, demand for slaves to supply the [[pearl]]-fisheries in nearby [[Isla Margarita]] led to them being declared \"Caribs\" (and thus, fair game for [[slavery|slavers]]) in 1511. As a consequence of this, Trinidad and Tobago became the focus of [[Spain|Spanish]] slaving raids, primarily to supply Margarita's pearl fisheries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Romero|first1=Aldemaro|title=Death and Taxes: the Case of the Depletion of Pearl Oyster Beds in Sixteenth-Century Venezuela|journal=Conservation Biology|date=2003|volume=17|issue=4|page=1016|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.01406.x|url=https://spark.siue.edu/bio_fac/408}}</ref>\n\nIn 1530 [[Antonio Sede\u00f1o]] was appointed governor.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|11}}  Granted a contract to settle Trinidad, with an eye toward discovering long-rumored ''[[El Dorado]]'' and controlling the trade in slaves, in 1532 he attempted to establish a settlement, but was driven off the island following the ''Battle of [[Cumucurapo]],'' (or ''The Place of the [[Ceiba pentandra|Silk Cotton]] Tree''). He withdrew to [[Isla Margarita|Margarita]], but he returned a year later and built a settlement at Cumucurapo (modern [[Mucurapo]] in what is now [[Port of Spain]]). After failing to attract more settlers to Trinidad, Sede\u00f1o was forced to withdraw in 1534. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn 1553 Juan Sede\u00f1o was authorised to settle Trinidad, but the contract was never fulfilled. In 1569 [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n II|Juan Troche Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] built the \"town of the Circumcision\", probably around modern [[Laventille]]. In 1570 this settlement was abandoned. In 1592 [[Antonio de Berrio]] established the first lasting settlement, the town of [[Saint Joseph, Trinidad and Tobago|San Jos\u00e9 de Oru\u00f1a]] (the modern [[Saint Joseph, Trinidad and Tobago|St. Joseph]]). [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], who was searching for ''El Dorado'', arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 and [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|soon attacked San Jos\u00e9]] and captured and interrogated de Berr\u00edo, obtaining much information from him and from the [[cacique]] Topiawari.<ref name=Whitehead>Whitehead, 1997.</ref><ref name=Eric/>{{rp|11,18}}\n\nLack of Spanish ships arriving on a regular basis forced the settlers to trade with the English, French and Dutch, in violation of the Spanish Exclusive.  The Spanish also lacked the means to defend the colony, which consisted of only 24 Spanish settlers in 1625.  Thus the Dutch attacked St. Joseph with impunity in 1637.  By 1671, the island included 80 settlers and 80 \"domesticated\" Amerindians.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|13\u201318}}\n\nBy 1772, the Spanish capital of St. Joseph had a population of 326 Spaniards and 417 Amerindians.  Yet the houses consisted of mud huts with thatch roofs.  In general, lacking gold, the island was poor and undeveloped, inducing many to leave.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|28}}\n\nThe Captaincy General of Venezuela ({{lang-es|Capitan\u00eda General de Venezuela}}) was created on 8 September 1777, through the Royal Decree of Graces of Charles III of Bourbon, to provide more autonomy for the provinces of [[Venezuela]] (include Trinidad), previously under the jurisdiction of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] and the [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Audiencia of Santo Domingo]]. The crown established a unified government in political ([[governorate|governorship]]), military ([[Captain General|captaincy general]]), fiscal ([[Intendant|intendancy]]) and judicial (''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]'') affairs. Its creation was part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]] and laid the groundwork for the future nation of Venezuela, in particular by orienting the [[Maracaibo Province (Spanish Empire)|province of Maracaibo]] towards the [[Venezuela Province|province of Caracas]].\n\n===Colonial settlement of Tobago===\n{{Main|Dutch Caribbean|Couronian colonization of the Americas}}\nIn Tobago, the first [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colony of ''Nieuw-Walcheren'' (\"New [[Walcheren]]\") was short-lived. 68 colonists established Fort Vlissingen (\"Fort Flushing\") near modern [[Plymouth, Trinidad and Tobago|Plymouth]] in 1628.

The Dutch colony on the other side of the island had three forts: Lampsinsberg, Beveren, and Bellavista. In 1658, 500 Frenchmen joined the Dutch colony but formed their own settlement called Three Rivers (''Le Quartier des trois Rivi\u00e8res'').<ref name=\"dutch\"/> On 11 December 1659, the Courlanders peaceably surrendered their colony to the Dutch. At the time, the island held about 1,500 Europeans and around 7,000 African slaves working on 120 plantations, supporting six or seven [[sugar mill]]s and two [[rum]] [[distillery|distilleries]].<ref name=\"dutch\"/>\n\nBritish Jamaican pirates captured the island in January 1666; the official English garrison surrendered to a French attack in August the same year. The Dutch admiral [[Abraham Crijnssen]] reclaimed a deserted colony in April 1667 and reestablished a fort. An attempt to restore the Courish Fort Jacob was suppressed in December 1668. In December, 1672, the British attacked and destroyed the Dutch colony as part of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]. Dutch control was regained under the ''status quo ante'' provisions of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Second Treaty of Westminster]] in 1674; in September 1676, Fort Sterreschans was constructed near the ruins of Fort Vlissingen. This star fort was reinforced in February 1677, but French attacks in February, March, and December of that year finally succeeded in killing the Dutch governor and capturing the island.<ref name=\"dutch\"/>\n\nIn 1749, Britain and France agreed to keep the island neutral, but Britain took control after 1763, prompting France to capture the island in 1781, then Britain to recapture the island in 1793.  The population in 1771 was 5,084, of which only 243 were white and 4,716 were slaves.  In 1791 the population was 15,020, of which 541 were white and 14,170 were slaves.  There were then 37 sugar factories, 99 cotton factories, and 4 coffee factories.  After nutmeg was discovered in 1768, 40 nutmeg plantations were started.  The island became a British acquisition for good in 1802, with a ratified treaty in 1814.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|55\u201359}}\n\n===Spanish missions in Trinidad===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Port of Spain Harbour, 1890s.jpg|thumb|360px|Port of Spain Harbour, 1890s]] -->\n{{Main|Spanish missions in Trinidad}}\n[[Spanish missions in Trinidad|Spanish missions]] were established as part of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] here as in its other new [[Americas|New World]] conquests. In 1687 the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friars were given responsibility for the [[Religious conversion|conversion]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of [[Trinidad]] and the [[History of Guyana|Guianas]]. In 1713 the missions were handed over to the ''secular clergy''. Due to shortages of missionaries, although the missions were established they often went without Christian instruction for long periods of time.\n\nBetween 1687 and 1700 several missions were founded in Trinidad, but only four survived as Amerindian villages throughout the 18th century \u2013 ''La Anunc\u00edata de Nazaret de Savana Grande'' (modern [[Princes Town]]), ''Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda Sant\u00edsima de Guayri'' (modern [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]]), ''Santa Ana de Savaneta'' (modern Savonetta), ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Montserrate'' (probably modern Mayo). The mission of ''Santa Rosa de Arima'' was established in 1789 when Amerindians from the former ''[[encomienda]]s'' of [[Tacarigua]] and ''Arauca'' ([[Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago|Arouca]]) were relocated further east (They settled in Santa Rosa close to the town of Arima).\n\nIn 1687 the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] Capuchin friars were given responsibility for the [[Religious conversion|conversion]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of [[Trinidad]] and the [[History of Guyana|Guianas]].  In 1713 the missions were handed over to the ''secular clergy''. Tensions between priests and Amerindians led to the ''[[Arena Massacre]]'' of 1699, wherein the Amerindians murdered the priests. After being hunted by the Spanish, the survivors are reported to have committed suicide by jumping off cliffs into the sea.\n\n===French settlement in Trinidad===\n{{main|France\u2013Trinidad and Tobago relations\n}}\n\nAlthough Spanish settlement began in the 16th century, the census of 1777 recorded only 2,763 people as living on the island, including some 2,000 [[Arawak people|Arawak]]s.\n\nIn 1777, Roume de St Laurent proposed French planters from the islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, and their African slaves, immigrate to Trinidad.  He estimated 1,532 whites, with 33,322 of their slaves, would be interested in such a proposal.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|40}}\n \nThe Spanish gave many incentives to lure settlers to the island, including exemption from taxes for ten years and land grants in accordance to the terms set out in the Cedula. In 1783, the proclamation of a [[Cedula of Population]] by the Spanish Crown granted 32 acres (129,000 m\u00b2) of land to each [[Roman Catholic]] who settled in Trinidad and half as much for each slave that they brought. Uniquely, 16 acres (65,000 m\u00b2) was offered to each ''[[Free people of color|Free Coloured]]'' or ''Free Person of Colour'' (''[[gens de couleur|gens de couleur libre]]'', as they were later known), and half as much for each slave they brought. French planters with their slaves, free coloureds and mulattos from neighboring islands of [[Grenada]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[Dominica]] migrated to the Trinidad during the French Revolution. These new immigrants establishing local communities of [[Blanchisseuse]], [[Champs Fleurs]], [[Paramin]], [[Cascade, Trinidad and Tobago|Cascade]], [[Carenage]] and [[Laventille]]. This resulted in Trinidad having the unique feature of a large French-speaking ''Free Coloured'' slave-owning class.\n\nBy the time the island was surrendered to the British in 1797 the population had increased to 17,643: 2,086 whites, 4,466 free people of colour, 1,082 Amerindians, and 10,009 African slaves.  In addition, there were 159 sugar estates, 130 coffee estates, 60 cocoa estates, and 103 cotton estates.  Yet, the island remained unfortified.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|47}}\n\n==British period==\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}\n\n[[File:Trinidad Ralph Abercromby.JPG|left|thumb|A medallion commemorating the capture of Trinidad and Tobago by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1797.]]\n[[File:Protector of Slaves Office (Trinidad) by Richard Bridgens.jpg|thumb|right|''Protector of Slaves Office (Trinidad)'', Richard Bridgens, c. 1833.]]\nIn 1797, a British force led by [[Ralph Abercromby|General Sir Ralph Abercromby]] launched the [[Invasion of Trinidad (1797)|invasion of Trinidad]].

The Spanish [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Chac\u00f3n|Governor Chac\u00f3n]] decided to capitulate without fighting. Trinidad thus became a British [[crown colony]], with a French-speaking population and Spanish laws.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|49}} British rule was formalized under the [[Treaty of Amiens]] (1802).\n\nBritish rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. English, Scots, Irish, German and Italian families arrived. Under British rule, new estates were created and the import of slaves did increase, but this was the period of [[abolitionism]] in England and the slave trade was under attack.<ref name=Brereton>Brereton, Bridget (1981).

The first announcement from [[Whitehall]] in England that slaves would be totally freed by 1840 was made in 1833. In the meantime, slaves on plantations were expected to remain where they were and work as \"apprentices\" for the next six years.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago demonstrated a successful use of [[non-violent]] protest and [[passive resistance]]. On 1 August 1834, an unarmed group of mainly elderly ex-slaves being addressed by the Governor at Government House about the new laws, began chanting: \"Pas de six ans. Point de six ans\" (\"Not six years. No six years\"), drowning out the voice of the Governor.\n\nPeaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish apprenticeship was passed and de facto freedom was achieved. This may have been partially due to the influence of Dr. Jean Baptiste Phillipe's book ''A Free Mulatto'' (1824).<ref>Carmichael (1961), p. 196, n.</ref> At the request of Governor Sir George Fitzgerald Hill, on 25 July, \"Dr. Jean Baptiste Phillipe the first coloured member of the Council, proposed a resolution to end apprenticeship and this was passed.

Trinidad and Tobago [[chocolate]] became a high-priced, much sought-after commodity. The [[Colonialism|Colonial]] government opened land to settlers interested in establishing cacao estates. French Creoles (white Trinidadian elites descended from the original French settlers) were being marginalised economically by large English business concerns who were buying up sugar plantations, and this gave them a fresh avenue of economic development.\n\n[[Venezuela]]n farmers with experience in cacao cultivation were also encouraged to settle in Trinidad and Tobago, where they provided much of the early labour in these estates. Many of the former cocoa-producing areas of Trinidad retain a distinctly Spanish flavour and many of the descendants of the [[Cocoa panyols]] (from 'espagnol') remain in these areas including Trinidad and Tobago's most famous [[cricket]]er, [[Brian Lara]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1844, the British Government allowed the immigration of 2,500 Indian workers as [[indentured servants]], from Calcutta and Madras. According to Williams, this was an effort to provide \"an adequate and dependable supply of labour.\" One third of the cost of passage, including return, was to borne as a public expense.  Additional funds were provided for the Office of Protector of Immigrants, medical and police services. Wages were set at $2.40 per month for males, and $1.45 per month for females. In 1899, the working day was fixed at 9 hours.  They could buy a plot of land in exchange for return passage.

Although [[Tobago]] had an elected Assembly, this was dissolved prior to the union of the two islands.  In 1925 the first elections to the [[Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago|Legislative Council]] were held.  Seven of the thirteen members were elected, the others were nominated by the Governor. The franchise was determined by income, property and residence qualifications, and was limited to men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30. The 1946 elections were the first with universal adult suffrage.\n\n[[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|Labour riots in 1937]] led by [[Tubal Uriah Butler|T.U.B. Butler]] (an immigrant from the neighbouring island of Grenada) shook the country and led to the formation of the modern [[Trade Union]] movement. Butler was jailed from 1937 to 1939, but was re-arrested when the [[United Kingdom]] entered [[World War II]] and jailed for the duration of the war. After his release in 1945 Butler reorganised his political party, the [[Butler Party|British Empire Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party]]. This party won a plurality in the [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 1956|1950 general elections]], the establishment feared Butler as a radical and instead [[Albert Gomes]] became the first [[Chief Minister]] of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe 1956 general elections saw the emergence of the [[People's National Movement]] under the leadership of [[Eric Williams]]. The PNM, opposed by Dr. Rudranath Capildeo of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago)|Democratic Labor Party]] and [[Ashford Sinanan]], who later founded the West Indian National Party (WINP),<ref>[[Democratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago)]]</ref> continued to dominate politics in Trinidad and Tobago until 1986. The party won every General Election between 1956 and 1981. Williams became [[Prime Minister]] at independence, and remained in that position until his death in 1981.\n\nIn 1958, the United Kingdom tried to establish an independent [[West Indies Federation]] comprising most of the former British West Indies. However, disagreement over the structure of the federation led to [[Jamaica]]'s withdrawal. Eric Williams responded to this with his now famous calculation \"One from ten leaves nought.\" Trinidad and Tobago chose not to bear the financial burden without Jamaica's assistance, and the Federation collapsed. Trinidad and Tobago achieved full independence via the [[Trinidad and Tobago Independence Act 1962]] on 31 August 1962 within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its titular [[head of state]]. On 1 August 1976, the country became a republic, and the last [[Governor-General]], [[Ellis Clarke|Sir Ellis Clarke]], became the first President.\n\nIn 1968 the [[National Joint Action Committee]] was formed by members of the ''Guild of Undergraduates'' at the St Augustine campus of the [[University of the West Indies]], under the leadership of [[Geddes Granger]].  In 1969 it was formally launched to protest the arrest of West Indian students at [[Concordia University (Montreal)#Sir George Williams University|Sir George Williams University]] in [[Montreal]].  Together with Trade Unions and other groups, this led to the birth of the [[Black Power]] movement.  In 1970 a series of marches and strikes led to the declaration of a [[State of Emergency]] and the arrest of 15 Black Power leaders.  In sympathy with the arrested leaders, a portion of the [[Trinidad and Tobago Regiment]], led by [[Raffique Shah]] and [[Rex Lassalle]] mutinied and took hostages at the Teteron Barracks (located on the [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] Peninsula).  However, the Coast Guard remained loyal and was able to isolate the mutineers at Teteron (as the only way out was along a narrow coastal road).  After 5 days the mutineers surrendered.\n{{See also|Black Power Revolution}}\nPolitical difficulties in the post-Black Power era culminated in the \"No Vote\" campaign of 1971 (which resulted in the PNM winning all the seats in [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]]). In 1973, in the face of a collapsing economy Eric Williams was prepared to resign as Prime Minister. However, the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Arab-Israeli War]] led to the recovery of oil prices and Williams remained in office.  The high oil prices of the 1970s and early 1980s led to an ''oil boom'' which resulted in a large increase in salaries, standards of living, and [[political corruption|corruption]].\n\nIn 1979, construction on the [[Eric Williams Plaza]] began. It would eventually finish in 1986. It remained the tallest building in Trinidad and Tobago until the construction of the Nicholas Tower in 2003.\n\nWilliams died in office in 1981.  The PNM remained in power following the death of Dr. Williams, but its 30-year rule ended in 1986 when the [[National Alliance for Reconstruction]] (NAR), a multi-ethnic coalition aimed at uniting Trinidadians of [[Afro-Trinidadian people|Afro-Trinidadian]] and [[Indo-Trinidadian]] descent, won a landslide victory by capturing 33 of 36 seats. Tobago's [[A. N. R. Robinson]], the political leader of the NAR, was named Prime Minister. The NAR also won 11 of the 12 seats in the Tobago House of Assembly. The NAR began to break down when the Indian component withdrew in 1988. [[Basdeo Panday]], leader of the old [[United Labour Front]] (ULF), formed the new opposition with the [[United National Congress]] (UNC). The NAR's margin was immediately reduced to 27 seats, with six for the UNC and three for the PNM.\n\n===Sexual Offences Act of 1986===\n\nThe Sexual Offenses Act was passed by the Parliament of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in 1986, serving as \"An Act to repeal and replace the laws of Trinidad and Tobago relating to sexual crimes, to the procuration, abduction and prostitution of persons and to kindred offences\" (Ministry 5). The Sexual Offences Act consisted of 35 provisions, six of which have since been repealed (Ministry 4). The act functioned to criminalize a number of sexual acts, including acts of incest, buggery, rape, bestiality, abduction, and forceful intercourse within a marriage (Alexander 8). The crime of buggery (anal intercourse performed between two males or a male and a female), is punishable by 10 years of imprisonment if found guilty.\n\n====Criticism of Sexual Offences Act====\n\nThe Sexual Offences Act received criticism in its criminalization of nonprocreative sex, homosexual intercourse, and sex work performed by prostitutes. In M. Jacqui Alexander's article ''Not Just (Any)body Can Be a Citizen: The Politics of Law, Sexuality, and Postcoloniality in Trinidad and Tobago'', Alexander details the ways the Sexual Offenses Act of 1986 regulated and enforced conjugal heterosexuality by punishing deviant sexual activities, and conflated violent acts of heterosexuality with nonprocreative sexual activity. The crime of marital rape, while punishable by 15 years imprisonment, was not referred to as such, but instead referred to as \"forceful intercourse\" between a husband and his wife, without her consent (Alexander 8).\n\n===1990 Jamaat-al-Muslimeen coup attempt===\n{{more|Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt}}\n\nIn July 1990, the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]], an extremist Black [[Muslim]] group with an unresolved grievance against the government over land claims, tried to overthrow the NAR government. The group held the prime minister and members of parliament hostage for five days while rioting shook [[Port of Spain]]. After a long standoff with the police and military, the Jamaat al Muslimeen leader, [[Yasin Abu Bakr]], and his followers surrendered to Trinidadian authorities. Having had the matter referred back to the local courts by the Privy Council with a clear indication of a view that the amnesty was valid, in July 1992, the High Court upheld the validity of a government amnesty given to the Jamaat members during the hostage crisis. Abu Bakr and 113 other Jamaat members were jailed for two years while the courts debated the amnesty's validity. All 114 members were eventually released. Subsequent to this, the UK [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] deemed the amnesty invalid but expressed the view that it would be improper to re-arrest the 114 accused.\n\n===Later developments===\nIn December 1991, the NAR captured only the two districts in Tobago. The PNM, led by [[Patrick Manning]], carried a majority of 21 seats, and the UNC came in second. Manning became the new Prime Minister and Basdeo Panday continued to lead the opposition. In November 1995, [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 1995|Manning called early elections]], in which the PNM and UNC both won 17 seats and the NAR won two seats. The UNC allied with the NAR and formed the new government, with Panday becoming prime minister \u2013 the first prime minister of Indo-Trinidadian descent.\n\nElections held in [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2000|December 2000]] returned the UNC to power when they won 19 seats, while the opposition PNM won 16, and the NAR 1. The UNC government fell in October 2001 with the defection of three of its parliamentarians amidst allegations of corruption in the then UNC government, and the [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2001|December 2001 elections]] resulted in an even 18 to 18 split between the UNC and the PNM. President Robinson appointed Patrick Manning Prime Minister despite the fact that the UNC won the popular vote and that Panday was the sitting Prime Minister.  Despite the fact that Manning was unable to attract a majority (and Parliament was thus unable to sit), he delayed calling elections until [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2002|October 2002]]. The PNM formed the next government after winning 20 seats, while the UNC won 16. Both parties are committed to free market economic policies and increased foreign investment. Trinidad and Tobago has remained cooperative with the United States in the regional fight against narcotics trafficking and on other issues.\n\nThe serious crime situation in the country has led to a severe deterioration in security conditions in the country. In addition, a resurgent Jamaat al Muslimeen continues to be a threat to stability.\n\nOn 26 May 2010, [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]], leader of the [[People's Partnership]], was sworn in as the country's first female Prime Minister. On 21 August 2011, she asked President [[George Maxwell Richards]] to declare a limited [[state of emergency]]. Dr. Keth Rowley is now Prime Minister\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/63215/2011-08-21.html |title=LIMITED STATE Of EMERGENCY: Trinidad and Tobago moving to deal with upsurge in murders |date=21 August 2011 |work=Cananews |publisher=Caribbean Media Corporation |accessdate=21 August 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> On 19 March 2018 Trinidad's first female President, Ms. Paula-Mae Weekes was sworn in.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tv6tnt.com/news/local/president-elect-paula-mae-weekes-swearing-in-ceremony/article_bfede362-2b6f-11e8-8328-bb29105bc999.html|title=President-elect Paula-Mae Weekes swearing in Ceremony|last=Desk|first=TV6 Digital|work=Caribbean Communications Network|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of Governors of the British Windward Islands]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Trinidad and Tobago]]\n*[[Politics of Trinidad and Tobago]]\n*[[Couronian colonization of the Americas|Lithuanian colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[West Indies Federation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|History of Trinidad and Tobago}}\n* {{cite book|title=The History of the West Indian Islands of Trinidad and Tobago, 1498\u20131900|year=1961|first=Gertrude|last=Carmichael|publisher=Alvin Redman, London}}\n* Aleong, Joe Chin, and Edward B.

Both islands were visited by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] in 1498 and claimed in the name of Spain. Trinidad remained in [[Spain|Spanish]] hands until 1797, but it was largely settled by French colonists. Tobago changed hands between the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]], [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]], and [[Courland colonization of the Americas|Courlanders]], but eventually ended up in British hands following the second [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]]. In 1889 the two islands were incorporated into a single [[British Empire|crown colony]].<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11332/ |title = Railroad Map of Trinidad |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1925 |accessdate = 25 October 2013 }}</ref> Trinidad and Tobago obtained its independence from the British Empire in 1962 and became a [[republic]] in 1976.\n\n==Pre-Columbian period==\n\n[[File:Tobago jade ceremonial ax.jpg|thumb|Green stone ceremonial axe. From [[shell midden]], Mt Irvine Bay, Tobago, 1957]]\n\nHuman settlement in [[Trinidad]] dates back at least 7,000 years. The earliest settlers, termed Archaic or [[Ortoiroid people|Ortoiroid]], are believed to have settled Trinidad and Tobago from northeastern South America around 4000 BCE. Twenty-nine Archaic sites have been identified, mostly in south Trinidad and Tobago; this includes the 7,000-year-old [[Banwari Trace]] site which is the oldest discovered human settlement in the eastern Caribbean.  Archaic populations were pre-ceramic, and dominated the area until about 200 BCE.<ref name=\"Reid 2008\">{{Cite book|title=Archaeology and geoinformatics : case studies from the Caribbean|last=Reid|first=Basil|publisher=University of Alabama Press|others=Reid, Basil A., 1961-|year=2008|isbn=9780817380533|location=Tuscaloosa|pages=33\u201373|chapter=Developing Weights-of-Evidence Predictive Models for the Cultural Resource Management of Pre-Columbian Sites in Trinidad|oclc=567999135}}</ref>\n\nAround 250 BCE the first ceramic-using people in the Caribbean, the [[Saladoid]] people, entered Trinidad and Tobago.  The earliest evidence of these people come from around 2100 BCE along the banks of the [[Orinoco]] River in [[Venezuela]]. From Trinidad and Tobago, they are believed to have moved north into the remaining islands of the Caribbean. Thirty-seven Saladoid sites have been identified in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and are located all over the island.<ref name=\"Reid 2008\"/>\n\nAfter 250 CE a third group, called the [[Barrancoid]] people settled in southern Trinidad and Tobago after migrating up the Orinoco River toward the sea. The oldest Barrancoid settlement appears to have been at [[Erin, Trinidad and Tobago|Erin]], on the south coast.<ref name=\"Reid 2008\"/>\n\nFollowing the collapse of Barrancoid communities along the Orinoco around 650 CE, a new group, called the Arauquinoid expanded up the river to the coast. The cultural artefacts of this group were only partly adopted in Trinidad and Tobago and adjacent areas of northeast Venezuela, and as a result, this culture is called Guayabitoid in these areas.<ref name=\" Reid 2008\"/>\n\nAround 1300 CE a new group appears to have settled in Trinidad and Tobago and introduced new cultural attributes which largely replaced the Guayabitoid culture. Termed the Mayoid cultural tradition, this represents the native tribes which were present in Trinidad and Tobago at the time of European arrival. Their distinct pottery and artefacts survive until 1800, but after this time they were largely assimilated into mainstream Trinidad and Tobago society. These included the Nepoya and Suppoya (who were probably [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking) and the Yao (who were probably [[Carib language|Carib]]-speaking). They have generally been called [[Arawak people|Arawak]]s and [[Island Caribs|Carib]]s. These were largely wiped out by the Spanish colonisers under the [[encomienda]] system. Under this system which was basically a form of slavery, Spanish encomederos forced the Amerindians to work for them in exchange for Spanish \"protection\" and conversion to Christianity. The survivors were first organised into [[Spanish missions in Trinidad|Missions]] by the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friars]], and then gradually assimilated.<ref name=\"Reid 2008\"/>\n\n==Spanish period==\n{{Main|Spanish West Indies}}\n\n===The arrival of Columbus===\nThe first ever contact with Europeans occurred when Christopher Columbus, who was on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] of exploration, arrived at noon on 31 July 1498.<ref>Carmichael (1961).</ref> He landed at a harbor he called Point Galera, while naming the island Trinidad, before proceeding into the [[Gulf of Paria]] via the [[Columbus Channel|Serpent's Mouth]] and the Caribbean Sea via [[Bocas del Dragon|Dragon's Mouth]].<ref name=\"Eric\">{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Eric|title=History of the People of Trinidad and Tobago|date=1942|publisher=Eworld Inc.|location=Buffalo|isbn=9781617590108|pages=1\u20134}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}\n\n===Colonial settlement of Trinidad===\nTrinidad is reported to have been densely populated at the beginning of the colonial period. Although in 1510 Trinidad was said to have the only \"peaceful Indians\" along the whole South American coast, demand for slaves to supply the [[pearl]]-fisheries in nearby [[Isla Margarita]] led to them being declared \"Caribs\" (and thus, fair game for [[slavery|slavers]]) in 1511. As a consequence of this, Trinidad and Tobago became the focus of [[Spain|Spanish]] slaving raids, primarily to supply Margarita's pearl fisheries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Romero|first1=Aldemaro|title=Death and Taxes: the Case of the Depletion of Pearl Oyster Beds in Sixteenth-Century Venezuela|journal=Conservation Biology|date=2003|volume=17|issue=4|page=1016|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.01406.x|url=https://spark.siue.edu/bio_fac/408}}</ref>\n\nIn 1530 [[Antonio Sede\u00f1o]] was appointed governor.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|11}}  Granted a contract to settle Trinidad, with an eye toward discovering long-rumored ''[[El Dorado]]'' and controlling the trade in slaves, in 1532 he attempted to establish a settlement, but was driven off the island following the ''Battle of [[Cumucurapo]],'' (or ''The Place of the [[Ceiba pentandra|Silk Cotton]] Tree''). He withdrew to [[Isla Margarita|Margarita]], but he returned a year later and built a settlement at Cumucurapo (modern [[Mucurapo]] in what is now [[Port of Spain]]). After failing to attract more settlers to Trinidad, Sede\u00f1o was forced to withdraw in 1534. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn 1553 Juan Sede\u00f1o was authorised to settle Trinidad, but the contract was never fulfilled. In 1569 [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n II|Juan Troche Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] built the \"town of the Circumcision\", probably around modern [[Laventille]]. In 1570 this settlement was abandoned. In 1592 [[Antonio de Berrio]] established the first lasting settlement, the town of [[Saint Joseph, Trinidad and Tobago|San Jos\u00e9 de Oru\u00f1a]] (the modern [[Saint Joseph, Trinidad and Tobago|St. Joseph]]). [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], who was searching for ''El Dorado'', arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 and [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|soon attacked San Jos\u00e9]] and captured and interrogated de Berr\u00edo, obtaining much information from him and from the [[cacique]] Topiawari.<ref name=Whitehead>Whitehead, 1997.</ref><ref name=Eric/>{{rp|11,18}}\n\nLack of Spanish ships arriving on a regular basis forced the settlers to trade with the English, French and Dutch, in violation of the Spanish Exclusive.  The Spanish also lacked the means to defend the colony, which consisted of only 24 Spanish settlers in 1625.  Thus the Dutch attacked St. Joseph with impunity in 1637.  By 1671, the island included 80 settlers and 80 \"domesticated\" Amerindians.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|13\u201318}}\n\nBy 1772, the Spanish capital of St. Joseph had a population of 326 Spaniards and 417 Amerindians.  Yet the houses consisted of mud huts with thatch roofs.  In general, lacking gold, the island was poor and undeveloped, inducing many to leave.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|28}}\n\nThe Captaincy General of Venezuela ({{lang-es|Capitan\u00eda General de Venezuela}}) was created on 8 September 1777, through the Royal Decree of Graces of Charles III of Bourbon, to provide more autonomy for the provinces of [[Venezuela]] (include Trinidad), previously under the jurisdiction of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] and the [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Audiencia of Santo Domingo]]. The crown established a unified government in political ([[governorate|governorship]]), military ([[Captain General|captaincy general]]), fiscal ([[Intendant|intendancy]]) and judicial (''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]'') affairs. Its creation was part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]] and laid the groundwork for the future nation of Venezuela, in particular by orienting the [[Maracaibo Province (Spanish Empire)|province of Maracaibo]] towards the [[Venezuela Province|province of Caracas]].\n\n===Colonial settlement of Tobago===\n{{Main|Dutch Caribbean|Couronian colonization of the Americas}}\nIn Tobago, the first [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colony of ''Nieuw-Walcheren'' (\"New [[Walcheren]]\") was short-lived. 68 colonists established Fort Vlissingen (\"Fort Flushing\") near modern [[Plymouth, Trinidad and Tobago|Plymouth]] in 1628.

The Dutch colony on the other side of the island had three forts: Lampsinsberg, Beveren, and Bellavista. In 1658, 500 Frenchmen joined the Dutch colony but formed their own settlement called Three Rivers (''Le Quartier des trois Rivi\u00e8res'').<ref name=\"dutch\"/> On 11 December 1659, the Courlanders peaceably surrendered their colony to the Dutch. At the time, the island held about 1,500 Europeans and around 7,000 African slaves working on 120 plantations, supporting six or seven [[sugar mill]]s and two [[rum]] [[distillery|distilleries]].<ref name=\"dutch\"/>\n\nBritish Jamaican pirates captured the island in January 1666; the official English garrison surrendered to a French attack in August the same year. The Dutch admiral [[Abraham Crijnssen]] reclaimed a deserted colony in April 1667 and reestablished a fort. An attempt to restore the Courish Fort Jacob was suppressed in December 1668. In December, 1672, the British attacked and destroyed the Dutch colony as part of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]. Dutch control was regained under the ''status quo ante'' provisions of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Second Treaty of Westminster]] in 1674; in September 1676, Fort Sterreschans was constructed near the ruins of Fort Vlissingen. This star fort was reinforced in February 1677, but French attacks in February, March, and December of that year finally succeeded in killing the Dutch governor and capturing the island.<ref name=\"dutch\"/>\n\nIn 1749, Britain and France agreed to keep the island neutral, but Britain took control after 1763, prompting France to capture the island in 1781, then Britain to recapture the island in 1793.  The population in 1771 was 5,084, of which only 243 were white and 4,716 were slaves.  In 1791 the population was 15,020, of which 541 were white and 14,170 were slaves.  There were then 37 sugar factories, 99 cotton factories, and 4 coffee factories.  After nutmeg was discovered in 1768, 40 nutmeg plantations were started.  The island became a British acquisition for good in 1802, with a ratified treaty in 1814.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|55\u201359}}\n\n===Spanish missions in Trinidad===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Port of Spain Harbour, 1890s.jpg|thumb|360px|Port of Spain Harbour, 1890s]] -->\n{{Main|Spanish missions in Trinidad}}\n[[Spanish missions in Trinidad|Spanish missions]] were established as part of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] here as in its other new [[Americas|New World]] conquests. In 1687 the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friars were given responsibility for the [[Religious conversion|conversion]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of [[Trinidad]] and the [[History of Guyana|Guianas]]. In 1713 the missions were handed over to the ''secular clergy''. Due to shortages of missionaries, although the missions were established they often went without Christian instruction for long periods of time.\n\nBetween 1687 and 1700 several missions were founded in Trinidad, but only four survived as Amerindian villages throughout the 18th century \u2013 ''La Anunc\u00edata de Nazaret de Savana Grande'' (modern [[Princes Town]]), ''Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda Sant\u00edsima de Guayri'' (modern [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]]), ''Santa Ana de Savaneta'' (modern Savonetta), ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Montserrate'' (probably modern Mayo). The mission of ''Santa Rosa de Arima'' was established in 1789 when Amerindians from the former ''[[encomienda]]s'' of [[Tacarigua]] and ''Arauca'' ([[Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago|Arouca]]) were relocated further east (They settled in Santa Rosa close to the town of Arima).\n\nIn 1687 the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] Capuchin friars were given responsibility for the [[Religious conversion|conversion]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of [[Trinidad]] and the [[History of Guyana|Guianas]].  In 1713 the missions were handed over to the ''secular clergy''. Tensions between priests and Amerindians led to the ''[[Arena Massacre]]'' of 1699, wherein the Amerindians murdered the priests. After being hunted by the Spanish, the survivors are reported to have committed suicide by jumping off cliffs into the sea.\n\n===French settlement in Trinidad===\n{{main|France\u2013Trinidad and Tobago relations\n}}\n\nAlthough Spanish settlement began in the 16th century, the census of 1777 recorded only 2,763 people as living on the island, including some 2,000 [[Arawak people|Arawak]]s.\n\nIn 1777, Roume de St Laurent proposed French planters from the islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, and their African slaves, immigrate to Trinidad.  He estimated 1,532 whites, with 33,322 of their slaves, would be interested in such a proposal.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|40}}\n \nThe Spanish gave many incentives to lure settlers to the island, including exemption from taxes for ten years and land grants in accordance to the terms set out in the Cedula. In 1783, the proclamation of a [[Cedula of Population]] by the Spanish Crown granted 32 acres (129,000 m\u00b2) of land to each [[Roman Catholic]] who settled in Trinidad and half as much for each slave that they brought. Uniquely, 16 acres (65,000 m\u00b2) was offered to each ''[[Free people of color|Free Coloured]]'' or ''Free Person of Colour'' (''[[gens de couleur|gens de couleur libre]]'', as they were later known), and half as much for each slave they brought. French planters with their slaves, free coloureds and mulattos from neighboring islands of [[Grenada]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[Dominica]] migrated to the Trinidad during the French Revolution. These new immigrants establishing local communities of [[Blanchisseuse]], [[Champs Fleurs]], [[Paramin]], [[Cascade, Trinidad and Tobago|Cascade]], [[Carenage]] and [[Laventille]]. This resulted in Trinidad having the unique feature of a large French-speaking ''Free Coloured'' slave-owning class.\n\nBy the time the island was surrendered to the British in 1797 the population had increased to 17,643: 2,086 whites, 4,466 free people of colour, 1,082 Amerindians, and 10,009 African slaves.  In addition, there were 159 sugar estates, 130 coffee estates, 60 cocoa estates, and 103 cotton estates.  Yet, the island remained unfortified.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|47}}\n\n==British period==\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}\n\n[[File:Trinidad Ralph Abercromby.JPG|left|thumb|A medallion commemorating the capture of Trinidad and Tobago by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1797.]]\n[[File:Protector of Slaves Office (Trinidad) by Richard Bridgens.jpg|thumb|right|''Protector of Slaves Office (Trinidad)'', Richard Bridgens, c. 1833.]]\nIn 1797, a British force led by [[Ralph Abercromby|General Sir Ralph Abercromby]] launched the [[Invasion of Trinidad (1797)|invasion of Trinidad]].

The Spanish [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Chac\u00f3n|Governor Chac\u00f3n]] decided to capitulate without fighting. Trinidad thus became a British [[crown colony]], with a French-speaking population and Spanish laws.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|49}} British rule was formalized under the [[Treaty of Amiens]] (1802).\n\nBritish rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. English, Scots, Irish, German and Italian families arrived. Under British rule, new estates were created and the import of slaves did increase, but this was the period of [[abolitionism]] in England and the slave trade was under attack.<ref name=Brereton>Brereton, Bridget (1981).

After rejecting British government orders for transfer to the [[West India Regiment]]s, and on the [[Admiralty]] refusing to continue responsibility for them, they finally accepted, but only with reluctance, a government offer of settlement in Trinidad.

The first announcement from [[Whitehall]] in England that slaves would be totally freed by 1840 was made in 1833. In the meantime, slaves on plantations were expected to remain where they were and work as \"apprentices\" for the next six years.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago demonstrated a successful use of [[non-violent]] protest and [[passive resistance]]. On 1 August 1834, an unarmed group of mainly elderly ex-slaves being addressed by the Governor at Government House about the new laws, began chanting: \"Pas de six ans. Point de six ans\" (\"Not six years. No six years\"), drowning out the voice of the Governor.\n\nPeaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish apprenticeship was passed and de facto freedom was achieved. This may have been partially due to the influence of Dr. Jean Baptiste Phillipe's book ''A Free Mulatto'' (1824).<ref>Carmichael (1961), p. 196, n.</ref> At the request of Governor Sir George Fitzgerald Hill, on 25 July, \"Dr. Jean Baptiste Phillipe the first coloured member of the Council, proposed a resolution to end apprenticeship and this was passed.

Trinidad and Tobago [[chocolate]] became a high-priced, much sought-after commodity. The [[Colonialism|Colonial]] government opened land to settlers interested in establishing cacao estates. French Creoles (white Trinidadian elites descended from the original French settlers) were being marginalised economically by large English business concerns who were buying up sugar plantations, and this gave them a fresh avenue of economic development.\n\n[[Venezuela]]n farmers with experience in cacao cultivation were also encouraged to settle in Trinidad and Tobago, where they provided much of the early labour in these estates. Many of the former cocoa-producing areas of Trinidad retain a distinctly Spanish flavour and many of the descendants of the [[Cocoa panyols]] (from 'espagnol') remain in these areas including Trinidad and Tobago's most famous [[cricket]]er, [[Brian Lara]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1844, the British Government allowed the immigration of 2,500 Indian workers as [[indentured servants]], from Calcutta and Madras. According to Williams, this was an effort to provide \"an adequate and dependable supply of labour.\" One third of the cost of passage, including return, was to borne as a public expense.  Additional funds were provided for the Office of Protector of Immigrants, medical and police services. Wages were set at $2.40 per month for males, and $1.45 per month for females. In 1899, the working day was fixed at 9 hours.  They could buy a plot of land in exchange for return passage.  Between 1838 and 1917, 145,000 Indians immigrated to Trinidad.<ref name=Eric/>{{rp|98\u2013103,120\u2013121}} There were also workers brought from China at about the same time:\n<blockquote>In Trinidad there were, about twenty years ago [i.e. ca.-1886], 4,000 or 5,000 Chinese, but they have decreased to probably about 2,000 or 3,000, [2,200 in 1900]. They used to work in sugar plantations, but are now principally shopkeepers, as well as general merchants, miners and railway builders, etc.<ref>''Things Chinese or Notes connected with China''. J.

The Indian community has steadily prospered and grown until now it makes up about 35% of the population of the nation (the largest ethnic group by about 1%).\n\nThe arrival of ''[[Witch's broom|witches' broom]]'' and ''[[Black pod disease|black pod]]'' diseases in the 1930s, coupled with the [[Great Depression]], destroyed the cacao industry in Trinidad and Tobago. Although prices for Trinidad and Tobago [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] beans remains high on the world markets, cocoa is no more than a marginal crop. \nRelations between the Indian immigrants, and both the British, and the black population were generally strained,<ref>Moore, P.

The other point of view from Capt.

Although [[Tobago]] had an elected Assembly, this was dissolved prior to the union of the two islands.  In 1925 the first elections to the [[Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago|Legislative Council]] were held.  Seven of the thirteen members were elected, the others were nominated by the Governor. The franchise was determined by income, property and residence qualifications, and was limited to men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30. The 1946 elections were the first with universal adult suffrage.\n\n[[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|Labour riots in 1937]] led by [[Tubal Uriah Butler|T.U.B. Butler]] (an immigrant from the neighbouring island of Grenada) shook the country and led to the formation of the modern [[Trade Union]] movement. Butler was jailed from 1937 to 1939, but was re-arrested when the [[United Kingdom]] entered [[World War II]] and jailed for the duration of the war. After his release in 1945 Butler reorganised his political party, the [[Butler Party|British Empire Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party]]. This party won a plurality in the [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 1956|1950 general elections]], the establishment feared Butler as a radical and instead [[Albert Gomes]] became the first [[Chief Minister]] of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe 1956 general elections saw the emergence of the [[People's National Movement]] under the leadership of [[Eric Williams]]. The PNM, opposed by Dr. Rudranath Capildeo of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago)|Democratic Labor Party]] and [[Ashford Sinanan]], who later founded the West Indian National Party (WINP),<ref>[[Democratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago)]]</ref> continued to dominate politics in Trinidad and Tobago until 1986. The party won every General Election between 1956 and 1981. Williams became [[Prime Minister]] at independence, and remained in that position until his death in 1981.\n\nIn 1958, the United Kingdom tried to establish an independent [[West Indies Federation]] comprising most of the former British West Indies. However, disagreement over the structure of the federation led to [[Jamaica]]'s withdrawal. Eric Williams responded to this with his now famous calculation \"One from ten leaves nought.\" Trinidad and Tobago chose not to bear the financial burden without Jamaica's assistance, and the Federation collapsed. Trinidad and Tobago achieved full independence via the [[Trinidad and Tobago Independence Act 1962]] on 31 August 1962 within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its titular [[head of state]]. On 1 August 1976, the country became a republic, and the last [[Governor-General]], [[Ellis Clarke|Sir Ellis Clarke]], became the first President.\n\nIn 1968 the [[National Joint Action Committee]] was formed by members of the ''Guild of Undergraduates'' at the St Augustine campus of the [[University of the West Indies]], under the leadership of [[Geddes Granger]].  In 1969 it was formally launched to protest the arrest of West Indian students at [[Concordia University (Montreal)#Sir George Williams University|Sir George Williams University]] in [[Montreal]].  Together with Trade Unions and other groups, this led to the birth of the [[Black Power]] movement.  In 1970 a series of marches and strikes led to the declaration of a [[State of Emergency]] and the arrest of 15 Black Power leaders.  In sympathy with the arrested leaders, a portion of the [[Trinidad and Tobago Regiment]], led by [[Raffique Shah]] and [[Rex Lassalle]] mutinied and took hostages at the Teteron Barracks (located on the [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] Peninsula).  However, the Coast Guard remained loyal and was able to isolate the mutineers at Teteron (as the only way out was along a narrow coastal road).  After 5 days the mutineers surrendered.\n{{See also|Black Power Revolution}}\nPolitical difficulties in the post-Black Power era culminated in the \"No Vote\" campaign of 1971 (which resulted in the PNM winning all the seats in [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]]). In 1973, in the face of a collapsing economy Eric Williams was prepared to resign as Prime Minister. However, the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Arab-Israeli War]] led to the recovery of oil prices and Williams remained in office.  The high oil prices of the 1970s and early 1980s led to an ''oil boom'' which resulted in a large increase in salaries, standards of living, and [[political corruption|corruption]].\n\nIn 1979, construction on the [[Eric Williams Plaza]] began. It would eventually finish in 1986. It remained the tallest building in Trinidad and Tobago until the construction of the Nicholas Tower in 2003.\n\nWilliams died in office in 1981.  The PNM remained in power following the death of Dr. Williams, but its 30-year rule ended in 1986 when the [[National Alliance for Reconstruction]] (NAR), a multi-ethnic coalition aimed at uniting Trinidadians of [[Afro-Trinidadian people|Afro-Trinidadian]] and [[Indo-Trinidadian]] descent, won a landslide victory by capturing 33 of 36 seats. Tobago's [[A. N. R. Robinson]], the political leader of the NAR, was named Prime Minister. The NAR also won 11 of the 12 seats in the Tobago House of Assembly. The NAR began to break down when the Indian component withdrew in 1988. [[Basdeo Panday]], leader of the old [[United Labour Front]] (ULF), formed the new opposition with the [[United National Congress]] (UNC). The NAR's margin was immediately reduced to 27 seats, with six for the UNC and three for the PNM.\n\n===Sexual Offences Act of 1986===\n\nThe Sexual Offenses Act was passed by the Parliament of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in 1986, serving as \"An Act to repeal and replace the laws of Trinidad and Tobago relating to sexual crimes, to the procuration, abduction and prostitution of persons and to kindred offences\" (Ministry 5). The Sexual Offences Act consisted of 35 provisions, six of which have since been repealed (Ministry 4). The act functioned to criminalize a number of sexual acts, including acts of incest, buggery, rape, bestiality, abduction, and forceful intercourse within a marriage (Alexander 8). The crime of buggery (anal intercourse performed between two males or a male and a female), is punishable by 10 years of imprisonment if found guilty.\n\n====Criticism of Sexual Offences Act====\n\nThe Sexual Offences Act received criticism in its criminalization of nonprocreative sex, homosexual intercourse, and sex work performed by prostitutes. In M. Jacqui Alexander's article ''Not Just (Any)body Can Be a Citizen: The Politics of Law, Sexuality, and Postcoloniality in Trinidad and Tobago'', Alexander details the ways the Sexual Offenses Act of 1986 regulated and enforced conjugal heterosexuality by punishing deviant sexual activities, and conflated violent acts of heterosexuality with nonprocreative sexual activity. The crime of marital rape, while punishable by 15 years imprisonment, was not referred to as such, but instead referred to as \"forceful intercourse\" between a husband and his wife, without her consent (Alexander 8).\n\n===1990 Jamaat-al-Muslimeen coup attempt===\n{{more|Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt}}\n\nIn July 1990, the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]], an extremist Black [[Muslim]] group with an unresolved grievance against the government over land claims, tried to overthrow the NAR government. The group held the prime minister and members of parliament hostage for five days while rioting shook [[Port of Spain]]. After a long standoff with the police and military, the Jamaat al Muslimeen leader, [[Yasin Abu Bakr]], and his followers surrendered to Trinidadian authorities. Having had the matter referred back to the local courts by the Privy Council with a clear indication of a view that the amnesty was valid, in July 1992, the High Court upheld the validity of a government amnesty given to the Jamaat members during the hostage crisis. Abu Bakr and 113 other Jamaat members were jailed for two years while the courts debated the amnesty's validity. All 114 members were eventually released. Subsequent to this, the UK [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] deemed the amnesty invalid but expressed the view that it would be improper to re-arrest the 114 accused.\n\n===Later developments===\nIn December 1991, the NAR captured only the two districts in Tobago. The PNM, led by [[Patrick Manning]], carried a majority of 21 seats, and the UNC came in second. Manning became the new Prime Minister and Basdeo Panday continued to lead the opposition. In November 1995, [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 1995|Manning called early elections]], in which the PNM and UNC both won 17 seats and the NAR won two seats. The UNC allied with the NAR and formed the new government, with Panday becoming prime minister \u2013 the first prime minister of Indo-Trinidadian descent.\n\nElections held in [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2000|December 2000]] returned the UNC to power when they won 19 seats, while the opposition PNM won 16, and the NAR 1. The UNC government fell in October 2001 with the defection of three of its parliamentarians amidst allegations of corruption in the then UNC government, and the [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2001|December 2001 elections]] resulted in an even 18 to 18 split between the UNC and the PNM. President Robinson appointed Patrick Manning Prime Minister despite the fact that the UNC won the popular vote and that Panday was the sitting Prime Minister.  Despite the fact that Manning was unable to attract a majority (and Parliament was thus unable to sit), he delayed calling elections until [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2002|October 2002]]. The PNM formed the next government after winning 20 seats, while the UNC won 16. Both parties are committed to free market economic policies and increased foreign investment. Trinidad and Tobago has remained cooperative with the United States in the regional fight against narcotics trafficking and on other issues.\n\nThe serious crime situation in the country has led to a severe deterioration in security conditions in the country. In addition, a resurgent Jamaat al Muslimeen continues to be a threat to stability.\n\nOn 26 May 2010, [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]], leader of the [[People's Partnership]], was sworn in as the country's first female Prime Minister. On 21 August 2011, she asked President [[George Maxwell Richards]] to declare a limited [[state of emergency]].
