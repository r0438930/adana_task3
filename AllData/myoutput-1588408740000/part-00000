The river turns to the west near [[Arezzo]] passing through [[Florence]], [[Empoli]] and [[Pisa]], flowing into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] at [[Marina di Pisa]].\n\nWith a length of {{convert|241|km}}, it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries: [[Sieve (river)|Sieve]] at {{convert|60|km|mi}} long, [[Bisenzio (river)|Bisenzio]] at {{convert|49|km}}, and the [[Era (river)|Era]], [[Elsa (river)|Elsa]], [[Pesa]], and [[Pescia (river)|Pescia]]. The drainage basin amounts to more than {{convert|8200|sqkm}} and drains the waters of the following subbasins:\n\n*The [[Casentino]], in the [[province of Arezzo]], formed by the upper course of the river until its confluence with the Maestro della Chiana channel.\n*The [[Valdichiana|Val di Chiana]], a plain drained in the 18th century, which until then had been a marshy area tributary of the Tiber.\n*The upper [[Valdarno]], a long valley bordered on the east by the [[Pratomagno]] massif and on the west by the hills around [[Siena]].\n*The Sieve's basin, which flows into the Arno immediately before Florence.\n*The middle Valdarno, with the plain including Florence, [[Sesto Fiorentino]], [[Prato]], and [[Pistoia]].\n*The lower Valdarno, with the valley of important tributaries such as the Pesa, Elsa, and Era and in which, after [[Pontedera]], the Arno flows into the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The river has a very variable discharge, ranging from about {{convert|6|m3/s|cuft/s}} to more than {{convert|2000|m3/s|cuft/s}}. The mouth of the river was once near [[Pisa]] but is now several kilometres westwards.\n\nIt crosses [[Florence]], where it passes below the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the [[Ponte Santa Trinita|Santa Trinita bridge]] (built by [[Bartolomeo Ammannati]] but inspired by [[Michelangelo]]). The river [[flood]]ed this city regularly in historical times, most recently in [[1966 flood of the Arno|1966]], with {{convert|4500|m3/s|cuft/s}} after rainfall of {{convert|437.2|mm}} in Badia Agnano and {{convert|190|mm}} in Florence, in only 24 hours.\n\nBefore Pisa, the Arno is crossed by the Imperial Canal at La Botte. This water channel passes under the Arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the [[Lago di Bientina]], which was once the largest lake in [[Tuscany]] before its reclamation. \n\nThe flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between {{convert|0.56|and|3540|m3/s|cuft/s}}. New [[dam]]s built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.\n\nThe [[1966 flood of the Arno|flood on November 4, 1966]] collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books.
