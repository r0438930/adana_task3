===Trump administration===
After Trump's January 2017 inauguration, Grisham was named deputy press secretary for [[Sean Spicer]] in the West Wing of the White House.<ref name=\"fox10phoenix\"/><ref name=\"Fortune06142019\"/>

In March 2017, First Lady Melania Trump moved her over to the East Wing.<ref name=\"Fortune06142019\"/><ref name=sentinel_20170327 /> A former White House colleague said that the president regretted losing Grisham to the first lady's office because of Grisham's loyalty and skill at handling the press while acting as his traveling press secretary. During that time, she built relationships with many reporters at events. Despite losing Grisham as part of his own staff, President Trump said he was satisfied that the first lady would \"be in good hands\". Grisham was described by several sources who had worked with her previously as being \"highly competent\" and \"self-aware\"; some suggested that she enjoyed \"trolling the press.\" <ref name=\"Beast\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-white-house-wont-stop-melania-from-contradicting-trump|title=The White House Won't Stop Melania From Contradicting Trump|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|last=Markay|first=Lachlan|date=August 7, 2018|accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Office of Special Counsel]] stated that Grisham violated the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] following a complaint by Senator [[Tom Carper]]. Grisham was accused of using her official [[Twitter]] account on July 11, 2018, to tweet out Trump's campaign slogan. Violation of the act is not a crime, but a workplace guideline, and the agency responded by sending Grisham a warning letter.<ref name=\"Hatch\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/melania-trump-spokesperson-violate-hatch-act-1132130|title=Melania Trump's Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham Violated Hatch Act With 'Make America Great Again' Tweet|last=Hutzler|first=Alexandra|work=[[Newsweek]] |date=October 9, 2018|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref>

On September 23, 2019, when asked by the hosts of Fox & Friends if the White House planned to resume its daily press briefing Grisham said \"not right now... I mean, ultimately, if the president decides that it's something we should do, we can do that, but right now he's doing just fine. And to be honest, the briefings have become a lot of theater.

On November 13, 2019, during the testimony of [[William B.

==Incidents of driving while intoxicated==
On January 9, 2013, Grisham was pulled over for speeding in [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]], [[Maricopa County, Arizona]]. The officer observed Grisham's signs of intoxication, and she failed a field sobriety test. Grisham denied consuming any alcohol, but said she had taken a Xanax 90 minutes earlier and a Zoloft the prior night. A blood test revealed Grisham's blood alcohol content to be .105 percent, which is above the .08 legal limit in Arizona. She also was found to be driving on a suspended license since August 2012 for failure to answer a traffic citation. In August 2014, Grisham accepted a plea bargain agreement that reduced the charge to misdemeanor reckless driving, plus two years of probation.<ref name=azr_20190626 /><ref name=\"NYTimes_20190625\" /><ref name=\"tsg_20190828\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/arizona/press-secretary-collars-162053|title=Like So Many Of His Associates, Donald Trump's New Press Secretary Has Posed For Some Mug Shots|date=August 28, 2019|website=The Smoking Gun|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref> She returned to court twice for failure to pay the $779 in fines and failure to complete a [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] program.<ref name=azr_20190626 />

===Trump administration===
After Trump's January 2017 inauguration, Grisham was named deputy press secretary for [[Sean Spicer]] in the West Wing of the White House.<ref name=\"fox10phoenix\"/><ref name=\"Fortune06142019\"/>

In March 2017, First Lady Melania Trump moved her over to the East Wing.<ref name=\"Fortune06142019\"/><ref name=sentinel_20170327 /> A former White House colleague said that the president regretted losing Grisham to the first lady's office because of Grisham's loyalty and skill at handling the press while acting as his traveling press secretary. During that time, she built relationships with many reporters at events. Despite losing Grisham as part of his own staff, President Trump said he was satisfied that the first lady would \"be in good hands\". Grisham was described by several sources who had worked with her previously as being \"highly competent\" and \"self-aware\"; some suggested that she enjoyed \"trolling the press.\" <ref name=\"Beast\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-white-house-wont-stop-melania-from-contradicting-trump|title=The White House Won't Stop Melania From Contradicting Trump|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|last=Markay|first=Lachlan|date=August 7, 2018|accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Office of Special Counsel]] stated that Grisham violated the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] following a complaint by Senator [[Tom Carper]]. Grisham was accused of using her official [[Twitter]] account on July 11, 2018, to tweet out Trump's campaign slogan. Violation of the act is not a crime, but a workplace guideline, and the agency responded by sending Grisham a warning letter.<ref name=\"Hatch\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/melania-trump-spokesperson-violate-hatch-act-1132130|title=Melania Trump's Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham Violated Hatch Act With 'Make America Great Again' Tweet|last=Hutzler|first=Alexandra|work=[[Newsweek]] |date=October 9, 2018|accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref>

On September 23, 2019, when asked by the hosts of Fox & Friends if the White House planned to resume its daily press briefing Grisham said \"not right now... I mean, ultimately, if the president decides that it's something we should do, we can do that, but right now he's doing just fine. And to be honest, the briefings have become a lot of theater.

It is horrible that people are working against a president who is delivering results for this country and has been since day one.

On October 26, 2019, in response to criticism of President Trump by his former chief of staff Gen. [[John F. Kelly]] (Ret.)

On November 13, 2019, during the testimony of [[William B.

That same month, Grisham claimed that Obama administration officials had left \"you will fail\" notes for the incoming Trump administration officials.

The '''Antonov An-225 Mriya''' ({{lang-uk|Антонов Ан-225 Мрія|lit=dream' or 'inspiration}}; [[NATO]] [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]]: '''Cossack''') is a [[strategic airlift]] [[cargo aircraft]] that was designed by the [[Antonov|Antonov Design Bureau]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] within the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1980s. It is powered by six [[turbofan]] engines and is the [[list of large aircraft|heaviest aircraft ever built]], with a [[maximum takeoff weight]] of {{convert|640|t|ST+LT}}.

==Development==
[[File:Antonov An-225 with Soviet space shuttle Buran on top.jpeg|thumb|left|An-225 carrying ''Buran'' in 1989]]

The Antonov An-225 was designed to airlift the [[Energia]] rocket's [[Zenit (rocket family)#Energia booster|boosters]] and the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'']] orbiter for the [[Soviet space program]]. It was developed as a replacement for the [[Myasishchev VM-T]].

The second An-225 was partially built during the late 1980s for the Soviet space program. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the cancellation of the Buran space program, the lone operational An-225 was placed in storage in 1994.<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=389 Antonov An-225 Mriya].

By 2000, the need for additional An-225 capacity had become apparent, so the decision was made in September 2006 to complete the second An-225. The second airframe was scheduled for completion around 2008,<ref>[http://www.aviationexplorer.com/Antonov_AN-225.html Antonov An-225 Mriya Aircraft History, Facts and Pictures].

==Design==
[[File:Antonov-225 main landing gear 2.jpg|thumb|left|An-225's main landing gear]]

Based on Antonov's earlier [[Antonov An-124|An-124]], the An-225 has fuselage barrel extensions added fore and aft of the wings. The wings also received root extensions to increase span. The wings are [[Anhedral (aeronautics)|anhedral]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Dave |title=Aerospaceweb.org {{!}} Ask Us - Wing Twist and Dihedral |url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/dynamics/q0055.shtml |website=www.aerospaceweb.org |date=2 December 2001}}</ref><ref name=mf/> The [[flight control surfaces]] are controlled via [[fly-by-wire]] and triple-redundant hydraulics.<ref name=\"ramAn225\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Antonov An-225 |url=https://www.copybook.com/fact-files/antonov-an-225 |website=www.copybook.com}}</ref> Two more [[Progress D-18T]] [[turbofan]] engines were added to the new [[wing root]]s, bringing the total to six. An increased-capacity [[landing gear]] system with 32 wheels was designed, some of which are steerable, enabling the aircraft to turn within a {{convert|60|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} runway. Like its An-124 predecessor, the An-225 has nose gear designed to \"kneel\" so cargo can be more easily loaded and unloaded.<ref name=\"ramAn225\"/> Unlike the An-124, which has a rear cargo door and ramp, the An-225 design left these off to save weight, and the [[empennage]] design was changed from a single [[vertical stabilizer]] to a [[twin tail]] with an oversized, swept-back [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal stabilizer]]. The twin tail was essential to enable the plane to carry large, heavy external loads that would disturb the [[aerodynamics|airflow]] around a conventional tail. Unlike the An-124, the An-225 was not intended for [[Airlift#Tactical airlift|tactical airlifting]] and is not designed for [[STOL|short-field operation]].<ref name=\"goebel\"/>

[[File:ILA 2018, Schönefeld (1X7A5450).jpg|thumb|Three of six [[Ivchenko Progress D-18T]] turbofan engines on the An-225]]
Initially the An-225 had a maximum gross weight of {{convert|600|t|ST+LT|abbr=on}}, but from 2000 to 2001 the aircraft underwent modifications at a cost of US$20M such as the addition of a reinforced floor, which increased the maximum gross weight to {{convert|640|t|ST+LT|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Forward\">Forward, David C: \"Antonov's Dream Machine\", p. 23.

Both the earlier and later takeoff weights establish the An-225 as the world's heaviest aircraft, being heavier than the double-deck [[Airbus A380]]. It is surpassed in other size-related categories, however: Airbus claims to have improved upon the An-225's maximum landing weight by landing an A380 at {{convert|591.7|t|lb}} during tests,<ref name=\"FlightglobalAirbusRevealsA380-LinkedPilotSystemsSecrets\">{{cite news|last1=Learmount|first1=David|title=Airbus reveals A380-linked pilot systems secrets|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-reveals-a380-linked-pilot-systems-secrets-327310/|accessdate=9 July 2009|work=[[Flightglobal]]|date=3 June 2009|location=London}}</ref> and the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]], known as the \"Spruce Goose\", has a greater wingspan and a greater overall height.

==Operational history==
[[File:An-225-manchester-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Antonov An-225 at [[Manchester Airport]] in 2006]]

During the last years of the [[Soviet space program]], the An-225 was employed as the prime method of transporting the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'']] space shuttle.<ref name=\"avzone\"/>

===Antonov commercialization===
[[File:Antonov An-225.jpg|thumb|Antonov An-225 at [[Arlanda Airport]], [[Sweden]]]]

In the late 1980s, the Soviet government was looking for a way to generate revenue from its military assets. In 1989, the Antonov Design Bureau set up a holding company as a heavy airlift shipping corporation under the name \"[[Antonov Airlines]]\", based in [[Kiev]], Ukraine and operating from [[London Luton Airport]] in partnership with [[Air Foyle HeavyLift]].<ref name=\"antonov\"/><ref name=\"goleta\">{{cite web |url=http://www.air-and-space.com/Antonov%20An-225%20Mriya.htm |website=Goleta Air & Space Museum |title=An-225 Mriya, NATO: Cossack |accessdate=31 March 2004}}</ref>

The company began operations with a fleet of four An-124-100s and three [[Antonov An-12]]s, but a need for aircraft larger than the An-124 became apparent in the late 1990s. In response, the original An-225 was re-engined, modified for heavy cargo transport, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines.

The An-225 attracts a high degree of public interest, so much that it has managed to attain a global following due to its size and its uniqueness. People frequently visit airports to see its scheduled arrivals and departures, such as in [[Perth]], Australia in May 2016 when a crowd of more than 50,000 people gathered at [[Perth Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/antonov-an225-mriya-worlds-biggest-planes-perth-landing-delayed-20160515-goven7.html |title= Antonov An-225 Mriya touches down in WA amid traffic chaos near Perth Airport |publisher=WANews.com |date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>{{better source|Text really needs another source that says 50K spectators were there, instead of \"were expected\"|date=October 2018}}

===Contracted flights===
The type's first flight in commercial service departed from [[Stuttgart]], Germany on 3 January 2002, and flew to [[Thumrait, Oman]] with 216,000 prepared meals for American military personnel based in the region. This vast number of ready meals was transported on 375 pallets and weighed 187.5 tons.<ref name=airfoyle2>{{cite web |url=http://www.airfoyle.co.uk/services/an225.asp |website=AirFoyle |title=Antonov Airlines:An-225 Mriya |access-date=10 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523173109/http://www.airfoyle.co.uk/services/an225.asp |archive-date=23 May 2006 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The An-225 has since become the workhorse of the Antonov Airlines fleet, transporting objects once thought impossible to move by air, such as 150-tonne generators. It has become an asset to international relief organizations for its ability to quickly transport huge quantities of emergency supplies during disaster relief operations.<ref name=\"aircraft info\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/antonov/AN-225 |website=Aircraft-Info.net |title=Antonov An-225 |accessdate=15 February 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401135622/http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/antonov/AN-225 |archivedate=1 April 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The An-225 has been contracted by the Canadian and U.S. governments to transport military supplies to the Middle East in support of coalition forces.<ref name=\"aircraft info\"/> An example of the cost of shipping cargo by An-225 was over 2 million [[Danish krone|DKK]] (approx. €266,000) for flying a chimney duct from [[Billund Airport|Billund]], Denmark to Kazakhstan in 2004.<ref name=\"steelcon\">[http://www.steelcon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/Steelcon__News_GB.pdf Steelcon News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716133659/http://www.steelcon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/Steelcon__News_GB.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}. steelcon.com.

The '''Antonov An-225 Mriya''' ({{lang-uk|Антонов Ан-225 Мрія|lit=dream' or 'inspiration}}; [[NATO]] [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]]: '''Cossack''') is a [[strategic airlift]] [[cargo aircraft]] that was designed by the [[Antonov|Antonov Design Bureau]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] within the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1980s. It is powered by six [[turbofan]] engines and is the [[list of large aircraft|heaviest aircraft ever built]], with a [[maximum takeoff weight]] of {{convert|640|t|ST+LT}}.

The Antonov An-225 was designed to airlift the [[Energia]] rocket's [[Zenit (rocket family)#Energia booster|boosters]] and the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'']] orbiter for the [[Soviet space program]]. It was developed as a replacement for the [[Myasishchev VM-T]].

==Design==
[[File:Antonov-225 main landing gear 2.jpg|thumb|left|An-225's main landing gear]]

Based on Antonov's earlier [[Antonov An-124|An-124]], the An-225 has fuselage barrel extensions added fore and aft of the wings. The wings also received root extensions to increase span. The wings are [[Anhedral (aeronautics)|anhedral]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Dave |title=Aerospaceweb.org {{!}} Ask Us - Wing Twist and Dihedral |url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/dynamics/q0055.shtml |website=www.aerospaceweb.org |date=2 December 2001}}</ref><ref name=mf/> The [[flight control surfaces]] are controlled via [[fly-by-wire]] and triple-redundant hydraulics.<ref name=\"ramAn225\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Antonov An-225 |url=https://www.copybook.com/fact-files/antonov-an-225 |website=www.copybook.com}}</ref> Two more [[Progress D-18T]] [[turbofan]] engines were added to the new [[wing root]]s, bringing the total to six. An increased-capacity [[landing gear]] system with 32 wheels was designed, some of which are steerable, enabling the aircraft to turn within a {{convert|60|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} runway. Like its An-124 predecessor, the An-225 has nose gear designed to \"kneel\" so cargo can be more easily loaded and unloaded.<ref name=\"ramAn225\"/> Unlike the An-124, which has a rear cargo door and ramp, the An-225 design left these off to save weight, and the [[empennage]] design was changed from a single [[vertical stabilizer]] to a [[twin tail]] with an oversized, swept-back [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal stabilizer]]. The twin tail was essential to enable the plane to carry large, heavy external loads that would disturb the [[aerodynamics|airflow]] around a conventional tail. Unlike the An-124, the An-225 was not intended for [[Airlift#Tactical airlift|tactical airlifting]] and is not designed for [[STOL|short-field operation]].<ref name=\"goebel\"/>

Initially the An-225 had a maximum gross weight of {{convert|600|t|ST+LT|abbr=on}}, but from 2000 to 2001 the aircraft underwent modifications at a cost of US$20M such as the addition of a reinforced floor, which increased the maximum gross weight to {{convert|640|t|ST+LT|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Forward\">Forward, David C: \"Antonov's Dream Machine\", p. 23.

Both the earlier and later takeoff weights establish the An-225 as the world's heaviest aircraft, being heavier than the double-deck [[Airbus A380]]. It is surpassed in other size-related categories, however: Airbus claims to have improved upon the An-225's maximum landing weight by landing an A380 at {{convert|591.7|t|lb}} during tests,<ref name=\"FlightglobalAirbusRevealsA380-LinkedPilotSystemsSecrets\">{{cite news|last1=Learmount|first1=David|title=Airbus reveals A380-linked pilot systems secrets|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-reveals-a380-linked-pilot-systems-secrets-327310/|accessdate=9 July 2009|work=[[Flightglobal]]|date=3 June 2009|location=London}}</ref> and the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]], known as the \"Spruce Goose\", has a greater wingspan and a greater overall height.

==Operational history==
[[File:An-225-manchester-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Antonov An-225 at [[Manchester Airport]] in 2006]]

During the last years of the [[Soviet space program]], the An-225 was employed as the prime method of transporting the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'']] space shuttle.<ref name=\"avzone\"/>

===Antonov commercialization===
[[File:Antonov An-225.jpg|thumb|Antonov An-225 at [[Arlanda Airport]], [[Sweden]]]]

In the late 1980s, the Soviet government was looking for a way to generate revenue from its military assets. In 1989, the Antonov Design Bureau set up a holding company as a heavy airlift shipping corporation under the name \"[[Antonov Airlines]]\", based in [[Kiev]], Ukraine and operating from [[London Luton Airport]] in partnership with [[Air Foyle HeavyLift]].<ref name=\"antonov\"/><ref name=\"goleta\">{{cite web |url=http://www.air-and-space.com/Antonov%20An-225%20Mriya.htm |website=Goleta Air & Space Museum |title=An-225 Mriya, NATO: Cossack |accessdate=31 March 2004}}</ref>

The company began operations with a fleet of four An-124-100s and three [[Antonov An-12]]s, but a need for aircraft larger than the An-124 became apparent in the late 1990s. In response, the original An-225 was re-engined, modified for heavy cargo transport, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines.

The An-225 attracts a high degree of public interest, so much that it has managed to attain a global following due to its size and its uniqueness. People frequently visit airports to see its scheduled arrivals and departures, such as in [[Perth]], Australia in May 2016 when a crowd of more than 50,000 people gathered at [[Perth Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/antonov-an225-mriya-worlds-biggest-planes-perth-landing-delayed-20160515-goven7.html |title= Antonov An-225 Mriya touches down in WA amid traffic chaos near Perth Airport |publisher=WANews.com |date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>{{better source|Text really needs another source that says 50K spectators were there, instead of \"were expected\"|date=October 2018}}

===Contracted flights===
The type's first flight in commercial service departed from [[Stuttgart]], Germany on 3 January 2002, and flew to [[Thumrait, Oman]] with 216,000 prepared meals for American military personnel based in the region. This vast number of ready meals was transported on 375 pallets and weighed 187.5 tons.<ref name=airfoyle2>{{cite web |url=http://www.airfoyle.co.uk/services/an225.asp |website=AirFoyle |title=Antonov Airlines:An-225 Mriya |access-date=10 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523173109/http://www.airfoyle.co.uk/services/an225.asp |archive-date=23 May 2006 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The An-225 has since become the workhorse of the Antonov Airlines fleet, transporting objects once thought impossible to move by air, such as 150-tonne generators. It has become an asset to international relief organizations for its ability to quickly transport huge quantities of emergency supplies during disaster relief operations.<ref name=\"aircraft info\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/antonov/AN-225 |website=Aircraft-Info.net |title=Antonov An-225 |accessdate=15 February 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401135622/http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/antonov/AN-225 |archivedate=1 April 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The An-225 has been contracted by the Canadian and U.S. governments to transport military supplies to the Middle East in support of coalition forces.<ref name=\"aircraft info\"/> An example of the cost of shipping cargo by An-225 was over 2 million [[Danish krone|DKK]] (approx. €266,000) for flying a chimney duct from [[Billund Airport|Billund]], Denmark to Kazakhstan in 2004.<ref name=\"steelcon\">[http://www.steelcon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/Steelcon__News_GB.pdf Steelcon News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716133659/http://www.steelcon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/Steelcon__News_GB.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}. steelcon.com.

The '''Battle of Bautzen''' (or '''Battle of Budziszyn''', April 1945) was one of the last battles of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder–Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.

The battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen–[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol Świerczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. 

After the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.

==Background==
In the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol Świerczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gräser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Schörner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>

On 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Weißer Schöps|Weisser Schöps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Weißenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>

Świerczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Schörner was concentrating his units (the \"Görlitz Group\") in the [[Görlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army. His aim was to stop the 1st Front's advance and break through to Berlin to relieve the trapped [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans were pinning their hopes on the idea that the Soviets might be fended off long enough for the city to be surrendered to the Western Allies.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> The concentration of Schörner's units went unnoticed by Soviet and Polish reconnaissance.<ref name=zw/>

==Prelude==

===Opposing forces===
German forces were composed of elements of the 4th Panzer Army and commanded by the headquarters for the ''Grossdeutschland'' and 57th Armored Corps.  For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}

The Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>

Overall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior. Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced, however the German sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers and inexperienced recruits of ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/>

===Drive on Dresden===
On 21 April, a gap had formed between the Polish infantry units (8th and 9th infantry divisions) and the 1st Armored Corps pushing towards Dresden, and the Polish units which were securing the Muskauer Forst region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The 7th and 10th infantry divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th Infantry Division and the 16th Tank Brigade were in transit in between those two groups.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish units were stretched over a line of {{convert|50|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=zw/> The Germans took the opportunity to push into this gap.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The battle started on 21 April.<ref name=\"zw\"/> In the west, the 20th Panzer Division started its drive on Bautzen, while in the east the 17th Infantry Division  advanced on Niesky and Weißenberg, freeing trapped German troops on its way.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> The Germans drove between the Polish Second Army and the [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 52nd Army]] around Bautzen, some {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} north-east of Dresden and {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} west of Görlitz, sweeping the Soviet units of the [[48th Rifle Corps]], and driving towards [[Spremberg]].<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Major General [[M. K. Puteiko]], commander of the 52nd Army's [[254th Rifle Division]] of the [[73rd Rifle Corps]] was mortally wounded around Bautzen.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998\"/> At first, Polish general Świerczewski continued with his attempt to take Dresden, which contributed to the growing chaos in the Polish forces, as many communication lines were cut.<ref name=zw/>

The Germans succeeded in linking up with the remnants of their forces in the Muskauer Forst, and throwing the local Polish and Soviet forces into chaos.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish Second Army lost cohesion and split into four groups.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Several units of the Polish Second Army found themselves surrounded.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> In particular, the Polish 5th Infantry Division and 16th Tank Brigade were struck in the rear, suffering severe losses.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The headquarters of the 5th Division, defended only by sapper and training battalions, came under attack.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/> The command group managed to break through to the 16th Tank Brigade, but that unit itself was almost annihilated at [[Förstgen]] (Forsiegen), losing over 90 percent of its personnel; out of 1,300 soldiers, only about 100 survived.<ref name=zw/> The commanding general of the Polish 5th Infantry Division, [[Aleksander Waszkiewicz]], was killed.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/> In the village of Niederkaina, today a part of Bautzen, between 196 and 300 captured German members of the ''Volkssturm'' were locked in a barn which was set on fire by retreating Polish or Soviet troops.<ref name=\"Eberhardt\"/><ref name=kiS/><ref name=ba/>

By 23 April the German breakthrough reached the [[Schwarzer Schöps]] River in the east, and [[Lohsa]], [[Oppitz]] and [[Grossdubrau]] in the west. The main body of the German force was located in the forested region around Lohsa.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans continued their push toward [[Königswartha]] and [[Hoyerswerda]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

===Polish retreat===
Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's advance on Dresden, and ordered it to pull back and secure the breach.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-132\"/> On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th remained near Dresden. For a while Świerczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Konev also sent his chief of staff, General [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov]], and his chief of operations, General [[Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev]], to look at the situation.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence.<ref name=\"zw\"/> To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions.<ref name=zw/> The [[14th Guards Rifle Division|Soviet 14th]] and [[95th Guards Rifle Division|95th Guards Rifle Divisions]], as well as the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|4th Guards Tank Corps]], were ordered to attack toward [[Kamenz]], Königswartha and [[Sdier]] to stop the Germans from advancing further north.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\" /> The [[2nd Air Army]] was also assigned to this theater.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/>

Meanwhile, the German advance to the southeast of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet [[294th Rifle Division]] was encircled at Weißenberg by the ''Brandenburg'' Division.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, large parts of the 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was able to break into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody [[house-to-house fighting|house-to-house combat]]. Several remaining pockets of resistance in the town were cleared during the next days.<ref name=Ahlfen208209/><ref name=B199942-46/> Outside the town the German advance stalled, as their troops were running low on fuel supplies.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The recapture of Bautzen was one of the last successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.<ref name=\"WilliamsonAndrew2003\"/>

By 25 April, Polish units were able to stabilize a defense on the line Kamenz–[[Kuckau]]–north Bautzen–Spree–[[Spreewiese]]–[[Kreba-Neudorf|Heideanger]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> On that day, [[Hitler]] congratulated Schörner on his \"victory\".<ref name=\"Mcateer2009\"/> The Polish 7th and 10th infantry divisions were ordered to advance toward Sdier-Heideanger.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The 7th and 10th Polish infantry divisions slowly advanced, with the 10th reaching north of [[Uhyst|Spreefurt]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> With the Soviet units on their right flank they also secured a road to Königswartha.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>

The 9th Division found itself alone at the spearhead of the abandoned Polish push towards Dresden. It received orders to retreat on 26 April.<ref name=as/> Attempting to withdraw quickly and to form back with the main forces, it was intercepted by the Germans and sustained heavy losses.<ref name=zw/> The units were moving with insufficient security, on the assumption that the line of retreat was safe; at the same time the Germans captured Polish orders with details of their planned withdrawal routes.<ref name=zw/> Coordination between the units was also lacking.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> 26th Infantry Regiment from the 9th Division took very heavy casualties (75 percent) in the \"valley of death\" around [[Panschwitz-Kuckau]] and [[Crostwitz]].<ref name=zw/> A Polish [[military hospital]] convoy from the same division was ambushed near [[Horka, Saxony|Horka]], with [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|most of its personnel and wounded executed]] (about 300 casualties). There was only one survivor, chaplain Jan Rdzanek.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"GrzelakStańczyk1993\"/> The division commander, Colonel [[Aleksander Łaski]], was taken captive.<ref name=zw/><ref name=zw/> As a result of these losses, the 9th Division ceased to be an effective force; the remaining personnel were merged into the Soviet [[19th Guards Rifle Division]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

According to some sources, 26 April marks the end of this battle, although less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April.<ref name=zw/> Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> By the end of the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–[[Doberschütz]]–[[Dauban]], and was preparing to launch an offensive toward [[Prague]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Pomnik żołnierzy polskich Crostwitz.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to Polish soldiers in [[Crostwitz]]]]
Both sides suffered heavy casualties.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The Polish casualties were particularly severe.<ref name=zw/> In a relatively short time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total).<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead).<ref name=zw/> Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000.<ref name=zw/> According to Polish historian [[Zbigniew Wawer]], this was the most bloody battle that the [[Polish Army]] had been involved in since the [[battle of Bzura]] in 1939.<ref name=zw/>

German casualties were significant, but less than the Polish and Soviet ones; contemporary Polish sources estimated German losses at 6,500 personnel, which is now seen as an inflated estimate.<ref name=zw/> The German forces failed in their objective of breaking through the 1st Ukrainian Front and coming to the aid of Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> They managed, however, to inflict very serious casualties on the local Polish and Soviet units and stopped the Polish drive on Dresden (it was still in German hands at the time of the German capitulation on May 9).<ref name=zw/> The successful recapture of Bautzen, Weißenberg and surroundings is called one of the last successful German armored counterattacks of the war. Bautzen and surroundings stayed in German hands until [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's capitulation]]. Although the battle had no strategic impact on the battle raging  in Berlin, it allowed most of the participating German units as well as numerous refugees from the east to escape to the west, surrendering to the Western Allies.<ref name=zw/><ref name=B199942-46/><ref name=Ahlfen209/>

==Historiography==
[[File:Karol Świerczewski 'Walter'.jpg|thumb|left|220px|General Karol Świerczewski|alt=General Karol Świerczewski]]
Despite the heavy Polish casualties, or possibly because of them, the battle has been largely neglected in Polish [[historiography]].<ref name=\"zw\"/> During the period of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> However, since the [[fall of communism]] modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force.<ref name=zw/> Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Piecuch1997\"/> He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev,<ref name=zw/> but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the [[NKVD]]) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero.<ref name=zw/> The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

In modern Poland, the battle's outcome is seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops.<ref name=zw/> As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet frontline was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

==Notes==
<small>'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Wawer incorrectly identifies this formation as the [[5th Guards Tank Army]], which was near the Baltic coast at the time and subordinated to the 2nd Belorussian Front.<ref name=zw/> Komornicki correctly identifies the formation as the [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/>

'''b''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Wawer and Solak assert that the 2nd SS Panzer Division was also present in the battle. This is an incorrect assertion as the 2nd SS Division fought in Hungary and Austria from January 1945 until the end of the war.<ref name=T145/> The 21st Panzer Division has also been mentioned in connection with this battle, but the 21st had already moved north as part of reinforcements provided by the 4th Panzer Army to the 9th Army. By the time the Battle of Bautzen had begun, both the 21st Panzer Division and the 10th SS Panzer Division (minus its supply train) were committed to support the 9th Army and both were encircled in the [[Battle of Halbe|Halbe Pocket]]. The assessments of Polish historian Kormonicki,<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> German general von Ahlfen, and Polish historian Grzelak all support the order of battle not including the 21st and 10th SS Divisions.

The '''Battle of Bautzen''' (or '''Battle of Budziszyn''', April 1945) was one of the last battles of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder–Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.

The battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen–[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol Świerczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. 

After the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.

==Background==
In the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol Świerczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gräser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Schörner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>

On 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Weißer Schöps|Weisser Schöps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Weißenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>

Świerczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Schörner was concentrating his units (the \"Görlitz Group\") in the [[Görlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army. His aim was to stop the 1st Front's advance and break through to Berlin to relieve the trapped [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans were pinning their hopes on the idea that the Soviets might be fended off long enough for the city to be surrendered to the Western Allies.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> The concentration of Schörner's units went unnoticed by Soviet and Polish reconnaissance.<ref name=zw/>

==Prelude==

===Opposing forces===
German forces were composed of elements of the 4th Panzer Army and commanded by the headquarters for the ''Grossdeutschland'' and 57th Armored Corps.  For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}

The Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>

Overall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior. Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced, however the German sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers and inexperienced recruits of ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/>

On 21 April, a gap had formed between the Polish infantry units (8th and 9th infantry divisions) and the 1st Armored Corps pushing towards Dresden, and the Polish units which were securing the Muskauer Forst region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The 7th and 10th infantry divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th Infantry Division and the 16th Tank Brigade were in transit in between those two groups.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish units were stretched over a line of {{convert|50|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=zw/> The Germans took the opportunity to push into this gap.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The battle started on 21 April.<ref name=\"zw\"/> In the west, the 20th Panzer Division started its drive on Bautzen, while in the east the 17th Infantry Division  advanced on Niesky and Weißenberg, freeing trapped German troops on its way.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> The Germans drove between the Polish Second Army and the [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 52nd Army]] around Bautzen, some {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} north-east of Dresden and {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} west of Görlitz, sweeping the Soviet units of the [[48th Rifle Corps]], and driving towards [[Spremberg]].<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Major General [[M. K. Puteiko]], commander of the 52nd Army's [[254th Rifle Division]] of the [[73rd Rifle Corps]] was mortally wounded around Bautzen.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998\"/> At first, Polish general Świerczewski continued with his attempt to take Dresden, which contributed to the growing chaos in the Polish forces, as many communication lines were cut.<ref name=zw/>

The Germans succeeded in linking up with the remnants of their forces in the Muskauer Forst, and throwing the local Polish and Soviet forces into chaos.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish Second Army lost cohesion and split into four groups.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Several units of the Polish Second Army found themselves surrounded.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> In particular, the Polish 5th Infantry Division and 16th Tank Brigade were struck in the rear, suffering severe losses.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The headquarters of the 5th Division, defended only by sapper and training battalions, came under attack.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/> The command group managed to break through to the 16th Tank Brigade, but that unit itself was almost annihilated at [[Förstgen]] (Forsiegen), losing over 90 percent of its personnel; out of 1,300 soldiers, only about 100 survived.<ref name=zw/> The commanding general of the Polish 5th Infantry Division, [[Aleksander Waszkiewicz]], was killed.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/> In the village of Niederkaina, today a part of Bautzen, between 196 and 300 captured German members of the ''Volkssturm'' were locked in a barn which was set on fire by retreating Polish or Soviet troops.<ref name=\"Eberhardt\"/><ref name=kiS/><ref name=ba/>

By 23 April the German breakthrough reached the [[Schwarzer Schöps]] River in the east, and [[Lohsa]], [[Oppitz]] and [[Grossdubrau]] in the west. The main body of the German force was located in the forested region around Lohsa.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans continued their push toward [[Königswartha]] and [[Hoyerswerda]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

===Polish retreat===
Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's advance on Dresden, and ordered it to pull back and secure the breach.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-132\"/> On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th remained near Dresden. For a while Świerczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Konev also sent his chief of staff, General [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov]], and his chief of operations, General [[Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev]], to look at the situation.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence.<ref name=\"zw\"/> To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions.<ref name=zw/> The [[14th Guards Rifle Division|Soviet 14th]] and [[95th Guards Rifle Division|95th Guards Rifle Divisions]], as well as the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|4th Guards Tank Corps]], were ordered to attack toward [[Kamenz]], Königswartha and [[Sdier]] to stop the Germans from advancing further north.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\" /> The [[2nd Air Army]] was also assigned to this theater.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/>

Meanwhile, the German advance to the southeast of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet [[294th Rifle Division]] was encircled at Weißenberg by the ''Brandenburg'' Division.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, large parts of the 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was able to break into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody [[house-to-house fighting|house-to-house combat]]. Several remaining pockets of resistance in the town were cleared during the next days.<ref name=Ahlfen208209/><ref name=B199942-46/> Outside the town the German advance stalled, as their troops were running low on fuel supplies.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The recapture of Bautzen was one of the last successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.<ref name=\"WilliamsonAndrew2003\"/>

By 25 April, Polish units were able to stabilize a defense on the line Kamenz–[[Kuckau]]–north Bautzen–Spree–[[Spreewiese]]–[[Kreba-Neudorf|Heideanger]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> On that day, [[Hitler]] congratulated Schörner on his \"victory\".<ref name=\"Mcateer2009\"/> The Polish 7th and 10th infantry divisions were ordered to advance toward Sdier-Heideanger.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The 7th and 10th Polish infantry divisions slowly advanced, with the 10th reaching north of [[Uhyst|Spreefurt]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> With the Soviet units on their right flank they also secured a road to Königswartha.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>

The 9th Division found itself alone at the spearhead of the abandoned Polish push towards Dresden. It received orders to retreat on 26 April.<ref name=as/> Attempting to withdraw quickly and to form back with the main forces, it was intercepted by the Germans and sustained heavy losses.<ref name=zw/> The units were moving with insufficient security, on the assumption that the line of retreat was safe; at the same time the Germans captured Polish orders with details of their planned withdrawal routes.<ref name=zw/> Coordination between the units was also lacking.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> 26th Infantry Regiment from the 9th Division took very heavy casualties (75 percent) in the \"valley of death\" around [[Panschwitz-Kuckau]] and [[Crostwitz]].<ref name=zw/> A Polish [[military hospital]] convoy from the same division was ambushed near [[Horka, Saxony|Horka]], with [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|most of its personnel and wounded executed]] (about 300 casualties). There was only one survivor, chaplain Jan Rdzanek.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"GrzelakStańczyk1993\"/> The division commander, Colonel [[Aleksander Łaski]], was taken captive.<ref name=zw/><ref name=zw/> As a result of these losses, the 9th Division ceased to be an effective force; the remaining personnel were merged into the Soviet [[19th Guards Rifle Division]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

According to some sources, 26 April marks the end of this battle, although less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April.<ref name=zw/> Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> By the end of the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–[[Doberschütz]]–[[Dauban]], and was preparing to launch an offensive toward [[Prague]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Pomnik żołnierzy polskich Crostwitz.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to Polish soldiers in [[Crostwitz]]]]
Both sides suffered heavy casualties.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The Polish casualties were particularly severe.<ref name=zw/> In a relatively short time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total).<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead).<ref name=zw/> Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000.<ref name=zw/> According to Polish historian [[Zbigniew Wawer]], this was the most bloody battle that the [[Polish Army]] had been involved in since the [[battle of Bzura]] in 1939.<ref name=zw/>

German casualties were significant, but less than the Polish and Soviet ones; contemporary Polish sources estimated German losses at 6,500 personnel, which is now seen as an inflated estimate.<ref name=zw/> The German forces failed in their objective of breaking through the 1st Ukrainian Front and coming to the aid of Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> They managed, however, to inflict very serious casualties on the local Polish and Soviet units and stopped the Polish drive on Dresden (it was still in German hands at the time of the German capitulation on May 9).<ref name=zw/> The successful recapture of Bautzen, Weißenberg and surroundings is called one of the last successful German armored counterattacks of the war. Bautzen and surroundings stayed in German hands until [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's capitulation]]. Although the battle had no strategic impact on the battle raging  in Berlin, it allowed most of the participating German units as well as numerous refugees from the east to escape to the west, surrendering to the Western Allies.<ref name=zw/><ref name=B199942-46/><ref name=Ahlfen209/>

==Historiography==
[[File:Karol Świerczewski 'Walter'.jpg|thumb|left|220px|General Karol Świerczewski|alt=General Karol Świerczewski]]
Despite the heavy Polish casualties, or possibly because of them, the battle has been largely neglected in Polish [[historiography]].<ref name=\"zw\"/> During the period of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> However, since the [[fall of communism]] modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force.<ref name=zw/> Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Piecuch1997\"/> He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev,<ref name=zw/> but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the [[NKVD]]) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero.<ref name=zw/> The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

In modern Poland, the battle's outcome is seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops.<ref name=zw/> As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet frontline was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

==Notes==
<small>'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Wawer incorrectly identifies this formation as the [[5th Guards Tank Army]], which was near the Baltic coast at the time and subordinated to the 2nd Belorussian Front.<ref name=zw/> Komornicki correctly identifies the formation as the [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/>

'''b''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Wawer and Solak assert that the 2nd SS Panzer Division was also present in the battle. This is an incorrect assertion as the 2nd SS Division fought in Hungary and Austria from January 1945 until the end of the war.<ref name=T145/> The 21st Panzer Division has also been mentioned in connection with this battle, but the 21st had already moved north as part of reinforcements provided by the 4th Panzer Army to the 9th Army. By the time the Battle of Bautzen had begun, both the 21st Panzer Division and the 10th SS Panzer Division (minus its supply train) were committed to support the 9th Army and both were encircled in the [[Battle of Halbe|Halbe Pocket]]. The assessments of Polish historian Kormonicki,<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> German general von Ahlfen, and Polish historian Grzelak all support the order of battle not including the 21st and 10th SS Divisions.

The '''Battle of Bautzen''' (or '''Battle of Budziszyn''', April 1945) was one of the last battles of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder–Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.

The battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen–[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol Świerczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. 

After the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.

==Background==
In the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol Świerczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gräser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Schörner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>

On 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Weißer Schöps|Weisser Schöps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Weißenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>

Świerczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Schörner was concentrating his units (the \"Görlitz Group\") in the [[Görlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army. His aim was to stop the 1st Front's advance and break through to Berlin to relieve the trapped [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans were pinning their hopes on the idea that the Soviets might be fended off long enough for the city to be surrendered to the Western Allies.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> The concentration of Schörner's units went unnoticed by Soviet and Polish reconnaissance.<ref name=zw/>

==Prelude==

===Opposing forces===
German forces were composed of elements of the 4th Panzer Army and commanded by the headquarters for the ''Grossdeutschland'' and 57th Armored Corps.  For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}

The Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>

Overall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior. Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced, however the German sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers and inexperienced recruits of ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/>

===Drive on Dresden===
On 21 April, a gap had formed between the Polish infantry units (8th and 9th infantry divisions) and the 1st Armored Corps pushing towards Dresden, and the Polish units which were securing the Muskauer Forst region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The 7th and 10th infantry divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th Infantry Division and the 16th Tank Brigade were in transit in between those two groups.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish units were stretched over a line of {{convert|50|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=zw/> The Germans took the opportunity to push into this gap.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The battle started on 21 April.<ref name=\"zw\"/> In the west, the 20th Panzer Division started its drive on Bautzen, while in the east the 17th Infantry Division  advanced on Niesky and Weißenberg, freeing trapped German troops on its way.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> The Germans drove between the Polish Second Army and the [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 52nd Army]] around Bautzen, some {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} north-east of Dresden and {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} west of Görlitz, sweeping the Soviet units of the [[48th Rifle Corps]], and driving towards [[Spremberg]].<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Major General [[M. K. Puteiko]], commander of the 52nd Army's [[254th Rifle Division]] of the [[73rd Rifle Corps]] was mortally wounded around Bautzen.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998\"/> At first, Polish general Świerczewski continued with his attempt to take Dresden, which contributed to the growing chaos in the Polish forces, as many communication lines were cut.<ref name=zw/>

The Germans succeeded in linking up with the remnants of their forces in the Muskauer Forst, and throwing the local Polish and Soviet forces into chaos.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish Second Army lost cohesion and split into four groups.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Several units of the Polish Second Army found themselves surrounded.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> In particular, the Polish 5th Infantry Division and 16th Tank Brigade were struck in the rear, suffering severe losses.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The headquarters of the 5th Division, defended only by sapper and training battalions, came under attack.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/> The command group managed to break through to the 16th Tank Brigade, but that unit itself was almost annihilated at [[Förstgen]] (Forsiegen), losing over 90 percent of its personnel; out of 1,300 soldiers, only about 100 survived.<ref name=zw/> The commanding general of the Polish 5th Infantry Division, [[Aleksander Waszkiewicz]], was killed.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/> In the village of Niederkaina, today a part of Bautzen, between 196 and 300 captured German members of the ''Volkssturm'' were locked in a barn which was set on fire by retreating Polish or Soviet troops.<ref name=\"Eberhardt\"/><ref name=kiS/><ref name=ba/>

By 23 April the German breakthrough reached the [[Schwarzer Schöps]] River in the east, and [[Lohsa]], [[Oppitz]] and [[Grossdubrau]] in the west. The main body of the German force was located in the forested region around Lohsa.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans continued their push toward [[Königswartha]] and [[Hoyerswerda]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

===Polish retreat===
Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's advance on Dresden, and ordered it to pull back and secure the breach.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-132\"/> On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th remained near Dresden. For a while Świerczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Konev also sent his chief of staff, General [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov]], and his chief of operations, General [[Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev]], to look at the situation.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence.<ref name=\"zw\"/> To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions.<ref name=zw/> The [[14th Guards Rifle Division|Soviet 14th]] and [[95th Guards Rifle Division|95th Guards Rifle Divisions]], as well as the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|4th Guards Tank Corps]], were ordered to attack toward [[Kamenz]], Königswartha and [[Sdier]] to stop the Germans from advancing further north.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\" /> The [[2nd Air Army]] was also assigned to this theater.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/>

Meanwhile, the German advance to the southeast of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet [[294th Rifle Division]] was encircled at Weißenberg by the ''Brandenburg'' Division.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, large parts of the 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was able to break into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody [[house-to-house fighting|house-to-house combat]]. Several remaining pockets of resistance in the town were cleared during the next days.<ref name=Ahlfen208209/><ref name=B199942-46/> Outside the town the German advance stalled, as their troops were running low on fuel supplies.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The recapture of Bautzen was one of the last successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.<ref name=\"WilliamsonAndrew2003\"/>

By 25 April, Polish units were able to stabilize a defense on the line Kamenz–[[Kuckau]]–north Bautzen–Spree–[[Spreewiese]]–[[Kreba-Neudorf|Heideanger]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> On that day, [[Hitler]] congratulated Schörner on his \"victory\".<ref name=\"Mcateer2009\"/> The Polish 7th and 10th infantry divisions were ordered to advance toward Sdier-Heideanger.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The 7th and 10th Polish infantry divisions slowly advanced, with the 10th reaching north of [[Uhyst|Spreefurt]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> With the Soviet units on their right flank they also secured a road to Königswartha.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>

The 9th Division found itself alone at the spearhead of the abandoned Polish push towards Dresden. It received orders to retreat on 26 April.<ref name=as/> Attempting to withdraw quickly and to form back with the main forces, it was intercepted by the Germans and sustained heavy losses.<ref name=zw/> The units were moving with insufficient security, on the assumption that the line of retreat was safe; at the same time the Germans captured Polish orders with details of their planned withdrawal routes.<ref name=zw/> Coordination between the units was also lacking.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> 26th Infantry Regiment from the 9th Division took very heavy casualties (75 percent) in the \"valley of death\" around [[Panschwitz-Kuckau]] and [[Crostwitz]].<ref name=zw/> A Polish [[military hospital]] convoy from the same division was ambushed near [[Horka, Saxony|Horka]], with [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|most of its personnel and wounded executed]] (about 300 casualties). There was only one survivor, chaplain Jan Rdzanek.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"GrzelakStańczyk1993\"/> The division commander, Colonel [[Aleksander Łaski]], was taken captive.<ref name=zw/><ref name=zw/> As a result of these losses, the 9th Division ceased to be an effective force; the remaining personnel were merged into the Soviet [[19th Guards Rifle Division]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

According to some sources, 26 April marks the end of this battle, although less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April.<ref name=zw/> Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> By the end of the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–[[Doberschütz]]–[[Dauban]], and was preparing to launch an offensive toward [[Prague]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Pomnik żołnierzy polskich Crostwitz.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to Polish soldiers in [[Crostwitz]]]]
Both sides suffered heavy casualties.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The Polish casualties were particularly severe.<ref name=zw/> In a relatively short time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total).<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead).<ref name=zw/> Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000.<ref name=zw/> According to Polish historian [[Zbigniew Wawer]], this was the most bloody battle that the [[Polish Army]] had been involved in since the [[battle of Bzura]] in 1939.<ref name=zw/>

German casualties were significant, but less than the Polish and Soviet ones; contemporary Polish sources estimated German losses at 6,500 personnel, which is now seen as an inflated estimate.<ref name=zw/> The German forces failed in their objective of breaking through the 1st Ukrainian Front and coming to the aid of Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> They managed, however, to inflict very serious casualties on the local Polish and Soviet units and stopped the Polish drive on Dresden (it was still in German hands at the time of the German capitulation on May 9).<ref name=zw/> The successful recapture of Bautzen, Weißenberg and surroundings is called one of the last successful German armored counterattacks of the war. Bautzen and surroundings stayed in German hands until [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's capitulation]]. Although the battle had no strategic impact on the battle raging  in Berlin, it allowed most of the participating German units as well as numerous refugees from the east to escape to the west, surrendering to the Western Allies.<ref name=zw/><ref name=B199942-46/><ref name=Ahlfen209/>

==Historiography==
[[File:Karol Świerczewski 'Walter'.jpg|thumb|left|220px|General Karol Świerczewski|alt=General Karol Świerczewski]]
Despite the heavy Polish casualties, or possibly because of them, the battle has been largely neglected in Polish [[historiography]].<ref name=\"zw\"/> During the period of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> However, since the [[fall of communism]] modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force.<ref name=zw/> Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Piecuch1997\"/> He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev,<ref name=zw/> but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the [[NKVD]]) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero.<ref name=zw/> The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

In modern Poland, the battle's outcome is seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops.<ref name=zw/> As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet frontline was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

==Notes==
<small>'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Wawer incorrectly identifies this formation as the [[5th Guards Tank Army]], which was near the Baltic coast at the time and subordinated to the 2nd Belorussian Front.<ref name=zw/> Komornicki correctly identifies the formation as the [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/>

'''b''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Wawer and Solak assert that the 2nd SS Panzer Division was also present in the battle. This is an incorrect assertion as the 2nd SS Division fought in Hungary and Austria from January 1945 until the end of the war.<ref name=T145/> The 21st Panzer Division has also been mentioned in connection with this battle, but the 21st had already moved north as part of reinforcements provided by the 4th Panzer Army to the 9th Army. By the time the Battle of Bautzen had begun, both the 21st Panzer Division and the 10th SS Panzer Division (minus its supply train) were committed to support the 9th Army and both were encircled in the [[Battle of Halbe|Halbe Pocket]]. The assessments of Polish historian Kormonicki,<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> German general von Ahlfen, and Polish historian Grzelak all support the order of battle not including the 21st and 10th SS Divisions.

The '''Battle of Bautzen''' (or '''Battle of Budziszyn''', April 1945) was one of the last battles of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder–Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.

The battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen–[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol Świerczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. 

After the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.

==Background==
In the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol Świerczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gräser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Schörner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>

On 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Weißer Schöps|Weisser Schöps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Weißenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>

Świerczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Schörner was concentrating his units (the \"Görlitz Group\") in the [[Görlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army. His aim was to stop the 1st Front's advance and break through to Berlin to relieve the trapped [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans were pinning their hopes on the idea that the Soviets might be fended off long enough for the city to be surrendered to the Western Allies.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> The concentration of Schörner's units went unnoticed by Soviet and Polish reconnaissance.<ref name=zw/>

==Prelude==

===Opposing forces===
German forces were composed of elements of the 4th Panzer Army and commanded by the headquarters for the ''Grossdeutschland'' and 57th Armored Corps.  For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}

The Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>

Overall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior. Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced, however the German sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers and inexperienced recruits of ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/>

===Drive on Dresden===
On 21 April, a gap had formed between the Polish infantry units (8th and 9th infantry divisions) and the 1st Armored Corps pushing towards Dresden, and the Polish units which were securing the Muskauer Forst region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The 7th and 10th infantry divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th Infantry Division and the 16th Tank Brigade were in transit in between those two groups.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish units were stretched over a line of {{convert|50|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=zw/> The Germans took the opportunity to push into this gap.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The battle started on 21 April.<ref name=\"zw\"/> In the west, the 20th Panzer Division started its drive on Bautzen, while in the east the 17th Infantry Division  advanced on Niesky and Weißenberg, freeing trapped German troops on its way.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> The Germans drove between the Polish Second Army and the [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 52nd Army]] around Bautzen, some {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} north-east of Dresden and {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} west of Görlitz, sweeping the Soviet units of the [[48th Rifle Corps]], and driving towards [[Spremberg]].<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Major General [[M. K. Puteiko]], commander of the 52nd Army's [[254th Rifle Division]] of the [[73rd Rifle Corps]] was mortally wounded around Bautzen.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998\"/> At first, Polish general Świerczewski continued with his attempt to take Dresden, which contributed to the growing chaos in the Polish forces, as many communication lines were cut.<ref name=zw/>

The Germans succeeded in linking up with the remnants of their forces in the Muskauer Forst, and throwing the local Polish and Soviet forces into chaos.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish Second Army lost cohesion and split into four groups.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Several units of the Polish Second Army found themselves surrounded.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> In particular, the Polish 5th Infantry Division and 16th Tank Brigade were struck in the rear, suffering severe losses.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The headquarters of the 5th Division, defended only by sapper and training battalions, came under attack.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/> The command group managed to break through to the 16th Tank Brigade, but that unit itself was almost annihilated at [[Förstgen]] (Forsiegen), losing over 90 percent of its personnel; out of 1,300 soldiers, only about 100 survived.<ref name=zw/> The commanding general of the Polish 5th Infantry Division, [[Aleksander Waszkiewicz]], was killed.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/> In the village of Niederkaina, today a part of Bautzen, between 196 and 300 captured German members of the ''Volkssturm'' were locked in a barn which was set on fire by retreating Polish or Soviet troops.<ref name=\"Eberhardt\"/><ref name=kiS/><ref name=ba/>

By 23 April the German breakthrough reached the [[Schwarzer Schöps]] River in the east, and [[Lohsa]], [[Oppitz]] and [[Grossdubrau]] in the west. The main body of the German force was located in the forested region around Lohsa.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans continued their push toward [[Königswartha]] and [[Hoyerswerda]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

===Polish retreat===
Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's advance on Dresden, and ordered it to pull back and secure the breach.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-132\"/> On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th remained near Dresden. For a while Świerczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Konev also sent his chief of staff, General [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov]], and his chief of operations, General [[Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev]], to look at the situation.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence.<ref name=\"zw\"/> To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions.<ref name=zw/> The [[14th Guards Rifle Division|Soviet 14th]] and [[95th Guards Rifle Division|95th Guards Rifle Divisions]], as well as the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|4th Guards Tank Corps]], were ordered to attack toward [[Kamenz]], Königswartha and [[Sdier]] to stop the Germans from advancing further north.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\" /> The [[2nd Air Army]] was also assigned to this theater.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/>

Meanwhile, the German advance to the southeast of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet [[294th Rifle Division]] was encircled at Weißenberg by the ''Brandenburg'' Division.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, large parts of the 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was able to break into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody [[house-to-house fighting|house-to-house combat]]. Several remaining pockets of resistance in the town were cleared during the next days.<ref name=Ahlfen208209/><ref name=B199942-46/> Outside the town the German advance stalled, as their troops were running low on fuel supplies.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The recapture of Bautzen was one of the last successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.<ref name=\"WilliamsonAndrew2003\"/>

By 25 April, Polish units were able to stabilize a defense on the line Kamenz–[[Kuckau]]–north Bautzen–Spree–[[Spreewiese]]–[[Kreba-Neudorf|Heideanger]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> On that day, [[Hitler]] congratulated Schörner on his \"victory\".<ref name=\"Mcateer2009\"/> The Polish 7th and 10th infantry divisions were ordered to advance toward Sdier-Heideanger.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The 7th and 10th Polish infantry divisions slowly advanced, with the 10th reaching north of [[Uhyst|Spreefurt]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> With the Soviet units on their right flank they also secured a road to Königswartha.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>

The 9th Division found itself alone at the spearhead of the abandoned Polish push towards Dresden. It received orders to retreat on 26 April.<ref name=as/> Attempting to withdraw quickly and to form back with the main forces, it was intercepted by the Germans and sustained heavy losses.<ref name=zw/> The units were moving with insufficient security, on the assumption that the line of retreat was safe; at the same time the Germans captured Polish orders with details of their planned withdrawal routes.<ref name=zw/> Coordination between the units was also lacking.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> 26th Infantry Regiment from the 9th Division took very heavy casualties (75 percent) in the \"valley of death\" around [[Panschwitz-Kuckau]] and [[Crostwitz]].<ref name=zw/> A Polish [[military hospital]] convoy from the same division was ambushed near [[Horka, Saxony|Horka]], with [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|most of its personnel and wounded executed]] (about 300 casualties). There was only one survivor, chaplain Jan Rdzanek.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"GrzelakStańczyk1993\"/> The division commander, Colonel [[Aleksander Łaski]], was taken captive.<ref name=zw/><ref name=zw/> As a result of these losses, the 9th Division ceased to be an effective force; the remaining personnel were merged into the Soviet [[19th Guards Rifle Division]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

According to some sources, 26 April marks the end of this battle, although less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April.<ref name=zw/> Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> By the end of the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–[[Doberschütz]]–[[Dauban]], and was preparing to launch an offensive toward [[Prague]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Pomnik żołnierzy polskich Crostwitz.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to Polish soldiers in [[Crostwitz]]]]
Both sides suffered heavy casualties.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The Polish casualties were particularly severe.<ref name=zw/> In a relatively short time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total).<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead).<ref name=zw/> Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000.<ref name=zw/> According to Polish historian [[Zbigniew Wawer]], this was the most bloody battle that the [[Polish Army]] had been involved in since the [[battle of Bzura]] in 1939.<ref name=zw/>

German casualties were significant, but less than the Polish and Soviet ones; contemporary Polish sources estimated German losses at 6,500 personnel, which is now seen as an inflated estimate.<ref name=zw/> The German forces failed in their objective of breaking through the 1st Ukrainian Front and coming to the aid of Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> They managed, however, to inflict very serious casualties on the local Polish and Soviet units and stopped the Polish drive on Dresden (it was still in German hands at the time of the German capitulation on May 9).<ref name=zw/> The successful recapture of Bautzen, Weißenberg and surroundings is called one of the last successful German armored counterattacks of the war. Bautzen and surroundings stayed in German hands until [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's capitulation]]. Although the battle had no strategic impact on the battle raging  in Berlin, it allowed most of the participating German units as well as numerous refugees from the east to escape to the west, surrendering to the Western Allies.<ref name=zw/><ref name=B199942-46/><ref name=Ahlfen209/>

==Historiography==
[[File:Karol Świerczewski 'Walter'.jpg|thumb|left|220px|General Karol Świerczewski|alt=General Karol Świerczewski]]
Despite the heavy Polish casualties, or possibly because of them, the battle has been largely neglected in Polish [[historiography]].<ref name=\"zw\"/> During the period of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> However, since the [[fall of communism]] modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force.<ref name=zw/> Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Piecuch1997\"/> He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev,<ref name=zw/> but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the [[NKVD]]) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero.<ref name=zw/> The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

In modern Poland, the battle's outcome is seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops.<ref name=zw/> As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet frontline was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>

==Notes==
<small>'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Wawer incorrectly identifies this formation as the [[5th Guards Tank Army]], which was near the Baltic coast at the time and subordinated to the 2nd Belorussian Front.<ref name=zw/> Komornicki correctly identifies the formation as the [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/>

'''b''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Wawer and Solak assert that the 2nd SS Panzer Division was also present in the battle. This is an incorrect assertion as the 2nd SS Division fought in Hungary and Austria from January 1945 until the end of the war.<ref name=T145/> The 21st Panzer Division has also been mentioned in connection with this battle, but the 21st had already moved north as part of reinforcements provided by the 4th Panzer Army to the 9th Army. By the time the Battle of Bautzen had begun, both the 21st Panzer Division and the 10th SS Panzer Division (minus its supply train) were committed to support the 9th Army and both were encircled in the [[Battle of Halbe|Halbe Pocket]]. The assessments of Polish historian Kormonicki,<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> German general von Ahlfen, and Polish historian Grzelak all support the order of battle not including the 21st and 10th SS Divisions.

===West Texas===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Texas}}
US&nbsp;62 has two separate segments in [[Texas]], separated by a portion in [[New Mexico]] with the first section in Texas from its terminus in El Paso to the state line in the [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park|Guadalupe Mountains]]. Through El Paso, US&nbsp;62 begins at the [[Paso del Norte International Bridge|Santa Fe Street Bridge]], and follows Santa Fe Street, then Paisano Drive. At the Paisano Drive underpass for [[Interstate 10|I-10]] (I-10 exit 23B), US&nbsp;62 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 180|US&nbsp;180]], while US&nbsp;180 ends its concurrency with I-10. The route then follows Montana Avenue, continuing the concurrency with US&nbsp;180 until [[Seminole, Texas|Seminole]]. Before exiting Texas, the route passes through the Salt Flats of Texas, the southern base of [[Guadalupe Peak]], the highest point in Texas, and [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park]].

===New Mexico===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in New Mexico}}
Through New Mexico, US&nbsp;62 is entirely concurrent with [[U.S. Route 180 in New Mexico|US&nbsp;180]]. The highway continues past [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] and [[White's City, New Mexico|White's City]] into the city of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]. In Carlsbad, [[U.S. Route 285|US&nbsp;285]] joins US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;180 for approximately {{convert|2.2|mi|km}}, then heads east to [[Hobbs, New Mexico|Hobbs]]. US&nbsp;62 comes within {{convert|12|mi|km}} of the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant|WIPP Plant]] while also coming across several State Highway termini: [[New Mexico State Road 360]] (NM&nbsp;360), [[New Mexico State Road 176|NM&nbsp;176]], [[New Mexico State Road 243|NM&nbsp;243]], [[New Mexico State Road 529|NM&nbsp;529]], [[New Mexico State Road 483|NM&nbsp;483]], [[New Mexico State Road 360|NM&nbsp;360]], and [[New Mexico State Road 8|NM&nbsp;8]] along the {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch. US&nbsp;62 comes into Hobbs along Marland Boulevard. After coming close to [[Hobbs High School]]'s Watson Stadium, US&nbsp;62 leaves Hobbs going east to the Texas–New Mexico state line.

===Texas Panhandle===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Texas}}
After re-entering Texas, US&nbsp;62 continues east through Seminole where US&nbsp;180 heads east towards [[Lamesa, Texas|Lamesa]] and US&nbsp;62 turns north northeast along a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 385|US&nbsp;385]] through [[Seagraves, Texas|Seagraves]] and [[Brownfield, Texas|Brownfield]]. In Brownfield, US&nbsp;62 picks up [[U.S. Route 82|US&nbsp;82]]/[[U.S. Route 380|US&nbsp;380]] from [[Plains, Texas|Plains]] for a four-way concurrency for about two blocks, where US&nbsp;380 heads east toward [[Tahoka, Texas|Tahoka]]. US&nbsp;385 drops off approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later to head northwest toward [[Levelland, Texas|Levelland]]. US&nbsp;82 continues as a concurrency with US&nbsp;62 into [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. US&nbsp;62 splits from US&nbsp;82 and joins with [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway&nbsp;114]] (SH&nbsp;114) for approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} along the [[Campus of Texas Tech University|campus]] of [[Texas Tech University]]'s southern border. On the east side of Lubbock, US&nbsp;82 joins back into US&nbsp;62/SH&nbsp;114 and then continues east passes through [[Lorenzo, Texas|Lorenzo]], then leaves off the concurrency and forms a spur around [[Ralls, Texas|Ralls]], locally known as the \"US&nbsp;62 Loop\". The route then turns north to form a concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 207|SH&nbsp;207]] up to [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]], where [[U.S. Route 70|US&nbsp;70]] joins in for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east and then SH&nbsp;207 turns north of the east side of Floydada. US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;70 then east through [[Matador, Texas|Matador]] to [[Paducah, Texas|Paducah]], and north again dropping off US&nbsp;70 and gaining [[U.S. Route 83|US&nbsp;83]] through [[Childress, Texas|Childress]] to a point {{convert|17|mi|km}} to the north of Childress where it turns east alone, before crossing the Texas–Oklahoma border {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} west of [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]].

===Oklahoma===
{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in Oklahoma}}
US&nbsp;62 runs east from the Texas border across Southwest [[Oklahoma]] through [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]], [[Gould, Oklahoma|Gould]] and [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]] and then continues east bypassing the communities of [[Headrick, Oklahoma|Headrick]], [[Snyder, Oklahoma|Snyder]], [[Indiahoma, Oklahoma|Indiahoma]] and [[Cache, Oklahoma|Cache]] into [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]. On the north side of Lawton, US&nbsp;62 joins [[I-44]] as a concurrent route for {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill Military Reservation]] and then splits on its own at Exit 46 near Medicine Park to continue north through [[Apache, Oklahoma|Apache]] then north and east toward [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]]. From Anadarko, US&nbsp;62 runs east through [[Verden, Oklahoma|Verden]] to [[Chickasha, Oklahoma|Chickasha]] and northeast through [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]] before returning to a concurrent route with I-44 into [[Oklahoma City]] and then with [[Interstate 240 (Oklahoma)|I-240]] and [[I-35]] through much of the city before leaving I-35 at Northeast 23rd Street (exit 130) {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} east of the Oklahoma State Capitol. It leaves Oklahoma City at 23rd street and heads east through [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]], [[Spencer, Oklahoma|Spencer]], [[Nicoma Park, Oklahoma|Nicoma Park]], [[Choctaw, Oklahoma|Choctaw]], [[Harrah, Oklahoma|Harrah]], [[Meeker, Oklahoma|Meeker]] and [[Boley, Oklahoma|Boley]] to [[Okemah, Oklahoma|Okemah]]. At Okemah, US&nbsp;62 overlaps [[I-40]] for {{convert|18|mi|km}} to [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]]. US&nbsp;62 then leaves I-40 to continue north to [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]] and east to [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], and heads northeast through [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma|Fort Gibson]] and [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] and into Arkansas.

In addition to sections of I-44, I-240, I-35 and I-40, US&nbsp;62 also runs concurrent with other US&nbsp;highways over its miles across Oklahoma including US&nbsp;281 from Lawton to Anadarko and US&nbsp;277 from Lawton north about 11 miles (both including the {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} I-44 concurrency north of Lawton), US&nbsp;81 in the Chickasha city limits, a second US&nbsp;277 concurrency from Chickasha to Newcastle, US&nbsp;75 from Henryetta to Okmulgee, US&nbsp;64 from an intersection near Taft to Muskogee and US&nbsp;69 in the Muskogee city limits. US&nbsp;62 business routes are designated through the cities of Snyder and Muskogee.

===Arkansas===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Arkansas}}
[[File:US&nbsp;62 near Busch, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] west of [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]].]]
In the state of [[Arkansas]], US&nbsp;62 runs {{convert|329.9|mi|km}} from the [[Oklahoma]] border near [[Summers, Arkansas|Summers]] east to the [[Missouri]] border in [[St. Francis, Arkansas|St. Francis]], serving the northern portion of the state. The route passes through several cities and towns, including [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], [[Prairie Grove, Arkansas |Prairie Grove]], [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]], [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]], [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]], [[Pocahontas, Arkansas|Pocahontas]], and [[Piggott, Arkansas|Piggott]]. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrent with several highways in Arkansas including [[Interstate 49|I-49]] and [[U.S. Route 71|US&nbsp;71]] between Fayetteville and Bentonville, [[U.S. Route 412|US&nbsp;412]] through much of the state, [[U.S. Route 65|US&nbsp;65]] in the Harrison area, and with [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]] and [[U.S. Route 67|US&nbsp;67]] (Future [[Interstate 57|I-57]]) in northeast Arkansas.

===Missouri===
US&nbsp;62 enters Missouri from Arkansas at Whitaker Place, and proceeds more or less easterly across the Missouri Bootheel via [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] to [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]].  Between Malden and New Madrid, US&nbsp;62 was designated as '''Route&nbsp;82''' in 1922. The part west of Malden was unnumbered until it became US&nbsp;62.  At New Madrid US&nbsp;62 begins a concurrency with US&nbsp;61.  The combined US&nbsp;61/62 goes north as far as [[Sikeston, Missouri|Sikeston]], where US&nbsp;62 resumes its easterly direction.  From Sikeston US&nbsp;62 runs east to [[Charleston, Missouri|Charleston]], where it is concurrent with Business I-57 for a short distance.  After crossing I-57, US&nbsp;62 becomes concurrent with US&nbsp;60, this concurrency continues until US&nbsp;60/62 leave Missouri by way of the [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|Mississippi River bridge]] into Cairo Ill.

===Illinois===
{{main|U.S. Route 60 in Illinois}}
US 62 overlaps [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]] for its entire length, {{convert|0.92|mi|km|2}}, in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"ittc\">{{cite web |author= Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url= http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title= T2 GIS Data |publisher= [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] |access-date= June 2, 2006}}</ref> It crosses Illinois at its very southern tip between the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers at [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]. US&nbsp;62 enters Illinois from Missouri by means of [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|a bridge over the Mississippi River]], turning east at [[U.S. Route 51|US&nbsp;51]] with US&nbsp;51 joining the concurrency. The three routes immediately cross into Kentucky by means of [[Cairo Ohio River Bridge|crossing the Ohio River]].

===Kentucky===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Kentucky}}
US&nbsp;62 runs right through the tourist section of Western [[Kentucky]]; between the cities of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] and [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]], it passes [[Kentucky Lake]] and [[Lake Barkley]], two large manmade lakes. From there US&nbsp;62 heads east through the cities of [[Princeton, Kentucky|Princeton]], [[Central City, Kentucky|Central City]], [[Beaver Dam, Kentucky|Beaver Dam]], [[Leitchfield, Kentucky|Leitchfield]], [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Lawrenceburg, Kentucky|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Midway, Kentucky|Midway]]. For much of this portion, US&nbsp;62 is paralleled by portions of the Kentucky Parkway System, including the [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] ([[Interstate 69 in Kentucky|I-69]]) and the [[Bluegrass Parkway]], which have taken most long-distance and freight traffic off the old US&nbsp;62 route. After passing through [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] and [[Cynthiana, Kentucky|Cynthiana]] it leaves Kentucky in [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] over the [[Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge]].

US&nbsp;62 is the only US Highway to cross the Ohio River twice.<ref group=lower-alpha>I-275 around Cincinnati is the only other numbered highway to do so.)</ref> It crosses the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, connecting the far western region of Kentucky with the southern tip of Illinois. Its other crossing over the Ohio River connects the northeastern Kentucky city of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] and the southwestern Ohio village of [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]].

===Ohio===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Ohio}}
[[File:OhioByway.JPG|upright|thumb|A US&nbsp;62 marker in [[Killbuck, Ohio]], in [[Amish]] Country, also marked as an [[Ohio Scenic Byways|Ohio Byway]] ]]
US&nbsp;62 enters [[Ohio]] from [[Kentucky]], crossing the [[Ohio River]] at [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]]. After the river crossing, the highway follows [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] until [[Ripley, Ohio|Ripley]] and US&nbsp;68 until just east of [[Georgetown, Ohio|Georgetown]]. From there, US&nbsp;62 enters the towns of [[Russellville, Ohio|Russellville]], [[Hillsboro, Ohio|Hillsboro]], and [[Washington Court House, Ohio|Washington Court House]]. In Washington Court House, US&nbsp;62 meets up with [[Ohio State Route 3|State Route&nbsp;3]] (SR&nbsp;3) and continues all the way into [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], passing through the towns of [[Mount Sterling, Ohio|Mount Sterling]], [[Orient, Ohio|Orient]], [[Harrisburg, Ohio|Harrisburg]], and [[Grove City, Ohio|Grove City]]. After heading toward downtown Columbus, US&nbsp;62 diverts from SR&nbsp;3 onto [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] (Broad Street) for a few blocks to Nelson Road. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrently with [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|I-670]] near [[Port Columbus International Airport]] until the eastern side of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|I-270]] where US&nbsp;62 heads toward [[Gahanna, Ohio|Gahanna]], [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], [[Johnstown, Ohio|Johnstown]], [[Utica, Ohio|Utica]], [[Millersburg, Ohio|Millersburg]], and [[Navarre, Ohio|Navarre]]. About {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} north of Navarre, US&nbsp;62 joins up with [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] into [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], where US&nbsp;62 heads north along [[Interstate 77|I-77]]. The highway passes [[West Lawn Cemetery]] and the [[McKinley National Memorial|President William McKinley memorial and tomb]] in Canton. At exit&nbsp;107B on I-77, US&nbsp;62 heads northeast to [[Alliance, Ohio|Alliance]], and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]. It leaves Ohio near [[Hubbard, Ohio|Hubbard]] and enters [[Pennsylvania]] near the interchange for [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|I-80]].

===Pennsylvania===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Pennsylvania}}
US&nbsp;62 enters [[Pennsylvania]] from Ohio in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]]. Also, at the Ohio–Pennsylvania state line, signage for US&nbsp;62 changes from an east–west to north–south. US&nbsp;62 also runs north-northeast from the Ohio border towards New York.<ref name=mapguy>{{cite web |author=Mapguy |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |title=End of U.S. Highway 62 |url=http://www.usends.com/60-69/062/062.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202030315/http://usends.com/60-69/062/062.html |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}{{self-published source|date=December 2014}}</ref> US&nbsp;62 passes through [[Mercer, Pennsylvania|Mercer]] and runs across country to [[Franklin, Pennsylvania|Franklin]]. At this point US&nbsp;62 enters the [[Allegheny River]] valley and follows this river for {{convert|45|mi|km}}. US&nbsp;62 crosses the river at [[Oil City, Pennsylvania|Oil City]], at [[Tionesta, Pennsylvania|Tionesta]], and twice again in the [[Warren, Pennsylvania|Warren]] area, once near Buckaloons Recreational Area in the [[Allegheny Islands Wilderness]] region, where it is concurrent with [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]] for a short distance.

===New York===
{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in New York}}
[[File:US 62 south in Niagara Falls.JPG|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in Niagara Falls, just after the terminus at NY&nbsp;104]]
While most of the route is an east–west route, US&nbsp;62 takes a north–south directionality in Pennsylvania and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is signed north–south in northern Pennsylvania and New York.

US&nbsp;62 enters New York State from Pennsylvania in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], south of [[Frewsburg, New York|Frewsburg]], past which it intersects with [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]] (Southern Tier Expressway). Following a northeasterly course, US&nbsp;62 enters [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]], crosses [[Cattaraugus Creek]] to enter [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and passes through the village of [[Gowanda, New York|Gowanda]], taking a more northerly direction. At the village of [[Hamburg (village), New York|Hamburg]], US&nbsp;62 turns northeast, passing Buffalo Raceway and the [[Erie County Fair]], [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90|I-90]]), continues northward through [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] as South Park Avenue and passes through [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] as South Park Avenue and Bailey Avenue. The Bailey Avenue section from [[New York State Route 5]] (NY&nbsp;5) at the Buffalo city line to [[New York State Route 324|NY 324]] is maintained by Erie County as County Road 152.

US&nbsp;62 briefly overlaps NY&nbsp;324 (Sheridan Drive) in the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], and turns northward as Niagara Falls Boulevard, intersects [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]], then exits [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and enters [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], as US&nbsp;62 crosses the [[Erie Canal]] / [[Tonawanda Creek]] and travels into the town of [[Wheatfield, New York|Wheatfield]]. The highway intersects [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]] and turns to the northwest intersecting [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] and [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]]. On the east side of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] the route diverges into US&nbsp;62 and its parallel route, [[U.S. Route 62 Business (Niagara Falls, New York)|Business US&nbsp;62]], (formerly NY&nbsp;62A). Within the city of Niagara Falls, US&nbsp;62 runs \"backwards\", bearing west for several miles as Ferry Avenue southbound (eastbound) and Walnut Avenue northbound (westbound) and terminates on Main Street, while is still signed north–south. The northern (eastern) terminus for both US&nbsp;62 and Business US&nbsp;62 is at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] (Main Street), less than {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} from the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] and U.S. Customs. The Rainbow Bridge then crosses the [[Niagara River]] into Canada, offering side-views of the famous [[Niagara Falls]].

<ref>http://www.nysenate.gov/news/new-national-veterans-highway</ref> In 2009, Legislation was proposed in the NY State Legislature for a bill (S.6277-A/A.9939-A) designating all of US Route 62 in New York State as the \"National Veterans Highway\".  The measure was sponsored by then Senator William Stachowski, and Assemblyperson Francine Delmonte as proposed by the Sons of the American Legion Post 880 as a way to salute and commemorate the service and sacrifice of all veterans of the US.  The Bill was signed into law by Governor David Paterson on July 30, 2010.  The designation runs from the Pennsylvania State Line south of Frewsburg, NY to a northern terminus near the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, NY.  Designations have also been successful in Illinois and Kentucky to this point.

==Future==
In Ohio, there are plans to reroute US&nbsp;62 onto a divided highway from Alliance to [[Salem, Ohio|Salem]], part of a larger relocation of both US&nbsp;62 and [[Ohio State Route 14|SR&nbsp;14]], then from downtown Youngstown to I-80 as part of the \"Hubbard Arterial\".<ref>[http://www.eastgatecog.org/reg-trac.asp Eastgate Regional Council of Governments: T.R.A.C.

===West Texas===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Texas}}
US&nbsp;62 has two separate segments in [[Texas]], separated by a portion in [[New Mexico]] with the first section in Texas from its terminus in El Paso to the state line in the [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park|Guadalupe Mountains]]. Through El Paso, US&nbsp;62 begins at the [[Paso del Norte International Bridge|Santa Fe Street Bridge]], and follows Santa Fe Street, then Paisano Drive. At the Paisano Drive underpass for [[Interstate 10|I-10]] (I-10 exit 23B), US&nbsp;62 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 180|US&nbsp;180]], while US&nbsp;180 ends its concurrency with I-10. The route then follows Montana Avenue, continuing the concurrency with US&nbsp;180 until [[Seminole, Texas|Seminole]]. Before exiting Texas, the route passes through the Salt Flats of Texas, the southern base of [[Guadalupe Peak]], the highest point in Texas, and [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park]].

===New Mexico===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in New Mexico}}
Through New Mexico, US&nbsp;62 is entirely concurrent with [[U.S. Route 180 in New Mexico|US&nbsp;180]]. The highway continues past [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] and [[White's City, New Mexico|White's City]] into the city of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]. In Carlsbad, [[U.S. Route 285|US&nbsp;285]] joins US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;180 for approximately {{convert|2.2|mi|km}}, then heads east to [[Hobbs, New Mexico|Hobbs]]. US&nbsp;62 comes within {{convert|12|mi|km}} of the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant|WIPP Plant]] while also coming across several State Highway termini: [[New Mexico State Road 360]] (NM&nbsp;360), [[New Mexico State Road 176|NM&nbsp;176]], [[New Mexico State Road 243|NM&nbsp;243]], [[New Mexico State Road 529|NM&nbsp;529]], [[New Mexico State Road 483|NM&nbsp;483]], [[New Mexico State Road 360|NM&nbsp;360]], and [[New Mexico State Road 8|NM&nbsp;8]] along the {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch. US&nbsp;62 comes into Hobbs along Marland Boulevard. After coming close to [[Hobbs High School]]'s Watson Stadium, US&nbsp;62 leaves Hobbs going east to the Texas–New Mexico state line.

===Texas Panhandle===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Texas}}
After re-entering Texas, US&nbsp;62 continues east through Seminole where US&nbsp;180 heads east towards [[Lamesa, Texas|Lamesa]] and US&nbsp;62 turns north northeast along a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 385|US&nbsp;385]] through [[Seagraves, Texas|Seagraves]] and [[Brownfield, Texas|Brownfield]]. In Brownfield, US&nbsp;62 picks up [[U.S. Route 82|US&nbsp;82]]/[[U.S. Route 380|US&nbsp;380]] from [[Plains, Texas|Plains]] for a four-way concurrency for about two blocks, where US&nbsp;380 heads east toward [[Tahoka, Texas|Tahoka]]. US&nbsp;385 drops off approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later to head northwest toward [[Levelland, Texas|Levelland]]. US&nbsp;82 continues as a concurrency with US&nbsp;62 into [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. US&nbsp;62 splits from US&nbsp;82 and joins with [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway&nbsp;114]] (SH&nbsp;114) for approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} along the [[Campus of Texas Tech University|campus]] of [[Texas Tech University]]'s southern border. On the east side of Lubbock, US&nbsp;82 joins back into US&nbsp;62/SH&nbsp;114 and then continues east passes through [[Lorenzo, Texas|Lorenzo]], then leaves off the concurrency and forms a spur around [[Ralls, Texas|Ralls]], locally known as the \"US&nbsp;62 Loop\". The route then turns north to form a concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 207|SH&nbsp;207]] up to [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]], where [[U.S. Route 70|US&nbsp;70]] joins in for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east and then SH&nbsp;207 turns north of the east side of Floydada. US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;70 then east through [[Matador, Texas|Matador]] to [[Paducah, Texas|Paducah]], and north again dropping off US&nbsp;70 and gaining [[U.S. Route 83|US&nbsp;83]] through [[Childress, Texas|Childress]] to a point {{convert|17|mi|km}} to the north of Childress where it turns east alone, before crossing the Texas–Oklahoma border {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} west of [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]].

===Oklahoma===
{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in Oklahoma}}
US&nbsp;62 runs east from the Texas border across Southwest [[Oklahoma]] through [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]], [[Gould, Oklahoma|Gould]] and [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]] and then continues east bypassing the communities of [[Headrick, Oklahoma|Headrick]], [[Snyder, Oklahoma|Snyder]], [[Indiahoma, Oklahoma|Indiahoma]] and [[Cache, Oklahoma|Cache]] into [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]. On the north side of Lawton, US&nbsp;62 joins [[I-44]] as a concurrent route for {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill Military Reservation]] and then splits on its own at Exit 46 near Medicine Park to continue north through [[Apache, Oklahoma|Apache]] then north and east toward [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]]. From Anadarko, US&nbsp;62 runs east through [[Verden, Oklahoma|Verden]] to [[Chickasha, Oklahoma|Chickasha]] and northeast through [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]] before returning to a concurrent route with I-44 into [[Oklahoma City]] and then with [[Interstate 240 (Oklahoma)|I-240]] and [[I-35]] through much of the city before leaving I-35 at Northeast 23rd Street (exit 130) {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} east of the Oklahoma State Capitol. It leaves Oklahoma City at 23rd street and heads east through [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]], [[Spencer, Oklahoma|Spencer]], [[Nicoma Park, Oklahoma|Nicoma Park]], [[Choctaw, Oklahoma|Choctaw]], [[Harrah, Oklahoma|Harrah]], [[Meeker, Oklahoma|Meeker]] and [[Boley, Oklahoma|Boley]] to [[Okemah, Oklahoma|Okemah]]. At Okemah, US&nbsp;62 overlaps [[I-40]] for {{convert|18|mi|km}} to [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]]. US&nbsp;62 then leaves I-40 to continue north to [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]] and east to [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], and heads northeast through [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma|Fort Gibson]] and [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] and into Arkansas.

In addition to sections of I-44, I-240, I-35 and I-40, US&nbsp;62 also runs concurrent with other US&nbsp;highways over its miles across Oklahoma including US&nbsp;281 from Lawton to Anadarko and US&nbsp;277 from Lawton north about 11 miles (both including the {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} I-44 concurrency north of Lawton), US&nbsp;81 in the Chickasha city limits, a second US&nbsp;277 concurrency from Chickasha to Newcastle, US&nbsp;75 from Henryetta to Okmulgee, US&nbsp;64 from an intersection near Taft to Muskogee and US&nbsp;69 in the Muskogee city limits. US&nbsp;62 business routes are designated through the cities of Snyder and Muskogee.

===Arkansas===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Arkansas}}
[[File:US&nbsp;62 near Busch, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] west of [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]].]]
In the state of [[Arkansas]], US&nbsp;62 runs {{convert|329.9|mi|km}} from the [[Oklahoma]] border near [[Summers, Arkansas|Summers]] east to the [[Missouri]] border in [[St. Francis, Arkansas|St. Francis]], serving the northern portion of the state. The route passes through several cities and towns, including [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], [[Prairie Grove, Arkansas |Prairie Grove]], [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]], [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]], [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]], [[Pocahontas, Arkansas|Pocahontas]], and [[Piggott, Arkansas|Piggott]]. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrent with several highways in Arkansas including [[Interstate 49|I-49]] and [[U.S. Route 71|US&nbsp;71]] between Fayetteville and Bentonville, [[U.S. Route 412|US&nbsp;412]] through much of the state, [[U.S. Route 65|US&nbsp;65]] in the Harrison area, and with [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]] and [[U.S. Route 67|US&nbsp;67]] (Future [[Interstate 57|I-57]]) in northeast Arkansas.

===Missouri===
US&nbsp;62 enters Missouri from Arkansas at Whitaker Place, and proceeds more or less easterly across the Missouri Bootheel via [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] to [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]].  Between Malden and New Madrid, US&nbsp;62 was designated as '''Route&nbsp;82''' in 1922. The part west of Malden was unnumbered until it became US&nbsp;62.  At New Madrid US&nbsp;62 begins a concurrency with US&nbsp;61.  The combined US&nbsp;61/62 goes north as far as [[Sikeston, Missouri|Sikeston]], where US&nbsp;62 resumes its easterly direction.  From Sikeston US&nbsp;62 runs east to [[Charleston, Missouri|Charleston]], where it is concurrent with Business I-57 for a short distance.  After crossing I-57, US&nbsp;62 becomes concurrent with US&nbsp;60, this concurrency continues until US&nbsp;60/62 leave Missouri by way of the [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|Mississippi River bridge]] into Cairo Ill.

===Illinois===
{{main|U.S. Route 60 in Illinois}}
US 62 overlaps [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]] for its entire length, {{convert|0.92|mi|km|2}}, in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"ittc\">{{cite web |author= Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url= http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title= T2 GIS Data |publisher= [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] |access-date= June 2, 2006}}</ref> It crosses Illinois at its very southern tip between the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers at [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]. US&nbsp;62 enters Illinois from Missouri by means of [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|a bridge over the Mississippi River]], turning east at [[U.S. Route 51|US&nbsp;51]] with US&nbsp;51 joining the concurrency. The three routes immediately cross into Kentucky by means of [[Cairo Ohio River Bridge|crossing the Ohio River]].

===Kentucky===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Kentucky}}
US&nbsp;62 runs right through the tourist section of Western [[Kentucky]]; between the cities of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] and [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]], it passes [[Kentucky Lake]] and [[Lake Barkley]], two large manmade lakes. From there US&nbsp;62 heads east through the cities of [[Princeton, Kentucky|Princeton]], [[Central City, Kentucky|Central City]], [[Beaver Dam, Kentucky|Beaver Dam]], [[Leitchfield, Kentucky|Leitchfield]], [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Lawrenceburg, Kentucky|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Midway, Kentucky|Midway]]. For much of this portion, US&nbsp;62 is paralleled by portions of the Kentucky Parkway System, including the [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] ([[Interstate 69 in Kentucky|I-69]]) and the [[Bluegrass Parkway]], which have taken most long-distance and freight traffic off the old US&nbsp;62 route. After passing through [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] and [[Cynthiana, Kentucky|Cynthiana]] it leaves Kentucky in [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] over the [[Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge]].

US&nbsp;62 is the only US Highway to cross the Ohio River twice.<ref group=lower-alpha>I-275 around Cincinnati is the only other numbered highway to do so.)</ref> It crosses the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, connecting the far western region of Kentucky with the southern tip of Illinois. Its other crossing over the Ohio River connects the northeastern Kentucky city of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] and the southwestern Ohio village of [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]].

===Ohio===

[[File:OhioByway.JPG|upright|thumb|A US&nbsp;62 marker in [[Killbuck, Ohio]], in [[Amish]] Country, also marked as an [[Ohio Scenic Byways|Ohio Byway]] ]]
US&nbsp;62 enters [[Ohio]] from [[Kentucky]], crossing the [[Ohio River]] at [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]]. After the river crossing, the highway follows [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] until [[Ripley, Ohio|Ripley]] and US&nbsp;68 until just east of [[Georgetown, Ohio|Georgetown]]. From there, US&nbsp;62 enters the towns of [[Russellville, Ohio|Russellville]], [[Hillsboro, Ohio|Hillsboro]], and [[Washington Court House, Ohio|Washington Court House]]. In Washington Court House, US&nbsp;62 meets up with [[Ohio State Route 3|State Route&nbsp;3]] (SR&nbsp;3) and continues all the way into [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], passing through the towns of [[Mount Sterling, Ohio|Mount Sterling]], [[Orient, Ohio|Orient]], [[Harrisburg, Ohio|Harrisburg]], and [[Grove City, Ohio|Grove City]]. After heading toward downtown Columbus, US&nbsp;62 diverts from SR&nbsp;3 onto [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] (Broad Street) for a few blocks to Nelson Road. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrently with [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|I-670]] near [[Port Columbus International Airport]] until the eastern side of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|I-270]] where US&nbsp;62 heads toward [[Gahanna, Ohio|Gahanna]], [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], [[Johnstown, Ohio|Johnstown]], [[Utica, Ohio|Utica]], [[Millersburg, Ohio|Millersburg]], and [[Navarre, Ohio|Navarre]]. About {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} north of Navarre, US&nbsp;62 joins up with [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] into [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], where US&nbsp;62 heads north along [[Interstate 77|I-77]]. The highway passes [[West Lawn Cemetery]] and the [[McKinley National Memorial|President William McKinley memorial and tomb]] in Canton. At exit&nbsp;107B on I-77, US&nbsp;62 heads northeast to [[Alliance, Ohio|Alliance]], and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]. It leaves Ohio near [[Hubbard, Ohio|Hubbard]] and enters [[Pennsylvania]] near the interchange for [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|I-80]].

===Pennsylvania===
{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Pennsylvania}}
US&nbsp;62 enters [[Pennsylvania]] from Ohio in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]]. Also, at the Ohio–Pennsylvania state line, signage for US&nbsp;62 changes from an east–west to north–south. US&nbsp;62 also runs north-northeast from the Ohio border towards New York.<ref name=mapguy>{{cite web |author=Mapguy |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |title=End of U.S. Highway 62 |url=http://www.usends.com/60-69/062/062.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202030315/http://usends.com/60-69/062/062.html |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}{{self-published source|date=December 2014}}</ref> US&nbsp;62 passes through [[Mercer, Pennsylvania|Mercer]] and runs across country to [[Franklin, Pennsylvania|Franklin]]. At this point US&nbsp;62 enters the [[Allegheny River]] valley and follows this river for {{convert|45|mi|km}}. US&nbsp;62 crosses the river at [[Oil City, Pennsylvania|Oil City]], at [[Tionesta, Pennsylvania|Tionesta]], and twice again in the [[Warren, Pennsylvania|Warren]] area, once near Buckaloons Recreational Area in the [[Allegheny Islands Wilderness]] region, where it is concurrent with [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]] for a short distance.

===New York===
{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in New York}}
[[File:US 62 south in Niagara Falls.JPG|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in Niagara Falls, just after the terminus at NY&nbsp;104]]
While most of the route is an east–west route, US&nbsp;62 takes a north–south directionality in Pennsylvania and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is signed north–south in northern Pennsylvania and New York.

US&nbsp;62 enters New York State from Pennsylvania in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], south of [[Frewsburg, New York|Frewsburg]], past which it intersects with [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]] (Southern Tier Expressway). Following a northeasterly course, US&nbsp;62 enters [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]], crosses [[Cattaraugus Creek]] to enter [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and passes through the village of [[Gowanda, New York|Gowanda]], taking a more northerly direction. At the village of [[Hamburg (village), New York|Hamburg]], US&nbsp;62 turns northeast, passing Buffalo Raceway and the [[Erie County Fair]], [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90|I-90]]), continues northward through [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] as South Park Avenue and passes through [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] as South Park Avenue and Bailey Avenue. The Bailey Avenue section from [[New York State Route 5]] (NY&nbsp;5) at the Buffalo city line to [[New York State Route 324|NY 324]] is maintained by Erie County as County Road 152.

US&nbsp;62 briefly overlaps NY&nbsp;324 (Sheridan Drive) in the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], and turns northward as Niagara Falls Boulevard, intersects [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]], then exits [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and enters [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], as US&nbsp;62 crosses the [[Erie Canal]] / [[Tonawanda Creek]] and travels into the town of [[Wheatfield, New York|Wheatfield]]. The highway intersects [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]] and turns to the northwest intersecting [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] and [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]]. On the east side of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] the route diverges into US&nbsp;62 and its parallel route, [[U.S. Route 62 Business (Niagara Falls, New York)|Business US&nbsp;62]], (formerly NY&nbsp;62A). Within the city of Niagara Falls, US&nbsp;62 runs \"backwards\", bearing west for several miles as Ferry Avenue southbound (eastbound) and Walnut Avenue northbound (westbound) and terminates on Main Street, while is still signed north–south. The northern (eastern) terminus for both US&nbsp;62 and Business US&nbsp;62 is at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] (Main Street), less than {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} from the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] and U.S. Customs. The Rainbow Bridge then crosses the [[Niagara River]] into Canada, offering side-views of the famous [[Niagara Falls]].

<ref>http://www.nysenate.gov/news/new-national-veterans-highway</ref> In 2009, Legislation was proposed in the NY State Legislature for a bill (S.6277-A/A.9939-A) designating all of US Route 62 in New York State as the \"National Veterans Highway\".  The measure was sponsored by then Senator William Stachowski, and Assemblyperson Francine Delmonte as proposed by the Sons of the American Legion Post 880 as a way to salute and commemorate the service and sacrifice of all veterans of the US.  The Bill was signed into law by Governor David Paterson on July 30, 2010.  The designation runs from the Pennsylvania State Line south of Frewsburg, NY to a northern terminus near the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, NY.  Designations have also been successful in Illinois and Kentucky to this point.

==Future==
In Ohio, there are plans to reroute US&nbsp;62 onto a divided highway from Alliance to [[Salem, Ohio|Salem]], part of a larger relocation of both US&nbsp;62 and [[Ohio State Route 14|SR&nbsp;14]], then from downtown Youngstown to I-80 as part of the \"Hubbard Arterial\".<ref>[http://www.eastgatecog.org/reg-trac.asp Eastgate Regional Council of Governments: T.R.A.C.

"Deleted a duplicate \"the\".",safe,Ira Leviton,"[[Image:Swinside (p4160146).jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Swinside]] stone circle, in the [[Lake District]], England, which megalithic specialist [[Aubrey Burl]] called \"the loveliest of all the circles\" in north-western Europe.{{sfn|Burl|1979|p=235}}]]
The '''stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany''' are a [[megalith]]ic tradition of monuments consisting of standing stones arranged in rings. These were constructed from 3300 to 900 BCE in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} It has been estimated that around 4,000 of these monuments were originally constructed in this part of north-western Europe during this period.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Around 1,300 of them are recorded, the others having been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}

Although [[stone circles]] have been erected throughout history by a variety of societies and for a variety of reasons, in the [[Late Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain|Early Bronze Ages]], this particular tradition was limited to Britain, Ireland and the neighbouring area of continental Europe now known as [[Brittany]]. The rings were not distributed equally across this area, but were concentrated in several highland regions: north-eastern and central Scotland, the [[Lake District]], the south-west peninsula of England, and the north and south-west of Ireland. Sparser groupings can also be found in [[Caithness]], the [[Outer Hebrides]], the [[Peak District]], the [[Wicklow Mountains]], [[Wales]] and [[Wessex]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}

Their original purpose is not fully known, but archaeological investigation has shed some light on it. It is widely thought that they served a ritual or ceremonial purpose, particularly in relation to solar and/or lunar alignments. In a minority of cases, some were also used as cemeteries, with burials being made in and around the circle.

Antiquarian investigation into the circles began in the Early Modern period, intensifying after the publications of notable English antiquarian [[William Stukeley]] in the 18th century. At the time, scholars understood little of prehistoric Britain, with the megalithic circles typically being ascribed either to the [[druid]]s of the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] or to the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish settlers]] of [[Early Medieval]] times.

In the 20th century, with the development of [[archaeology]], archaeologists could investigate the circles in more detail. They dated them to the Late Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Since the late 20th century, many of these monuments were adopted as \"sacred sites\" by adherents of [[Paganism (contemporary religious movements)|contemporary pagan]] religions such as [[Neo-Druidism]], [[Wicca]] and the [[Goddess movement]], and they had used the sites as places to conduct their magico-religious rites.

==Background==

===Early Neolithic===
[[File:WKLB Mittelgang DB.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of [[West Kennet Long Barrow]]. Long barrows such as this one were the dominant form of megalithic architecture before the development of the stone circle tradition.]]

During the Neolithic, or 'New Stone Age', there were extensive cultural changes across north-western Europe. The introduction of [[agriculture]] ended the [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle which had dominated in the preceding Palaeolithic ('Old Stone Age') and Mesolithic ('Middle Stone Age') periods.

During the Early Neolithic in Brittany and the British Isles, the megalithic tradition of building [[chambered tomb]]s for the dead had waxed and waned. The chambered tomb tradition lasted between about 4000 and 3500 BCE, although an earlier example, at [[Carrowmore]] in County Sligo, has been disputably dated to 5000 BCE.<ref name=\"Pearson 2005. p. 34\">[[#Par05|Parker Pearson 2005]]. p. 34.</ref><ref name=\"Burl 2000 24\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 24.</ref> The length of this tradition led prehistorian [[Mike Parker Pearson]] to note that it was \"a relatively short-lived fashion in archaeological terms.\"<ref name=\"Pearson 2005. p. 34\"/> In southern England, 84% of chambered tombs were built in a north-east to south-east orientation, which probably had some special significance for their builders.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=23}}

In some parts of the British Isles, architectural changes were made to the style of chambered tomb, which may have been a forerunner of the later circular design of the stone rings.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 26-27\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. pp. 26-27.</ref> In the later Clyde tombs of south-western Scotland and the court-cairns of northern Ireland, crescent-shaped forecourts were constructed inside the tombs. This would have enabled more people to enter the tomb and take part in any rites there in sunlight.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 26-27\"/>

During the Early Neolithic another form of monument was also constructed in the British Isles, now known by archaeologists as [[causewayed enclosure]]s.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 25.</ref> These  consisted of massive circular ditch-and-bank earthworks. Construction of causewayed enclosures in the lowland regions of Southern England flourished around 3800 BCE, but by 3200 BCE almost all of them had been abandoned by their users.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/> No equivalents have been found in the highland areas of northern Britain.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/> Despite having excavated a number of these sites across southern Britain, archaeologists do not know their exact purpose. It has been suggested that they were camps, markets, cattle kraals or occasional settlements, or perhaps ritual centres for the celebration of seasonal festivals or cemeteries.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/>

===Late Neolithic===

As the transition from the [[Neolithic|Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic]] took place in around 3000 BCE, there was much economic and technological continuity. But there was considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} By that date, the [[long barrow]]s, [[causewayed enclosure]]s, and [[cursus]]es which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased to be built. They were replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} These include not only stone circles, but also earthen [[henge]]s and [[timber circles]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=91–94}} This transition toward circular monuments had symbolic associations. As the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]] stated, \"There was a change from the cramped, gloomy chamber of a tomb to the unroofed, wide ring, a change from darkness to light, from the dead to the living, from the grave to the sky.\"{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=38}} Similar observations were made by the historian Ronald Hutton, who commented that the circular shape of the rings \"mirrors the sun, the full moon and the bounds of the horizon\" and that such a shape can also be \"profoundly egalitarian\".{{sfn|Hutton|1991|p=52}}

[[File:Maumbury Rings center.jpg|thumb|left|Alongside the stone circles, earthen henges (such as [[Maumbury Rings]] in Dorset) were erected in Late Neolithic Britain]]

This transition was, according to historian [[Ronald Hutton]], \"as fundamental as that from the Mesolithic had been.\"<ref name=\"Hutton 1991 52\">[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 52.</ref> Archaeological pollen analysis has shown that it was a period when scrub and weeds were spreading over what had formerly been cultivated fields, and forests that had previously been cleared began to grow back.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 29.</ref> Chambered tombs were blocked up and abandoned, implying that people were ceasing to use them as cultic sites.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/> Several former causewayed enclosures were converted into defensive structures with gateways and walls, and in some cases they were attacked. Evidence for conflict has been found at [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] in Cornwall, [[Hambledon Hill]] in Dorset, and Crickley Hill in Gloucestershire.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/> Various archaeologists have suggested that this was a period of particular turmoil within the British Isles, perhaps caused by an overuse of land, the failure of crops, famine, plague, climatic change, or an increase in population that was not supported by the food supply.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/>

===Early Bronze Age===
The start of the Bronze Age in Britain was signalled by the introduction of [[bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and usually [[tin]]. Ideologically, there is no evidence for a change in Brittany and the British Isles at this time, with communities continuing to construct megalithic stone circles. The archaeologists J.M. Coles and A.F. Harding noted that across western Europe, the Bronze Age was \"closely and logically connected\" with the Late Neolithic which preceded it, and that the marker that is applied between the two by contemporary archaeologists is \"arbitrary\".{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=213}}

==Description==

The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that, along with the [[chambered long barrow]]s of the Early Neolithic, stone circles are one of the most prominent forms of monument produced in prehistoric Britain.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} Despite the commonly used term \"stone circles\", many of these monuments are not true circles, but are instead ellipses or ovals.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=91}} The stone circles are not always found in isolation from other forms of monument and often intersect with timber and earth structures.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}} For this reason, the archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] cautioned against understanding stone circles, timber circles, and earthen henges as distinct \"types\" of monument.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}}

The archaeologist Alexander Thom suggested that the stone circles fell into four broad classes: circles, flattened circles, egg-shaped rings, and ellipses.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

Some stone circles, such as that at [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in [[Somerset]], are approached by a short alignment of paired stones.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=123}} There are also stone avenues that link different monuments in the landscape, such as the [[West Kennet Avenue]] which links the Avebury henge to [[The Sanctuary]].{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}} In some cases, the stone circles survive in such a damaged state that it is not possible to know what they originally looked like.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

In some examples, timber posts were replaced with stone ones, perhaps with the intention of making the monument more durable and protecting it from decay.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=125}} In others, it is possible that both wooden and stone features of the circle were contemporary with each other.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}}

Like henges, the stone circles are almost exclusively found in the British Isles. The distribution of the stone circles is distinctive as it is broader than that of the henges.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} They are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, except the island's south-eastern corner.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}}
They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and near [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} There is much diversity in the design of these circles, both between different regions and within them.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} According to Mike Parker Pearson, this is \"perhaps unsurprising for a thousand-year fashion\".{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}

==Construction==
[[File:LongMegAndHerDaughters(SimonLedingham)May2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Long Meg and Her Daughters]], the largest example of Alexander Thom's Type B Flattened Circle]]
The archaeologist and stone circle specialist Aubrey Burl noted that the stone circle builders would have had to undertake \"careful planning\" before they erected these monuments. There was much that they had to take into consideration: the choice of location, the size of the ring, the transport of the heavy stones, the laying out of the circle or ellipse, and the preparation of stone holes. They may have also had to plot astronomical alignments, making the task more difficult.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}

Most stone circles were constructed upon flat ground, although some were instead built on a slope. At some sites, such as [[Kiltierney]] in [[County Fermanagh]], the land was flattened especially for this purpose, although in other cases it is clear that the land had been flattened by earlier communities, who had used the land for settlement or agriculture.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}

Aaron Watson has argued that various circles were located in a particular position to give the appearance of occupying the centre of the world, representing a microcosm of the surrounding area.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|pp=136–137}}

In some instances it appears that the choice of material used was important.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} For instance, at the [[Ring of Brodgar]] the stones used in the circle were produced from a variety of different sources.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}}

Very little is known about the process of quarrying the stone and transporting it to the sites of the circles.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One exception is at [[Vestra Fiold]] in [[Orkney]], where [[Colin Richards]] led an excavation that determined that the stones used for the Orcadian stone circles were cut from a horizontal seam of bedrock that was located just below the surface.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} These had been eased over a large pit and supported on stone trestles, after which wooden rollers and a sled were likely positioned underneath, allowing the megalith to be moved.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One of these stones, which weighed over 10 tonnes, had been left in its original position poised on stone supports, to be discovered by the archaeological excavators.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|pp=59–60}}

===Dating, number and size===
Burl noted that archaeologists assumed that for every stone circle that survived to the late 20th century,  there would have been two lost. From the 1300 surviving examples, Burl calculated that there might have originally been around 4000 stone circles across Britain, Ireland and Brittany.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}

Since the 1950s, archaeologists have been able to use [[radiocarbon dating]] of the material around the stones in order to accurately date their original construction.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} As of 2000, the earliest known radiocarbon dating of a stone circle was from the [[Lochmaben Stone]] in [[Dumfriesshire]], which was dated to 2525 ± 85 BCE, whilst the latest examples came from Sandy Road in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] (1200 ± 150 BCE), from [[Dromberg]] in [[County Cork]] (790 ± 80 BCE), and from the Five-Stone ring of [[Cashelkeety]] in [[County Kerry]] (715 ± 50 BCE).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Burl said that, the calibration of these dates indicated that the stone circle tradition existed between 3300 and 900 BCE.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}

[[File:Avebury Stone Circles.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Avebury in Wiltshire is the largest example of a stone circle from the British Isles, and is physically situated within an earlier henge.]]
The size of the megalithic rings varied, perhaps according to the number of people who would be using it during ceremonies.{{sfn|Burl|2000|pp=44–45}} Burl calculated that the largest stone circle in terms of both diameter and area was [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in Somerset, with a diameter of {{convert|112.2|m|ft}} and an area of 9,887 m² (2.44 acres). Second came the [[Ring of Brodgar]] in Orkney at {{convert|103.6|m|ft}} in diameter and 8,430 m² (2.08 acres) in area, whilst third was [[Avebury]] in Wiltshire, which had a diameter of {{convert|102.4|m|ft}} and an area of 8,236m² (2.04 acres).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}} However, Burl did not count the outer stone circle at Avebury, which has a diameter of {{convert|331.6|m|ft}}, making it Britain's largest stone circle. All of the largest circles were found in or near earlier henge monuments.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=45}} Such gargantuan monuments were rare. Burl calculated that most of the megalithic rings (92%) had an average diameter of {{convert|13.7|m|ft}}, with an average area of 150 m² (1615&nbsp;ft²).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}}

===Megalithic yard===
The archaeologist [[Alexander Thom]] proposed that the stone circles were built using a unit of measurement which he called the \"[[megalithic yard]]\",{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} about {{convert|2.72|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}} He came to this conclusion following more than forty years of surveying the monuments, aided by his son Archibald Stevenson Thom.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}
Parker Pearson stated that \"the idea of a standard unit of measurement is very plausible\" but perhaps not as regular as Thom and others have argued.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} In 1980, Burl noted that the idea of Thom's Megalithic Yard \"remain[ed] contentious\".{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}

===Astronomical alignments===

Thom also argued that the builders of these circles were accomplished astronomers and deliberately included astronomical alignments in the rings.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}
According to Parker Pearson, however, many of the circles do not appear to be based on any astronomical alignment.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} Pearson cautioned that Late Neolithic/Bronze Age conceptions of cosmology were likely very different from modern understandings of astronomy.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} However, it has been found that the earliest standing stone monuments in the British Isles, the great circles such as Callanish on the Isle of Lewis and Stenness on the Isle of Orkney, were specifically constructed to align with the sun and moon, and the movements of the sun and moon across the local landscape.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.05.025|title = Origins of Standing Stone Astronomy in Britain: New quantitative techniques for the study of archaeoastronomy|journal = Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume = 9|pages = 249–258|year = 2016|last1 = Higginbottom|first1 = Gail|last2 = Clay|first2 = Roger}}</ref>

==Purposes==
[[File:Rollrights King's Men.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The largest stone in the King's Men, a stone circle that is the dominant part of the [[Rollright Stones]] complex in the [[Cotswolds]].]]

There has been much analysis and debate about these monuments.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} No simple explanations have emerged.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} The original purposes of the stone ring monuments has been widely debated by antiquarians and archaeologists for several centuries.

These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=97}} This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence. They may have been deliberately left as \"silent and empty monuments\".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}} The archaeologists [[Mike Parker Pearson]] and Ramilsonina suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living.{{sfnm|1a1=Bradley|1y=2007|1p=126|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2pp=97–98}} Bradley noted that this interpretation was \"consistent with the archaeological evidence from Britain\",{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} where evidence for feasting and other human activities have been found at a range of timber sites but not at their stone counterparts. At the latter sites, there has been evidence of human remains.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Bradley suggested that the stone circles may have been spaces \"devoted to the dead\".{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}}

==Regional distribution==
Aubrey Burl's gazetteer lists 1,303 stone circles in Britain, Ireland and Brittany. The largest number of these are found in Scotland, with 508 sites recorded. There are 316 in England; 187 in Ireland; 156 in Northern Ireland; 81 in Wales; 49 in Brittany; and 6 in the Channel Isles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=395}}

===South-west Britain===

There are 13 to be found on [[Dartmoor]], including [[Brisworthy stone circle]] and [[Scorhill]], and numerous examples to be found in Cornwall such as [[The Merry Maidens]], [[The Hurlers]] and [[Boscawen-Un]].

In contrast to the over 70 stone circles known from Dartmoor, there are only two known from [[Exmoor]]:{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=150}} [[Porlock Stone Circle]] and [[Withypool Stone Circle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=150|2a1=Riley|2a2=Wilson-North|2y=2001|2p=24|3a1=Gillings|3y=2015a|3p=1}} The contrast between the number of rings on the two moors may be because Dartmoor has abundant natural [[granite]] while Exmoor has none, instead having [[Devonian]] slates and [[Exmoor Group#Hangman Sandstone Formation|Hangman Grits]], both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=150}} The two Exmoor stones are made from smaller stones, which archaeologists have termed ''miniliths''. However, the presence of other Exmoor constructions, such as the [[clapper bridge]] at [[Tarr Steps]] and the three-metre Long Stone at [[Challacombe]], which do use locally sourced large megaliths, suggests that larger stones would have been available had the sites' builders desired, and that the use of miniliths was perhaps deliberate.{{sfn|Gillings|2015b|p=210}}

===Wessex===
Wessex contains the two best known, though most atypical stone circles, [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{fact|date=January 2020}} All of the other Wiltshire circles are in a heavily ruined state and in some cases have been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} As noted by the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]], these examples have left behind \"only frustrating descriptions and vague positions\".{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} Most of the known Wiltshire examples were erected on low-lying positions in the landscape.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} 
In northern Wiltshire, in the area to the south of [[Swindon]], at least seven stone circles are reported as having existed, often only a few miles distant from one another;{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} of these, the [[Day House Lane Stone Circle]] is the only example to survive.{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} The stones of the [[Fir Clump Stone Circle]] were for instance removed during construction of the [[M4 motorway]] in 1969.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=311|2a1=Burl|2y=2004|2p=205|3a1=Field|3a2=McOmish|3y=2017|3p=78}}

[[File:Nine Stones, Dorset.jpg|thumb|left|The Nine Stones near Winterbourne Abbas, Dorset]]

The area of modern Dorset has a \"thin scatter\" of stone circles,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=307}} with nine possible examples known within its boundaries: [[Hampton Down Stone Circle]], [[Kingston Russell Stone Circle]], [[Nine Stones, Winterbourne Abbas|Nine Stones]], and [[Rempstone Stone Circle]] remain visible.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} The archaeologist John Gale described these as \"a small but significant group\" of such monuments.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} All are located within five miles of the sea.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}} All but Rempstone—which is on the [[Isle of Purbeck]]—are located on the chalk hills west of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]].{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology, being of comparatively small size, with none exceeding 28 metres in diameter.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1a2=Piggott|1y=1939|1p=139|2a1=Burl|2y=2000|2p=308|3a1=Gale|3y=2003|3p=72}} All are oval in shape, although perhaps have been altered from their original form.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2p=72}}

With the exception of the sandstone Rempstone circle, all consist of sarsen boulders.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} Much of this may have been obtained from the \"Valley of Stones\", a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to [[Littlebredy]], which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2pp=182–183}} With the exception of the circle at [[Litton Cheney]], none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=139}} The archaeologists [[Stuart Piggott|Stuart]] and [[Margaret Guido|Cecily Piggott]] believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin,{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=141}} The Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that \"their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age\".{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}}
Their nearest analogies are the circles found on [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] to the west, and the [[Stanton Drew stone circles]] to the north.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=140}} It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} On average Dorset's earthen henges are four times larger than the stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}}

===Northern England===
In what is now northern England, there was a particularly rich stone circle tradition in Cumbria. Several large megalithic rings were constructed here, such as [[Castlerigg stone circle]], [[Swinside]], and [[Long Meg and Her Daughters]].

===Scotland===
[[Image:Ring of Brodgar 3.jpg|thumb|The Ring of Brodgar, a Neolithic stone circle on [[Orkney]], Scotland.]]
Stone circles exist throughout Scotland, from [[Ninestane Rig]] in the far south to more famous examples in the far north and particularly in the islands (where several form part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]]). The [[Callanish Stones]] are one of the best-known examples in the [[Outer Hebrides]], while [[Orkney]] is known for its [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney|Neolithic monuments]], including the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]].

==Later history==

In some cases, the stones were removed from the rings for use as a building material.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}} In others, the site has been disrupted by natural causes such as trees, the roots of which have shifted the location of the megaliths.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

===Late Bronze and Iron Ages===
Evidence for the destruction of stone circles first comes from the Late Bronze Age.

===Medieval period===

Following the Christianisation of Britain in the Early Medieval period, various Christian clergyman denounced those pagans who continued to venerate at stones in the landscape, which in some cases perhaps implied stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=14}}

By the Late Mediaeval period, references to prehistoric monuments in the British Isles were rare, and were usually only to note down practical matters, such as that a judicial court would be held near to one or that a farmer's land lay near to one.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}
A rare exception is found in the fictionalised ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (c.1136), in which the chronicle's author [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] claimed that Stonehenge had once been the Giants' Ring, and that it had originally been located on [[Mount Killaraus]] in Ireland, until the wizard [[Merlin]] moved it to Salisbury Plain.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}

===Antiquarian and archaeological investigation===

Many 19th century antiquarians produced plans of the circles which were \"inaccurate and slipshod.\"{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}

==Folklore==
In the Mediaeval and Early Modern period onward, much folklore developed around the subject of the stone circles.

In Britain, several stone circles have been connected to the [[countless stones]] motif in folklore. The earliest recorded account comes from [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''The 7 Wonders of England'', written prior to 1586. Sidney linked the motif to Stonehenge.{{sfn|Menefee|1975|p=146}} Subsequently, the antiquary [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] mentioned the story in his book, ''The Survey of Cornwall'', published in 1602, noting that it was applied both the Stonehenge and to The Hurlers in Cornwall.{{sfn|Menefee|1975|pp=146, 155}}
The countless stones motif has been attributed to over five different stone circles, as well as several ruined long barrows such as [[Little Kit's Coty House]] in Kent.{{sfn|Grinsell|1976|p=63}}

The '''stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany''' are a [[megalith]]ic tradition of monuments consisting of standing stones arranged in rings. These were constructed from 3300 to 900 BCE in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} It has been estimated that around 4,000 of these monuments were originally constructed in this part of north-western Europe during this period.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Around 1,300 of them are recorded, the others having been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}

Although [[stone circles]] have been erected throughout history by a variety of societies and for a variety of reasons, in the [[Late Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain|Early Bronze Ages]], this particular tradition was limited to Britain, Ireland and the neighbouring area of continental Europe now known as [[Brittany]]. The rings were not distributed equally across this area, but were concentrated in several highland regions: north-eastern and central Scotland, the [[Lake District]], the south-west peninsula of England, and the north and south-west of Ireland. Sparser groupings can also be found in [[Caithness]], the [[Outer Hebrides]], the [[Peak District]], the [[Wicklow Mountains]], [[Wales]] and [[Wessex]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}

Their original purpose is not fully known, but archaeological investigation has shed some light on it. It is widely thought that they served a ritual or ceremonial purpose, particularly in relation to solar and/or lunar alignments. In a minority of cases, some were also used as cemeteries, with burials being made in and around the circle.

Antiquarian investigation into the circles began in the Early Modern period, intensifying after the publications of notable English antiquarian [[William Stukeley]] in the 18th century. At the time, scholars understood little of prehistoric Britain, with the megalithic circles typically being ascribed either to the [[druid]]s of the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] or to the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish settlers]] of [[Early Medieval]] times.

In the 20th century, with the development of [[archaeology]], archaeologists could investigate the circles in more detail. They dated them to the Late Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Since the late 20th century, many of these monuments were adopted as \"sacred sites\" by adherents of [[Paganism (contemporary religious movements)|contemporary pagan]] religions such as [[Neo-Druidism]], [[Wicca]] and the [[Goddess movement]], and they had used the sites as places to conduct their magico-religious rites.

==Background==

===Early Neolithic===
[[File:WKLB Mittelgang DB.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of [[West Kennet Long Barrow]]. Long barrows such as this one were the dominant form of megalithic architecture before the development of the stone circle tradition.]]

During the Neolithic, or 'New Stone Age', there were extensive cultural changes across north-western Europe. The introduction of [[agriculture]] ended the [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle which had dominated in the preceding Palaeolithic ('Old Stone Age') and Mesolithic ('Middle Stone Age') periods.

During the Early Neolithic in Brittany and the British Isles, the megalithic tradition of building [[chambered tomb]]s for the dead had waxed and waned. The chambered tomb tradition lasted between about 4000 and 3500 BCE, although an earlier example, at [[Carrowmore]] in County Sligo, has been disputably dated to 5000 BCE.<ref name=\"Pearson 2005. p. 34\">[[#Par05|Parker Pearson 2005]]. p. 34.</ref><ref name=\"Burl 2000 24\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 24.</ref> The length of this tradition led prehistorian [[Mike Parker Pearson]] to note that it was \"a relatively short-lived fashion in archaeological terms.\"<ref name=\"Pearson 2005. p. 34\"/> In southern England, 84% of chambered tombs were built in a north-east to south-east orientation, which probably had some special significance for their builders.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=23}}

In some parts of the British Isles, architectural changes were made to the style of chambered tomb, which may have been a forerunner of the later circular design of the stone rings.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 26-27\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. pp. 26-27.</ref> In the later Clyde tombs of south-western Scotland and the court-cairns of northern Ireland, crescent-shaped forecourts were constructed inside the tombs. This would have enabled more people to enter the tomb and take part in any rites there in sunlight.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 26-27\"/>

During the Early Neolithic another form of monument was also constructed in the British Isles, now known by archaeologists as [[causewayed enclosure]]s.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 25.</ref> These  consisted of massive circular ditch-and-bank earthworks. Construction of causewayed enclosures in the lowland regions of Southern England flourished around 3800 BCE, but by 3200 BCE almost all of them had been abandoned by their users.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/> No equivalents have been found in the highland areas of northern Britain.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/> Despite having excavated a number of these sites across southern Britain, archaeologists do not know their exact purpose. It has been suggested that they were camps, markets, cattle kraals or occasional settlements, or perhaps ritual centres for the celebration of seasonal festivals or cemeteries.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 25\"/>

===Late Neolithic===

As the transition from the [[Neolithic|Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic]] took place in around 3000 BCE, there was much economic and technological continuity. But there was considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} By that date, the [[long barrow]]s, [[causewayed enclosure]]s, and [[cursus]]es which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased to be built. They were replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} These include not only stone circles, but also earthen [[henge]]s and [[timber circles]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=91–94}} This transition toward circular monuments had symbolic associations. As the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]] stated, \"There was a change from the cramped, gloomy chamber of a tomb to the unroofed, wide ring, a change from darkness to light, from the dead to the living, from the grave to the sky.\"{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=38}} Similar observations were made by the historian Ronald Hutton, who commented that the circular shape of the rings \"mirrors the sun, the full moon and the bounds of the horizon\" and that such a shape can also be \"profoundly egalitarian\".{{sfn|Hutton|1991|p=52}}

[[File:Maumbury Rings center.jpg|thumb|left|Alongside the stone circles, earthen henges (such as [[Maumbury Rings]] in Dorset) were erected in Late Neolithic Britain]]

This transition was, according to historian [[Ronald Hutton]], \"as fundamental as that from the Mesolithic had been.\"<ref name=\"Hutton 1991 52\">[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 52.</ref> Archaeological pollen analysis has shown that it was a period when scrub and weeds were spreading over what had formerly been cultivated fields, and forests that had previously been cleared began to grow back.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\">[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 29.</ref> Chambered tombs were blocked up and abandoned, implying that people were ceasing to use them as cultic sites.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/> Several former causewayed enclosures were converted into defensive structures with gateways and walls, and in some cases they were attacked. Evidence for conflict has been found at [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] in Cornwall, [[Hambledon Hill]] in Dorset, and Crickley Hill in Gloucestershire.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/> Various archaeologists have suggested that this was a period of particular turmoil within the British Isles, perhaps caused by an overuse of land, the failure of crops, famine, plague, climatic change, or an increase in population that was not supported by the food supply.<ref name=\"Burl 2000 29\"/>

===Early Bronze Age===
The start of the Bronze Age in Britain was signalled by the introduction of [[bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and usually [[tin]]. Ideologically, there is no evidence for a change in Brittany and the British Isles at this time, with communities continuing to construct megalithic stone circles. The archaeologists J.M. Coles and A.F. Harding noted that across western Europe, the Bronze Age was \"closely and logically connected\" with the Late Neolithic which preceded it, and that the marker that is applied between the two by contemporary archaeologists is \"arbitrary\".{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=213}}

==Description==

The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that, along with the [[chambered long barrow]]s of the Early Neolithic, stone circles are one of the most prominent forms of monument produced in prehistoric Britain.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} Despite the commonly used term \"stone circles\", many of these monuments are not true circles, but are instead ellipses or ovals.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=91}} The stone circles are not always found in isolation from other forms of monument and often intersect with timber and earth structures.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}} For this reason, the archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] cautioned against understanding stone circles, timber circles, and earthen henges as distinct \"types\" of monument.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}}

The archaeologist Alexander Thom suggested that the stone circles fell into four broad classes: circles, flattened circles, egg-shaped rings, and ellipses.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

Some stone circles, such as that at [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in [[Somerset]], are approached by a short alignment of paired stones.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=123}} There are also stone avenues that link different monuments in the landscape, such as the [[West Kennet Avenue]] which links the Avebury henge to [[The Sanctuary]].{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}} In some cases, the stone circles survive in such a damaged state that it is not possible to know what they originally looked like.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

In some examples, timber posts were replaced with stone ones, perhaps with the intention of making the monument more durable and protecting it from decay.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=125}} In others, it is possible that both wooden and stone features of the circle were contemporary with each other.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}}

Like henges, the stone circles are almost exclusively found in the British Isles. The distribution of the stone circles is distinctive as it is broader than that of the henges.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} They are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, except the island's south-eastern corner.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}}
They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and near [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} There is much diversity in the design of these circles, both between different regions and within them.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} According to Mike Parker Pearson, this is \"perhaps unsurprising for a thousand-year fashion\".{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}

==Construction==
[[File:LongMegAndHerDaughters(SimonLedingham)May2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Long Meg and Her Daughters]], the largest example of Alexander Thom's Type B Flattened Circle]]
The archaeologist and stone circle specialist Aubrey Burl noted that the stone circle builders would have had to undertake \"careful planning\" before they erected these monuments. There was much that they had to take into consideration: the choice of location, the size of the ring, the transport of the heavy stones, the laying out of the circle or ellipse, and the preparation of stone holes. They may have also had to plot astronomical alignments, making the task more difficult.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}

Most stone circles were constructed upon flat ground, although some were instead built on a slope. At some sites, such as [[Kiltierney]] in [[County Fermanagh]], the land was flattened especially for this purpose, although in other cases it is clear that the land had been flattened by earlier communities, who had used the land for settlement or agriculture.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}

Aaron Watson has argued that various circles were located in a particular position to give the appearance of occupying the centre of the world, representing a microcosm of the surrounding area.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|pp=136–137}}

In some instances it appears that the choice of material used was important.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} For instance, at the [[Ring of Brodgar]] the stones used in the circle were produced from a variety of different sources.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}}

Very little is known about the process of quarrying the stone and transporting it to the sites of the circles.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One exception is at [[Vestra Fiold]] in [[Orkney]], where [[Colin Richards]] led an excavation that determined that the stones used for the Orcadian stone circles were cut from a horizontal seam of bedrock that was located just below the surface.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} These had been eased over a large pit and supported on stone trestles, after which wooden rollers and a sled were likely positioned underneath, allowing the megalith to be moved.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One of these stones, which weighed over 10 tonnes, had been left in its original position poised on stone supports, to be discovered by the archaeological excavators.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|pp=59–60}}

===Dating, number and size===
Burl noted that archaeologists assumed that for every stone circle that survived to the late 20th century,  there would have been two lost. From the 1300 surviving examples, Burl calculated that there might have originally been around 4000 stone circles across Britain, Ireland and Brittany.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}

Since the 1950s, archaeologists have been able to use [[radiocarbon dating]] of the material around the stones in order to accurately date their original construction.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} As of 2000, the earliest known radiocarbon dating of a stone circle was from the [[Lochmaben Stone]] in [[Dumfriesshire]], which was dated to 2525 ± 85 BCE, whilst the latest examples came from Sandy Road in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] (1200 ± 150 BCE), from [[Dromberg]] in [[County Cork]] (790 ± 80 BCE), and from the Five-Stone ring of [[Cashelkeety]] in [[County Kerry]] (715 ± 50 BCE).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Burl said that, the calibration of these dates indicated that the stone circle tradition existed between 3300 and 900 BCE.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}

[[File:Avebury Stone Circles.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Avebury in Wiltshire is the largest example of a stone circle from the British Isles, and is physically situated within an earlier henge.]]
The size of the megalithic rings varied, perhaps according to the number of people who would be using it during ceremonies.{{sfn|Burl|2000|pp=44–45}} Burl calculated that the largest stone circle in terms of both diameter and area was [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in Somerset, with a diameter of {{convert|112.2|m|ft}} and an area of 9,887 m² (2.44 acres). Second came the [[Ring of Brodgar]] in Orkney at {{convert|103.6|m|ft}} in diameter and 8,430 m² (2.08 acres) in area, whilst third was [[Avebury]] in Wiltshire, which had a diameter of {{convert|102.4|m|ft}} and an area of 8,236m² (2.04 acres).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}} However, Burl did not count the outer stone circle at Avebury, which has a diameter of {{convert|331.6|m|ft}}, making it Britain's largest stone circle. All of the largest circles were found in or near earlier henge monuments.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=45}} Such gargantuan monuments were rare. Burl calculated that most of the megalithic rings (92%) had an average diameter of {{convert|13.7|m|ft}}, with an average area of 150 m² (1615&nbsp;ft²).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}}

===Megalithic yard===
The archaeologist [[Alexander Thom]] proposed that the stone circles were built using a unit of measurement which he called the \"[[megalithic yard]]\",{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} about {{convert|2.72|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}} He came to this conclusion following more than forty years of surveying the monuments, aided by his son Archibald Stevenson Thom.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}
Parker Pearson stated that \"the idea of a standard unit of measurement is very plausible\" but perhaps not as regular as Thom and others have argued.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} In 1980, Burl noted that the idea of Thom's Megalithic Yard \"remain[ed] contentious\".{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}

===Astronomical alignments===

Thom also argued that the builders of these circles were accomplished astronomers and deliberately included astronomical alignments in the rings.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}
According to Parker Pearson, however, many of the circles do not appear to be based on any astronomical alignment.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} Pearson cautioned that Late Neolithic/Bronze Age conceptions of cosmology were likely very different from modern understandings of astronomy.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} However, it has been found that the earliest standing stone monuments in the British Isles, the great circles such as Callanish on the Isle of Lewis and Stenness on the Isle of Orkney, were specifically constructed to align with the sun and moon, and the movements of the sun and moon across the local landscape.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.05.025|title = Origins of Standing Stone Astronomy in Britain: New quantitative techniques for the study of archaeoastronomy|journal = Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume = 9|pages = 249–258|year = 2016|last1 = Higginbottom|first1 = Gail|last2 = Clay|first2 = Roger}}</ref>

==Purposes==
[[File:Rollrights King's Men.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The largest stone in the King's Men, a stone circle that is the dominant part of the [[Rollright Stones]] complex in the [[Cotswolds]].]]

There has been much analysis and debate about these monuments.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} No simple explanations have emerged.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} The original purposes of the stone ring monuments has been widely debated by antiquarians and archaeologists for several centuries.

These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=97}} This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence. They may have been deliberately left as \"silent and empty monuments\".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}} The archaeologists [[Mike Parker Pearson]] and Ramilsonina suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living.{{sfnm|1a1=Bradley|1y=2007|1p=126|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2pp=97–98}} Bradley noted that this interpretation was \"consistent with the archaeological evidence from Britain\",{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} where evidence for feasting and other human activities have been found at a range of timber sites but not at their stone counterparts. At the latter sites, there has been evidence of human remains.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Bradley suggested that the stone circles may have been spaces \"devoted to the dead\".{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}}

==Regional distribution==
Aubrey Burl's gazetteer lists 1,303 stone circles in Britain, Ireland and Brittany. The largest number of these are found in Scotland, with 508 sites recorded. There are 316 in England; 187 in Ireland; 156 in Northern Ireland; 81 in Wales; 49 in Brittany; and 6 in the Channel Isles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=395}}

===South-west Britain===

There are 13 to be found on [[Dartmoor]], including [[Brisworthy stone circle]] and [[Scorhill]], and numerous examples to be found in Cornwall such as the [[The Merry Maidens]], [[The Hurlers ]] and [[Boscawen-Un]].

In contrast to the over 70 stone circles known from Dartmoor, there are only two known from [[Exmoor]]:{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=150}} [[Porlock Stone Circle]] and [[Withypool Stone Circle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=150|2a1=Riley|2a2=Wilson-North|2y=2001|2p=24|3a1=Gillings|3y=2015a|3p=1}} The contrast between the number of rings on the two moors may be because Dartmoor has abundant natural [[granite]] while Exmoor has none, instead having [[Devonian]] slates and [[Exmoor Group#Hangman Sandstone Formation|Hangman Grits]], both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=150}} The two Exmoor stones are made from smaller stones, which archaeologists have termed ''miniliths''. However, the presence of other Exmoor constructions, such as the [[clapper bridge]] at [[Tarr Steps]] and the three-metre Long Stone at [[Challacombe]], which do use locally sourced large megaliths, suggests that larger stones would have been available had the sites' builders desired, and that the use of miniliths was perhaps deliberate.{{sfn|Gillings|2015b|p=210}}

===Wessex===
Wessex contains the two best known, though most atypical stone circles, [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{fact|date=January 2020}} All of the other Wiltshire circles are in a heavily ruined state and in some cases have been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} As noted by the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]], these examples have left behind \"only frustrating descriptions and vague positions\".{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} Most of the known Wiltshire examples were erected on low-lying positions in the landscape.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} 
In northern Wiltshire, in the area to the south of [[Swindon]], at least seven stone circles are reported as having existed, often only a few miles distant from one another;{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} of these, the [[Day House Lane Stone Circle]] is the only example to survive.{{sfn|Burl|2004|p=197}} The stones of the [[Fir Clump Stone Circle]] were for instance removed during construction of the [[M4 motorway]] in 1969.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=311|2a1=Burl|2y=2004|2p=205|3a1=Field|3a2=McOmish|3y=2017|3p=78}}

[[File:Nine Stones, Dorset.jpg|thumb|left|The Nine Stones near Winterbourne Abbas, Dorset]]

The area of modern Dorset has a \"thin scatter\" of stone circles,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=307}} with nine possible examples known within its boundaries: [[Hampton Down Stone Circle]], [[Kingston Russell Stone Circle]], [[Nine Stones, Winterbourne Abbas|Nine Stones]], and [[Rempstone Stone Circle]] remain visible.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} The archaeologist John Gale described these as \"a small but significant group\" of such monuments.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} All are located within five miles of the sea.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}} All but Rempstone—which is on the [[Isle of Purbeck]]—are located on the chalk hills west of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]].{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology, being of comparatively small size, with none exceeding 28 metres in diameter.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1a2=Piggott|1y=1939|1p=139|2a1=Burl|2y=2000|2p=308|3a1=Gale|3y=2003|3p=72}} All are oval in shape, although perhaps have been altered from their original form.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2p=72}}

With the exception of the sandstone Rempstone circle, all consist of sarsen boulders.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} Much of this may have been obtained from the \"Valley of Stones\", a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to [[Littlebredy]], which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2pp=182–183}} With the exception of the circle at [[Litton Cheney]], none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=139}} The archaeologists [[Stuart Piggott|Stuart]] and [[Margaret Guido|Cecily Piggott]] believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin,{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=141}} The Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that \"their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age\".{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}}
Their nearest analogies are the circles found on [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] to the west, and the [[Stanton Drew stone circles]] to the north.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=140}} It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} On average Dorset's earthen henges are four times larger than the stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}}

===Northern England===
In what is now northern England, there was a particularly rich stone circle tradition in Cumbria. Several large megalithic rings were constructed here, such as [[Castlerigg stone circle]], [[Swinside]], and [[Long Meg and Her Daughters]].

===Scotland===
[[Image:Ring of Brodgar 3.jpg|thumb|The Ring of Brodgar, a Neolithic stone circle on [[Orkney]], Scotland.]]
Stone circles exist throughout Scotland, from [[Ninestane Rig]] in the far south to more famous examples in the far north and particularly in the islands (where several form part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]]). The [[Callanish Stones]] are one of the best-known examples in the [[Outer Hebrides]], while [[Orkney]] is known for its [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney|Neolithic monuments]], including the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]].

==Later history==

In some cases, the stones were removed from the rings for use as a building material.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}} In others, the site has been disrupted by natural causes such as trees, the roots of which have shifted the location of the megaliths.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

===Late Bronze and Iron Ages===
Evidence for the destruction of stone circles first comes from the Late Bronze Age.

===Medieval period===

Following the Christianisation of Britain in the Early Medieval period, various Christian clergyman denounced those pagans who continued to venerate at stones in the landscape, which in some cases perhaps implied stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=14}}

By the Late Mediaeval period, references to prehistoric monuments in the British Isles were rare, and were usually only to note down practical matters, such as that a judicial court would be held near to one or that a farmer's land lay near to one.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}
A rare exception is found in the fictionalised ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (c.1136), in which the chronicle's author [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] claimed that Stonehenge had once been the Giants' Ring, and that it had originally been located on [[Mount Killaraus]] in Ireland, until the wizard [[Merlin]] moved it to Salisbury Plain.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}

===Antiquarian and archaeological investigation===

Many 19th century antiquarians produced plans of the circles which were \"inaccurate and slipshod.\"{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}

==Folklore==
In the Mediaeval and Early Modern period onward, much folklore developed around the subject of the stone circles.

In Britain, several stone circles have been connected to the [[countless stones]] motif in folklore. The earliest recorded account comes from [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''The 7 Wonders of England'', written prior to 1586. Sidney linked the motif to Stonehenge.{{sfn|Menefee|1975|p=146}} Subsequently, the antiquary [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] mentioned the story in his book, ''The Survey of Cornwall'', published in 1602, noting that it was applied both the Stonehenge and to The Hurlers in Cornwall.{{sfn|Menefee|1975|pp=146, 155}}
The countless stones motif has been attributed to over five different stone circles, as well as several ruined long barrows such as [[Little Kit's Coty House]] in Kent.{{sfn|Grinsell|1976|p=63}}

==Government==
{{See also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov|authorlink=Indiana Code}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= Indiana Code |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov|authorlink= Indiana Code}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:'''

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/> The current [[Putnam County Jail]] was built in 1995 for $5.6 million.

For the seasons of 1981 and 1982, plays and musicals were presented on an outdoor stage with bleacher seating. By 1983, the funds had been raised to convert a larger structure, a barn built in 1918, into an intimate 220-seat theater. The Hazel Day Longden Barn Theatre had its grand opening on June 4, 1983. Past performers presented a program of scenes and songs that had been produced by the PCP in its early years. In 1993, extensive work was done on the physical plant. A fly area was added and a new workshop and costume loft were constructed. The following year, a moderate cooling system was added and posts in the auditorium were removed. In April 2000, aluminum siding was added to the barn. Most recently, the seating system was completely replaced and the theater now seats 198 people.

The Putnam County Playhouse is active from June through September each year. It presents two musicals and two plays during those sixteen weeks. Every other year, a children's workshop play is also produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com/about/history.html|title=Putnam County Playhouse - History of the Putnam County Playhouse|website=www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com}}</ref>

==Government==
{{See also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov|authorlink=Indiana Code}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= Indiana Code |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov|authorlink= Indiana Code}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:'''

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/> The current [[Putnam County Jail]] was built in 1995 for $5.6 million.

=== Cagles Mill Lake ===
In 1952,[[Cagles Mill Lake]] was built as Indiana's first flood control reservoir, protecting the [[Eel River (White River)|Eel]] and [[White River (Indiana)|White]] river watersheds. Mill Creek feeds the {{convert|1400|acre|adj=on}} lake and is home to [[Cataract Falls (Indiana)|Cataract Falls]]. In the 1800s, [[Lieber State Recreation Area]] was populated by the [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Potawatomi]]. In 1809, what was left of the great Miami Indian Confederacy sold the now southern one-third of Indiana to the U.S. government, when the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|10 O'Clock Treaty Line]], which passes through Lieber SRA, was laid out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goputnam.com/merchant/cagles-mill-lake/|title=Cagles Mill Lake – Putnam County|website=goputnam.com}}</ref>

=== DePauw University Nature Park ===
The DePauw Nature Park is a {{convert|9}mi|adj=on)) moderately trafficked loop trail that features a lake, wildlife, and bird-watching. The trails are rated as moderate, offer a number of activity options and are accessible year round. Between 1917 and 1977, the nature park was the site of a limestone quarry, owned and operated by Hanson Aggregates. With the quarry dormant for decades, Hanson Aggregates donated {{convert|280|acre}} of the land and leased the remaining {{convert|178|acre}} to [[DePauw University]] for $1 per year for 99 years. DePauw acquired adjacent property to increase the total size of the Nature Park to {{convert|520|acre}}. DePauw commissioned Mansur Developers in 2002 to design a master plan for possible uses of the nature park. DePauw completed phase 1 of the master plan in 2004 and opened the Nature Park to the public in September 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goputnam.com/merchant/depauw-university-nature-park/|title=DePauw University Nature Park – Putnam County|website=goputnam.com}}</ref>

=== Fern Cliff ===
Fern Cliff and its sandstone cliffs have long been a popular Indiana refuge. Steep forested, sandstone cliffs, lush wooded ravines, and a profusion of ferns and bryophytes characterize the preserve. The preserve is open for hiking, photography, and bird watching on its moderate to rugged terrain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goputnam.com/merchant/fern-cliff/|title=Fern Cliff – Putnam County|website=goputnam.com}}</ref>

=== Glenn Flint Lake ===
Located in Putnam County, north and a bit west of Greencastle, {{convert|371|acre|adj=on}} Glenn Flint Lake is home to a relatively new population of game fish, including panfish. The lake renovation that took place in 1995 removed large numbers of carp, so the blugills and crappies are now doing well. Little Walnut Creek Conservancy District owns the lake. The [[Indiana Department of Natural Resources]], Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) manages the fishery at Glenn Flint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goputnam.com/merchant/glenn-flint-lake/|title=Glenn Flint Lake – Putnam County|website=goputnam.com}}</ref>

=== Greencastle People Pathways ===
People Pathways is a planning and implementation group established with the approval of the Greencastle Park Board of Commissioners. People Pathways has successfully developed a multi-use recreation trail plan. The paths connect public spaces such as schools, parks, libraries, and community resources. The paths are used primarily by walkers, joggers, and cyclists. Implementation of the People Pathways plan is being done in phases as opportunities develop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goputnam.com/merchant/greencastle-people-pathways/|title=Greencastle People Pathways – Putnam County|website=goputnam.com}}</ref>

=== Putnam County Playhouse ===
The Putnam County Playhouse was organized in late 1961 by a group of people in Greencastle. Their purpose was \"To provide the people of the county and the surrounding area with the opportunity to participate in and enjoy live theatre.\" For the first seasons, the plays and musicals were presented in various venues around the Greencastle. For the seasons of 1981 and 1982, plays and musicals were presented on an outdoor stage with bleacher seating. By 1983, the funds had been raised to convert a larger structure, a barn built in 1918, into an intimate 220-seat theater. The Hazel Day Longden Barn Theatre had its grand opening on June 4, 1983. Past performers presented a program of scenes and songs that had been produced by the PCP in its early years. In 1993, extensive work was done on the physical plant. A fly area was added and a new workshop and costume loft were constructed. The following year, a moderate cooling system was added and posts in the auditorium were removed. In April 2000, aluminum siding was added to the barn. Most recently, the seating system was completely replaced and the theater now seats 198 people.

The Putnam County Playhouse is active from June through September each year. It presents two musicals and two plays during those sixteen weeks. Every other year, a children's workshop play is also produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com/about/history.html|title=Putnam County Playhouse - History of the Putnam County Playhouse|website=www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com}}</ref>

{{short description|Fundamental legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory}}
{{Rights}}

'''Rights''' are [[law|legal]], social, or [[ethics|ethical]] [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.<ref name=tws21decgghg/> Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].
 
Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], for they are regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]],<ref>UN [[UDHR]] Preamble: \"Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world...\"</ref> and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', \"rights structure the form of governments, the content of [[laws]], and the shape of [[morality]] as it is currently perceived\".<ref name=tws21decgghg/>

==Definitional issues==
[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it waso advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.<ref name=tws21decgghg>{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.
|publisher = Stanford University
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}</ref>}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.<ref name=tws21decgghg/>}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].

===Natural Rights===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]

* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are \"natural\" in the sense of \"not artificial, not man-made\", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.

===Claim versus liberty===
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').<ref name=IEP>Fagan, Andrew. \"Human Rights\". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b</ref> In logic, this idea can be expressed as: \"Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something.\" Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like \"life, liberty, and property\"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}
* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.<ref name=\"IEP\" /> This can be expressed in logic as: \"Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something.\" For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive versus negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:
* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported \"right to welfare.\"<ref name=tws21decgkfjf/>
* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.<ref name=tws21decgkfjf>{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.

}}</ref>

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass \"privileges\" and \"powers\") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass \"claims\" and \"immunities\").

===Individual versus group===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].<ref name=tws18decafafa>{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]

|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}</ref> However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''.<ref>For a general discussion see. Charles Edward Andrew Lincoln IV, ''Hegelian Dialectical Analysis of U.S. Voting Laws'', 42 U. Dayton L. Rev. 87 (2017).</ref> Accordingly:
* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]
* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a \"right\" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term \"group\" as well as by the term \"group rights.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed \"individual rights\" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the \"group rights\" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

==Politics==
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their \"Miranda rights\". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]
Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],<ref name=tws21decghnnb>{{cite magazine

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as \"rights\" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a \"right to medical care\" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the \"right to a fair trial\".

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of \"rights\" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].<ref name=tws21dece563e>{{cite news

|quote = Equality of opportunity is to be contrasted with equality of outcome.

Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of others’. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, ‘levels the playing field,’ so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], [[meta-ethics]] is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].

While normative ethics addresses such questions as \"What should one do?\", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as \"What ''is'' goodness?\" and \"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?\", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).
Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:
* Duties ([[deontology]])
* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])
* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])
* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

===Criticism===
Some philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85–88 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}</ref> Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Magna Carta]]'' or \"The Great Charter\" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights.

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to be respected by his son did not indicate a right of the son to receive something in return for that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave much possibility for many rights for the subjects themselves.<ref name=tws21decfrre>{{cite news

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.

Important documents in the [[political history]] of rights include:

{{Rights}}

'''Rights''' are [[law|legal]], social, or [[ethics|ethical]] [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.<ref name=tws21decgghg/> Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].
 
Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], for they are regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]],<ref>UN [[UDHR]] Preamble: \"Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world...\"</ref> and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', \"rights structure the form of governments, the content of [[laws]], and the shape of [[morality]] as it is currently perceived\".<ref name=tws21decgghg/>

==Definitional issues==
[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.<ref name=tws21decgghg>{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.
|publisher = Stanford University
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}</ref>}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.<ref name=tws21decgghg/>}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].

===Natural Rights===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]

* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are \"natural\" in the sense of \"not artificial, not man-made\", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.

===Claim versus liberty===
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').<ref name=IEP>Fagan, Andrew. \"Human Rights\". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b</ref> In logic, this idea can be expressed as: \"Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something.\" Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like \"life, liberty, and property\"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}
* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.<ref name=\"IEP\" /> This can be expressed in logic as: \"Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something.\" For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive versus negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:
* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported \"right to welfare.\"<ref name=tws21decgkfjf/>
* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.<ref name=tws21decgkfjf>{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.

}}</ref>

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass \"privileges\" and \"powers\") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass \"claims\" and \"immunities\").

===Individual versus group===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].<ref name=tws18decafafa>{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]

|date = 2009-12-18

|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}</ref> However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''.<ref>For a general discussion see. Charles Edward Andrew Lincoln IV, ''Hegelian Dialectical Analysis of U.S. Voting Laws'', 42 U. Dayton L. Rev. 87 (2017).</ref> Accordingly:
* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]
* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a \"right\" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term \"group\" as well as by the term \"group rights.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed \"individual rights\" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the \"group rights\" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

==Politics==
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their \"Miranda rights\". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]
Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],<ref name=tws21decghnnb>{{cite magazine

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as \"rights\" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a \"right to medical care\" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the \"right to a fair trial\".

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of \"rights\" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].<ref name=tws21dece563e>{{cite news

|title = Roemer on equality of opportunity
|quote = Equality of opportunity is to be contrasted with equality of outcome. While advocacy of the latter has been traditionally associated with a left-wing political philosophy, the former has been championed by conservative political philosophy. Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of others’. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, ‘levels the playing field,’ so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], [[meta-ethics]] is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].

While normative ethics addresses such questions as \"What should one do?\", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as \"What ''is'' goodness?\" and \"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?\", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).
Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:
* Duties ([[deontology]])
* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])
* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])
* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

===Criticism===
Some philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85–88 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}</ref> Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

==History==
{{see also|History of human rights}}
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Magna Carta]]'' or \"The Great Charter\" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.]]

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting; the painting is of a written declaration; there are two human images to the left and right; it says \"Declaration des droits de l'homme\" (declaration of the rights of man)|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in 1789 in [[France]].]]

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to be respected by his son did not indicate a right of the son to receive something in return for that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave much possibility for many rights for the subjects themselves.<ref name=tws21decfrre>{{cite news

|quote = [...] the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers [...] was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.

Important documents in the [[political history]] of rights include:

* The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]] established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under [[Cyrus the Great]].

While ''Magna Carta'' was originally a set of rules that the king had to follow, and mainly protected the property of aristocratic landowners, today it is seen as the basis of certain rights for ordinary people, such as the right of due process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=April 20, 2015|title=The Rule of History: Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, and the hold of time.|url=|journal=New Yorker|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> 
* The [[Declaration of Arbroath]] (1320; [[Scotland]]) established the right of the people to choose a head of state (see [[popular sovereignty]]).
* The [[Henrician Articles]] (1573; Poland-Lithuania) or King Henry's Articles were a permanent contract that stated the fundamental principles of governance and constitutional law in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including the rights of the nobility to elect the king, to meet in parliament whose approval was required to levy taxes and declare war or peace, to religious liberty and the right to rebel in case the king transgressed against the laws of the republic or the rights of the nobility.
* The [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1689; England) declared that [[Englishmen]], as embodied by [[Parliament]], possess certain civil and political rights; the [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] (1689; Scotland) was similar but distinct.
* The [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] (1776) by [[George Mason]] declared the inherent natural rights and [[separation of powers]].
* The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] (1776) succinctly defined the rights of man as including, but not limited to, \"[[Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]\" which later influenced \"[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]\" (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Dyck | first = Rand | title = Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches (3rd edition) | publisher = [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] | year = 2000 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-17-616792-9 | postscript = <!--none--> | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/canadianpolitics0000dyck_m4n9 }}</ref> The phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/1947con.html|title=1947 Japanese Constitution|author=|date=|website=history.hanover.edu}}</ref> and in President [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s 1945 declaration of independence of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1945vietnam.html|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|author=|date=|website=www.fordham.edu}}</ref> An alternative phrase \"life, liberty and property\", is found in the [[Declaration of Colonial Rights]], a resolution of the [[First Continental Congress]].

* The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (1789; France), one of the fundamental documents of the [[French Revolution]], defined a set of individual rights and collective rights of the people.
* The [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] (1785; United States), written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1779, was a document that asserted the right of man to form a personal relationship with God free from interference by the state.
* The [[United States Bill of Rights]] (1789–1791; United States), the first ten amendments of the [[United States Constitution]] specified rights of individuals in which government could not interfere, including the rights of free assembly, freedom of religion, trial by jury, and the right to keep and bear arms.
* The [[Constitution of 3rd May|Constitution of Poland-Lithuania]] (1791; Poland-Lithuania) was the first constitution in Europe, and second in the world. It built upon previous Polish law documents such as the Henrician Articles, as well as the US constitution, and it too, specified many rights.

The '''flag of the Republic of China''' (also known as the '''Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth''' and the '''flag of Taiwan''') consists of a red field with a blue [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|canton]] bearing a white disc with twelve triangles surrounding it. The disc and triangles symbolize the sun and rays of light emanating from it respectively.

The flag was originally designed by the anti-Qing group, [[Revive China Society]] in 1894 with the addition of the red field component in 1906 by Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] in speech.

It was first used in [[mainland China]] as the Navy flag in 1912,<ref name=\"ROCN\">Official gazette of Ministry of the Navy of Republic of China, July 1912, page 344, [http://twinfo.ncl.edu.tw/tiqry/hypage.cgi?HYPAGE=search/merge_pdf.hpg&sysid=E10D4656&jid=00227485&type=g&vol=01070000&page=%E9%A0%81342-353 pdf], National Central Library - Gazette Online</ref> and was made the official [[national flag]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) in 1928 by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT). It was enshrined in the sixth article of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] when it was promulgated in 1947. The flag is no longer officially used in mainland China, as the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded in 1949.

As the islands of [[island of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] were [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]] until 1945, the flag was not in use in two territories, until ROC took control in 1945. The flag is now mostly used within [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and other outlying islands, [[Free area of the Republic of China|where the ROC relocated to]] in 1949 after its defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]].

[[File:Flag of Chinese Taipei for Olympic games.svg|thumb|left|The [[Chinese Taipei flag|Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee flag]] (known in Chinese as the 'Plum Blossom Banner') is used in place of the flag of the Republic of China at the [[Olympic Games]] and in some sporting events.]]
The first national flag of Taiwan was first used in 1663 during the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] which had a plain white flag with the character \"鄭\" (''zhèng'') on the red bordered circle. The [[flag of the Qing dynasty]] was also used from 1683 until 1895 when the [[Republic of Formosa]] was declared. The Formosan flag had a tiger on a plain blue filed with azure clouds below it.

During Japanese rule of Taiwan, the [[flag of Japan]] was flown in the island from 1895 to 1945. At the same time, when the government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] was established on 1 January 1912, the \"Five-Colored Flag\" was selected by the provisional Senate as the national flag. The [[:File:Chinese-Army-Wuhan-Flag-1911-1928 dots18.svg|\"18-Star Flag\"]] was adopted by the army<ref name=\"army\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aiplus.idv.tw/soviet/FARMY.HTM |script-title=zh:中國歷代陸軍旗幟 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref> and the modern flag was adopted as a naval ensign.<ref name=\"navy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aiplus.idv.tw/soviet/FNAVY.HTM |script-title=zh:中國歷代海軍旗幟 |accessdate=2007-12-11 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref> Sun Yat-sen, however, did not consider the five-colored flag appropriate, reasoning that horizontal order implied a hierarchy or class like that which existed during dynastic times.

Following the [[Retrocession Day|transfer of Taiwan from Japan to China]] in 1945, the flag was specified in Article Six of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|1947 Constitution]]. After the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the government of Chiang Kai-shek relocated the sovereign independent country of the Republic of China (ROC) to the island of Taiwan. On the [[mainland China|mainland]], the communist forces of [[Mao Zedong]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] and adopted their own national flag. On 23 October 1954, the National Emblem and National Flag of the Republic of China Act ({{zh|t={{linktext|中華民國|國徽|國旗法}}|p=Zhōnghuá Mínguó guóhuī guóqífǎ|labels=no}}) was promulgated by the [[Legislative Yuan]] to specify the size, measure, ratio, production, and management of the flag.<ref name=\"1954law\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqf.htm |script-title=zh:中華民國國徽國旗法 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref>

===Ban in Cambodia===
While public display of the ROC flag is generally frowned upon, and may even lead to arrest in the PRC,{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Cambodia]] was the first country to outlaw it officially. In February 2017, Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] announced that the ROC flag will be banned from being displayed in [[Cambodia]] as a part of its commitment to the [[One-China policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2068888/banning-taiwans-flag-cambodia-adds-taipeis-woes-beijing|title=With flag ban, Cambodia adds to Taiwan's woes|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/hun-sen-bans-taiwan-flag-from-cambodia-124609/|title=With flag ban, Cambodia adds to Taiwan's woes|publisher=}}</ref>

== Symbolism ==
[[File:Flag of the Republic of China.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Flag of the Republic of China flying.]]

In the \"[[Blue Sky with a White Sun]]\" flag of Lu Hao-tung, unveiled in 1895 in Hawaii. The twelve rays of the white [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun]] symbolize the twelve [[month]]s and the twelve traditional ''[[Chinese units of measurement#Time|shichen]]'' ({{zh|t=時辰|p=shíchén|labels=no}}), a traditional unit of time which corresponds to two modern [[hour]]s. Sun Yat-sen added the \"Red Earth\" to the flag to signify the [[blood]] of the revolutionaries who sacrificed themselves in order to overthrow the [[Qing Dynasty]] and create the ROC. Together, the three colors of the flag correspond to the [[Three Principles of the People]]: [[Blue]] represents [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]] and liberty; [[White]] represents [[democracy]] and equality; and [[Red]] represents the people's livelihood and fraternity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.president.gov.tw/Default.aspx?tabid=441 |title=National Flag |author=Office of the President |authorlink=President of the Republic of China |year=2011 |publisher=Republic of China (Taiwan) |accessdate=7 August 2011 }}</ref> President Chiang Kai-shek proclaimed on the [[Double Ten Day|National Day]] in 1929, \"As long as a national flag with Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flies on the land of China, it symbolises the independence and liberty of the [[Yan Huang Zisun|descendants of the Huang Emperor]]\".

The blue-and-white canton of the ROC flag is often used as the party flag of the KMT. The flag has developed a great deal of additional symbolism due to the unique and controversial [[political status of Taiwan]]. At one level, the flag represents a clear symbol that Taiwan is not governed by the same government as Mainland China, as this flag is different from the [[Flag of China|flag of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC).

Meanwhile, because it was formerly used as the flag over all of China, the flag has become a symbol of continuity with the ideals of the [[Chinese nationalism]] and [[Chinese reunification]] movements, and has become a symbol of a connection both historical and current with mainland China. In addition, the flag is derived from the seal of the KMT, and the color of the field of the flag is associated with the KMT party colors.

Some Chinese see the flag as an expression of [[Chinese nationalism]] and pride combined with simultaneous disapproval for the current communist regime. Additionally, the flag may symbolize identification with, and admiration for the political thoughts of [[Sun Yat-sen]], and his [[Three Principles of the People]].

One irony is that given the association of the flag with [[Chinese nationalism]] in opposition to [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]], the ROC flag has found an unexpected ally in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The PRC has criticized Taiwan independence groups for wishing to change or abolish the ROC flag, and has implied that legal steps to do so would bring a strongly negative reaction from the PRC.

However, the presence of the ROC flag in Taiwan also distinguishes the fact that Taiwan and ROC territorial islands elsewhere fall under jurisdiction of a country separate from that of [[mainland China]], the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]]. The hoisting of the ROC flag is even advocated by the most extreme Taiwanese independence supporters, such as [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] members when emphasizing the separate and independently governed systems and territories of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] and the People's Republic of China in mainland China.

[[File:Republic of China(Taiwan) sheet.svg|thumb|National flag construction sheet.]]
The specific designs of the flag are located in the \"Law about the national flag and emblem of the Republic of China.\" The ratio of the flag is 2:3, with most of it being red. One-fourth of the flag is blue, which contains the 12 pointed sun. Each sun ray is 30 degrees, so the total sun rays will make up a complete 360 degree circle. Inside the sun, the blue ring is the diameter of the white sun divided by 15.<ref name=\"flaglaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqf.htm |script-title=zh:中華民國國徽國旗法 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref>

In later years, more specifics of the [[Flag terminology|canton]] area (also used as the flag of the KMT), were codified into law. In the drawing released in \"Law on the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Methods\" ({{lang|zh|黨旗國旗之製造及使用辦法}}), the sun was drawn in more specific detail and mathematical values were given to all elements in the flag. In the law, the canton still had a ratio of 2:3, but the math values given were 24x36 meters. The diameter of the sun with rays is {{frac|6|8}} of height of the canton, so in this case, it will be 18. The diameter of the white sun without the sun rays is {{frac|4}} of the width of the canton, so it is 9. The blue ring that is on top of this sun and part of the rays is {{frac|15}} diameter of the white sun, so the size will be 0.6. The angle of the rays, 30 degrees, and the total number of rays have not changed.<ref name=\"kmtflaglaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqfggy.htm#zzjsybf |script-title=zh:黨旗國旗之製造及使用辦法 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=2006-05-19 |language=Chinese }}</ref>

== Uses ==
In the early years of the Republic, under the [[KMT]]'s political tutelage, the flag shared the same prominence as the KMT party flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of [[Father of the Nation]] [[Sun Yat-sen]] displayed in the center. For the summits held between the KMT and [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC flag was displayed at an equal position to the flag of the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] (Jiangxi Soviet). Later, the flag law specified a horizontal display of the flag with the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in a portion of the red field at the center position. This display can be found in numerous government offices in Taiwan and is that which the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] and [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] face to take the oath of office.

The flag has a ubiquitous presence in Taiwan. The hoisting and lowering of the flag are ceremoniously accompanied by the [[National Banner Song]] while those present stand at attention to give a standard [[salute]] with the right hand, held flat, to the right eyebrow. Schoolchildren have traditionally been required to attend morning rallies where the flag is raised after a rendition of the ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]''. Before [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was lifted in 1987 in Taiwan, it was required that all vehicles be halted when passing by a flag ceremony.

The ROC flag is not commonly seen at international gatherings in which the PRC participates due to pressure from the PRC over the [[political status of Taiwan]] and resulting minimal political influence of the ROC in such circles. Instead, the ROC is usually represented under a [[pseudonym]] (usually \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\") and in the case of Olympics, it flies its own flag, the [[Chinese Taipei flag]]. This is because the IOC recognises the PRC's position that the ROC is a defunct entity and that the ROC on Taiwan is illegitimate. The ban also effectively applies to spectators&mdash;during a [[Table Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Table Tennis final]] match at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], police arrested a Taiwanese student for waving the ROC flag.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwanese spectators arrested |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=1996-09-01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/olympics/daily/tableten/aug/1/arrest.htm }}</ref>

However, the symbolism of the flag began to shift in the early 21st century{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} as there was a warming of relations between the [[pan-Blue coalition]] in Taiwan and the [[Communist Party of China]] on mainland China. The flag of the Republic of China has begun to symbolize the existence of a past and possibly future unified China, and as such the government of the PRC has made it clear that for Taiwan to change the flag would be a major provocation in favor of [[Taiwan independence]]. The ambiguity surrounding the flag was made apparent during the trip of Kuomintang Chairman [[Lien Chan]] to mainland China in April 2005, during which the flag was very prominently displayed at ceremonies honoring [[Sun Yat-Sen]] at which both KMT party officials and government officials from the PRC were in attendance. One place in Mainland China where the White Sun emblem is still prominently displayed in public is the ceiling mosaic within [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in Nanjing.

The use of the flag in Taiwan reflects the controversy behind its symbolism. Although supporters of [[Taiwan independence]], such as former President [[Chen Shui-bian]], will display and salute the flag on formal official state occasions, it is never seen at political rallies of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. This is not only because of its association with mainland China but also because the flag contains design elements of the KMT party flag. By contrast, the ROC flag is always extremely prominent at political rallies of the [[pan-Blue coalition]]. This difference extends to the colors seen at the rallies. Rallies of the pan-Blue coalition give prominence to the colors of the ROC flag, with very large amounts of blue and smaller amounts of red. Rallies of independence-leaning parties are filled with green, with no blue or red at all.

Some supporters of Taiwan independence, including former president [[Lee Teng-hui]], have called for the abandonment of the flag, and there are a number of alternate [[Proposed flags of Taiwan|designs for a specifically Taiwanese flag]]. However, the prospects for this are not high given that changing the flag requires a constitutional amendment; that the current flag has a huge amount of support among pan-Blue supporters and grudging acceptance among moderate independence supporters; and because changing the flag might cause political tension with the PRC. During the 2004 ROC legislative elections, it was briefly suggested that if the pan-green coalition won the elections that it would force the KMT to change the party emblem to be different from the flag. This proposal generated a few days of controversy and was then quickly forgotten.

The '''flag of the Republic of China''' (also known as the '''Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth''' and the '''flag of Taiwan''') consists of a red field with a blue [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|canton]] bearing a white disc with twelve triangles surrounding it. The disc and triangles symbolize the sun and rays of light emanating from it respectively.

The flag was originally designed by the anti-Qing group, [[Revive China Society]] in 1894 with the addition of the red field component in 1906 by Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] in speech.

It was first used in [[mainland China]] as the Navy flag in 1912,<ref name=\"ROCN\">Official gazette of Ministry of the Navy of Republic of China, July 1912, page 344, [http://twinfo.ncl.edu.tw/tiqry/hypage.cgi?HYPAGE=search/merge_pdf.hpg&sysid=E10D4656&jid=00227485&type=g&vol=01070000&page=%E9%A0%81342-353 pdf], National Central Library - Gazette Online</ref> and was made the official [[national flag]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) in 1928 by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT). It was enshrined in the sixth article of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] when it was promulgated in 1947. The flag is no longer officially used in mainland China, as the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded in 1949.

As the islands of [[island of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] were [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]] until 1945, the flag was not in use in two territories, until ROC took control in 1945. The flag is now mostly used within [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and other outlying islands, [[Free area of the Republic of China|where the ROC relocated to]] in 1949 after its defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]].

[[File:Flag of Chinese Taipei for Olympic games.svg|thumb|left|The [[Chinese Taipei flag|Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee flag]] (known in Chinese as the 'Plum Blossom Banner') is used in place of the flag of the Republic of China at the [[Olympic Games]] and in some sporting events.]]
The first national flag of Taiwan was first used in 1663 during the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] which had a plain white flag with the character \"鄭\" (''zhèng'') on the red bordered circle. The [[flag of the Qing dynasty]] was also used from 1683 until 1895 when the [[Republic of Formosa]] was declared. The Formosan flag had a tiger on a plain blue filed with azure clouds below it.

During Japanese rule of Taiwan, the [[flag of Japan]] was flown in the island from 1895 to 1945. At the same time, when the government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] was established on 1 January 1912, the \"Five-Colored Flag\" was selected by the provisional Senate as the national flag. The [[:File:Chinese-Army-Wuhan-Flag-1911-1928 dots18.svg|\"18-Star Flag\"]] was adopted by the army<ref name=\"army\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aiplus.idv.tw/soviet/FARMY.HTM |script-title=zh:中國歷代陸軍旗幟 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref> and the modern flag was adopted as a naval ensign.<ref name=\"navy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aiplus.idv.tw/soviet/FNAVY.HTM |script-title=zh:中國歷代海軍旗幟 |accessdate=2007-12-11 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref> Sun Yat-sen, however, did not consider the five-colored flag appropriate, reasoning that horizontal order implied a hierarchy or class like that which existed during dynastic times.

Following the [[Retrocession Day|transfer of Taiwan from Japan to China]] in 1945, the flag was specified in Article Six of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|1947 Constitution]]. After the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the government of Chiang Kai-shek relocated the sovereign independent country of the Republic of China (ROC) to the island of Taiwan. On the [[mainland China|mainland]], the communist forces of [[Mao Zedong]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] and adopted their own national flag. On 23 October 1954, the National Emblem and National Flag of the Republic of China Act ({{zh|t={{linktext|中華民國|國徽|國旗法}}|p=Zhōnghuá Mínguó guóhuī guóqífǎ|labels=no}}) was promulgated by the [[Legislative Yuan]] to specify the size, measure, ratio, production, and management of the flag.<ref name=\"1954law\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqf.htm |script-title=zh:中華民國國徽國旗法 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref>

===Ban in Cambodia===
While public display of the ROC flag is generally frowned upon, and may even lead to arrest in the PRC,{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[Cambodia]] was the first country to outlaw it officially. In February 2017, Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] announced that the ROC flag will be banned from being displayed in [[Cambodia]] as a part of its commitment to the [[One-China policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2068888/banning-taiwans-flag-cambodia-adds-taipeis-woes-beijing|title=With flag ban, Cambodia adds to Taiwan's woes|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/hun-sen-bans-taiwan-flag-from-cambodia-124609/|title=With flag ban, Cambodia adds to Taiwan's woes|publisher=}}</ref>

[[File:Flag of the Republic of China.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Flag of the Republic of China flying.]]

In the \"[[Blue Sky with a White Sun]]\" flag of Lu Hao-tung, unveiled in 1895 in Hawaii. The twelve rays of the white [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun]] symbolize the twelve [[month]]s and the twelve traditional ''[[Chinese units of measurement#Time|shichen]]'' ({{zh|t=時辰|p=shíchén|labels=no}}), a traditional unit of time which corresponds to two modern [[hour]]s. Sun Yat-sen added the \"Red Earth\" to the flag to signify the [[blood]] of the revolutionaries who sacrificed themselves in order to overthrow the [[Qing Dynasty]] and create the ROC. Together, the three colors of the flag correspond to the [[Three Principles of the People]]: [[Blue]] represents [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]] and liberty; [[White]] represents [[democracy]] and equality; and [[Red]] represents the people's livelihood and fraternity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.president.gov.tw/Default.aspx?tabid=441 |title=National Flag |author=Office of the President |authorlink=President of the Republic of China |year=2011 |publisher=Republic of China (Taiwan) |accessdate=7 August 2011 }}</ref> President Chiang Kai-shek proclaimed on the [[Double Ten Day|National Day]] in 1929, \"As long as a national flag with Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flies on the land of China, it symbolises the independence and liberty of the [[Yan Huang Zisun|descendants of the Huang Emperor]]\".

The blue-and-white canton of the ROC flag is often used as the party flag of the KMT. The flag has developed a great deal of additional symbolism due to the unique and controversial [[political status of Taiwan]]. At one level, the flag represents a clear symbol that Taiwan is not governed by the same government as Mainland China, as this flag is different from the [[Flag of China|flag of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC).

Meanwhile, because it was formerly used as the flag over all of China, the flag has become a symbol of continuity with the ideals of the [[Chinese nationalism]] and [[Chinese reunification]] movements, and has become a symbol of a connection both historical and current with mainland China. In addition, the flag is derived from the seal of the KMT, and the color of the field of the flag is associated with the KMT party colors.

Some Chinese see the flag as an expression of [[Chinese nationalism]] and pride combined with simultaneous disapproval for the current communist regime. Additionally, the flag may symbolize identification with, and admiration for the political thoughts of [[Sun Yat-sen]], and his [[Three Principles of the People]].

One irony is that given the association of the flag with [[Chinese nationalism]] in opposition to [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]], the ROC flag has found an unexpected ally in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The PRC has criticized Taiwan independence groups for wishing to change or abolish the ROC flag, and has implied that legal steps to do so would bring a strongly negative reaction from the PRC.

However, the presence of the ROC flag in Taiwan also distinguishes the fact that Taiwan and ROC territorial islands elsewhere fall under jurisdiction of a country separate from that of [[mainland China]], the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]]. The hoisting of the ROC flag is even advocated by the most extreme Taiwanese independence supporters, such as [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] members when emphasizing the separate and independently governed systems and territories of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] and the People's Republic of China in mainland China.

[[File:Flag of the Republic of China canton construction sheet.svg|thumb|Design for the canton (Chinese).]]
[[File:Republic of China(Taiwan) sheet.svg|thumb|National flag construction sheet.]]
The specific designs of the flag are located in the \"Law about the national flag and emblem of the Republic of China.\" The ratio of the flag is 2:3, with most of it being red. One-fourth of the flag is blue, which contains the 12 pointed sun. Each sun ray is 30 degrees, so the total sun rays will make up a complete 360 degree circle. Inside the sun, the blue ring is the diameter of the white sun divided by 15.<ref name=\"flaglaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqf.htm |script-title=zh:中華民國國徽國旗法 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |date=1954-10-23 |language=Chinese }}</ref>

In later years, more specifics of the [[Flag terminology|canton]] area (also used as the flag of the KMT), were codified into law. In the drawing released in \"Law on the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Methods\" ({{lang|zh|黨旗國旗之製造及使用辦法}}), the sun was drawn in more specific detail and mathematical values were given to all elements in the flag. In the law, the canton still had a ratio of 2:3, but the math values given were 24x36 meters. The diameter of the sun with rays is {{frac|6|8}} of height of the canton, so in this case, it will be 18. The diameter of the white sun without the sun rays is {{frac|4}} of the width of the canton, so it is 9. The blue ring that is on top of this sun and part of the rays is {{frac|15}} diameter of the white sun, so the size will be 0.6. The angle of the rays, 30 degrees, and the total number of rays have not changed.<ref name=\"kmtflaglaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqfggy.htm#zzjsybf |script-title=zh:黨旗國旗之製造及使用辦法 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=2006-05-19 |language=Chinese }}</ref>

The colors of the national flag are dark red, white and dark blue. The KMT party flag just uses white and dark blue and both flags are to be topped with a golden [[finial]].<ref name=\"colorlaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalflag.idv.tw/wg/gqfggy.htm#zysjbf |script-title=zh:國旗黨旗製用升降辦法 |accessdate=2008-09-19 |last=Yu-liang |first=Tai |date=2006-05-19 |language=Chinese }}</ref> The law does not list any specific color processes, such as [[Pantone]], to manufacturing or drawing the flag. Other publications, such as the ''[[Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctive]]s'', have given approximations for Pantone colors. The dark blue color is Pantone 301c <!-- c stands for coated --> and the dark red is Pantone 186c.<ref name=\"a2k\">{{cite book | last = du Payrat | first = Armand | authorlink = | title = Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctive | publisher = Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine | year = 2000 | location = France | pages = TA2.1 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref> ''Album des pavillons'' also gave the approximate [[CMYK]] colors for the flag; dark blue is 100-45-0-10 and dark red is 0-90-75-5.<ref name=\"a2k\"/>

== Uses ==
In the early years of the Republic, under the [[KMT]]'s political tutelage, the flag shared the same prominence as the KMT party flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of [[Father of the Nation]] [[Sun Yat-sen]] displayed in the center. For the summits held between the KMT and [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC flag was displayed at an equal position to the flag of the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] (Jiangxi Soviet). Later, the flag law specified a horizontal display of the flag with the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in a portion of the red field at the center position. This display can be found in numerous government offices in Taiwan and is that which the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] and [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] face to take the oath of office.

The flag has a ubiquitous presence in Taiwan. The hoisting and lowering of the flag are ceremoniously accompanied by the [[National Banner Song]] while those present stand at attention to give a standard [[salute]] with the right hand, held flat, to the right eyebrow. Schoolchildren have traditionally been required to attend morning rallies where the flag is raised after a rendition of the ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]''. Before [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was lifted in 1987 in Taiwan, it was required that all vehicles be halted when passing by a flag ceremony.

The ROC flag is not commonly seen at international gatherings in which the PRC participates due to pressure from the PRC over the [[political status of Taiwan]] and resulting minimal political influence of the ROC in such circles. Instead, the ROC is usually represented under a [[pseudonym]] (usually \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\") and in the case of Olympics, it flies its own flag, the [[Chinese Taipei flag]]. This is because the IOC recognises the PRC's position that the ROC is a defunct entity and that the ROC on Taiwan is illegitimate. The ban also effectively applies to spectators&mdash;during a [[Table Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Table Tennis final]] match at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], police arrested a Taiwanese student for waving the ROC flag.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwanese spectators arrested |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=1996-09-01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/olympics/daily/tableten/aug/1/arrest.htm }}</ref>

However, the symbolism of the flag began to shift in the early 21st century{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} as there was a warming of relations between the [[pan-Blue coalition]] in Taiwan and the [[Communist Party of China]] on mainland China. The flag of the Republic of China has begun to symbolize the existence of a past and possibly future unified China, and as such the government of the PRC has made it clear that for Taiwan to change the flag would be a major provocation in favor of [[Taiwan independence]]. The ambiguity surrounding the flag was made apparent during the trip of Kuomintang Chairman [[Lien Chan]] to mainland China in April 2005, during which the flag was very prominently displayed at ceremonies honoring [[Sun Yat-Sen]] at which both KMT party officials and government officials from the PRC were in attendance. One place in Mainland China where the White Sun emblem is still prominently displayed in public is the ceiling mosaic within [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in Nanjing.

The use of the flag in Taiwan reflects the controversy behind its symbolism. Although supporters of [[Taiwan independence]], such as former President [[Chen Shui-bian]], will display and salute the flag on formal official state occasions, it is never seen at political rallies of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. This is not only because of its association with mainland China but also because the flag contains design elements of the KMT party flag. By contrast, the ROC flag is always extremely prominent at political rallies of the [[pan-Blue coalition]]. This difference extends to the colors seen at the rallies. Rallies of the pan-Blue coalition give prominence to the colors of the ROC flag, with very large amounts of blue and smaller amounts of red. Rallies of independence-leaning parties are filled with green, with no blue or red at all.

Some supporters of Taiwan independence, including former president [[Lee Teng-hui]], have called for the abandonment of the flag, and there are a number of alternate [[Proposed flags of Taiwan|designs for a specifically Taiwanese flag]]. However, the prospects for this are not high given that changing the flag requires a constitutional amendment; that the current flag has a huge amount of support among pan-Blue supporters and grudging acceptance among moderate independence supporters; and because changing the flag might cause political tension with the PRC. During the 2004 ROC legislative elections, it was briefly suggested that if the pan-green coalition won the elections that it would force the KMT to change the party emblem to be different from the flag. This proposal generated a few days of controversy and was then quickly forgotten.

Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka.<ref name=EB>{{cite web|title=Adam's bridge |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Adams-Bridge |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2007 |accessdate=14 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113002452/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003680 |archivedate=13 January 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The bridge is {{convert|48|km|abbr=on|-1}} long and separates the [[Gulf of Mannar]] (south-west) from the [[Palk Strait]] (northeast). Some of the regions are dry and the sea in the area rarely exceeds {{convert|1|m|ft|sigfig=1}} in depth, thus hindering navigation.<ref name=\"EB\" /> It was reportedly passable on foot until the 15th century, when storms deepened the channel: temple records seem to say that Adam's Bridge was completely above sea level until it broke in a [[cyclone]] in 1480.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}<!-- apparently mentioned here https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33591636 -->

[[File:Adams bridge map.png|right|thumb|Historical map of Adam's Bridge and environs, before the cyclone of 1964]]
The bridge starts as a chain of shoals from the [[Dhanushkodi]] tip of India's [[Pamban Island]] and ends at Sri Lanka's [[Mannar Island]]. Pamban Island is semi-connected to the Indian mainland by the 2-km-long [[Pamban Bridge]]. Mannar Island is connected to mainland Sri Lanka by a causeway. The border between India and Sri Lanka is said to pass across one of the shoals, constituting one of the shortest land borders in the world. Ramasetu and neighbouring areas like [[Rameswaram]], Dhanushkodi, Devipattinam and Thirupullani are mentioned in the context of various legends in Ramayana.

[[File:Rama's bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Landsat 5 image of Adam's Bridge]]
Considerable diversity of opinion and confusion exists about the nature and origin of this structure. In the 19th century, two major theories were prominent in explaining the structure. One considered it to be formed by the process of accretion and rising of the land, while the other surmised that it was established by the breaking away of Sri Lanka from the Indian mainland.<ref name=\"Ceylon\">{{cite book|last= Tennent | first = James Emerson| authorlink=James Emerson Tennent |title = Ceylon: An Account of the Island Physical, Historical and Topographical|url= https://archive.org/details/ceylonanaccount00tenngoog | year = 1859|publisher = Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|page = [https://archive.org/details/ceylonanaccount00tenngoog/page/n57 13]|place=London}}</ref> The friable calcareous ridges later broke into large rectangular blocks, which perhaps gave rise to the belief that the causeway is an artificial construction.<ref name=\"Suess\">{{cite book |last=Suess |first=Eduard |authorlink=Eduard Suess |translator=Hertha B.

According to V.

Based on satellite remote sensing data, but without actual field verification, the Marine and Water Resources Group of the Space Application Centre (SAC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) concludes that Adam's Bridge comprises 103 small patch reefs lying in a linear pattern.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bahuguna|first=Anjali|last2=Nayak|first2=Shailesh|last3=Deshmukh|first3=Benidhar|date=1 December 2003|title=IRS views the Adams bridge (bridging India and Sri Lanka)|journal=Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=237–239|doi=10.1007/BF03007343|issn=0255-660X}}</ref> The feature consists of the reef crest (flattened, emergent, especially during low tides, or nearly emergent segment of a reef), sand cays (accumulations of loose coral sands and beach rock) and intermittent deep channels.

The geological process that gave rise to this structure has been attributed in one study to crustal down warping, block faulting, and mantle plume activity<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/17/stories/2007031713280200.htm Crustal downwarping, block faulting, and mantel plume activity view]</ref> while another theory attributes it to continuous sand deposition and the natural process of sedimentation leading to the formation of a chain of barrier islands related to rising sea levels.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another theory affirms that the origin and linearity of Adam's Bridge might be due to the old shoreline (implying that the two landmasses of India and Sri Lanka were once connected) from which shoreline coral reefs developed.

Another study attributes the origin of the structure to [[longshore drift]]ing currents which moved in an anticlockwise direction in the north and clockwise direction in the south of Rameswaram and Talaimannar. The sand could have been dumped in a linear pattern along the current shadow zone between Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar with the later accumulation of corals over these linear sand bodies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramasamy|first=S.M.|date=2003|title=Facts and myths about Adam's Bridge|url=http://14.139.186.108/jspui/bitstream/123456789/15989/1/53_Facts%20and%20Myths%20about%20Adam’s%20bridge.pdf|journal=GIS@development}}</ref> In a diametrically opposing view, another group of geologists propose a crustal thinning theory, block faulting and a ridge formed in the region owing to thinning and asserts that development of this ridge augmented the coral growth in the area and in turn coral cover acted as a 'sand trapper'.<ref name=\":0\" />

The studies under \"Project Rameswaram\" of the [[Geological Survey of India]] (GSI), which included dating of corals, indicate Rameswaram Island evolved beginning 125,000 years ago.

==Early surveys and dredging efforts==
[[File:Pearling crew 1926.JPG|thumb|Pearl fishing in the [[Gulf of Mannar]], c. 1926]]
Due to shallow waters, Adam's bridge presents a formidable hindrance to navigation through the Palk Strait. Though trade across the India-Sri Lanka divide has been active since at least the first millennium BC, it was limited to small boats and dinghies. Larger ocean-going vessels from the West have had to navigate around Sri Lanka to reach India's eastern coast.<ref name = Francis>{{cite book|last=Francis Jr.|first= Peter|title=Asia's Maritime Bead Trade: 300 B.C. to the Present| publisher = University of Hawaii Press| year = 2002| isbn=978-0-8248-2332-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzZBdGQN_TIC&pg=PA4}}</ref> Eminent British geographer [[James Rennell|Major James Rennell]], who surveyed the region as a young officer in the late 18th century, suggested that a \"navigable passage could be maintained by dredging the strait of Ramisseram {{sic}}\". However, little notice was given to his proposal, perhaps because it came from \"so young and unknown an officer\", and the idea got revived only 60 years later.

In 1823, [[Arthur Cotton|Sir Arthur Cotton]] (then an [[Ensign (rank)#United Kingdom|Ensign]]), was assigned to survey the [[Pamban channel]], which separates the Indian mainland from the island of Rameswaram and forms the first link of Adam's Bridge. Geological evidence indicates that a land connection bridged this in the past, and some temple records suggest that violent storms broke the link in 1480. Cotton suggested that the channel could be dredged to enable passage of ships, but nothing was done until 1828 when Major Sim directed the blasting and removal of some rocks.<ref name = \"Gazeteer 1886\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first= Sir William Wilson|authorlink=William Wilson Hunter|title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India| publisher = Trübner & co.| year = 1886|pages= 21–23}}</ref><ref name = \"Cotton\">{{cite book|last=Digby|first= William |authorlink=William Digby (writer) |title=General Sir Arthur Cotton, R.

The government of India constituted nine committees before independence, and five committees since then, to suggest alignments for a Sethusamudram canal project.

In 2005, the [[Government of India]] approved a multi-million dollar [[Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project]] that aims to create a ship channel across the [[Palk Strait]] by dredging the shallow ocean floor near [[Dhanushkodi]]. The channel is expected to cut over 400&nbsp;km (nearly 30 hours of shipping time) off the voyage around the island of [[Sri Lanka]]. This proposed channel's current alignment requires dredging through Adam's Bridge.

Indian political parties including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK), [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]] (RJD), [[Janata Dal (Secular)]] (JD(S)) and some [[Hindu]] organisations oppose dredging through the shoal on religious grounds. The contention is that Adam's Bridge is identified popularly as the causeway described in the [[Ramayana]]. The political parties and organizations suggest alternate alignment for the channel that avoids damage to Adam's Bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newkerala.com/oct.php?action=fullnews&id=3715|title=Ram Setu a matter of faith, needs to be protected: Lalu|work=NewKerela.com|date = 21 September 2007|accessdate=24 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&newsid=53581 |title=Rama is 'divine personality' says Gowda |work=MangaoreNews.com |date=22 September 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421223657/http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&newsid=53581 |archivedate=21 April 2008 }}</ref> The then state and central governments opposed such changes, with the Union Shipping Minister T.

==Origin legends==
[[File:The Monkeys and Bears Build a Bridge to Lanka.jpg|thumb|alt=A 19th-century painting depicting a scene from Ramayana, wherein monkeys are shown building a bridge to Lanka|A 19th-century painting depicting a scene from Ramayana, wherein monkeys are shown building a bridge to [[Lanka]].]]

Indian culture and religion includes legends that the structure is of supernatural origin.

According to the [[Hindu]] epic, [[Ramayana]], [[Ravana]], the ten-headed demon king of [[Lanka]] (Sri Lanka), enticed [[Rama]]'s wife [[Sita]] with a magical golden deer, then kidnapped her and took her to Lanka, doing this for revenge against Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] for having cut off the nose of Ravana's sister, [[Shurpanakha]].

To rescue Sita, Rama needed to cross to Lanka. [[Brahma]] created an army of [[vanara]] (intelligent warrior monkeys) to aid Rama. Led by [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] and under the engineering direction of [[Nala (Ramayana)|Nala]], the vanara constructed a bridge to Lanka in five days.

Rama crossed the sea on this bridge, and pursued Ravana for many days. He fired hundreds of golden arrows which became serpents that cut off Ravana's heads, but ultimately had to use the divine arrow of Brahma (which had the power of the gods in it and cannot miss its target) to slay Ravana.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/cult/inside/gallery/ravanadeath/ravanaheads.html |title=Ravana loses his heads |publisher=British Library |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hakai>{{cite web |url=https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/god-or-geology-genesis-rams-bridge/ |title=God or Geology?

'''Adam's Bridge''' ({{transl|ta|ātām pālam}}; [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: ''adamgay palama''), also known as '''Rama's Bridge''' or '''Rama Setu''' ({{transl|ta|Irāmar pālam}}, [[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|rāmasetu}}),<ref>also spelled  ''Ram Sethu'', ''Ramasethu''  and variants.</ref> is a chain of [[limestone]] [[shoal]]s, between [[Pamban Island]], also known as Rameswaram Island, off the south-eastern coast of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], and [[Mannar Island]], off the north-western coast of [[Sri Lanka]]. Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka.<ref name=EB>{{cite web|title=Adam's bridge |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Adams-Bridge |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2007 |accessdate=14 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113002452/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003680 |archivedate=13 January 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The bridge is {{convert|48|km|abbr=on|-1}} long and separates the [[Gulf of Mannar]] (south-west) from the [[Palk Strait]] (northeast). Some of the regions are dry and the sea in the area rarely exceeds {{convert|1|m|ft|sigfig=1}} in depth, thus hindering navigation.<ref name=\"EB\" /> It was reportedly passable on foot until the 15th century, when storms deepened the channel: temple records seem to say that Adam's Bridge was completely above sea level until it broke in a [[cyclone]] in 1480.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}<!-- apparently mentioned here https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33591636 -->

The bridge starts as a chain of shoals from the [[Dhanushkodi]] tip of India's [[Pamban Island]] and ends at Sri Lanka's [[Mannar Island]]. Pamban Island is semi-connected to the Indian mainland by the 2-km-long [[Pamban Bridge]]. Mannar Island is connected to mainland Sri Lanka by a causeway. The border between India and Sri Lanka is said to pass across one of the shoals, constituting one of the shortest land borders in the world. Ramasetu and neighbouring areas like [[Rameswaram]], Dhanushkodi, Devipattinam and Thirupullani are mentioned in the context of various legends in Ramayana.

[[File:Rama's bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Landsat 5 image of Rama's Bridge]]
Considerable diversity of opinion and confusion exists about the nature and origin of this structure. In the 19th century, two major theories were prominent in explaining the structure. One considered it to be formed by the process of accretion and rising of the land, while the other surmised that it was established by the breaking away of Sri Lanka from the Indian mainland.<ref name=\"Ceylon\">{{cite book|last= Tennent | first = James Emerson| authorlink=James Emerson Tennent |title = Ceylon: An Account of the Island Physical, Historical and Topographical|url= https://archive.org/details/ceylonanaccount00tenngoog | year = 1859|publisher = Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|page = [https://archive.org/details/ceylonanaccount00tenngoog/page/n57 13]|place=London}}</ref> The friable calcareous ridges later broke into large rectangular blocks, which perhaps gave rise to the belief that the causeway is an artificial construction.<ref name=\"Suess\">{{cite book |last=Suess |first=Eduard |authorlink=Eduard Suess |translator=Hertha B.

According to V. Ram Mohan of the Centre of Natural Hazards and Disaster Studies of the [[University of Madras]], \"reconstruction of the geological evolution of the island chain is a challenging task and has to be carried out based on circumstantial evidence\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.speakingtree.in/allslides/ram-setu-fact-or-fiction/29796|title=Ram Setu: Fact or fiction?|website=www.speakingtree.in|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref> The lack of comprehensive field studies explains many of the uncertainties regarding the nature and origin of Rama's Bridge, which mostly consists of a series of parallel ledges of sandstone and conglomerates that are hard at the surface and grow coarse and soft as they descend to sandy banks.<ref name=\":2\" />

Studies have variously described the structure as a chain of [[shoal]]s, [[coral reefs]], a ridge formed in the region owing to thinning of the earth's crust, a double [[tombolo]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption.jsp?searchpage=true&keywords=adam's%20bridge&textsearch=Go&hitsperpage=5&pageno=1&photoId=STS056-78-083 |title=Double Tombolo reference by NASA |access-date=21 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202121411/http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption.jsp?searchpage=true&keywords=adam's%20bridge&textsearch=Go&hitsperpage=5&pageno=1&photoId=STS056-78-083 |archive-date=2 December 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> a sand [[Spit (landform)|spit]], or [[barrier islands]].

Based on satellite remote sensing data, but without actual field verification, the Marine and Water Resources Group of the Space Application Centre (SAC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) concludes that Rama's Bridge comprises 103 small patch reefs lying in a linear pattern.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bahuguna|first=Anjali|last2=Nayak|first2=Shailesh|last3=Deshmukh|first3=Benidhar|date=1 December 2003|title=IRS views the Adams bridge (bridging India and Sri Lanka)|journal=Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=237–239|doi=10.1007/BF03007343|issn=0255-660X}}</ref> The feature consists of the reef crest (flattened, emergent, especially during low tides, or nearly emergent segment of a reef), sand cays (accumulations of loose coral sands and beach rock) and intermittent deep channels.

The geological process that gave rise to this structure has been attributed in one study to crustal down warping, block faulting, and mantle plume activity<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/17/stories/2007031713280200.htm Crustal downwarping, block faulting, and mantel plume activity view]</ref> while another theory attributes it to continuous sand deposition and the natural process of sedimentation leading to the formation of a chain of barrier islands related to rising sea levels.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another theory affirms that the origin and linearity of Rama's Bridge might be due to the old shoreline (implying that the two landmasses of India and Sri Lanka were once connected) from which shoreline coral reefs developed.

Another study attributes the origin of the structure to [[longshore drift]]ing currents which moved in an anticlockwise direction in the north and clockwise direction in the south of Rameswaram and Talaimannar. The sand could have been dumped in a linear pattern along the current shadow zone between Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar with the later accumulation of corals over these linear sand bodies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramasamy|first=S.M.|date=2003|title=Facts and myths about Adam's Bridge|url=http://14.139.186.108/jspui/bitstream/123456789/15989/1/53_Facts%20and%20Myths%20about%20Adam’s%20bridge.pdf|journal=GIS@development}}</ref> In a diametrically opposing view, another group of geologists propose a crustal thinning theory, block faulting and a ridge formed in the region owing to thinning and asserts that development of this ridge augmented the coral growth in the area and in turn coral cover acted as a 'sand trapper'.<ref name=\":0\" />

The tombolo model affirms a constant sediment source and a high unidirectional or bi-directional (monsoonal) longshore current.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} One study tentatively concludes that there is insufficient evidence to indicate eustatic emergence and that the raised reef in southern India probably results from a local uplift.<ref name=\"sto\">{{cite journal|title=Raised Reefs of Ramanathapuram, South India|author1=D.

===Age===
The studies under \"Project Rameswaram\" of the [[Geological Survey of India]] (GSI), which included dating of corals, indicate Rameswaram Island evolved beginning 125,000 years ago. Radiocarbon dating of samples in this study suggests the domain between Rameswaram and Talaimannar may have been exposed sometime between 7,000 and 18,000 years ago.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Thermoluminescence dating]] by GSI concludes that the sand dunes between Dhanushkodi and Rama's Bridge started forming about 500–600 years ago.<ref name=\":0\" />

Another study suggests that the appearance of the reefs and other evidence indicate their recency, and a coral sample gives a radiocarbon age of 4,020±160 years [[Before Present|BP.]]<ref name=\":0\" />

==Early surveys and dredging efforts==
[[File:Pearling crew 1926.JPG|thumb|Pearl fishing in the [[Gulf of Mannar]], c. 1926]]
Due to shallow waters, Rama's bridge presents a formidable hindrance to navigation through the Palk Strait. Though trade across the India-Sri Lanka divide has been active since at least the first millennium BC, it was limited to small boats and dinghies. Larger ocean-going vessels from the West have had to navigate around Sri Lanka to reach India's eastern coast.<ref name = Francis>{{cite book|last=Francis Jr.|first= Peter|title=Asia's Maritime Bead Trade: 300 B.C. to the Present| publisher = University of Hawaii Press| year = 2002| isbn=978-0-8248-2332-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzZBdGQN_TIC&pg=PA4}}</ref> Eminent British geographer [[James Rennell|Major James Rennell]], who surveyed the region as a young officer in the late 18th century, suggested that a \"navigable passage could be maintained by dredging the strait of Ramisseram {{sic}}\". However, little notice was given to his proposal, perhaps because it came from \"so young and unknown an officer\", and the idea got revived only 60 years later.

In 1823, [[Arthur Cotton|Sir Arthur Cotton]] (then an [[Ensign (rank)#United Kingdom|Ensign]]), was assigned to survey the [[Pamban channel]], which separates the Indian mainland from the island of Rameswaram and forms the first link of Rama's Bridge. Geological evidence indicates that a land connection bridged this in the past, and some temple records suggest that violent storms broke the link in 1480. Cotton suggested that the channel could be dredged to enable passage of ships, but nothing was done until 1828 when Major Sim directed the blasting and removal of some rocks.<ref name = \"Gazeteer 1886\">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first= Sir William Wilson|authorlink=William Wilson Hunter|title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India| publisher = Trübner & co.| year = 1886|pages= 21–23}}</ref><ref name = \"Cotton\">{{cite book|last=Digby|first= William |authorlink=William Digby (writer) |title=General Sir Arthur Cotton, R.

A more detailed marine survey of Rama's Bridge was undertaken in 1837 by Lieutenants F. T.

[[File:Alternative Alignments.png|thumb|left|300px|Opposition parties demanded implementation of the Sethusamudram canal project using one of the five alternative alignments considered earlier by the Government, without damaging the structure of Rama's Bridge.]]

The government of India constituted nine committees before independence, and five committees since then, to suggest alignments for a Sethusamudram canal project. Most of them suggested land-based passages across Rameswaram island, and none recommended alignment across Rama's Bridge.<ref>[http://sethusamudram.gov.in/History.asp Sethusamudram Corporation Limited–History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014012322/http://sethusamudram.gov.in/History.asp |date=14 October 2007 }}</ref> The Sethusamudram project committee in 1956 also strongly recommended to the Union government to use land passages instead of cutting Rama's Bridge because of the several advantages of land passage.<ref>{{cite news| title= Use land based channel and do not cut through Adam bridge:Sethu samudram project committee report to Union Government| url= http://www.india-forum.com/articles/10327/1/Rama-Setu-and-setusamudram-channel-conspiracy| date= 30 September 2007| accessdate= 15 October 2007| quote= \"\"In these circumstances we have no doubt, whatever that the junction between the two sea should be effected by a Canal; and the idea of cutting a passage in the sea through Adam's Bridge should be abandoned.\"| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013125126/http://www.india-forum.com/articles/10327/1/Rama-Setu-and-setusamudram-channel-conspiracy| archivedate= 13 October 2007| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}</ref>

In 2005, the [[Government of India]] approved a multi-million dollar [[Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project]] that aims to create a ship channel across the [[Palk Strait]] by dredging the shallow ocean floor near [[Dhanushkodi]]. The channel is expected to cut over 400&nbsp;km (nearly 30 hours of shipping time) off the voyage around the island of [[Sri Lanka]]. This proposed channel's current alignment requires dredging through Adam's Bridge.

Indian political parties including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK), [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]] (RJD), [[Janata Dal (Secular)]] (JD(S)) and some [[Hindu]] organisations oppose dredging through the shoal on religious grounds. The contention is that Rama's Bridge is identified popularly as the causeway described in the [[Ramayana]].

==Origin legends==
[[File:The Monkeys and Bears Build a Bridge to Lanka.jpg|thumb|alt=A 19th-century painting depicting a scene from Ramayana, wherein monkeys are shown building a bridge to Lanka|A 19th-century painting depicting a scene from Ramayana, wherein monkeys are shown building a bridge to [[Lanka]].]]

Indian culture and religion includes legends that the structure is of supernatural origin.

According to the [[Hindu]] epic, [[Ramayana]], [[Ravana]], the ten-headed demon king of [[Lanka]] (Sri Lanka), enticed [[Rama]]'s wife [[Sita]] with a magical golden deer, then kidnapped her and took her to Lanka, doing this for revenge against Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] for having cut off the nose of Ravana's sister, [[Shurpanakha]].

To rescue Sita, Rama needed to cross to Lanka. [[Brahma]] created an army of [[vanara]] (intelligent warrior monkeys) to aid Rama. Led by [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] and under the engineering direction of [[Nala (Ramayana)|Nala]], the vanara constructed a bridge to Lanka in five days.

Rama crossed the sea on this bridge, and pursued Ravana for many days. He fired hundreds of golden arrows which became serpents that cut off Ravana's heads, but ultimately had to use the divine arrow of Brahma (which had the power of the gods in it and cannot miss its target) to slay Ravana.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/cult/inside/gallery/ravanadeath/ravanaheads.html |title=Ravana loses his heads |publisher=British Library |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hakai>{{cite web |url=https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/god-or-geology-genesis-rams-bridge/ |title=God or Geology?

===Revisionist movement===
In recent times, some groups have attempted to recast this religious legend as a historical event, with Rama's Bridge being the remains of the bridge built for Rama by the vanara, rather than having been created by natural processes. These groups include [[Tamil nationalism|Tamil nationalists]],{{Cref2|Note 1}} [[Hindu fundamentalist]]s, and [[Infotainment]] providers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |date=2008 |title=Hindu Nationalism and the (Not So Easy) Art of Being Outraged: The Ram Setu Controversy |url=https://journals.openedition.org/samaj/1372 |journal=SAMAJ (South Asia Multidisciplinary Academic Journal |issue=2 ('Outraged Communities': Comparative Perspectives on the Politicization of Emotions in South Asia) |editor=Amélie Blom and Nicolas Jaoul |doi= 10.4000/samaj.1372|access-date=15 April 2019|doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[Bharathidasan University]] was founded in 1982 in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]] and named after [[Bharathidasan]], a Tamil poet, social reformer, and political philosopher associated with the [[Dravidian movement]], the [[Pure Tamil]] movement, and the resurgence of Tamil cultural identity generally.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-bharathidasan-prolific-poet-and-dravidian-politics-rhetorical-memory-34844 |title=Remembering Bharathidasan: Prolific poet and Dravidian politics' rhetorical memory |author=Raman N.

S. Badrinarayanan, a former director of the [[Geological Survey of India]], said that it is impossible for Rama's Bridge to be a natural formation, because of the presence of a loose sand layer under corals for the entire stretch. Coral typically forms above rocks.<ref name = INT>{{cite news|title = Debate shifted over Ram from Ram Sethu| url = http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/896| publisher = indianewstrack.com| date = 15 September 2007|accessdate = 18 September 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Rediff\">[http://specials.rediff.com/news/2007/jul/31slid3.htm Ram sethu should be manmade says former Geological survey of India director]</ref> He suggests that a thorough analysis was not conducted by the Geological Survey of India before undertaking the SSCP project.

The [[Science Channel]] had broadcast an episode in the series ''What on Earth?,'' which included a few minutes on Rama's Bridge and claimed that the ancient Hindu myth of Lord Ram building the structure could be true. [[Deutsche Welle]] rejected the conclusions noting that no actual evidence is offered beyond vague speculation, false implications, and the point that – as with many geological formations – not every detail of its formation has been incontrovertibly settled.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dw.com/en/a-bridge-that-lord-ram-built-myth-or-reality/a-41797300 |title=A bridge that Lord Ram built - myth or reality? |work=DW |publisher=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref> Indian Geologist [[C.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Born in [[Azul, Buenos Aires Province]], Almeyda started playing professionally for local and national powerhouse [[Club Atlético River Plate]], first as understudy to [[Leonardo Astrada]] then as a starter, helping the side to the 1996 [[Argentine Primera División|Primera División]] title after his insertion in the starting XI, as well as [[1996 Copa Libertadores|that year]]'s [[Copa Libertadores]]. Shortly after, he moved to [[Sevilla FC]] in Spain for a record fee for a player in the country of [[United States dollar|$]]9 million;<ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1996/08/31/deportes/841442407_850215.html|title=El Sevilla paga 1. 160 millones por Almeyda, fichaje récord del fútbol argentino|trans-title=Sevilla pay 1. 160 million for Almeyda, Argentine football record signing|newspaper=[[El País]]|last=Ares|first=Carlos|language=Spanish|date=31 August 1996|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref> he appeared regularly in [[1996–97 La Liga|his first and only season]] with the [[Andalusia]]ns, but suffered [[La Liga]] relegation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sevilla.abc.es/deportes/orgullodenervion/noticias/la-entrevista-de-roberto-arrocha/almeyda-cuando-salcancha-ogente-decia-d-estaba-verdadero-almeyda.html|title=Almeyda: \"Cuando salía a la cancha oía cómo la gente decía que dónde estaba el verdadero Almeyda\"|trans-title=Almeyda: «When I took the pitch I heard people wondering where the real Almeyda was»|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|language=Spanish|date=9 July 2007|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>

In the following eight years, Almeyda would play in the Italian [[Serie A]], successively representing [[S.S. Lazio]], [[Parma F.C.|A.C. Parma]] and [[Inter Milan]]. He spent three seasons in [[Rome]] with Lazio, becoming a firm fan favourite especially after scoring a 35-yard goal against Parma's [[Gianluigi Buffon]], his only of the [[1999–2000 Serie A|1999–2000 campaign]], which ended with league and [[Coppa Italia]] [[1999–2000 Coppa Italia|conquest]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://parma.repubblica.it/sport/2010/02/12/news/ricordi_e_gol_di_parma_lazio-2628597/|title=Ricordi e gol di Parma Lazio|trans-title=Memories and goals of Parma Lazio|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|language=Italian|date=12 February 2010|accessdate=5 November 2017}}</ref> additionally, he was voted the competition's best player in [[1998–99 Serie A|1998–99]], and also won – as a starter – [[1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|the last]] [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], against [[RCD Mallorca]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/argentina/squad/newsid_2002000/2002468.stm|title=Matias Almeyda|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=22 May 2002|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> and was often partnered with compatriot [[Juan Sebastián Verón]] in the heart of midfield by manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] in his [[Formation (association football)|4–4–2 formation]], with Verón providing the creativity and Almeyda the strength.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/1999/ottobre/17/Una_Lazio_mostruosa_ga_0_9910173640.shtml|title=Una Lazio mostruosa|trans-title=Monster Lazio|newspaper=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]|last=Condò|first=Paolo|language=Italian|date=17 October 1999|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2015/mar/30/sven-goran-eriksson-lazio-serie-a-1999-2000-mancini-milan|title=How Sven-Goran Eriksson’s Lazio won the great Serie A title race of 1999–2000|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|last=Newman|first=Blair|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>

In the summer of 2002, Almeyda was exchanged with [[Vratislav Greško]] and moved to Inter, where he was again partnered by compatriots as in his previous clubs. Two years later he joined his final team in Italy, lowly [[Brescia Calcio]], on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=218823.html|title=Brescia boosted by Almeyda|publisher=UEFA|date=24 August 2004|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref> the following year, after [[2004–05 Serie A|the team's relegation, as second from bottom]], he returned to Argentina and agreed to play for [[Quilmes Atlético Club]], which [[2005 Copa Libertadores|appeared at the Libertadores]], announcing his retirement after their elimination from that tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/claro-mx/futbol/guadalajara/2017/05/29/592c1423e2704e19408b461f.html|title=10 cosas que tal vez no sabías de 'El Pelado' Almeyda|trans-title=10 things you maybe did not know about 'El Pelado' Almeyda|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|last=Torres|first=Fabián|language=Spanish|date=29 May 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>

After one-and-a-half years away from football, in which he represented Argentina in a ''Showball'' tour around the world alongside [[Diego Maradona]] and participated in the Indoor Football World Cup in Spain, Almeyda joined [[Tippeligaen|Norwegian Premier League]] side [[FK Lyn]] in [[Oslo]], in which he was accompanied by compatriot [[José Oscar Flores]]. Their friend [[Terje Liverod]] was central in these transfers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2007/03/26/futbol/1174923284.html|title=Almeyda y el 'Turu' Flores regresan al fútbol en la Liga noruega|trans-title=Almeyda and ''Turu'' Flores return to football in the Norwegian League|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The midfielder made his debut on 13 May 2007, but only played regularly in the reserves and in the [[Norwegian Football Cup|domestic Cup]], being released as the [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] shortly after and again retiring from football.

On 16 January 2009, at almost 36, Almeyda, after nearly agreeing on a return to River, signed with modest [[Club Atlético Fénix]] in the [[Primera C|fourth division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.derf.com.ar/despachos.asp?cod_des=243236&ID_Seccion=31|title=Almeyda: de refuerzo de River a la Primera C|trans-title=Almeyda: from River signing to ''Primera C''|publisher=DERF|language=Spanish|date=16 January 2009|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> During his brief spell, he managed to be [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] on two occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/news/newsid=1173005.html#fine+form+favoured+targets|title=Fine form and favoured targets|publisher=FIFA|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

==Style of play==
A tenacious, dynamic and physically strong player in spite of his diminutive stature, Almeyda excelled in a midfield holding role due to his stamina, tactical awareness, reactions, anticipation and work rate, as well as his ability to press opponents and break down opposition plays which allowed him to protect his team's back-line. Although he earned a reputation in the media as a hard tackler, he was gifted with good feet and passing ability, which enabled him to start attacking plays after winning back possession; he also stood out for his leadership throughout his career.<ref name=TRECCANI/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmain.it/2014/01/28/il-lider-massimo-i-18-anni-del-petroliere-8-200203/|title=Il lìder massimo: i 18 anni del Petroliere #8 (2002/03)|trans-title=Top leader: the 18th anniversary of Petroliere #8 (2002/03)|publisher=Sport Main|last=Ghio|first=Nicola|language=Italian|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/talent_scout/2013/03/29-314778/Erbes,+corsa+e+pressing%3A+ecco+un+altro+Almeyda|title=Erbes, corsa e pressing: ecco un altro Almeyda|trans-title=Erbes, stamina and pressing: here is another Almeyda|newspaper=[[Corriere dello Sport – Stadio|Corriere dello Sport]]|last=Chioffi|first=Stefano|language=Italian|date=29 March 2013|accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio_Estero/Primo_Piano/26-09-2012/vita-indio-almeyda-alcol-mafia-depressione--912726770571.shtml|title=La vita dell'Indio Almeyda tra alcol e depressione|trans-title=The life of Almeyda the Indian among alcohol and depression|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|last=Mazur|first=Martin|language=Italian|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://temi.repubblica.it/repubblicaparma-speciale-promozione-parma/2009/05/04/alfabeto-gialloblu/|title=Alfabeto gialloblù|trans-title=Yellow and blue alphabet|newspaper=La Repubblica|last=Bertoncini|first=Antonio|language=Italian|date=4 May 2009|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2000/marzo/29/Almeyda_rimasto_Roma_tornato_capitan_ga_0_00032913142.shtml|title=Almeyda è rimasto a Roma: è tornato capitan Uncino|trans-title=Almeyda has stayed in Rome: captain Hook has returned|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|last1=Piccioni|first1=Valerio|last2=Imparato|first2=Gaetano|language=Italian|date=29 March 2000|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1997/09/20/almeyda-trattorino-di-baires.html|title=Almeyda, 'Trattorino' di Baires|trans-title=Almeyda, the \"Little Tractor\" from Baires|newspaper=La Repubblica|last=Galdi|first=Andrea|language=Italian|date=20 September 1997|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>

==History==
Carter and Barthel have been friends since preschool. In the summer of 2007, Barthel returned home dissatisfied with pursuing a [[visual arts]] degree at [[Champlain College]] in Vermont, and Carter returned home after a brief stint in [[New York City]] with Grand Habit, an experimental band formed with his older brother, John. The two friends reunited and worked on finishing some of Carter's earlier songwriting ideas, then finally formed the band.<ref name=\"reverb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heyreverb.com/2010/05/07/the-reverb-interview-phantogram/|title=The Reverb Interview: Phantogram|last=Wenzel|first=John|date=May 7, 2010|publisher=The Reverb|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alarmpress.com/17981/features/music-interview/phantogram-dream-pop-duo-unifies-its-vision |title=Phantogram: Dream-Pop Duo Unifies Its Vision |last=Swanson |first=Charlie |date=November 5, 2010 |publisher=ALARM Press |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107223220/http://alarmpress.com/17981/features/music-interview/phantogram-dream-pop-duo-unifies-its-vision/ |archivedate=November 7, 2011 }}</ref> They played some live shows, but decided to focus the bulk of their energies on making records.

The duo was originally called Charlie Everywhere and used that name to perform around the [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] area and to release two [[extended play|EP]]s on local label Sub-Bombin Records.<ref name=reverb /> Upon signing with UK label [[Barely Breaking Even]] on January 26, 2009, they changed their name to Phantogram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/phantogram/blog/466576539|title=We are now signed to BBE records!!!|last=Phantogram|date=January 26, 2009|publisher=MySpace|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://shyannessongs.wordpress.com/interviews/phantogram-interview|title=Phantogram Interview|publisher=Shy Anne's Songs|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Furfaro |first=Danielle |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/localarts/charlie-everywhere-becomes-a-phantom/1609/ |title=Charlie Everywhere becomes a phantom - Arts Talk |website=Blog.timesunion.com |date=January 26, 2009 |accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref> Carter suggested the name Phantogram when the band wanted to switch from Charlie Everywhere to \"something [they] liked\". Upon looking up [[phantogram]], they found that it referred to an [[optical illusion]] in which two-dimensional images appear to be [[three-dimensional]], and noted parallels between this meaning and their band and music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skidmoresec.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/interview-phantogram|title=Interview: Phantogram|last=Dafoe|first=Taylor|author2=Drew Litowitz|date=November 19, 2010|publisher=Skidmore SEC|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref>

==History==
Carter and Barthel have been friends since preschool. In the summer of 2007, Barthel returned home dissatisfied with pursuing a [[visual arts]] degree at [[Champlain College]] in Vermont, and Carter returned home after a brief stint in [[New York City]] with Grand Habit, an experimental band formed with his older brother, John. The two friends reunited and worked on finishing some of Carter's earlier songwriting ideas, then finally formed the band.<ref name=\"reverb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heyreverb.com/2010/05/07/the-reverb-interview-phantogram/|title=The Reverb Interview: Phantogram|last=Wenzel|first=John|date=May 7, 2010|publisher=The Reverb|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alarmpress.com/17981/features/music-interview/phantogram-dream-pop-duo-unifies-its-vision |title=Phantogram: Dream-Pop Duo Unifies Its Vision |last=Swanson |first=Charlie |date=November 5, 2010 |publisher=ALARM Press |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107223220/http://alarmpress.com/17981/features/music-interview/phantogram-dream-pop-duo-unifies-its-vision/ |archivedate=November 7, 2011 }}</ref> They played some live shows, but decided to focus the bulk of their energies on making records.

The duo was originally called Charlie Everywhere and used that name to perform around the [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] area and to release two [[extended play|EP]]s on local label Sub-Bombin Records.<ref name=reverb /> Upon signing with UK label [[Barely Breaking Even]] on January 26, 2009, they changed their name to Phantogram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/phantogram/blog/466576539|title=We are now signed to BBE records!!!|last=Phantogram|date=January 26, 2009|publisher=MySpace|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://shyannessongs.wordpress.com/interviews/phantogram-interview|title=Phantogram Interview|publisher=Shy Anne's Songs|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Furfaro |first=Danielle |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/localarts/charlie-everywhere-becomes-a-phantom/1609/ |title=Charlie Everywhere becomes a phantom - Arts Talk |website=Blog.timesunion.com |date=January 26, 2009 |accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref> Carter suggested the name Phantogram when the band wanted to switch from Charlie Everywhere to \"something [they] liked\". Upon looking up [[phantogram]], they found that it referred to an [[optical illusion]] in which two-dimensional images appear to be [[three-dimensional]], and noted parallels between this meaning and their band and music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skidmoresec.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/interview-phantogram|title=Interview: Phantogram|last=Dafoe|first=Taylor|author2=Drew Litowitz|date=November 19, 2010|publisher=Skidmore SEC|accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref>

Phantogram's eponymous debut EP was self-released on the CE Records label on May 12, 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=160301158&blogId=488526213|title=May 12th!!! |author=Phantogram |publisher=[[MySpace]]|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> followed in the same year by another EP, ''Running From the Cops'', issued on BBE.

Phantogram is now signed to Barsuk Records!!! |author=Phantogram |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=October 13, 2009}}</ref> after encouragement from Erich Cannon of Portland's Spectre Entertainment, who contacted them after he heard songs on their [[MySpace]] page. \"We were going to write the record, finish it, and release it as a demo for upstate,\" explained Barthel. \"Then our plan was to move down to New York [City] to do the whole networking and meeting people kind of stuff. And we kind of skipped that whole thing, just because of the internet.\"<ref>{{cite web|title = Coming in from the Cold|url = http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/coming-in-from-the-cold/Content?oid=2917398|website = Portland Mercury|accessdate = October 20, 2015}}</ref>

Phantogram released their debut album, ''[[Eyelid Movies]]'', on September 15, 2009 on BBE (Europe) and Indica Records (Canada), and on February 9, 2010 on Barsuk (US).

The band's second studio album, ''[[Voices (Phantogram album)|Voices]]'', was released on February 18, 2014 by Barsuk/Republic.

The same year, Phantogram collaborated with Big Boi again, resulting in the seven-song EP ''[[Big Grams]]'', released on September 25, 2015 by [[Epic Records]]. The EP featured production work from Big Boi, Phantogram, [[9th Wonder]] and [[Skrillex]]. Barthel also guest appeared on the [[Miley Cyrus]] song \"Slab of Butter (Scorpion)\" from her album ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]''.

→‎History:average,safe,Peipsi-Pihkva,"'''Eastern European people''' are a pan-ethnic group, or multi-ethnic regional grouping, and the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]]. '''East''' or '''Eastern Europeans''' can usually trace back full or partial heritage to [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[European Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other nations bordering with or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the region.

Mainly comprised of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicities, in its strictest geographical terms [[Moldova]] is the sole majority-Romance ethnic nation in the region; with significant numbers of [[Moldovans in Ukraine|Moldovans]] and [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanians]] also native to other areas of Eastern Europe, such as in the [[Western Ukrainian]] borderland province [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and parts of Russia.

There are also many descriptions of Eastern Europeans which include ancestry from nations in [[Central Europe]], and countries of the [[South Slavs]], particularly in diasporic identification. There is a large Eastern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in North America ([[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians|Canadians]]), as well as Oceania ([[Eastern European Australians]]).

==Background==
Eastern Europeans have been discussed academically, researched and reported on as a pan-ethnic group, which is most usually based on full or partial ancestry to Eastern Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cee-communism/closed-borders-no-shops-been-there-done-that-say-east-europeans-idUSKBN21E2KO |title=Closed borders, no shops? Been there, done that, say east Europeans|author1=Michael Kahn|author2=Joanna Plucinska|date=March 27, 2020|publisher=[[Reuters]]|quote=Eastern Europeans with strong memories of authoritarian [[Communist]] rule have taken a “been there, done that” attitude to the restrictions on free movement and shortages of some basic goods caused by the [[coronavirus pandemic]].}}</ref> Historian [[Andrew Wilson (historian)|Andrew Wilson]], who specializes in the region, has defined East Europeans as the [[East Slavs]]; [[Russians]], Belarusians, [[Ukrainians]], and separately; [[Moldovans]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Stephen White|editor2=Judy Batt|editor3=Paul G.

Although this definition is accurate and specific, it does represents the pan-ethnic grouping in the strictest geographical terms, and is frequently not adhered to in the international identification of and referencing to Eastern Europeans. The classification is extended, at times, to people from bordering and nearby areas, such as Central and [[Southeastern Europe]], which occurs most frequently from Anglo-centric and English-speaking perspectives, as well as in reference to diaspora populations.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Aloysius Balawyder|title=In the Clutches of the Kremlin – Canadian–East European Relations 1945–1962|date=2000|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=978-0880334440|chapter=|page=66|quote=Eastern European Canadians constitute an important base for Canadian domestic and foreign policies.

Russia's richest one percent earned 3.5 percent of national income (by 2019, this had risen to 27 percent).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/30/young-lefty-eastern-europe-socialism |title=Why it’s not easy being a young lefty in eastern Europe  |authorlink=|author=Paula Erizanu|date=October 30, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Since the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], despite the fact that eastern European states have became wealthier, the poor in these states have become poorer and the rich richer. In the 1980s, the total earnings of the poorer half of east Europeans was equivalent to 25-35% of national income. Since the end of communism, this figure has dropped to 17% in some countries. The most unequal country in the region is Russia, where the richest 1% now earns 27% of national income – a dramatic increase from 3.5% before the fall of the iron curtain.}}</ref>

In 1989, historian [[Thaddeus Gromada]] claimed that non-Russian Eastern European people generally had more affinity with Western European culture than Russian culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thaddeus Gromada|authorlink1=Thaddeus V.

During the economic reforms of the 1990s, as the region partially fell away from the economic sphere of Russia, Eastern Europeans suffered financially with, at first, growing costs and less disposable income.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Counts|title=Effects of Eastern European Reforms on World Trade in Forest Products|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|quote=The Eastern European people were faced with the dual problem of having less money to spend while at the same time facing increasingly high prices on virtually all goods and services.}}</ref> In the 21st-century, the process of [[EU enlargement]] has occasionally exposed cultural differences in between Western and Eastern Europeans, with the Soviet history of the region influencing the latter's political worldviews.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dieter Gosewinkel|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|date=2014|page=157|isbn=978-1782384250|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|quote=However, the [[EU enlargement|European enlargement]] process since the end of the [[Cold War]] has brought to the surface significant differences in opinions concerning the future of the union between so-called Old and New Europe.

In 2019, a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that between 58 and 65 percent of Eastern Europeans felt positively about [[living standards]], education and [[national pride]] in the post-Communist era.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=30 years after communism, eastern Europe divided on democracy's impact |authorlink=|author=Jon Henley|date=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Asked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%).

In 2020, it was reported how the [[European Union]]'s policy of free movement had enabled or encouraged millions of Eastern Europeans to return home from Germany, and other large European economies, after job losses created by the [[coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=After coronavirus: how will Europe rebuild? |authorlink=|author=Katherine Butler|date=12 April 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=If Germany’s success in handling the pandemic is partly down to an army of migrant doctors and nurses, it should not be to the detriment of central and eastern Europe.

==Academic research==
A 2013 study at [[Bucharest University]] proposed how a culture where Eastern European people seem under interrogation, for all political and cultural decisions taken by them, has developed due to the cultural conflict caused by public transition from communism to democracy.<ref>{{cite study|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Bojan Todosijevic|author3=Guido Boella|title=Political Attitudes and Mentalities.

In a 2018 [[Feminist Media Studies]] journal piece, [[University of Vienna]] Research Fellow Katharina Wiedlack criticized Western cultural perceptions, which she argued can frame Eastern Europeans as unthinking, unoriginal or possessing lower morality.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Katharina Wiedlack|title=In/visibly different: Melania Trump and the othering of Eastern European women in US culture|date=2017|page=179|isbn=978-0748624164|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|quote=The view on Eastern European people as unable to produce original thinking, and accordingly stealing from their Western peers, does not only confirm their questionable morals and character, it also confirms the superiority of Western (here US) thinking, culture, and being.}}</ref> A 2019 [[Roskilde University]] study was critical of discriminatory Danish media representations of Eastern European people, which it described as portraying them as a racially inferior working-class, prone to criminality, who's 'otherness' was to be subsumed by integration into a \"Danish '[[whiteness studies|whiteness]]'\".<ref>{{cite study|author1=Agnieszka Feliksik|author2=Valeriia Karamysheva|author3=Irina Fedorova|title=The Representation of Eastern Europeans in Danish Media|date=1989|page=43|publisher=[[Roskilde University]]|quote=They are presented as an ‘inferior race’ consisting of ‘cheap labor’ and criminals, who ‘invade’ Denmark and cause economical and security problems for Danish population.

The integration of Eastern Europeans is considered as converting them to Danish ‘whiteness’}}</ref>

==Diaspora==
Large numbers of Eastern Europeans have emigrated from the region between the 18th and 21st centuries, driven by many factors, including wars, discrimination and opportunity. Significant proportions of such people, and their descendents, constitute the modern populations of [[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians]] in the North American continent, and [[Eastern European Australians]] in Oceania.

===Europe===
Since the opening up of [[EU accession]] in the early 21st-century, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to other parts of Europe, especially to Central, Western, and Northern Europe; gaining access to the job markets of large economies in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in particular.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\" />

[[Russell Deacon]] has written of the tension created in the mid-2000s, from Eastern Europeans emigrating to [[Welsh-speaking]] areas of Wales, with pressure group [[Cymuned]] lobbying the Welsh government to prioritize housing for locals, as a reactionary response.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Russell Deacon|author2=Alan Sandry|authorlink1=Russell Deacon|title=Devolution in the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland|date=2007|page=179|isbn=978-0748624164|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|quote=The problem of solely English-speaking or Eastern European people moving into predominantly Welsh-speaking areas has at times been a sensitive political issue.

By 2014, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' society-piece by [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]], outlined multiple years of apparent social problems created by large numbers of immigrants from Eastern Europe (and its bordering regions) which included reports of mafias, intra-ethnic conflicts, murders, as well as positive elements such as the revival of town centres.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/16/fear-anger-wisbech-cambridgeshire-insecurity-immigration |title=Fear and anger in once-wealthy town divided by insecurity and immigration |authorlink=|author=John Harris|date=16 June 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> In 2015, most Eastern Europeans living in [[Suffolk]] were young working-age adults.<ref>{{Cite article|url=https://www.healthysuffolk.org.uk/uploads/Migrants_from_Eastern_Europe_.pdf |title=Health and Wellbeing Suffolk: Joint Strategic Needs Assessment - Migrants from Eastern Europe|date=1 July 2015|publisher=[[Suffolk County Council]]|quote=

===North America===
====19th-century====
Eastern Europeans arrived in large numbers to the United States during the 1880s and 1890s, settling in industry towns and cities, such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohiodigitalnetwork.org/historic-ethnic-groups-in-ohio/|title=Historic Ethnic Groups in Ohio|publisher=[[State Library of Ohio]]|quote=[[Cleveland, Ohio]], likewise, saw many Eastern Europeans choosing its city as their new home. While thousands of [[Germans]] often chose rural areas throughout Ohio as their new residence, they also settled in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. In fact, at the beginning of the 20th century, at least 50 percent of Cleveland residents were German. Over 75 percent of Cleveland’s population was foreign born by 1900.}}</ref> Implications of the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' in 1914, which authorized the designation of \"aliens of enemy nationality\", included Eastern European Canadians born or resident in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Martin Louis Kovacs|title=Ethnic Canadians: Culture and Education|date=1978|publisher=[[University of Regina]]|isbn=978-0889770096|chapter=Volume 8|page=132|quote=The conflict between clashing loyalties for the Ukrainian and some other Central Eastern European Canadians was exacerbated by the war measures.}}</ref> Continuing into the 1920s, Eastern European Canadians faced persecution, along with [[African Canadians]], during economic recession and post-[[World War I]] unrest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sarah-Jane Mathieu|title=North of the Color Line: Migration and Black Resistance in Canada, 1870–1955|date=2010|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|isbn=978-0807834299|chapter=Fighting the Empire|page=114|quote=Throughout the 1920s, eastern European Canadians, like [[African Canadians]], became the country's convenient scapegoats for postwar labor unrest, peacetime economic recession, and urban demise.}}</ref> In the US from 1900 (until the [[Hart–Celler Act]] of 1965 ended it), the majority of immigration into the US was comprised of people arriving from Southern Europe, and large numbers of Eastern Europeans.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irmo Marini|title=The Professional Counselor's Desk Reference|date=2009|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|isbn=978-0826171818|chapter=Counseling White Americans|page=249|quote=[[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans.

====World War II====
After the outbreak of [[World War II]], Eastern European citizens of Canada received training at [[Camp X]], many going on to serve their adoptive country in the [[Special Operations Executive]].<ref name=\"saturdaynight1982\">{{cite news|title=Saturday Night, Volume 97|date=1982|work=[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]|quote=Similarly out of the mainstream were those central and eastern European Canadians, now condescendingly called \"ethnics.\" Of those who served with SOE , most were Yugoslavs who had immigrated to Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.}}</ref> In the US, however, Americans of Eastern European heritage faced government-enforced restrictions.

Our government confiscated the personal property of many [[European Americans]] and restricted their travel rights.}}</ref>

In both Canada and the United States, in the post-WWII period, politically active Eastern European people were forced to tread a careful line of diplomacy in both North American nations; demonstrating loyalty to their countries, while advocating for interventional policy which might aid people in their ancestral homelands.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H.

====Social breakthrough====
Eastern Europeans in Canada were shown to be underrepresented in professional occupations (and overrepresented in the [[personal service sector]]) by a 1961 census.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irwin Taylor Sanders|author2=Ewa T.

(Such name changes were not untypical among assimilating Eastern Europeans in Canada.)}}</ref>

In the US, Eastern Europeans were also gradually being accepted into mainstream American culture. Historian [[David Halberstam]], speaking in a [[New England Board of Higher Education]] interview, discussed how access to [[white society]] became plausible for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nebhe.org/fall-2005-connection-50-years-of-new-england-higher-education-and-economic-development/|title=Fall 2005 Connection: 50 Years of New England Higher Education and Economic Development|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[New England Board of Higher Education]]|quote= But in retrospect, it was narrower than we thought. We perceived ourselves in the ‘50s as a white society, and the breakthrough was mostly limited to people who were descendents of Italian-Americans, Eastern European Americans, children of Jewish immigrants.”}}</ref> Perhaps respresenting this social change best, the [[US Census Bureau]] found that the Eastern European  born in this time period (between 1956 and 1965) were indistinguishable, in education results, with [[British Americans]].  Eastern European Americans were found to have also outperformed US citizens of solely British heritage in the completion of [[bachelor's degrees]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dominic J.

However, the percentages had virtually converged for two groups in this cohort: men of solely [[British ancestry]] (66.3% and 31.8%, respectively) and Southern and Eastern European men (66.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too. While the [[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans began to prosper in America, [[African Americans]] continued to suffer from discrimination and diminished life chances}}</ref>

====Late 20th-century====
During the 1970s, the majority of Eastern Europeans resident in Canada lived in the country's main urban centers. The exception being those of Ukrainian heritage, who still mostly lived rurally.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peggy Tyrchniewicz|title=Ethnic folk costumes in Canada|date=1979|publisher=[[Hyperion Press]]|isbn=978-0920534106|chapter=|page=111|quote=By 1971, the greatest percentage of all eastern European Canadians lived in the largest urban centers. The exception is the Ukrainians who live mainnly on the prairies.}}</ref> During this time, the [[Helsinki Accords]] were the cause of various political strife between the [[Ford administration]] and Eastern European people in the US.<ref>{{cite article|title=Through the Looking Glass: The Helsinki Final Act and the 1976 Election for President|author1=Sarah B. Snyder |date=2010|pages=86-106|publisher=Diplomacy & Statecraft|quote=[[Helsinki Final Act]] became a point of contention between the [[White House]] and Eastern European Americans during Ford's election campaign}}</ref> Whereas, writing in 1980, Dr Roy Norton suggested that the group were appreciative of the role Canada played in the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]], as well as the country's consistent criticizm of abuses to human rights in their ancestral lands.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nelson Michaud|editor2=Kim Richard Nossal|author1=Roy Norton|title=Diplomatic Departures: The Conservative Era in Canadian Foreign Policy, 1984-93 (Canada and International Relations)|date=2002|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|isbn=978-0774808651|chapter=Ethnic Groups and Conservative Foreign Policy|page=247|quote=Most eastern European-Canadians appeared to be pleased with Canada's leadership at the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] and on individual human rights cases; one community leader claimed he \"always felt [[Joe Clark]] was totally in tune with the position [he] was advocating\".}}</ref>

====Academic studies====
Academic reesearch has been utilized in the study of Eastern European diaspora in North American.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Wilhelm Kohler|title=European Economic Integration, WTO Membership, Immigration and Offshoring|date=2014|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-9814440189|chapter=Restrictive Immigration Policy in Germany: Pains and Gains Foregone?|page=409|quote=(iii) A “high education” scenario which assumes that the composition of the inflow equals the one observed for Eastern Europeans in Canada between 1995 and 2000.}}</ref> Professor Cezara O.

In 2008, a genetic research investigation consecutively tested over five hundred Eastern European US citizens, in order to identify [[human leukocyte antigen]] alleles. The research, which was based at the [[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]], contributed towards the creation of a [[hematopoietic stem cell]] register.<ref>{{cite study|title=HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allele and haplotype frequencies distinguish Eastern European Americans from the general European American population.|date=2008|publisher=[[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]]|author=S.

[[Category:Eastern Europeans in the United States]]
[[Category:Ethnic groups in Europe]]","'''Eastern European people''' are a pan-ethnic group, or multi-ethnic regional grouping, and the inhabitants of [[Eastern Europe]]. '''East''' or '''Eastern Europeans''' can usually trace back full or partial heritage to [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[European Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other nations bordering with or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the region.

Mainly comprised of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicities, in its strictest geographical terms [[Moldova]] is the sole majority-Romance ethnic nation in the region; with significant numbers of [[Moldovans in Ukraine|Moldovans]] and [[Romanians in Ukraine|Romanians]] also native to other areas of Eastern Europe, such as in the [[Western Ukrainian]] borderland province [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and parts of Russia.

There are also many descriptions of Eastern Europeans which include ancestry from nations in [[Central Europe]], and countries of the [[South Slavs]], particularly in diasporic identification. There is a large Eastern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in North America ([[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians|Canadians]]), as well as Oceania ([[Eastern European Australians]]).

Eastern Europeans have been discussed academically, researched and reported on as a pan-ethnic group, which is most usually based on full or partial ancestry to Eastern Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cee-communism/closed-borders-no-shops-been-there-done-that-say-east-europeans-idUSKBN21E2KO |title=Closed borders, no shops?

Although this definition is accurate and specific, it does represents the pan-ethnic grouping in the strictest geographical terms, and is frequently not adhered to in the international identification of and referencing to Eastern Europeans.

==History==
In 1964, the [[Assembly of Captive European Nations]] published material suggesting how, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the \"Eastern European people were sealed off from the West and held down by Soviet-patterned police apparatuses\".<ref>{{cite news|author1=George Meany|authorlink1=George Meany|title=ACEN News|date=1964|publisher=[[Assembly of Captive European Nations]]}}</ref> The attitudes of Eastern Europeans and their relationship to the state, government and society underwent transformation during the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Markus Schatten|title=Recovering the Past.

During the economic reforms of the 1990s, as the region partially fell away from the economic sphere of Russia, Eastern Europeans suffered financially with, at first, growing costs and less disposable income.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Counts|title=Effects of Eastern European Reforms on World Trade in Forest Products|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|quote=The Eastern European people were faced with the dual problem of having less money to spend while at the same time facing increasingly high prices on virtually all goods and services.}}</ref> In the 21st-century, the process of [[EU enlargement]] has occasionally exposed cultural differences in between Western and Eastern Europeans, with the Soviet history of the region influencing the latter's political worldviews.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dieter Gosewinkel|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|date=2014|page=157|isbn=978-1782384250|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|quote=However, the [[EU enlargement|European enlargement]] process since the end of the [[Cold War]] has brought to the surface significant differences in opinions concerning the future of the union between so-called Old and New Europe.

In 2019, a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that between 58 and 65 percent of Eastern Europeans felt positively about [[living standards]], education and [[national pride]] in the post-Communist era.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=30 years after communism, eastern Europe divided on democracy's impact |authorlink=|author=Jon Henley|date=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Asked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%).

In 2020, it was reported how the [[European Union]]'s policy of free movement had enabled or encouraged millions of Eastern Europeans to return home from Germany, and other large European economies, after job losses created by the [[coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild |title=After coronavirus: how will Europe rebuild? |authorlink=|author=Katherine Butler|date=12 April 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=If Germany’s success in handling the pandemic is partly down to an army of migrant doctors and nurses, it should not be to the detriment of central and eastern Europe.

==Academic research==
A 2013 study at [[Bucharest University]] proposed how a culture where Eastern European people seem under interrogation, for all political and cultural decisions taken by them, has developed due to the cultural conflict caused by public transition from communism to democracy.<ref>{{cite study|author1=Camelia Florela Voinea|author2=Bojan Todosijevic|author3=Guido Boella|title=Political Attitudes and Mentalities.

The integration of Eastern Europeans is considered as converting them to Danish ‘whiteness’}}</ref>

==Diaspora==
Large numbers of Eastern Europeans have emigrated from the region between the 18th and 21st centuries, driven by many factors, including wars, discrimination and opportunity. Significant proportions of such people, and their descendents, constitute the modern populations of [[Eastern European Americans]] and [[Eastern European Canadians]] in the North American continent, and [[Eastern European Australians]] in Oceania.

===Europe===
Since the opening up of [[EU accession]] in the early 21st-century, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to other parts of Europe, especially to Central, Western, and Northern Europe; gaining access to the job markets of large economies in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in particular.<ref name=\"goldenage2019\" />

[[Russell Deacon]] has written of the tension created in the mid-2000s, from Eastern Europeans emigrating to [[Welsh-speaking]] areas of Wales, with pressure group [[Cymuned]] lobbying the Welsh government to prioritize housing for locals, as a reactionary response.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Russell Deacon|author2=Alan Sandry|authorlink1=Russell Deacon|title=Devolution in the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland|date=2007|page=179|isbn=978-0748624164|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|quote=The problem of solely English-speaking or Eastern European people moving into predominantly Welsh-speaking areas has at times been a sensitive political issue.

===North America===
====19th-century====
Eastern Europeans arrived in large numbers to the United States during the 1880s and 1890s, settling in industry towns and cities, such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohiodigitalnetwork.org/historic-ethnic-groups-in-ohio/|title=Historic Ethnic Groups in Ohio|publisher=[[State Library of Ohio]]|quote=[[Cleveland, Ohio]], likewise, saw many Eastern Europeans choosing its city as their new home. While thousands of [[Germans]] often chose rural areas throughout Ohio as their new residence, they also settled in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. In fact, at the beginning of the 20th century, at least 50 percent of Cleveland residents were German. Over 75 percent of Cleveland’s population was foreign born by 1900.}}</ref> Implications of the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' in 1914, which authorized the designation of \"aliens of enemy nationality\", included Eastern European Canadians born or resident in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Martin Louis Kovacs|title=Ethnic Canadians: Culture and Education|date=1978|publisher=[[University of Regina]]|isbn=978-0889770096|chapter=Volume 8|page=132|quote=The conflict between clashing loyalties for the Ukrainian and some other Central Eastern European Canadians was exacerbated by the war measures.}}</ref> Continuing into the 1920s, Eastern European Canadians faced persecution, along with [[African Canadians]], during economic recession and post-[[World War I]] unrest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sarah-Jane Mathieu|title=North of the Color Line: Migration and Black Resistance in Canada, 1870–1955|date=2010|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|isbn=978-0807834299|chapter=Fighting the Empire|page=114|quote=Throughout the 1920s, eastern European Canadians, like [[African Canadians]], became the country's convenient scapegoats for postwar labor unrest, peacetime economic recession, and urban demise.}}</ref> In the US from 1900 (until the [[Hart–Celler Act]] of 1965 ended it), the majority of immigration into the US was comprised of people arriving from Southern Europe, and large numbers of Eastern Europeans.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irmo Marini|title=The Professional Counselor's Desk Reference|date=2009|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|isbn=978-0826171818|chapter=Counseling White Americans|page=249|quote=[[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans.

====World War II====
After the outbreak of [[World War II]], Eastern European citizens of Canada received training at [[Camp X]], many going on to serve their adoptive country in the [[Special Operations Executive]].<ref name=\"saturdaynight1982\">{{cite news|title=Saturday Night, Volume 97|date=1982|work=[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]|quote=Similarly out of the mainstream were those central and eastern European Canadians, now condescendingly called \"ethnics.\" Of those who served with SOE , most were Yugoslavs who had immigrated to Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.}}</ref> In the US, however, Americans of Eastern European heritage faced government-enforced restrictions.

Our government confiscated the personal property of many [[European Americans]] and restricted their travel rights.}}</ref>

In both Canada and the United States, in the post-WWII period, politically active Eastern European people were forced to tread a careful line of diplomacy in both North American nations; demonstrating loyalty to their countries, while advocating for interventional policy which might aid people in their ancestral homelands.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H.

====Social breakthrough====
Eastern Europeans in Canada were shown to be underrepresented in professional occupations (and overrepresented in the [[personal service sector]]) by a 1961 census.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irwin Taylor Sanders|author2=Ewa T.

(Such name changes were not untypical among assimilating Eastern Europeans in Canada.)}}</ref>

In the US, Eastern Europeans were also gradually being accepted into mainstream American culture. Historian [[David Halberstam]], speaking in a [[New England Board of Higher Education]] interview, discussed how access to [[white society]] became plausible for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nebhe.org/fall-2005-connection-50-years-of-new-england-higher-education-and-economic-development/|title=Fall 2005 Connection: 50 Years of New England Higher Education and Economic Development|date=September 26, 2013|publisher=[[New England Board of Higher Education]]|quote= But in retrospect, it was narrower than we thought. We perceived ourselves in the ‘50s as a white society, and the breakthrough was mostly limited to people who were descendents of Italian-Americans, Eastern European Americans, children of Jewish immigrants.”}}</ref> Perhaps respresenting this social change best, the [[US Census Bureau]] found that the Eastern European  born in this time period (between 1956 and 1965) were indistinguishable, in education results, with [[British Americans]].  Eastern European Americans were found to have also outperformed US citizens of solely British heritage in the completion of [[bachelor's degrees]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dominic J.

However, the percentages had virtually converged for two groups in this cohort: men of solely [[British ancestry]] (66.3% and 31.8%, respectively) and Southern and Eastern European men (66.4% and 33.8%, respectively). Interestingly, these trends were reflected in the data for women too. While the [[Southern European Americans|Southern]] and Eastern European Americans began to prosper in America, [[African Americans]] continued to suffer from discrimination and diminished life chances}}</ref>

====Late 20th-century====
During the 1970s, the majority of Eastern Europeans resident in Canada lived in the country's main urban centers. The exception being those of Ukrainian heritage, who still mostly lived rurally.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peggy Tyrchniewicz|title=Ethnic folk costumes in Canada|date=1979|publisher=[[Hyperion Press]]|isbn=978-0920534106|chapter=|page=111|quote=By 1971, the greatest percentage of all eastern European Canadians lived in the largest urban centers. The exception is the Ukrainians who live mainnly on the prairies.}}</ref> During this time, the [[Helsinki Accords]] were the cause of various political strife between the [[Ford administration]] and Eastern European people in the US.<ref>{{cite article|title=Through the Looking Glass: The Helsinki Final Act and the 1976 Election for President|author1=Sarah B. Snyder |date=2010|pages=86-106|publisher=Diplomacy & Statecraft|quote=[[Helsinki Final Act]] became a point of contention between the [[White House]] and Eastern European Americans during Ford's election campaign}}</ref> Whereas, writing in 1980, Dr Roy Norton suggested that the group were appreciative of the role Canada played in the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]], as well as the country's consistent criticizm of abuses to human rights in their ancestral lands.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nelson Michaud|editor2=Kim Richard Nossal|author1=Roy Norton|title=Diplomatic Departures: The Conservative Era in Canadian Foreign Policy, 1984-93 (Canada and International Relations)|date=2002|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|isbn=978-0774808651|chapter=Ethnic Groups and Conservative Foreign Policy|page=247|quote=Most eastern European-Canadians appeared to be pleased with Canada's leadership at the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] and on individual human rights cases; one community leader claimed he \"always felt [[Joe Clark]] was totally in tune with the position [he] was advocating\".}}</ref>

====Academic studies====
Academic reesearch has been utilized in the study of Eastern European diaspora in North American.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Wilhelm Kohler|title=European Economic Integration, WTO Membership, Immigration and Offshoring|date=2014|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-9814440189|chapter=Restrictive Immigration Policy in Germany: Pains and Gains Foregone?|page=409|quote=(iii) A “high education” scenario which assumes that the composition of the inflow equals the one observed for Eastern Europeans in Canada between 1995 and 2000.}}</ref> Professor Cezara O.

In 2008, a genetic research investigation consecutively tested over five hundred Eastern European US citizens, in order to identify [[human leukocyte antigen]] alleles. The research, which was based at the [[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]], contributed towards the creation of a [[hematopoietic stem cell]] register.<ref>{{cite study|title=HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allele and haplotype frequencies distinguish Eastern European Americans from the general European American population.|date=2008|publisher=[[Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute]]|author=S.

The '''Circus Maximus''' ([[Latin]] for ''greatest'' or ''largest [[Circus (building)|circus]]''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: '''Circo Massimo''') is an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[chariot racing|chariot-racing]] [[stadium]] and mass entertainment venue located in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Situated in the valley between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, it was the first and largest stadium in [[ancient Rome]] and its later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. It measured {{Convert|621|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{Convert|118|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width and could accommodate over 150,000 spectators.<ref>This is a modern recalculation of the [[seating capacity]] at the Circus, a substantial downward revision of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000. For discussion see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref> In its fully developed form, it became the model for circuses throughout the Roman Empire. The site is now a [[public park]].

The Circus was Rome's largest venue for ''ludi,'' public games connected to [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] [[Roman festival|festivals]]. ''Ludi'' were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people (''populus Romanus'')]] and [[List of Roman deities|gods]]. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the [[Roman calendar]]. Others might be given to fulfill a [[Votum|religious vow]], such as the games in celebration of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal ''ludi'' at the Circus were [[Votum#Military vota|vowed]] by [[Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] to Jupiter in the [[Roman kingdom|late Regal era]] for his victory over [[Suessa Pometia|Pometia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=66–67}}</ref>

''Ludi'' ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|plays]] and recitals, [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] and [[gladiator]] fights. Some included public executions. The greater ''ludi'' (<ref>http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/noun:ludus</ref>meaning sport or game in latin) at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'', much like the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.<ref>Described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 7.72.1–13, supplemented by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]'s history.</ref>

During [[Roman Republic|Rome's Republican era]], the [[aedile]]s organised the games. The most costly and complex of the ''ludi'' offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|higher office]].<ref>Aedileship was a rung on the [[Cursus honorum|ladder of Roman politics]], available to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebs|plebeians]] of wealth and high standing. Despite the sometimes crippling personal cost of running for office and providing \"extras\" for the ''ludi'', a successful aedile could secure popular favor and a substantial share of the vote at election time. [[Julius Caesar]] was among those who solidified his support through his lavish ''ludi'' as aedile.</ref> Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, \"[[tibicen|flute players]], scenic artists and dancers\" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A ''[[venatio]]'' held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed \"63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants\", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}, A later iron cage-work barrier is evident at [[Pompey]]'s ''venatione'' of 55 BC.</ref>

As Rome's provinces expanded, existing ''ludi'' were embellished and new ''ludi'' invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133–49 BC)|late Republic]], ''ludi'' were held on 57 days of the year;<ref name=\"auto1\">Bunson, Matthew, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246.</ref> an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby [[Forum Boarium|cattle market]], just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of [[Catullus]] (mid-1st century BC) was likely \"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}, citing [[T. P. Wiseman]], \"Looking for Camerius. The Topography of [[Catullus 55]],\"  ''Papers of the British School at Rome'', 1980, pp. 11–13 with footnotes.</ref> frequented by \"prostitutes, jugglers, fortune tellers and low-class performing artists.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}</ref>

[[File:CircusMaximusNorthEast2019.jpg|thumb|View of the Circus site from the north-east – 2019]]
Rome's emperors met the ever-burgeoning popular demand for regular ''ludi'' and the need for more specialised venues, as essential obligations of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|their office and cult]]. Over the several centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the [[Colosseum]] had been built to host most of the city's [[gladiator]] shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed [[Stadium of Domitian]], though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus.<ref>Extraordinarily long races of up to 128 miles, if [[Pliny the Elder]] is to be believed; see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}</ref> Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to ''ludi''.<ref name=\"auto1\" />

Even at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale, and was the most popular venue for large-scale ''venationes'';<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=71–72}}</ref> in the late 3rd century, the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=128}}, citing ''Historia Augusta'', Probus, 19.2–4.</ref> With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ''ludi'' gradually fell out of favour. The last known beast-hunt at the Circus Maximus took place in 523, and the last known races there were held by [[Totila]] in 549.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowersock|first1=Glen Warren|last2=Brown|first2=Peter|last3=Grabar|first3=Oleg|title=Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World|url=https://archive.org/details/lateantiquitygui00bowe|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-51173-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/lateantiquitygui00bowe/page/674 674]}}; citing Procopius, ''The Gothic Wars'', 3. 37. 4.For the last known beast-hunt at the Circus, see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=131}}.

== Topography and construction ==

=== Regal era ===
[[File:Obelisk-popolo.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Flaminio Obelisk|Obelisco Flaminio]]'', now in the [[Piazza del Popolo]], was once part of the dividing barrier (''spina'') at the Circus Maximus]]

The Circus Maximus was sited on the level ground of the Valley of Murcia ''(Vallis Murcia)'', between Rome's [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill]]s. In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river [[Tiber]] and the stream which divided the valley. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, \"with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots\".<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=11}}. Humphrey describes this as \"like a Greek [[hippodrome]]\"</ref>

In [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|history of Rome]], the first [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Roman Kingdom|king of Rome]] [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the [[equites]] and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, [[Tarquinius Superbus]], added the first seating for citizen-commoners ([[plebs]], or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track.<ref>The Aventine was a predominantly plebeian area.</ref> Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained<ref>Tarquin might have employed the plebs in constructing a conduit or drain (cloaca) for Murcia's stream, discharging into the Tiber. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=67}}</ref> but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (''metae''), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.<ref>Etruscan tomb paintings of chariot races offer a possible seating model for this earliest phase; noble sponsors and other dignitaries sit in elevated stands, complete with awning. Commoners lounge or sit below, at ground level. At the early Circus Maximus, the sloping ground afforded the possibility of turf seating tiers at an early date – as imagined by [[Ovid]] in his account of the first Consualia – replaced with wooden seating tiers by later sponsors and benefactors. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=65–66, 68–69}}, for early ''metae'' and a possible canal as central dividing barrier, see summary on pp. 292–3.</ref>

=== Republican era ===
The games' sponsor (Latin ''editor)'' usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'') but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the [[Roman republic|Republican era]]) the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants were granted rights to a [[curule chair]] at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing.<ref>In the earliest exercise of the right, a curule chair would have been brought to the spot; its permanent positioning there is unlikely. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> In the 190s&nbsp;BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.<ref>Livy has the plebs seated \"promiscuously\" (''antea in promiscuo spectabant'') up to then: see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=70}}</ref>

Permanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted,<ref>Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 8.20.1</ref> and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots ( [[Quadriga]]s ) abreast but when team-racing was introduced,<ref>Racing teams might have been used as early as the Regal era (according to some later Roman traditions), or as late as the end of the Punic Wars.</ref> they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by [[herma|herms]] that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, [[Quadriga|four-horse]] or [[Biga (chariot)|two-horse chariots]] could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=171}}; the gates probably used the same animal-sinew torsion springing as the Roman [[ballista]]; ''Ibid'', pp. 137–138: opposing teams of Reds and Whites are prominent in late Republican literature, and Greens and Blues in the Imperial era. Some Roman authors held that team-racing in multiple colors dated back to the regal era. ''Ibid,'' p. 175 for allocation of stalls by lottery.</ref> Typically, there were seven laps per race.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/chariot.html|title=The Roman Empire: in the First Century. The Roman Empire. Life In Roman Times. Chariot Races|website=PBS.org}}</ref> From at least 174&nbsp;BC, they were counted off using large sculpted eggs. In 33&nbsp;BC, an additional system of large bronze dolphin-shaped lap counters was added, positioned well above the central dividing barrier ''(euripus)'' for maximum visibility.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=261–265}}</ref>

[[File:Sestertius-Caracalla-Circus Maximus-RIC 0500a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sestertius]] depicting [[Caracalla]], and the Circus Maximus, with Augustus' obelisk midway along the central dividing barrier ''(euripus)'']]
[[Julius Caesar]]'s development of the Circus, commencing around 50&nbsp;BC, extended the seating tiers to run almost the entire circuit of the track, barring the starting gates and a processional entrance at the semi-circular end.<ref>A processional entrance at the semi-circular end,. prior to the erection there of Titus' triumphal arch, is assumed by most modern sources. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=69, 97ff}}</ref> The track measured approximately 621&nbsp;m (2,037&nbsp;ft) in length and 150&nbsp;m (387&nbsp;ft) in breadth. A&nbsp;canal was cut between the track perimeter and its seating to protect spectators and help drain the track.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=75, 84}}</ref> The inner third of the seating formed a trackside ''[[cavea]]''. Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for ''equites''. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Circus-Maximus|title=Circus Maximus arena, Rome, Italy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000 is unlikely. The wooden bleachers were damaged in a fire of 31&nbsp;BC, either during or after construction.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]]'s figure of 250,000 circus seats is unreliable; it ignores the necessary interruptions of seating rows by many access stairways and corridors. It might represent a per foot run seating estimate, or include those watching from the nearby heights, outside the building proper. In late Imperial regionary catalogues, seating estimates for the Circus become even wilder; one gives an impossible 450,000 seats. Discussion is in {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref>

=== Imperial era ===
[[File:Sestertius Trajan Circus Maximus AD103.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Sestertius of Trajan celebrating the restoration of the Circus Maximus (minted 103 AD).<ref>Sear, David R. (2002).

The fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and ''pulvinar'' at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods.<ref>It was quarried and first dedicated in the reign of [[Seti I]]</ref> Augustus had it brought from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=Mysteries of the Nile – A World of Obelisks: Rome|website=NOVA Online}}</ref> at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'' was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'') raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] as \"one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome\", with \"entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=72–73}}. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] described the Circus and its seating c.30 BC–AD 8. Augustus also rebuilt Ceres' temple, above the starting gates; it was probably damaged in the fire of 31 BC. ''Ibid,'' pp. 268–272 for Augustus' obelisk.</ref>
[[File:Topographical diagram of the Circus Maximus by Samuel Ball Platner.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Groundplan of the Circus Maximus, according to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], 1911. The staggered starting gates are to the left.]]
The site remained prone to flooding,<ref>The ''Ludi Martiales'' of AD 12 were temporarily transferred from the Circus, after a flood.</ref> probably through the starting gates, until [[Claudius]] made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor [[Tiberius]] compensated various small businesses there for their losses.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=100–101}}. Claudius' improvements at the Circus included stone-built or marble-clad starting stalls and rebuilt turning posts.</ref> In [[Great Fire of Rome|AD 64]], during [[Nero]]'s reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.<ref>Nero, inordinately fond of chariot-racing, may have considered the Circus rebuilding a priority but the overall cost of Rome's rebuilding must have proved an extraordinary drain on Imperial and public funds. Wooden bleachers for the Roman masses were an expedient, cost-effective solution. If Nero had grander plans for the Circus, they ended with his suicide under compulsion, after a coup d'etat in AD 68. {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=101}}</ref>

By the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=293–294}}</ref>

In AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring [[Titus]] at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance.<ref>This is not to be confused with the [[Arch of Titus]], built over the [[Via Sacra]] on the opposite side of the Palatine.</ref> The emperor [[Domitian]] built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=74}}</ref>

The risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have prompted [[Trajan]]'s decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside their gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under [[Caracalla]], and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in [[Diocletian]]'s reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=80, 102, 126–9}}</ref>

== Religious significance ==
{{Wide image|Circus Maximus in Rome.jpg|900px|The Circus Maximus site and the Palatine Hill in background|box width|center|alt=alt text}}

The southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, located at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]], an obscure deity associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Myrtus|myrtle]] shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill.<ref>The prestige attached to the [[curule chair]] granted [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants in 494 BC would have been enhanced by its positioning close to this shrine. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> The other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to [[Consus]], a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and to the [[underworld]]. According to Roman tradition, [[Romulus]] discovered this shrine shortly after the [[founding of Rome]]. He invented the [[Consualia]] festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then [[bride abduction|abducted]] the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]] of the [[Rape of the Sabine women]] had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.

In this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and [[Hercules]]' [[Ara Maxima]], supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}</ref> The position of Consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s Greek equivalent, [[Poseidon]], in Greek [[hippodrome]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}; \"later Roman authors often reported the Consualia were held in honour of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptunus Equestris]].\"</ref> In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus' [[tutelary deity|patron deities]], was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the ''spina'' or ''euripus'')<ref>Most modern sources use ''spina'' (a spine) for the central barrier, based on a single, very late Roman source ([[Cassiodorus]]), but most Roman sources used ''euripus'', a Greek word meaning a channel, strait, or canal, and thus a barrier. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=175}}</ref> between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as ''Vallis Murcia''.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61–62}}. For Murcia's shifting topographical associations, see Otto Skutsch, \"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\", ''The Classical Quarterly, New Series'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252–67.</ref> The symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; [[Castor and Pollux]], who were [[Leda (mythology)|born from an egg]], were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the [[equestrian order]] ''(equites)''. Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune]], as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> When the Romans adopted the Phrygian [[Magna Mater|Great Mother]] as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.

[[File:Roman - Intaglio of a Circus with a Chariot Race - Walters 421314.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Jasper]] [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]] (2nd century AD) depicting chariot races, with the three-pointed  ''metae'' at each end of the dividing barrier shown at top ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]
Sun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and solar monism as a theological basis for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]]. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred [[obelisk]] towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line.  The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (''[[quadriga]]'') through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]''); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track.<ref>Jean Sorabella, \"A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron\", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'', Vol. 36, (2001), p. 75. See also Doro Levi, \"Aion\", ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens'', Vol. 13, 4, 1944, pp. 287ff.</ref> In Imperial cosmology, the emperor was Sol-Apollo's earthly equivalent, and Luna may have been linked to the empress.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<!-- Emperor and Sol is covered by Humphrey but no RS as yet for Luna's Imperial equivalence in the reigning empress. Severan (Julia Domna) coins sorta suggest it but could equally show Cybele  --> Luna's temple, built long before Apollo's, burned down in the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64 AD]] and was probably not replaced. Her cult was closely identified with that of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with [[Sol Indiges]], usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61–64, 92–94, 270–273}}</ref>

Temples to several deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to [[Temple of Luna|Luna]], the moon goddess. Aventine temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Obsequens]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Dis Pater|Dis]] (or perhaps [[Summanus]]) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Magna Mater]] and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|Apollo]].

Several festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the [[Cerealia]], the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested \"Roman Games\" ''([[Ludi Romani]])'' held at the Circus in honour of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in 366 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56.</ref> In the early Imperial era, [[Ovid]] describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus,<ref>Wiseman, 1995, p.137.</ref> followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches.<ref>See [[Barbette Spaeth|Spaeth, Barbette Stanley]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 36–37.</ref> Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.

[[File:Circus-Maximus-June-1983.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins overlooking the Circus Maximus, seen from the Aventine (1983)]]
After the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay, and was quarried for building materials.

The Circus site now functions as a large park area, in the centre of the city. It is often used for concerts and meetings. The [[Live 8 concert, Rome|Rome concert of Live 8]] (July 2, 2005) was held there. The English band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] performed a concert before an estimated audience of 500,000 people in 2007 (this was filmed and released as [[When in Rome 2007]]). [[The Rolling Stones]] played there in front of 71,527 people on June 22, 2014 for the Italian date of their [[14 On Fire]] tour. The Circus has also hosted victory celebrations, following the Italian [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] victory and the [[A.S. Roma]] [[Serie A]] victory in 1983 and 2001. In May 2019, a new [[virtual reality|virtual]]/[[augmented reality]] experience, the ''Circo Maximo Experience'', opened on the site, taking visitors on a journey through the site and its history.

The '''Circus Maximus''' ([[Latin]] for ''greatest'' or ''largest [[Circus (building)|circus]]''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: '''Circo Massimo''') is an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[chariot racing|chariot-racing]] [[stadium]] and mass entertainment venue located in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Situated in the valley between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, it was the first and largest stadium in [[ancient Rome]] and its later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. It measured {{Convert|621|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{Convert|118|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width and could accommodate over 150,000 spectators.<ref>This is a modern recalculation of the [[seating capacity]] at the Circus, a substantial downward revision of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000. For discussion see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref> In its fully developed form, it became the model for circuses throughout the Roman Empire. The site is now a [[public park]].

{{See also|Chariot racing|Ludi}}
[[File:Plan Rome Caen Circus Maximus Colisée.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Model of Rome in the 4th century AD, by [[Paul Bigot]]. The Circus lies between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] (left) and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] (right); the oval structure to the far right is the [[Colosseum]].]]
The Circus was Rome's largest venue for ''ludi,'' public games connected to [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] [[Roman festival|festivals]]. ''Ludi'' were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people (''populus Romanus'')]] and [[List of Roman deities|gods]]. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the [[Roman calendar]]. Others might be given to fulfill a [[Votum|religious vow]], such as the games in celebration of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal ''ludi'' at the Circus were [[Votum#Military vota|vowed]] by [[Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] to Jupiter in the [[Roman kingdom|late Regal era]] for his victory over [[Suessa Pometia|Pometia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=66–67}}</ref>

''Ludi'' ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|plays]] and recitals, [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] and [[gladiator]] fights. Some included public executions. The greater ''ludi'' (<ref>http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/noun:ludus</ref>meaning sport or game in latin) at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'', much like the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.<ref>Described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 7.72.1–13, supplemented by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]'s history.</ref>

During [[Roman Republic|Rome's Republican era]], the [[aedile]]s organised the games. The most costly and complex of the ''ludi'' offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|higher office]].<ref>Aedileship was a rung on the [[Cursus honorum|ladder of Roman politics]], available to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebs|plebeians]] of wealth and high standing. Despite the sometimes crippling personal cost of running for office and providing \"extras\" for the ''ludi'', a successful aedile could secure popular favor and a substantial share of the vote at election time. [[Julius Caesar]] was among those who solidified his support through his lavish ''ludi'' as aedile.</ref> Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, \"[[tibicen|flute players]], scenic artists and dancers\" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A ''[[venatio]]'' held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed \"63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants\", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}, A later iron cage-work barrier is evident at [[Pompey]]'s ''venatione'' of 55 BC.</ref>

As Rome's provinces expanded, existing ''ludi'' were embellished and new ''ludi'' invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133–49 BC)|late Republic]], ''ludi'' were held on 57 days of the year;<ref name=\"auto1\">Bunson, Matthew, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246.</ref> an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby [[Forum Boarium|cattle market]], just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of [[Catullus]] (mid-1st century BC) was likely \"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}, citing [[T. P. Wiseman]], \"Looking for Camerius. The Topography of [[Catullus 55]],\"  ''Papers of the British School at Rome'', 1980, pp. 11–13 with footnotes.</ref> frequented by \"prostitutes, jugglers, fortune tellers and low-class performing artists.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}</ref>

[[File:CircusMaximusNorthEast2019.jpg|thumb|View of the Circus site from the north-east – 2019]]
Rome's emperors met the ever-burgeoning popular demand for regular ''ludi'' and the need for more specialised venues, as essential obligations of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|their office and cult]]. Over the several centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the [[Colosseum]] had been built to host most of the city's [[gladiator]] shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed [[Stadium of Domitian]], though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus.<ref>Extraordinarily long races of up to 128 miles, if [[Pliny the Elder]] is to be believed; see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}</ref> Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to ''ludi''.<ref name=\"auto1\" />

Even at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale, and was the most popular venue for large-scale ''venationes'';<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=71–72}}</ref> in the late 3rd century, the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=128}}, citing ''Historia Augusta'', Probus, 19.2–4.</ref> With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ''ludi'' gradually fell out of favour. The last known beast-hunt at the Circus Maximus took place in 523, and the last known races there were held by [[Totila]] in 549.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowersock|first1=Glen Warren|last2=Brown|first2=Peter|last3=Grabar|first3=Oleg|title=Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World|url=https://archive.org/details/lateantiquitygui00bowe|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-51173-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/lateantiquitygui00bowe/page/674 674]}}; citing Procopius, ''The Gothic Wars'', 3. 37. 4.For the last known beast-hunt at the Circus, see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=131}}.

== Topography and construction ==

=== Regal era ===
[[File:Obelisk-popolo.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Flaminio Obelisk|Obelisco Flaminio]]'', now in the [[Piazza del Popolo]], was once part of the dividing barrier (''spina'') at the Circus Maximus]]

The Circus Maximus was sited on the level ground of the Valley of Murcia ''(Vallis Murcia)'', between Rome's [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill]]s. In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river [[Tiber]] and the stream which divided the valley. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, \"with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots\".<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=11}}. Humphrey describes this as \"like a Greek [[hippodrome]]\"</ref>

In [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|history of Rome]], the first [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Roman Kingdom|king of Rome]] [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the [[equites]] and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, [[Tarquinius Superbus]], added the first seating for citizen-commoners ([[plebs]], or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track.<ref>The Aventine was a predominantly plebeian area.</ref> Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained<ref>Tarquin might have employed the plebs in constructing a conduit or drain (cloaca) for Murcia's stream, discharging into the Tiber. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=67}}</ref> but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (''metae''), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.<ref>Etruscan tomb paintings of chariot races offer a possible seating model for this earliest phase; noble sponsors and other dignitaries sit in elevated stands, complete with awning. Commoners lounge or sit below, at ground level. At the early Circus Maximus, the sloping ground afforded the possibility of turf seating tiers at an early date – as imagined by [[Ovid]] in his account of the first Consualia – replaced with wooden seating tiers by later sponsors and benefactors. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=65–66, 68–69}}, for early ''metae'' and a possible canal as central dividing barrier, see summary on pp. 292–3.</ref>

=== Republican era ===
The games' sponsor (Latin ''editor)'' usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'') but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the [[Roman republic|Republican era]]) the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants were granted rights to a [[curule chair]] at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing.<ref>In the earliest exercise of the right, a curule chair would have been brought to the spot; its permanent positioning there is unlikely. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> In the 190s&nbsp;BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.<ref>Livy has the plebs seated \"promiscuously\" (''antea in promiscuo spectabant'') up to then: see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=70}}</ref>

Permanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted,<ref>Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 8.20.1</ref> and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots ( [[Quadriga]]s ) abreast but when team-racing was introduced,<ref>Racing teams might have been used as early as the Regal era (according to some later Roman traditions), or as late as the end of the Punic Wars.</ref> they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by [[herma|herms]] that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, [[Quadriga|four-horse]] or [[Biga (chariot)|two-horse chariots]] could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=171}}; the gates probably used the same animal-sinew torsion springing as the Roman [[ballista]]; ''Ibid'', pp. 137–138: opposing teams of Reds and Whites are prominent in late Republican literature, and Greens and Blues in the Imperial era. Some Roman authors held that team-racing in multiple colors dated back to the regal era. ''Ibid,'' p. 175 for allocation of stalls by lottery.</ref> Typically, there were seven laps per race.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/chariot.html|title=The Roman Empire: in the First Century. The Roman Empire. Life In Roman Times. Chariot Races|website=PBS.org}}</ref> From at least 174&nbsp;BC, they were counted off using large sculpted eggs. In 33&nbsp;BC, an additional system of large bronze dolphin-shaped lap counters was added, positioned well above the central dividing barrier ''(euripus)'' for maximum visibility.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=261–265}}</ref>

[[File:Sestertius-Caracalla-Circus Maximus-RIC 0500a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sestertius]] depicting [[Caracalla]], and the Circus Maximus, with Augustus' obelisk midway along the central dividing barrier ''(euripus)'']]
[[Julius Caesar]]'s development of the Circus, commencing around 50&nbsp;BC, extended the seating tiers to run almost the entire circuit of the track, barring the starting gates and a processional entrance at the semi-circular end.<ref>A processional entrance at the semi-circular end,. prior to the erection there of Titus' triumphal arch, is assumed by most modern sources. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=69, 97ff}}</ref> The track measured approximately 621&nbsp;m (2,037&nbsp;ft) in length and 150&nbsp;m (387&nbsp;ft) in breadth. A&nbsp;canal was cut between the track perimeter and its seating to protect spectators and help drain the track.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=75, 84}}</ref> The inner third of the seating formed a trackside ''[[cavea]]''. Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for ''equites''. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Circus-Maximus|title=Circus Maximus arena, Rome, Italy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000 is unlikely. The wooden bleachers were damaged in a fire of 31&nbsp;BC, either during or after construction.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]]'s figure of 250,000 circus seats is unreliable; it ignores the necessary interruptions of seating rows by many access stairways and corridors. It might represent a per foot run seating estimate, or include those watching from the nearby heights, outside the building proper. In late Imperial regionary catalogues, seating estimates for the Circus become even wilder; one gives an impossible 450,000 seats. Discussion is in {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref>

=== Imperial era ===
[[File:Sestertius Trajan Circus Maximus AD103.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Sestertius of Trajan celebrating the restoration of the Circus Maximus (minted 103 AD).<ref>Sear, David R. (2002).

The fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and ''pulvinar'' at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods.<ref>It was quarried and first dedicated in the reign of [[Seti I]]</ref> Augustus had it brought from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=Mysteries of the Nile – A World of Obelisks: Rome|website=NOVA Online}}</ref> at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'' was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'') raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] as \"one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome\", with \"entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=72–73}}. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] described the Circus and its seating c.30 BC–AD 8. Augustus also rebuilt Ceres' temple, above the starting gates; it was probably damaged in the fire of 31 BC. ''Ibid,'' pp. 268–272 for Augustus' obelisk.</ref>
[[File:Topographical diagram of the Circus Maximus by Samuel Ball Platner.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Groundplan of the Circus Maximus, according to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], 1911. The staggered starting gates are to the left.]]
The site remained prone to flooding,<ref>The ''Ludi Martiales'' of AD 12 were temporarily transferred from the Circus, after a flood.</ref> probably through the starting gates, until [[Claudius]] made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor [[Tiberius]] compensated various small businesses there for their losses.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=100–101}}. Claudius' improvements at the Circus included stone-built or marble-clad starting stalls and rebuilt turning posts.</ref> In [[Great Fire of Rome|AD 64]], during [[Nero]]'s reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.<ref>Nero, inordinately fond of chariot-racing, may have considered the Circus rebuilding a priority but the overall cost of Rome's rebuilding must have proved an extraordinary drain on Imperial and public funds. Wooden bleachers for the Roman masses were an expedient, cost-effective solution. If Nero had grander plans for the Circus, they ended with his suicide under compulsion, after a coup d'etat in AD 68. {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=101}}</ref>

By the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=293–294}}</ref>

In AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring [[Titus]] at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance.<ref>This is not to be confused with the [[Arch of Titus]], built over the [[Via Sacra]] on the opposite side of the Palatine.</ref> The emperor [[Domitian]] built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=74}}</ref>

The risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have prompted [[Trajan]]'s decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside their gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under [[Caracalla]], and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in [[Diocletian]]'s reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=80, 102, 126–9}}</ref>

== Religious significance ==
{{Wide image|Circus Maximus in Rome.jpg|900px|The Circus Maximus site and the Palatine Hill in background|box width|center|alt=alt text}}

The southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, located at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]], an obscure deity associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Myrtus|myrtle]] shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill.<ref>The prestige attached to the [[curule chair]] granted [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants in 494 BC would have been enhanced by its positioning close to this shrine. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> The other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to [[Consus]], a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and to the [[underworld]]. According to Roman tradition, [[Romulus]] discovered this shrine shortly after the [[founding of Rome]]. He invented the [[Consualia]] festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then [[bride abduction|abducted]] the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]] of the [[Rape of the Sabine women]] had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.

In this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and [[Hercules]]' [[Ara Maxima]], supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}</ref> The position of Consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s Greek equivalent, [[Poseidon]], in Greek [[hippodrome]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}; \"later Roman authors often reported the Consualia were held in honour of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptunus Equestris]].\"</ref> In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus' [[tutelary deity|patron deities]], was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the ''spina'' or ''euripus'')<ref>Most modern sources use ''spina'' (a spine) for the central barrier, based on a single, very late Roman source ([[Cassiodorus]]), but most Roman sources used ''euripus'', a Greek word meaning a channel, strait, or canal, and thus a barrier. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=175}}</ref> between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as ''Vallis Murcia''.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61–62}}. For Murcia's shifting topographical associations, see Otto Skutsch, \"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\", ''The Classical Quarterly, New Series'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252–67.</ref> The symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; [[Castor and Pollux]], who were [[Leda (mythology)|born from an egg]], were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the [[equestrian order]] ''(equites)''. Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune]], as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> When the Romans adopted the Phrygian [[Magna Mater|Great Mother]] as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.

Sun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and solar monism as a theological basis for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]]. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred [[obelisk]] towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line.  The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (''[[quadriga]]'') through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]''); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track.<ref>Jean Sorabella, \"A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron\", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'', Vol. 36, (2001), p. 75. See also Doro Levi, \"Aion\", ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens'', Vol. 13, 4, 1944, pp. 287ff.</ref> In Imperial cosmology, the emperor was Sol-Apollo's earthly equivalent, and Luna may have been linked to the empress.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<!-- Emperor and Sol is covered by Humphrey but no RS as yet for Luna's Imperial equivalence in the reigning empress. Severan (Julia Domna) coins sorta suggest it but could equally show Cybele  --> Luna's temple, built long before Apollo's, burned down in the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64 AD]] and was probably not replaced. Her cult was closely identified with that of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with [[Sol Indiges]], usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61–64, 92–94, 270–273}}</ref>

Temples to several deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to [[Temple of Luna|Luna]], the moon goddess. Aventine temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Obsequens]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Dis Pater|Dis]] (or perhaps [[Summanus]]) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Magna Mater]] and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|Apollo]].

Several festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the [[Cerealia]], the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested \"Roman Games\" ''([[Ludi Romani]])'' held at the Circus in honour of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in 366 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56.</ref> In the early Imperial era, [[Ovid]] describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus,<ref>Wiseman, 1995, p.137.</ref> followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches.<ref>See [[Barbette Spaeth|Spaeth, Barbette Stanley]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 36–37.</ref> Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.

After the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay, and was quarried for building materials. The lower levels, ever prone to flooding, were gradually buried under waterlogged alluvial soil and accumulated debris, so that the original track is now buried 6 meters beneath the modern surface. In the 11th century, the Circus was \"replaced by dwellings rented out by the congregation of Saint-Guy.\"<ref>Françoise Choay, (Trans. Lauren M. O'Connell), ''The Invention of the Historic Monument'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 20.</ref> In the 12th century, a watercourse was dug there to drain the soil, and by the 16th century the area was used as a [[market garden]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Partner|first=Peter|title=Renaissance Rome 1500–1559: A Portrait of a Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=An0HYF7hvP4C&pg=PA4|year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03945-2|pages=4, 166}}</ref> Many of the Circus's standing structures survived these changes; in 1587, two obelisks were removed from the central barrier by [[Pope Sixtus V]], and one of these was re-sited at the [[Piazza del Popolo]].<ref name=\"auto3\" /> In 1852 a gas works was built on the site by the  Anglo-Italian Gas Society.

The Circus site now functions as a large park area, in the centre of the city. It is often used for concerts and meetings. The [[Live 8 concert, Rome|Rome concert of Live 8]] (July 2, 2005) was held there. The English band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] performed a concert before an estimated audience of 500,000 people in 2007 (this was filmed and released as [[When in Rome 2007]]). [[The Rolling Stones]] played there in front of 71,527 people on June 22, 2014 for the Italian date of their [[14 On Fire]] tour. The Circus has also hosted victory celebrations, following the Italian [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] victory and the [[A.S. Roma]] [[Serie A]] victory in 2001. In May 2019, a new [[virtual reality|virtual]]/[[augmented reality]] experience, the ''Circo Maximo Experience'', opened on the site, taking visitors on a journey through the site and its history.

Fauci has contributed to the understanding of how [[HIV]] destroys the body's defenses leading to the progression to [[AIDS]]. He has outlined the mechanisms of induction of HIV expression by endogenous [[cytokine]]s.<ref name=\"AACC Lectureship Award 1998\" /> Fauci has worked to develop strategies for the therapy and immune reconstitution of patients with the disease, as well as for a [[vaccine]] to prevent HIV infection. His current research is concentrated on identifying the nature of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of HIV infection and the scope of the body's immune responses to HIV.

In 2003, the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] stated that from 1983 to 2002, \"Fauci was the 13th most-cited scientist among the 2.5 to 3 million authors in all disciplines throughout the world who published articles in scientific journals\".<ref name=\"NIAID\"/>

Fauci also remarked in the hearing: \"As we continue to expedite research while enforcing high safety and efficacy standards, the implementation of the public health measures already known to contain prior Ebola virus outbreaks and the implementation of treatment strategies such as fluid and electrolyte replacement are essential to preventing additional infections, treating those already infected, protecting healthcare providers, and ultimately bringing this epidemic to an end.\"<ref name=\"Guardian Ebola Hearing\"/>

The '''Battle of Keren''' ({{lang|it|Cheren}}) was fought as part of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] during the [[Second World War]]. The engagement took place from 5 February to 1 April 1941, between a mixed Italian army of regular and colonial troops and British troops (mostly from Sudan and British India) and [[Free French]] forces. The town of [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], in the colony of [[Italian East Africa]], was of tactical importance to both sides in 1941. The road and railway through Keren were the main routes to the colonial capital at [[Asmara]] and the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Massawa]], which surrendered to the British after the battle.

==Background==
===Eritrea===
{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}

[[File:Italian East Africa (1938–1941).svg|thumb|[[Italian East Africa]], May 1940, before the conquest of [[British Somaliland]]]]
Colonised by the Italians in 1885, [[Italian Eritrea]] was used as a staging ground for Italian invasions of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] in the First and Second Italo-Abyssinian Wars. The second invasion began in 1935 and Ethiopia fell in 1936. Ethiopia, [[Italian Somaliland]] and Eritrea were combined to form [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'') part of the [[Italian Empire]]. Following the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] ordered his troops to capture the [[British Somaliland]] and border towns in the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[British Kenya|Kenya]].

Eritrea has three climate zones, a coastal region, with a sandy plain and low scrub running inland for {{cvt|10|–|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} in the east with elevations of up to {{cvt|1650|ft|m|disp=flip}}, which is hot and humid for most of the year, with June, September and October the hottest months.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=17}}

At Massawa the average temperature is {{cvt|31|C}} and in summer can reach {{cvt|49|C}} in the shade. Most rain falls in the summer monsoon, with occasional showers in the winter. In the escarpments and valleys, the climate is temperate with only summer monsoon rains, except close to the coast, where there is some winter rain; May is the hottest month. Towards the high plateau, the elevation rises steeply to {{cvt|6000|ft|m|disp=flip}}, with some peaks {{cvt|10000|ft|m|disp=flip}} high and the ground declines to the west. It is cooler, with the monsoon from June to September and light rain in April and May. The temperature is highest during the dry season from November to April and above {{cvt|8500|ft|m|disp=flip}}, sub-alpine temperatures are found.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=17}} The high ground continues into Northern Ethiopia, where the mountains and ravines make ideal defensive terrain.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=173}}

===Middle East Command===
{{main|Middle East Command}}

The British responded by building up a force of more than two [[division (military)|divisions]] in Sudan and three in Kenya by early February 1941. The Sudan-based forces—commanded by Lieutenant-General [[William Platt]] and under the command of General [[Archibald Wavell]] (Commander-in-Chief British [[Middle East Command]])—had invaded Eritrea through [[Kassala]] on 18 January and by 1 February had captured [[Agordat]] about {{cvt|100|mi|km|disp=flip}} further east.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=148–162}}

===Italian Invasion of Sudan===
{{main|Capture of Kassala}}

Anglo-Egyptian Sudan shared a {{cvt|1000|mi|km|disp=flip}} border with the AOI, and on 4 July 1940, was invaded by an Italian force of about {{nowrap|6,500 men}} from Eritrea, which advanced on a railway junction at [[Kassala]] and forced the British garrison of {{nowrap|320 men}} of the SDF and some local police to retire, after inflicting casualties of {{nowrap|43 killed}} and {{nowrap|114 wounded}} for ten casualties.{{sfn|Schreiber|1995|pp=262–263}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=72}} The Italians also drove a platoon of No 3 Company, Eastern Arab Corps (EAC) of the SDF, from the small fort at [[Gallabat]], just over the border from [[Metemma]], about {{cvt|320|km}} south of Kassala and took the villages of [[Qaysān, Qēssan|Qaysān]], [[Kurmuk]] and Dumbode on the [[Blue Nile]]. From there the Italians ventured no further into Sudan, owing to lack of fuel. They proceeded to fortify Kassala with anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts and strong-points, later establishing a brigade-strong garrison. The Italians were disappointed to find no strong anti-British sentiment among the native population.{{sfn|Schreiber|1995|p=295}}{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=170–171}}

==Prelude==
===Keren===
[[File:Map Eritrean Campaign 1941-en.svg|thumb|The advance of Platt's forces into Eritrea]]
[[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] was not [[fortification|fortified]] but it is surrounded on most sides by a jumble of steep granite mountains and sharp ridges which gave the defending forces on the high ground a distinct advantage. ontrol of the mountains provided the Italian artillery with [[Forward observer|perfect observation]] of an attack. The narrow Dongolaas Gorge at {{coord|15|45|34|N|38|25|16.8|E|name=Dongolaas Gorge|type:landmark}} through which the road and railway from Agordat to Keren passed was dominated on the south eastern side by the [[massif]] of Mount Zeban and Mount Falestoh on which stood the imposing defences of Fort Dologorodoc at {{coord|15|45|14.9|N|38|25|30.6|E|name=Fort Dologorodoc|type:landmark}}. The other side of the gorge was commanded by the mass of Mount Sanchil with a saddle of secondary summits, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and Flat Top stretching north-westwards toward Mount Sammana. In front of the Sanchil feature on its south western side was a secondary ridge, feature 1616, which became known as Cameron Ridge, overlooking the Ascidera Valley and the railway line.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=53}}

===Northern front===
The 5th Indian Infantry Division began to arrive in Sudan in early September 1940 and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade was placed on the Red Sea coast to protect Port Sudan, the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade south-west of Kassala and the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade ([[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]]) were sent to Gedaref with the divisional headquarters, to block an Italian attack on Khartoum from Goz Regeb to Gallabat, on a front of {{cvt|320|km}}. [[Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)#Northern Front, Eritrea|Gazelle Force]] (Colonel [[Frank Messervy]]) was formed on 16 October, as a mobile unit to raid Italian territory and delay an Italian advance.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=160}} Late on 30 January, Gazelle Force was ordered to make pursuit of the enemy retreating down the road to Keren.

As the British forces approached Keren, Brigadier-General [[Nicolangelo Carnimeo]], commander of the [[Italian 2nd Eritrean Division|2nd Eritrean Division]] and the X Territorial Defence Command, drew in his 5th and 44th Colonial Brigades from positions to the north. 42nd Brigade had reached Keren from Agordat almost intact, and the 2nd Brigade—which had suffered greater casualties there—was reforming. The 11th Regiment of the Savoia Grenadiers and the Alpini battalion of the 10th Savoia Grenadiers had just arrived after a three-day non-stop truck journey from Addis Ababa while the 11th Colonial Brigade was also in place, having previously been called from reserve in Addis Ababa. Meanwhile, the 6th Brigade—having relinquished its responsibilities at Metemma—was also making its way to Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|pp=37–38}}

==Battle==
{{see also|Order of battle, Keren 1941}}

===5–8 February===
[[File:BattleofKerenMap1941-en.svg|thumb|Sketch map of the Keren battlefield (not to scale)]]
At 08:00 on 1 February 1941, ''Gazelle Force'' was held up in crossing the [[Barka River|Baraka River]] about {{cvt|60|km|mi|-1}} from Keren, where the ''Ponte Mussolini'' had been blown and the approaches to the river mined.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=52}} By noon on 2 February, they were across the river and winding up the Ascidera Valley, until brought to a halt at the Dongolaas Gorge, about {{cvt|6|km|mi|0}} from Keren, where the road had been blocked by the Italians, who blew down the overhanging crags, to fill the gorge with boulders and rocks.

The [[11th Indian Infantry Brigade]], (4th Indian Division) arrived on 3 February, [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the next day and attacked on the left of the gorge on 5 February. The 2nd [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]] fought their way to the top of the ridge called feature 1616, in front of Sanchil and on the night of 6/7 February, the 3/[[14th Punjab Regiment]] passed through and advanced onto Brig's Peak. The Indians were counter-attacked by elements of the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division \"Granatieri di Savoia\"]] (Grenadiers of Savoy) who forced them back towards Cameron Ridge, which was being consolidated by [[104th Wellesley's Rifles|(Wellesley's)]] the 1st Battalion/[[6th Rajputana Rifles]]. The ridge was overlooked in front by Sanchil, to the left by Mount Sammana and from behind by other mountains along the Ascidera Valley. The Cameron Highlanders and Rajputana Rifles clung on, despite frequent attacks and having to carry food, water and ammunition up hill for {{cvt|500|m|ft|-2}}, across exposed terrain.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|pp=53–54}}

By 6 February, the [[5th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (4th Indian Division) had arrived and next day, attacked the Dologorodoc feature east of the gorge, looping right through the Scescilembi Valley (known as Happy Valley) and then attacking from the south-east toward Acqua [[Col]] joining Mount Zelele and Mount Falestoh. On the night of 7 February, a company of [[123rd Outram's Rifles|(Outram's)]] the 4th Battalion/[[6th Rajputana Rifles]] took the col until 4:30&nbsp;am, when they ran out of ammunition and were driven back to a lower feature. On 8 February, having spent most of the day under heavy artillery and mortar fire, they withdrew to their jumping-off positions.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|pp=54–55}}

===10–13 February===
On the afternoon of 10 February, 3/[[1st Punjab Regiment]] attacked Brig's Peak and by the morning of 11 February were on top of Sanchil. The need for men to handle and carry supplies, ammunition and wounded meant there were only two [[platoon]]s to hold the feature.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=55}} Having endured heavy shelling and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire throughout the day, they were forced off Sanchil and Brig's Peak with heavy casualties by a determined counter-attack from the Savoia Grenadiers. Once again the attackers were thrown onto desperate defence on Cameron Ridge. Despite the failure by the Punjabis to hold the important observation posts on Sanchil, the renewed attack on Acqua Col—planned for 12 February—went ahead. The [[29th Indian Infantry Brigade]] of the [[5th Indian Infantry Division]] was brought up from Barentu and put under command of Major-General [[Beresford-Peirse]] (4th Indian Infantry Division) and held in readiness to exploit a break-through. At 05:30, supported by an intensive artillery barrage, the 4/6th Rajputana Rifles once again led the way. [[Richhpal Ram]] was less fortunate and having gained the crest, had a foot blown off and shortly thereafter was mortally wounded. He was awarded a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]] for his exploits on the Col. The 4/[[11th Sikh Regiment]] were pushing up around the side of Acqua Col but the attack could not be carried through, lacking the extra impact that might have come from the 2/[[5th Mahratta Light Infantry]] which had been diverted to reinforce the hard-pressed defences on Cameron Ridge.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=55}}

Platt decided to pause, regroup and train before making a further attempt at Keren. To release road transport to bring forward supplies for a new attack, the 5th Indian Infantry Division returned to Kessala where it could be maintained by the railhead for a period of intensive training until preparations were complete and the division could be brought forward again for the offensive. [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|Skinners Horse]] and most of the Motor Machine Gun companies assembled in front of Arressa and Adi Ugri to pose a threat to the Italian line of reinforcement to Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=42}} From the north, [[Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)#Northern Front, Eritrea|Briggsforce]], comprising two battalions from the [[7th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier [[Harold Rawdon Briggs|Harold Briggs]]) of the 4th Indian Infantry Division and two [[Free French]] battalions. After crossing the border into Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, Briggsforce had captured Karora and then moved south to take Kubkub. In late February, Marching Battalion nº 3 of the Free French Orient Brigade captured Kubkub, becoming the first French unit to engage in combat against Axis forces since the Fall of France. On 1 March, Briggsforce had broken through the Mescelit pass some {{cvt|24|km}} north-east of Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=43}} Briggsforce provided a third potential direction of attack to occupy the Keren defenders and created a threat to [[Massawa]] on the coast, pinning valuable reserves there.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}}

The scene was set for a set-piece battle with Major-General [[Noel Beresford-Peirse]]'s 4th Indian Infantry Division concentrated on the Sanchil side of the gorge and [[Lewis Heath]]'s 5th Indian Infantry Division, brought forward from Kessala once again, on the Happy Valley side. The Keren defences had been reinforced with the arrival of 6th Colonial Brigade from Metemma and also the 11th Blackshirt Battalion of the Savoia Grenadiers. The defenders now totalled 25,000 facing an attacking force which had grown to more than 13,000.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}} Beresford-Pierce would launch the 11th Indian Brigade, expanded to five battalions under command, against the peaks of the Sanchil mass and 5th Brigade against Mount Sammana on the left of his front. On the 5th Division front, the Italian reinforcements on Dologorodoc meant Happy Valley was dominated by the defenders and the attackers' artillery had had to be withdrawn from their forward positions in the valley to safer locations. Without the artillery, it was no longer considered practical to continue the [[flanking manoeuvre|flanking attack]] through Acqua Col to threaten the Dologorodoc [[supply lines|lines of supply]]. Instead, Major-General [[Lewis Heath]] determined that Fort Dologorodoc would be the key objective for his Indian 5th Infantry Division. Gaining the fort would not only give the attacking forces the artillery observation post to direct fire on both sides of the gorge but would expose the reverse slopes of the Dologorodoc mass (which had been immune to his artillery fire and so a haven to the defenders for supplies and reserves) to direct fire from the fort.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}}{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}}

The two offensives were planned to take place one after the other on 15 March so that the full force's artillery could be employed for the preliminary bombardment of them both. At the final meeting on 14 March with his commanders Platt said,

{{quote|Do not let anybody think this is going to be a walkover. It is not. It is going to be a bloody battle: a bloody battle against both enemy and ground. It will be won by the side which lasts longest. I know you will last longer than they do. And I promise you I will last longer than my opposite number.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}}}}

===15–27 March===
At 07:00 on 15 March, the British and Commonwealth troops of 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked from Cameron Ridge making for Sanchil, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and the three peaks of Mount Sammana. That night, the battle ebbed and flowed with attack and counter-attack inflicting very heavy casualties on both sides.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=57}} On the right, 5th Indian Infantry Division launched its attack on the Dologorodoc feature at 10:30 on 15 March. The 2nd [[Highland Light Infantry]] led the attack on the lower features (\"Pimple\" and \"Pinnacle\") but made no progress in the daylight because of fire from the overlooking Sanchil peak, where the Italian defenders had defeated the 11th Brigade assault. They were [[pinned down]], suffering casualties and without supply until darkness provided the opportunity to withdraw.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}} By moonlight that evening, the attack on Dologorodoc was taken up by 9th Brigade, now commanded by the recently promoted Brigadier Messervy. Heath and Messervy planned a near two battalion attack on ''Pimple'' and ''Pinnacle'', with a third battalion ready to pass through and attack the fort. The capture of Pinnacle that night by the 3/5th Mahratta Light Infantry led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Denys Whitehorn Reid|Denys Reid]] (with the 3/[[12th Frontier Force Regiment]] less two companies under command to take ''Pimple''),

{{quote|one of the outstanding small actions of World War II, decisive in its results and formidable in its achievement... Next morning Messervy scrambled up ''Pinnacle'' to congratulate Reid and his Mahrattas and wondered how they had been able to scramble up with their equipment against fierce opposition, when he was finding it a pretty tough job without [either]... At the top, when he saw the victors, he was overcome by the splendour of their feat and his combative amber eyes filled with tears.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=58}}}}

In the early hours of 16 March, the defenders of Fort Dologorodoc counter-attacked ''Pinnacle'' and ''Pimple'' for several hours. The defences at the fort were depleted and during the counter-attack, the 2nd [[West Yorkshire Regiment]] made their way over a seemingly impossible knife-edge to surprise the defenders of the fort. The fort was captured after a determined defence by 06:30 with 40 prisoners taken.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=59}}{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=44}} Finally, Platt had the artillery observation point so greatly needed.

Through 16 March, the Italians counter-attacked while the 29th Brigade made an unsuccessful attack in the evening to Falestoh and Zeban, which was abandoned after dark on 17 March after a day exposed to blistering heat, fierce fighting and no supply.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=59}}{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}} For the next ten days, the 5th Indian Division position at Fort Dologorodoc—exposed to the enemy on three sides—was subject to intense fighting, as the Italians threw in more new units but failed to regain the position.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=44}}

On the Sanchil feature, the 4th Indian Division, with the [[10th Indian Infantry Brigade]] under command, continued to batter away to no avail. On the night of 17/18 March, having suffered many casualties, they withdrew from the slopes of Sanchil and Brig's Peak and the 10th Brigade returned to the 5th Indian Division to reform. The 4th Indian Division continued to hold Hog's Back and Flat Top. Over the next three days, the Italian forces continued to counter-attacks on both sides of the gorge involving desperate, often hand to hand, fighting.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=60}}

[[File:Indian-field-gun-keren.jpg|thumb|British [[QF 18-pounder gun#Second World War|18-pounder]] gun in action at the Battle of Keren]]

Platt decided to regroup and concentrate his forces before attacking again and disbanded Gazelle Force (with Messervy taking over the 9th Indian Brigade) and brought the 5th Indian Infantry Division (which had been mopping up at Agordat) to the front. On 1 March his command was expanded by the arrival of Briggs Force from the north. Although it lacked the artillery for a big attack, Briggs Force drew off a significant part of the Keren garrison. This aided Platt's main offensive, which was being launched from the south-west. Briggs Force also menaced Massawa to the east, obliging the Italians to maintain a reserve on the coast.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=433–437}}

Platt and his commanders decided that the supreme attack should be made through the Dongolaas Gorge. Heath felt that, because of its physical defensive advantages, the Italians might have neglected its defence. On the nights of 16/17 and 17/18 March, escorted engineers reconnoitred the road block and attempted to make a start to clear it. This failed because of fire from the Italian lines. The information led Heath to decide that the key to the gorge was not Sanchil but two smaller features (the ''Railway Bumps'') which overlooked the roadblock and could be approached, with much less opposition, along the railway line from the tunnel below Cameron Ridge.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}

An attack on the defenders at the head of the gorge was planned to give the [[sapper]]s and miners the 48 hours they needed, free of interference from mortar and [[machine gun]] fire, to clear the road. Heath had to wait until the 10th Indian Brigade had refitted after its mauling on the Sanchil feature. The plan was for the 10th Indian Brigade to advance into the gorge while the 9th Indian Brigade (which was holding the Fort Dologorodoc positions) would move down to take three smaller hills overlooking the far end of the gorge; The 29th Brigade would then attack to take Mount Zeban and Mount Canabai, beyond it to the east, which looked down on Keren and guarded the road to Asmara. [[Thomas Wynford Rees|Thomas \"Pete\" Rees]] was appointed to command the 10th Indian Brigade and his predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Bernard Campbell Fletcher|Bernard Fletcher]] was released to form ''Fletcher Force'', a mobile force comprising the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|Central India Horse]] and six [[Matilda II]] tanks, which would be used to exploit the break-through in the gorge and move rapidly into the defenders' rear position to attack their reserves.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}

On 24 March, diversionary attacks were made on Sanchil and just before midnight, the West Yorkshires and the 3/5th Mahrattas in Fort Dologorodoc moved down to take the lower hills overlooking the gorge. The West Yorkshires were able to take their hill unopposed but the Mahrattas met dug-in Italian opposition. By 07:30 the three hills were taken and the defences on the south eastern side of the gorge silenced.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}

At 03:00 on 25 March, the 2nd [[Highland Light Infantry]] and the 4/[[10th Baluch Regiment]] on their right, advanced from the shelter of the railway tunnel, previously cleared by the sappers and miners, up the gorge. A hundred-gun artillery bombardment was raining down on the ridge on Sanchil above (to suppress any defensive fire from this dominating height) and the attack in the gorge achieved surprise, the defenders concentrating on Sanchil. The 3/[[2nd Punjab Regiment]] then advanced between the Baluchis and the West Yorkshires to clear the gorge. By 05:30, the railway bumps and most of the objectives were captured and the defenders no longer held positions from which to direct fire into the gorge below.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=61}}

The sappers and miners laboured on the road while the battles on the Sanchil and Dologorodoc features continued. By midday on 26 March, they had repaired the road through the gorge.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=61}} In the early hours of 27 March, the British artillery turned onto Zeban and Falstoh. The 29th Brigade passed through the 9th Indian Brigade to attack at 04:30 but found the defenders had withdrawn and were able to occupy Falestoh Ridge and the two Zeban summits unopposed.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}} The Italian position was untenable and by first light the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was reporting their withdrawal along the road from Keren to Asmara. The defenders on the Sanchil ridge were less fortunate and the Savoia Grenadiers and Bersaglieri were cut off and with no option but surrender. ''Fletcher Force'' was in Keren by 10:30 and was then sent in pursuit along the Asmara road.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}

From 27 March 1941, the route to Asmara and Massawa was open and Wavell was able to order the 4th Indian Division move to Port Sudan for transport back to [[Egypt]]. On 11 April, the [[President of the United States|US President]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], rescinded the status of the Red Sea as a combat zone under the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]], freeing US merchant ships to use the route to carry supplies to the Middle East.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=181–182}}

===Casualties===
In the 4th Division history of 1948, Stevens gave {{nowrap|3,273 casualties,}} of whom about ten percent were killed.{{sfn|Stevens|1948|p=55}} In 1951, Mackenzie wrote that in the final stages of the battle, the Italians had {{nowrap|5,000 casualties,}} of whom {{nowrap|1,135 men}} were killed.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=60}} In 1954, I.

===Massawa===
[[File:Italians repairing amored vehicle (East Africa) winter 1941.jpg|thumb|Italians repairing an [[Autoblindo Fiat-Ansaldo]] armoured car in East Africa, 1941]]
Rear-Admiral [[Mario Bonetti]], commander of Italian Red Sea Flotilla and the garrison at Massawa, had {{nowrap|10,000 troops}} and about {{nowrap|100 tanks}} to defend the port.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=66}} During the evening of 31 March, three of the last six destroyers at Massawa put to sea, to raid the Gulf of Suez and then scuttle themselves but ''Leone'' ran aground and sank the next morning and the sortie was cancelled. On 2 April the last five destroyers left to attack Port Sudan and then sink themselves.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=441}} Heath telephoned Bonetti with an ultimatum to surrender and not block the harbour by scuttling ships. If this was refused, the British would leave Italian citizens in Eritrea and Ethiopia to fend for themselves. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group sent small forces towards Adowa and Adigrat and the rest advanced down the Massawa road, which declined by {{cvt|2100|m|ft|-3}} in {{cvt|80|km}} and the Indians rendezvoused with Briggs Force, which had cut across country, at Massawa by 5 April.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=441–442}}

Bonetti was called upon to surrender but refused again and on 8 April, an attack by the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group was repulsed. A simultaneous attack by the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and the tanks of B Squadron 4th RTR broke through the defences on the west side. The Free French overran the defences in the south-west, taking Montecullo and Fort Umberto April 7 as the RAF bombed Italian artillery positions. [[Raoul Magrin-Vernerey|Colonel Monclar]] of the [[13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade|13th French Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade]] captured the Italian Admiralty building and accepted Bonetti's surrender, taking {{nowrap|9,590 prisoners}} and {{nowrap|127 guns.}} The harbour was found to have been blocked by the [[Scuttling#Blockade of Massawa (1941)|scuttling]] of two large [[Drydock#Floating|floating dry docks]], {{nowrap|16 large}} ships and a floating crane in the mouths of the north Naval Harbour, the central Commercial Harbour and the main South Harbour. The Italians had also dumped as much of their equipment as possible in the water. The British re-opened the Massawa–Asmara railway on 27 April and by 1 May, the port came into use to supply the 5th Indian Division.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=441–442}}{{efn|[[Edward Ellsberg]] later wrote that after arriving in April, with a salvage crew and specialist equipment, the United States Naval Repair Base, Massawa opened on 8 May for repairs and maintenance.{{sfn|Ellsberg|1946|p=160}}}} The Italian surrender ended organised resistance in Eritrea and fulfilled the strategic objective of ending the threat to shipping in the Red Sea.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=181–182}}

The '''battle of Keren''' (or '''Cheren''', the old Italian spelling) was fought as part of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] during the [[Second World War]]. The engagement took place from 5 February to 1 April 1941, between a mixed Italian army of regular and colonial troops and British (mostly Sudanese and Indian troops under the British flag) and [[Free French]] forces. The town of [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], in the colony of [[Italian East Africa]], was of strategic importance to both sides in 1941. The road and railway through Keren were the main routes to the colonial capital at [[Asmara]] and the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Massawa]], which surrendered to the British after the battle.

==Background==
===Eritrea===
{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}

[[File:Italian East Africa (1938–1941).svg|thumb|[[Italian East Africa]], May 1940, before the conquest of [[British Somaliland]]]]
Colonised by the Italians in 1885, [[Italian Eritrea]] was used as a staging ground for Italian invasions of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] in the First and Second Italo-Abyssinian Wars. The second invasion began in 1935 and Ethiopia fell in 1936. Ethiopia, [[Italian Somaliland]] and Eritrea were combined to form [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'') part of the [[Italian Empire]]. Following the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] ordered his troops to capture the [[British Somaliland]] and border towns in the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[British Kenya|Kenya]].

Eritrea has three climate zones, a coastal region, with a sandy plain and low scrub running inland for {{cvt|10|–|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} in the east with elevations of up to {{cvt|1650|ft|m|disp=flip}}, which is hot and humid for most of the year, with June, September and October the hottest months.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=17}}

At Massawa the average temperature is {{convert|31|C}} and in summer can reach {{convert|49|C}} in the shade. Most rain falls in the summer monsoon, with occasional showers in the winter. In the escarpments and valleys, the climate is temperate with only summer monsoon rains, except close to the coast, where there is some winter rain; May is the hottest month. Towards the high plateau, the elevation rises steeply to {{cvt|6000|ft|m|disp=flip}}, with some peaks {{cvt|10000|ft|m|disp=flip}} high and the ground declines to the west. It is cooler, with the monsoon from June to September and light rain in April and May. The temperature is highest during the dry season from November to April and above {{cvt|8500|ft|m|disp=flip}}, sub-alpine temperatures are found.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=17}} The high ground continues into Northern Ethiopia, where the mountains and ravines make ideal defensive terrain.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=173}}

===Middle East Command===
{{main|Middle East Command}}

The British responded by building up a force of more than two [[division (military)|divisions]] in Sudan and three in Kenya by early February 1941. The Sudan-based forces—commanded by Lieutenant-General [[William Platt]] and under the command of General [[Archibald Wavell]] (Commander-in-Chief British [[Middle East Command]])—had launched an attack into Eritrea through [[Kassala]] on 18 January and by 1 February had captured [[Agordat]] some {{cvt|100|mi|km|disp=flip}} east of Kassala.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=148–162}}

===Italian Invasion of Sudan===
{{main|Capture of Kassala}}

Anglo-Egyptian Sudan shared a {{cvt|1000|mi|km|disp=flip}} border with the AOI, and on 4 July 1940, was invaded by an Italian force of about {{nowrap|6,500 men}} from Eritrea, which advanced on a railway junction at [[Kassala]] and forced the British garrison of {{nowrap|320 men}} of the SDF and some local police to retire, after inflicting casualties of {{nowrap|43 killed}} and {{nowrap|114 wounded}} for ten casualties.{{sfn|Schreiber|1995|pp=262–263}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=72}} The Italians also drove a platoon of No 3 Company, Eastern Arab Corps (EAC) of the SDF, from the small fort at [[Gallabat]], just over the border from [[Metemma]], about {{cvt|320|km}} south of Kassala and took the villages of [[Qaysān, Qēssan|Qaysān]], [[Kurmuk]], and Dumbode on the [[Blue Nile]]. From there the Italians ventured no further into Sudan, owing to lack of fuel. They proceeded to fortify Kassala with anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts and strong-points, later establishing a brigade-strong garrison. The Italians were disappointed to find no strong anti-British sentiment among the native population.{{sfn|Schreiber|1995|p=295}}{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=170–171}}

==Prelude==
===Keren===
[[File:Map Eritrean Campaign 1941-en.svg|thumb|The advance of Platt's forces into Eritrea]]
[[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] had no built-in [[fortification]]s or defensive structures but it is surrounded on most sides by a jumble of steep granite mountains and sharp ridges which gave the defending forces on the high ground a distinct advantage whilst providing their artillery with [[Forward observer|perfect observation]] of any attacking formations. The narrow Dongolaas Gorge at {{coord|15|45|34|N|38|25|16.8|E|name=Dongolaas Gorge|type:landmark}} through which both the road and railway from Agordat to Keren passed was dominated on the south eastern side by the [[massif]] of Mount Zeban and Mount Falestoh on which stood the imposing defences of Fort Dologorodoc at {{coord|15|45|14.9|N|38|25|30.6|E|name=Fort Dologorodoc|type:landmark}}. The other side of the gorge was commanded by the mass of Mount Sanchil with a saddle of secondary summits, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and Flat Top stretching north westwards toward Mount Sammana. In front of the Sanchil feature on its south western side was a secondary ridge, feature 1616, which became known as Cameron Ridge, overlooking the Ascidera Valley and the railway line.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=53}}

===Northern front===
The 5th Indian Division began to arrive in Sudan in early September 1940 and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade was placed on the Red Sea coast to protect Port Sudan, the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade south-west of Kassala and the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade ([[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]]) were sent to Gedaref with the divisional headquarters, to block an Italian attack on Khartoum from Goz Regeb to Gallabat, on a front of {{cvt|320|km}}. [[Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)#Northern Front, Eritrea|Gazelle Force]] (Colonel [[Frank Messervy]]) was formed on 16 October, as a mobile unit to raid Italian territory and delay an Italian advance.{{sfn|Prasad|1963|p=160}} Late on 30 January, Gazelle Force was ordered to make pursuit of the enemy retreating down the road to Keren.

As the British forces approached Keren, Brigadier-General [[Nicolangelo Carnimeo]], commander of the [[Italian 2nd Eritrean Division|2nd Eritrean Division]] and the X Territorial Defence Command, drew in his 5th and 44th Colonial Brigades from positions to the north. 42nd Brigade had reached Keren from Agordat almost intact, and the 2nd Brigade—which had suffered greater casualties there—was reforming. The 11th Regiment of the Savoia Grenadiers and the Alpini battalion of the 10th Savoia Grenadiers had just arrived after a three-day non-stop truck journey from Addis Ababa while the 11th Colonial Brigade was also in place, having previously been called from reserve in Addis Ababa. Meanwhile, the 6th Brigade—having relinquished its responsibilities at Metemma—was also making its way to Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|pp=37–38}}

===5–8 February===
[[File:BattleofKerenMap1941-en.svg|thumb|Sketch map of the Keren battlefield (not to scale)]]
At 08:00 on 1 February 1941, ''Gazelle Force'' was held up in crossing the [[Barka River|Baraka River]] about {{cvt|60|km|mi|-1}} from Keren, where the ''Ponte Mussolini'' had been blown and the approaches to the river mined.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=52}} By noon on 2 February, they were across the river and winding up the Ascidera Valley, until brought to a halt at the Dongolaas Gorge, about {{cvt|6|km|mi|0}} from Keren, where the road had been blocked by the Italians, who blew down the overhanging crags, to fill the gorge with boulders and rocks.

The [[11th Indian Infantry Brigade]], (4th Indian Division) arrived on 3 February, [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the next day and attacked on the left of the gorge on 5 February. The 2nd [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]] fought their way to the top of the ridge called feature 1616, in front of Sanchil and on the night of 6/7 February, the 3/[[14th Punjab Regiment]] passed through and advanced onto Brig's Peak. The Indians were counter-attacked by elements of the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] (Grenadiers of Savoy) who forced them back towards Cameron Ridge, which was being consolidated by [[104th Wellesley's Rifles|(Wellesley's)]] the 1st Battalion/[[6th Rajputana Rifles]]. The ridge was overlooked in front by Sanchil, to the left by Mount Sammana and from behind by other mountains along the Ascidera Valley. The Cameron Highlanders and Rajputana Rifles clung on, despite frequent attacks and having to carry food, water and ammunition up hill for {{cvt|500|m|ft|-2}}, across exposed terrain.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|pp=53–54}}

By 6 February, the [[5th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (4th Indian Division) had arrived and next day, attacked the Dologorodoc feature east of the gorge, looping right through the Scescilembi Valley (known as Happy Valley) and then attacking from the south-east toward Acqua [[Col]] joining Mount Zelele and Mount Falestoh. On the night of 7 February, a company of [[123rd Outram's Rifles|(Outram's)]] the 4th Battalion/[[6th Rajputana Rifles]] took the col until 4:30&nbsp;am, when they ran out of ammunition and were driven back to a lower feature. On 8 February, having spent most of the day under heavy artillery and mortar fire, they withdrew to their jumping-off positions.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|pp=54–55}}

===10–13 February===
On the afternoon of 10 February, 3/[[1st Punjab Regiment]] attacked Brig's Peak and by the morning of 11 February were on top of Sanchil. The need for men to handle and carry supplies, ammunition and wounded meant there were only two [[platoon]]s to hold the feature.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=55}} Having endured heavy shelling and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire throughout the day, they were forced off Sanchil and Brig's Peak with heavy casualties by a determined counter-attack from the Savoia Grenadiers. Once again the attackers were thrown onto desperate defence on Cameron Ridge. Despite the failure by the Punjabis to hold the important observation posts on Sanchil, the renewed attack on Acqua Col—planned for 12 February—went ahead. The [[29th Indian Infantry Brigade]] of the [[5th Indian Infantry Division]] was brought up from Barentu and put under command of Major-General [[Beresford-Peirse]] (4th Indian Infantry Division) and held in readiness to exploit a break-through. At 05:30, supported by an intensive artillery barrage, the 4/6th Rajputana Rifles once again led the way. [[Richhpal Ram]] was less fortunate and having gained the crest, had a foot blown off and shortly thereafter was mortally wounded. He was awarded a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]] for his exploits on the Col. The 4/[[11th Sikh Regiment]] were pushing up around the side of Acqua Col but the attack could not be carried through, lacking the extra impact that might have come from the 2/[[5th Mahratta Light Infantry]] which had been diverted to reinforce the hard-pressed defences on Cameron Ridge.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=55}}

Platt decided to pause, regroup and train before making a further attempt at Keren. To release road transport to bring forward supplies for a new attack, the 5th Indian Infantry Division returned to Kessala where it could be maintained by the railhead for a period of intensive training until preparations were complete and the division could be brought forward again for the offensive. [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|Skinners Horse]] and most of the Motor Machine Gun companies assembled in front of Arressa and Adi Ugri to pose a threat to the Italian line of reinforcement to Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=42}} From the north, [[Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)#Northern Front, Eritrea|Briggsforce]], comprising two battalions from the [[7th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier [[Harold Rawdon Briggs|Harold Briggs]]) of the 4th Indian Infantry Division and two [[Free French]] battalions. After crossing the border into Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, Briggsforce had captured Karora and then moved south to take Kubkub. In late February, Marching Battalion nº 3 of the Free French Orient Brigade captured Kubkub, becoming the first French unit to engage in combat against Axis forces since the Fall of France. On 1 March, Briggsforce had broken through the Mescelit pass some {{cvt|24|km}} north-east of Keren.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=43}} Briggsforce provided a third potential direction of attack to occupy the Keren defenders and created a threat to [[Massawa]] on the coast, pinning valuable reserves there.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}}

====Plan of attack====
[[File:Vickers Wellesley Mk I of No. 47 Squadron on a bombing mission to Keren, Eritrea, 2 April 1941. CM645.jpg|thumb|[[Vickers Wellesley]] of [[No. 47 Squadron RAF]] based at [[Agordat]], Eritrea, in flight during a bombing sortie to Keren]]
The scene was set for a set-piece battle with Major-General [[Noel Beresford-Peirse]]'s 4th Indian Infantry Division concentrated on the Sanchil side of the gorge and [[Lewis Heath]]'s 5th Indian Infantry Division, brought forward from Kessala once again, on the Happy Valley side. The Keren defences had been reinforced with the arrival of 6th Colonial Brigade from Metemma and also the 11th Blackshirt Battalion of the Savoia Grenadiers. The defenders now totalled 25,000 facing an attacking force which had grown to more than 13,000.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}} Beresford-Pierce would launch the 11th Indian Brigade, expanded to five battalions under command, against the peaks of the Sanchil mass and 5th Brigade against Mount Sammana on the left of his front. On the 5th Division front, the Italian reinforcements on Dologorodoc meant Happy Valley was dominated by the defenders and the attackers' artillery had had to be withdrawn from their forward positions in the valley to safer locations. Without the artillery, it was no longer considered practical to continue the [[flanking manoeuvre|flanking attack]] through Acqua Col to threaten the Dologorodoc [[supply lines|lines of supply]]. Instead, Major-General [[Lewis Heath]] determined that Fort Dologorodoc would be the key objective for his Indian 5th Infantry Division. Gaining the fort would not only give the attacking forces the artillery observation post to direct fire on both sides of the gorge but would expose the reverse slopes of the Dologorodoc mass (which had been immune to his artillery fire and so a haven to the defenders for supplies and reserves) to direct fire from the fort.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=56}}{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}}

The two offensives were planned to take place one after the other on 15 March so that the full force's artillery could be employed for the preliminary bombardment of them both. At the final meeting on 14 March with his commanders Platt said,

{{quote|Do not let anybody think this is going to be a walkover. It is not. It is going to be a bloody battle: a bloody battle against both enemy and ground. It will be won by the side which lasts longest. I know you will last longer than they do. And I promise you I will last longer than my opposite number.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}}}}

===15–27 March===
At 07:00 on 15 March, the British and Commonwealth troops of 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked from Cameron Ridge making for Sanchil, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and the three peaks of Mount Sammana. That night, the battle ebbed and flowed with attack and counter-attack inflicting very heavy casualties on both sides.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=57}} On the right, 5th Indian Infantry Division launched its attack on the Dologorodoc feature at 10:30 on 15 March. The 2nd [[Highland Light Infantry]] led the attack on the lower features (\"Pimple\" and \"Pinnacle\") but made no progress in the daylight because of fire from the overlooking Sanchil peak, where the Italian defenders had defeated the 11th Brigade assault. They were [[pinned down]], suffering casualties and without supply until darkness provided the opportunity to withdraw.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}} By moonlight that evening, the attack on Dologorodoc was taken up by 9th Brigade, now commanded by the recently promoted Brigadier Messervy. Heath and Messervy planned a near two battalion attack on ''Pimple'' and ''Pinnacle'', with a third battalion ready to pass through and attack the fort. The capture of Pinnacle that night by the 3/5th Mahratta Light Infantry led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Denys Whitehorn Reid|Denys Reid]] (with the 3/[[12th Frontier Force Regiment]] less two companies under command to take ''Pimple''),

{{quote|one of the outstanding small actions of World War II, decisive in its results and formidable in its achievement... Next morning Messervy scrambled up ''Pinnacle'' to congratulate Reid and his Mahrattas and wondered how they had been able to scramble up with their equipment against fierce opposition, when he was finding it a pretty tough job without [either]... At the top, when he saw the victors, he was overcome by the splendour of their feat and his combative amber eyes filled with tears.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=58}}}}

In the early hours of 16 March, the defenders of Fort Dologorodoc counter-attacked ''Pinnacle'' and ''Pimple'' for several hours. The defences at the fort were depleted and during the counter-attack, the 2nd [[West Yorkshire Regiment]] made their way over a seemingly impossible knife-edge to surprise the defenders of the fort. The fort was captured after a determined defence by 06:30 with 40 prisoners taken.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=59}}{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=44}} Finally, Platt had the artillery observation point so greatly needed.

Through 16 March, the Italians counter-attacked while the 29th Brigade made an unsuccessful attack in the evening to Falestoh and Zeban, which was abandoned after dark on 17 March after a day exposed to blistering heat, fierce fighting and no supply.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=59}}{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§4}} For the next ten days, the 5th Indian Division position at Fort Dologorodoc—exposed to the enemy on three sides—was subject to intense fighting, as the Italians threw in more new units but failed to regain the position.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=44}}

On the Sanchil feature, the 4th Indian Division, with the [[10th Indian Infantry Brigade]] under command, continued to batter away to no avail. On the night of 17/18 March, having suffered many casualties, they withdrew from the slopes of Sanchil and Brig's Peak and the 10th Brigade returned to the 5th Indian Division to reform. The 4th Indian Division continued to hold Hog's Back and Flat Top. Over the next three days, the Italian forces continued to counter-attacks on both sides of the gorge involving desperate, often hand to hand, fighting.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=60}}

[[File:Indian-field-gun-keren.jpg|thumb|British [[QF 18-pounder gun#Second World War|18-pounder]] gun in action at the Battle of Keren]]

Platt decided to regroup and concentrate his forces before attacking again and disbanded Gazelle Force (with Messervy taking over the 9th Indian Brigade) and brought the 5th Indian Infantry Division (which had been mopping up at Agordat) to the front. On 1 March his command was expanded by the arrival of Briggs Force from the north. Although it lacked the artillery for a big attack, Briggs Force drew off a significant part of the Keren garrison. This aided Platt's main offensive, which was being launched from the south-west. Briggs Force also menaced Massawa to the east, obliging the Italians to maintain a reserve on the coast.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=433–437}}

Platt and his commanders decided that the supreme attack should be made through the Dongolaas Gorge. Heath felt that, because of its physical defensive advantages, the Italians might have neglected its defence. On the nights of 16/17 and 17/18 March, escorted engineers reconnoitred the road block and attempted to make a start to clear it. This failed because of fire from the Italian lines. The information led Heath to decide that the key to the gorge was not Sanchil but two smaller features (the ''Railway Bumps'') which overlooked the roadblock and could be approached, with much less opposition, along the railway line from the tunnel below Cameron Ridge.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}

An attack on the defenders at the head of the gorge was planned to give the [[sapper]]s and miners the 48 hours they needed, free of interference from mortar and [[machine gun]] fire, to clear the road. Heath had to wait until the 10th Indian Brigade had refitted after its mauling on the Sanchil feature. The plan was for the 10th Indian Brigade to advance into the gorge while the 9th Indian Brigade (which was holding the Fort Dologorodoc positions) would move down to take three smaller hills overlooking the far end of the gorge; The 29th Brigade would then attack to take Mount Zeban and Mount Canabai, beyond it to the east, which looked down on Keren and guarded the road to Asmara. [[Thomas Wynford Rees|Thomas \"Pete\" Rees]] was appointed to command the 10th Indian Brigade and his predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Bernard Campbell Fletcher|Bernard Fletcher]] was released to form ''Fletcher Force'', a mobile force comprising the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|Central India Horse]] and six [[Matilda II]] tanks, which would be used to exploit the break-through in the gorge and move rapidly into the defenders' rear position to attack their reserves.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}

On 24 March, diversionary attacks were made on Sanchil and just before midnight, the West Yorkshires and the 3/5th Mahrattas in Fort Dologorodoc moved down to take the lower hills overlooking the gorge. The West Yorkshires were able to take their hill unopposed but the Mahrattas met dug-in Italian opposition. By 07:30 the three hills were taken and the defences on the south eastern side of the gorge silenced.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}

At 03:00 on 25 March, the 2nd [[Highland Light Infantry]] and the 4/[[10th Baluch Regiment]] on their right, advanced from the shelter of the railway tunnel, previously cleared by the sappers and miners, up the gorge. A hundred-gun artillery bombardment was raining down on the ridge on Sanchil above (to suppress any defensive fire from this dominating height) and the attack in the gorge achieved surprise, the defenders concentrating on Sanchil. The 3/[[2nd Punjab Regiment]] then advanced between the Baluchis and the West Yorkshires to clear the gorge. By 05:30, the railway bumps and most of the objectives were captured and the defenders no longer held positions from which to direct fire into the gorge below.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=61}}

The sappers and miners laboured on the road while the battles on the Sanchil and Dologorodoc features continued. By midday on 26 March, they had repaired the road through the gorge.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=61}} In the early hours of 27 March, the British artillery turned onto Zeban and Falstoh. The 29th Brigade passed through the 9th Indian Brigade to attack at 04:30 but found the defenders had withdrawn and were able to occupy Falestoh Ridge and the two Zeban summits unopposed.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}} The Italian position was untenable and by first light the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was reporting their withdrawal along the road from Keren to Asmara. The defenders on the Sanchil ridge were less fortunate and the Savoia Grenadiers and Bersaglieri were cut off and with no option but surrender. ''Fletcher Force'' was in Keren by 10:30 and was then sent in pursuit along the Asmara road.{{sfn|Brett-James|1951|loc=§5}}

From 27 March 1941, the route to Asmara and Massawa was open and Wavell was able to order the 4th Indian Division move to Port Sudan for transport back to [[Egypt]]. On 11 April, the [[President of the United States|US President]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], rescinded the status of the Red Sea as a combat zone under the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]], freeing US merchant ships to use the route to carry supplies to the Middle East.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=181–182}}

===Casualties===
In the 4th Division history of 1948, Stevens gave {{nowrap|3,273 casualties,}} of whom about ten percent were killed.{{sfn|Stevens|1948|p=55}} In 1951, Mackenzie wrote that in the final stages of the battle, the Italians had {{nowrap|5,000 casualties,}} of whom {{nowrap|1,135 men}} were killed.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=60}} In 1954, I. S. O. Playfair, the British official historian, recorded that Italian troops and [[Eritrean Ascari]] had {{nowrap|3,000 casualties.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=439}} In 1993, Raugh wrote that {{nowrap|3,000 Italian}} troops were killed and that British casualties were {{nowrap|536 men}} killed and {{nowrap|3,229 wounded}}.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=181}} An informal review of Bruttini and Puglisi (1957) found that about {{nowrap|3,000 Italian}} soldiers were killed, {{nowrap|4,500 wounded}} and sick, {{nowrap|9,000 Askari}} killed and nearly {{nowrap|20,000 wounded}} giving totals of {{nowrap|12,147 killed}} and {{nowrap|21,700 men}} wounded.{{sfn|Bruttini|Puglisi|1957|p=}}

===Massawa===
[[File:Italians repairing amored vehicle (East Africa) winter 1941.jpg|thumb|Italians repairing an [[Autoblindo Fiat-Ansaldo]] armoured car in East Africa, 1941]]
Rear-Admiral [[Mario Bonetti]], commander of Italian Red Sea Flotilla and the garrison at Massawa, had {{nowrap|10,000 troops}} and about {{nowrap|100 tanks}} to defend the port.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=66}} During the evening of 31 March, three of the last six destroyers at Massawa put to sea, to raid the Gulf of Suez and then scuttle themselves but ''Leone'' ran aground and sank the next morning and the sortie was cancelled. On 2 April the last five destroyers left to attack Port Sudan and then sink themselves.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=441}} Heath telephoned Bonetti with an ultimatum to surrender and not block the harbour by scuttling ships. If this was refused, the British would leave Italian citizens in Eritrea and Ethiopia to fend for themselves. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group sent small forces towards Adowa and Adigrat and the rest advanced down the Massawa road, which declined by {{cvt|2100|m|ft|-3}} in {{cvt|80|km}} and the Indians rendezvoused with Briggs Force, which had cut across country, at Massawa by 5 April.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=441–442}}

Bonetti was called upon to surrender but refused again and on 8 April, an attack by the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group was repulsed. A simultaneous attack by the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and the tanks of B Squadron 4th RTR broke through the defences on the west side. The Free French overran the defences in the south-west, taking Montecullo and Fort Umberto April 7 as the RAF bombed Italian artillery positions. [[Raoul Magrin-Vernerey|Colonel Monclar]] of the [[13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade|13th French Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade]] captured the Italian Admiralty building and accepted Bonetti's surrender, taking {{nowrap|9,590 prisoners}} and {{nowrap|127 guns.}} The harbour was found to have been blocked by the [[Scuttling#Blockade of Massawa (1941)|scuttling]] of two large [[Drydock#Floating|floating dry docks]], {{nowrap|16 large}} ships and a floating crane in the mouths of the north Naval Harbour, the central Commercial Harbour and the main South Harbour. The Italians had also dumped as much of their equipment as possible in the water. The British re-opened the Massawa–Asmara railway on 27 April and by 1 May, the port came into use to supply the 5th Indian Division.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=441–442}}{{efn|[[Edward Ellsberg]] later wrote that after arriving in April, with a salvage crew and specialist equipment, the United States Naval Repair Base, Massawa opened on 8 May for repairs and maintenance.{{sfn|Ellsberg|1946|p=160}}}} The Italian surrender ended organised resistance in Eritrea and fulfilled the strategic objective of ending the threat to shipping in the Red Sea.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=181–182}}

Bradley is unhappy with her initial wardrobe and camera tests, so she challenges the copy Mia is providing her, and dispenses with the clothing chosen for her by Alex. Fred summons Alex to browbeat her in front of a room of network executives, but she informs him that he lost power over the show long ago, and from now on they will be doing things her way.

==Critical response==
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 63% approval rating, based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 5.66/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Flashy, but somewhat frivolous, ''The Morning Show'' often feels more like a vanity project than the hard-hitting drama it aspires to be—but there is pleasure to be had in watching Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon give it their all.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title= The Morning Show: Season 1 (2019) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_morning_show/s01 |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= December 24, 2019 }}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{Cite web |title= The Morning Show: Season 1 |url= https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show |website= [[Metacritic]] |access-date= December 23, 2019}}</ref>

[[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave a positive review and wrote: \"''The Morning Show'' doesn't have the cinematic gravitas of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[The Loudest Voice]]'' or the [[Aaron Sorkin]] poetry of [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Newsroom (American TV series)|The Newsroom]]''. It's more along the lines of the solid but underachieving ''[[Sports Night]]'' TV series from the late 1990s.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= 29 October 2019 |last= Roeper |first= Richard |author-link=Richard Roeper |title= Sex scandal a wakeup call for news team on AppleTV+’s solid, starry new series ''The Morning Show'' |url= https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/29/20938259/morning-show-review-appletv-apple-tv-plus-streaming-for-all-mankind-dickinson-jennifer-aniston |website= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>

Elsewhere, conservative reporter Bradley Jackson becomes a viral sensation after a video of her angrily fact-checking a coal mine protester is posted on social media. Bradley quits following a confrontation with her boss and, after an argument with her family, is asked to appear on ''The Morning Show'' for an interview.

Forced to go along with Alex's announcement or lose face, network head Fred Micklen is furious, but Cory sees Bradley as an opportunity to reinvent the show and eventually be rid of Alex. Bradley is unhappy with her initial wardrobe and camera tests, so she challenges the copy Mia is providing her, and dispenses with the clothing chosen for her by Alex. Fred summons Alex to browbeat her in front of a room of network executives, but she informs him that he lost power over the show long ago, and from now on they will be doing things her way.

Alex is convinced to give Bradley the interview with one of Mitch's accusers, but Bradley goes off script and the accuser reveals more than the producers had planned. Meanwhile, an investigation is launched by human resources into Mitch's conduct, with most of the crew offering their support to Mitch and denying knowledge of his sexual misconduct.

==Critical response==
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 63% approval rating, based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 5.66/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Flashy, but somewhat frivolous, ''The Morning Show'' often feels more like a vanity project than the hard-hitting drama it aspires to be—but there is pleasure to be had in watching Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon give it their all.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title= The Morning Show: Season 1 (2019) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_morning_show/s01 |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= December 24, 2019 }}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{Cite web |title= The Morning Show: Season 1 |url= https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show |website= [[Metacritic]] |access-date= December 23, 2019}}</ref>

[[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave a positive review and wrote: \"''The Morning Show'' doesn't have the cinematic gravitas of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[The Loudest Voice]]'' or the [[Aaron Sorkin]] poetry of [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Newsroom (American TV series)|The Newsroom]]''. It's more along the lines of the solid but underachieving ''[[Sports Night]]'' TV series from the late 1990s.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= 29 October 2019 |last= Roeper |first= Richard |author-link=Richard Roeper |title= Sex scandal a wakeup call for news team on AppleTV+’s solid, starry new series ''The Morning Show'' |url= https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/29/20938259/morning-show-review-appletv-apple-tv-plus-streaming-for-all-mankind-dickinson-jennifer-aniston |website= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>

SkylArk]]'' (1974–76) and when he played Tom Good in the [[BBC]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' (1975–78), that he became a household name. Later, he starred as Martin in ''[[Ever Decreasing Circles]]'' (1984–89), and he had a leading role as Hector in ''[[Monarch of the Glen (TV series)|Monarch of the Glen]]'' (2000–05).

Fellow television star [[Penelope Keith]] said, \"He was always courteous, always generous and always self-deprecating\" adding, \"He was also such a clever actor that he made you feel secure.

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', critic [[Michael Coveney]] described  Briers as \"always the most modest and self-deprecating of actors, and the sweetest of men,\" and noted: \"Although he excelled in the plays of Alan Ayckbourn, and became a national figure in his television sitcoms of the 1970s and 80s, notably ''The Good Life'', he could mine hidden depths on stage, giving notable performances in [[Ibsen]], [[Chekhov]] and, for Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance company, [[Shakespeare]].\"<ref name=\"Coveney\"/>

The '''Parachutist Badge''', also commonly referred to as \"Jump Wings\" is a [[Military badges of the United States|military badge]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. The [[United States Coast Guard]] is the only [[United States Armed Forces|branch]] that does not issue its own Parachutist Badge, but its members are authorized to receive the Parachutist Badges of other services in accordance with their prescribed requirements. The DoD military services are all awarded the same Basic Parachutist Badge. The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] issue the same Senior and Master Parachutist Badges while the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] issue the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Badge to advanced parachutists. The majority of the services earn their Basic Parachutist Badge through the [[United States Army Airborne School|U.S. Army Airborne School]].

==Army==
The Army's Basic Parachutist Badge is awarded to all military personnel of any service who complete the [[United States Army Airborne School|US Army Basic Airborne Course]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It signifies that the soldier is a trained military [[Paratrooper|parachutist]], and is qualified to participate in airborne operations. The badge and its sew-on equivalent may be worn on the Army Combat Uniform (ACU).<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/TIOH/docs/Changes%20to%20Wear%20of%20Army%20ACU.pdf Army Directive 2011-11, Change to Wear of the Army Combat Uniform (ACU) Items] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510011151/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/TIOH/docs/Changes%20to%20Wear%20of%20Army%20ACU.pdf |date=10 May 2012 }}, Secretary of the Army, 13 June 2011, last accessed 18 February 2013</ref>

The original Army Parachutist Badge was designed in 1941 by [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] (later [[Lieutenant General]]) [[William P. Yarborough]] and approved by the Department of War in March of that year. The Parachutist Badge replaced the \"Parachutist Patch\" which had previously been worn as a large patch on the side of a paratrooper's garrison cap. LTG Yarborough also designed the Senior and Master Parachutist Badges and the addition of stars to portray the number of combat jumps. The flash that is worn behind the badge is also a contribution of [[William P. Yarborough]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qmfound.com/parachute_badge.htm |title=U.S. Army Parachute Badge|work=US Army Quartermaster Museum |first=K |last=Born |year=1998 |accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>

The original background trimming was also a contribution of William P. Yarborough.<ref name=\"Oval\"/>  Each unit's background trimming design is created and approved by the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]] (TIOH) who evaluate unit lineage, military heraldry, as well as proposed designs by unit members themselves.  Once approved, the institute publishes manufacturing instructions to authorized companies for manufacturing.<ref name=\"AR670-1\">[https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN6173_AR670-1_Web_FINAL.pdf Army Regulation 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia], dated 25 May 2017, last accessed 2 January 2020</ref>

===Combat Jump Device===
If a soldier completes an airborne jump into a combat zone, they are authorized to wear a Combat Jump Device on their Parachutist Badge. The device consists of a star or arrangements of stars, indicating the number of combat jumps.<ref name=\"USAIH\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Badges/parachutists.aspx|title=US Army Badges|publisher=US Army Institute of Heraldry|accessdate=8 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615100232/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Badges/parachutists.aspx|archivedate=15 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The use of stars as Combat Jump Devices did not gain official approval until after the 1983 invasion of Grenada ([[Operation Urgent Fury]]). The stars are awarded as follows:<ref name=\"Army Quartermaster Museum\">[http://qmfound.com/parachute_badge.htm U.S. Army Parachute Badge], U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum, last accessed 18 February 2013</ref><ref name=\"AR670-1\"/>

==Air Force==
Like the Army, the Air Force issues the same parachutist badges in the same three degrees (Basic, Senior, & Master) but have different criteria for the awarding of these badges. The level of degree is determined by the number of jumps the wearer has successfully completed, years of service on jump status, and other requirements as specified by AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges.<ref name=\"AFI 11-402\">[http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3_5/publication/afi11-402/afi11-402.pdf AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112010936/http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3_5/publication/afi11-402/afi11-402.pdf |date=12 January 2014 }}, U.S. Air Force Instructions, dated 13 December 2010, last accessed 11 January 2014</ref>

In 1956 the Air Force began issuing a unique Basic, Senior, and Master Parachutist Badges. These parachutist badges were modeled after the [[United States Air Force Medical Service|Air Force's Medical Badges]]. Due to popular demand, the Air Force decided to revert to issuing the Army style parachutist badges in 1963.<ref>[http://usafflagranks.com/usaf_obsolete_insignia.html Obsolete USAF Insignia], USAF Flag Ranks website, last accessed 1 June 2012</ref>

===Basic Parachutist Badge===
The Basic Parachutist Badge may be awarded following completion of basic parachute training through a designated Air Force Air-Ground Training Program. Air Force personnel generally earn the basic parachutist badge either through the Army's [[Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], or the [[United States Air Force Academy]]'s AM-490 freefall parachute training course taught by [[Air Education and Training Command|AETC]]'s [[98th Flying Training Squadron]].<ref name=\"AFI 11-402\"/>

===Senior Parachutist Badge===
The Senior Parachutist Badge consists of the Basic Parachutist Badge with a star atop the parachute. Awarded for 30 static line jumps with a minimum of 24 months of cumulative time on jump status. The 30 jumps must include: (1) Two jumps during the hours of darkness; (2) Fifteen jumps with operational equipment IAW AFI 11-410; (3) Actually perform one night jump as a Primary JM (PJM); and (4) Seven jumps performing as PJM.<ref name=\"static.e-publishing.af.mil\">http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3/publication/afi11-402/afi11-402.pdf#page=119</ref>

===Master Parachutist Badge===
The Master Parachutist Insignia consists of the Senior Parachutist Badge with a star centered within the wreath. Awarded for 65 static line jumps with a minimum of 36 months of cumulative time on jump status. The 65 jumps must include: (1) Four jumps during the hours of darkness; (2) Twenty-five jumps with operational equipment IAW AFI 11-410; (3) Two night jumps performing PJM duties; and (4) Fifteen jumps performing as PJM.<ref name=\"static.e-publishing.af.mil\"/>

Qualified Army and Air Force personnel may go on to earn the Military Freefall Parachutist Badge in special operations training for High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) jumps. HALO/HAHO training is conducted by the [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] of the [[US Army Special Operations Command]], on behalf of the [[US Special Operations Command]]. It is awarded in two degrees: Basic and Master. To earn the basic badge, the jumper must have graduated from Army Airborne School and the Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course.<ref name=\"MFFPC\">[http://www.soc.mil/SWCS/SWCS%20Courses/COURSE%20PDF/2nd%20Bn/Military%20Free-Fall%20Parachute%20Course%202E-S14X-ASI4X-011%20ASIW8.pdf MFFPC ATRRS Information Changes], U.S. Army Special Operations Center of Excellence, last accessed 22 April 2017</ref> To earn the master badge, jumpers must have graduated from Army Airborne School, Army Jumpmaster School, Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course, and the Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course.<ref name=\"MFFJMC\">[http://www.soc.mil/SWCS/SWCS%20Courses/COURSE%20PDF/2nd%20Bn/Military%20Free%20Jumpmaster%20Course%202E-F287011-F120%20(os-x).pdf Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course (MFFJMC)], U.S. Army Special Operations Center of Excellence, last accessed 22 April 2017</ref>

As with the Army's Parachutist Badges, US Army parachutist that have earned one of the Military Freefall Parachutist Badges are also eligible to earn Combat Jump Devices.<ref name=\"AR600-8-22\"/><ref name=\"AR670-1\"/><ref name=\"HAHO\"/>

==Navy and Marine Corps==
The United States Navy and Marine Corps issue parachutist insignia in two degrees: the U.S. Military Basic Parachutist Badge, also called the Basic Parachutist Insignia (the same badge that's awarded to all DoD military services), and the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia. Parachutist insignia is available to personnel who perform jumps as a:<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\">[http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/MCO%203120.11.pdf U.S. Marine Corps Order 3120.11, U.S. Marine Corps Parachuting Policy and Program Administration], dated 4 May 2009, last accessed 18 February 2013</ref>
* Static-Line Parachute Jumper,
* Military Free-Fall Parachute Jumper, and
* High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) Parachute Jumper (used for premeditated personnel parachute (P3) operations).

Training is accomplished by successful completion of the prescribed course of instruction while attending the:<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>
* [[United States Army Airborne School|U.S. Army Airborne School]],
* [[Military Freefall Parachutist Badge#Training|Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course]], or
* other training certified by Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET) or approved by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO).

===Basic Parachutist Insignia===
The right to wear the Basic Parachutist Insignia is based on the completion of prescribed training defined in MCO 3120.11.:<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

When an enlisted member initially qualifies as a static line parachutist, an entry shall be made on NAVPERS 1070/613 (commonly referred to as a \"Page 13\" entry) of the service record indicating the date of qualification, type(s) of aircraft in which qualified, and unit at which the training was received. Enlisted members are authorized the parachutist '''(PJ)''' [[List of United States Navy enlisted warfare designations|designator]] added to their rating.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

A qualified static-line parachute jumper who successfully completes the prescribed program of instruction while attending a formal, interservice training facility including a minimum of 10 military free-fall parachute jumps, at least 2 of which must have been conducted carrying full combat equipment (1 day/1 night), may qualify. Enlisted members are authorized the military free-fall parachutist '''(FPJ)''' designator added to their rating.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

When an officer initially qualifies as a static line parachutist, the [[United States military occupation codes#Commissioned Officer Designators|additional qualification designator]] (AQD) of BT1 will be entered into the officer's record by their detailer (NAVPERS). Free-fall qualification will result in an AQD of BT2.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

For both Static Line and Military Free Fall Parachutist qualified personnel, a service record entry shall also indicate whether or not the member is HALO-qualified.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

The Basic Parachutist Badge is a prerequisite for the [[Special Warfare Badge]] since parachutist training is an integral part of the Navy's [[United States Navy SEALs|Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL]] (BUD/S) program. SEAL personnel generally do not wear the Basic badge once they earn their [[Special Warfare insignia]], but will wear their Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Badge in addition to the Special Warfare Badge, the latter nicknamed the \"Budweiser\" badge. [[United States Navy EOD|Navy EOD]] technicians are generally also jump qualified with a number of them also being qualified in military free-fall ([[HALO jump|HALO/HAHO]]). Currently, due to a recent change, newly pinned Navy EOD technicians are required to attend the U.S. Army's Basic Airborne School upon graduation. As well, a number of [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen|SWCC]] personnel earn Basic Parachutist badges in conjunction with their assignment to a Special Boat Team detachment that uses the [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen#Maritime Craft Aerial Deployment System (MCADS)|Maritime Craft Air Delivery System (MCADS)]]. This enables them to drop small watercraft and their crews from [[C-130]] aircraft.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

===Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia===
The Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia (originally issued as Navy Parachute Rigger wings) is a gold-colored embroidered or metal insignia depicting an open parachute with outstretched wings. It is authorized for officers and enlisted personnel who were awarded the Basic Parachutist Insignia and, under competent orders, have completed a minimum of five additional [[Static line|static-line]] or P3 jumps, to include: ''(1) combat equipment day jump, two (2) combat equipment night jumps, and employ at least two (2) different types of military aircraft.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>''

The U.S Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist badge was originally known as the U.S. Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge and designed by American Insignia Company in 1942 for graduates of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School. During WWII, despite being against uniform regulations it became common for U.S. Marine Corps paratroopers who were issued the silver U.S. Army Basic Parachutist badge to wear the gold Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge because they believed the gold \"Rigger wings\" looked better on their uniform.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Chris|title=Paramarine!: Uniforms and Equipment of Marine Corps Parachute Units in World War II|date=2004|publisher=Schiffer Pub Ltd|isbn=9780764319242|pages=175–177}}</ref> This out of regulations wearing of the Parachute Rigger badge became so common that in July 1963, the Commander of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]] Bruce F. Meyers sent a request to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[George W. Anderson Jr.]] via Marine Corps [[Commandant]] General [[David M. Shoup]] requesting to officially make the Navy Parachute Rigger badge the parachutist badge for the Navy and Marine Corps. The request was approved by Admiral Anderson on July 12, 1963 per BuPers Notice 1020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evolution of Naval Wings|url=http://uscgaviationhistory.aoptero.org/images/APP20.pdf|website=Coast Guard Aviation History|publisher=THE U.S. COAST GUARD AVIATION ASSOCIATION}}</ref> Since 1963, being a graduate of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School is no longer a requirement to earn the badge. To be awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia did, however, require the parachutist to have completed the minimum five additional jumps in a jump billet.

The '''Parachutist Badge''', also commonly referred to as \"Jump Wings\" is a [[Military badges of the United States|military badge]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. The [[United States Coast Guard]] is the only [[United States Armed Forces|branch]] that does not issue its own Parachutist Badge, but its members are authorized to receive the Parachutist Badges of other services in accordance with their prescribed requirements. The DoD military services are all awarded the same Basic Parachutist Badge. The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] issue the same Senior and Master Parachutist Badges while the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] issue the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Badge to advanced parachutists. The majority of the services earn their Basic Parachutist Badge through the [[United States Army Airborne School|U.S. Army Airborne School]].

==Army==
The Army's Basic Parachutist Badge is awarded to all military personnel of any service who complete the [[United States Army Airborne School|US Army Basic Airborne Course]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It signifies that the soldier is a trained military [[Paratrooper|parachutist]], and is qualified to participate in airborne operations. The badge and its sew-on equivalent may be worn on the Army Combat Uniform (ACU).<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/TIOH/docs/Changes%20to%20Wear%20of%20Army%20ACU.pdf Army Directive 2011-11, Change to Wear of the Army Combat Uniform (ACU) Items] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510011151/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/TIOH/docs/Changes%20to%20Wear%20of%20Army%20ACU.pdf |date=10 May 2012 }}, Secretary of the Army, 13 June 2011, last accessed 18 February 2013</ref>

The original Army Parachutist Badge was designed in 1941 by [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] (later [[Lieutenant General]]) [[William P. Yarborough]] and approved by the Department of War in March of that year. The Parachutist Badge replaced the \"Parachutist Patch\" which had previously been worn as a large patch on the side of a paratrooper's garrison cap. LTG Yarborough also designed the Senior and Master Parachutist Badges and the addition of stars to portray the number of combat jumps. The flash that is worn behind the badge is also a contribution of [[William P. Yarborough]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qmfound.com/parachute_badge.htm |title=U.S. Army Parachute Badge|work=US Army Quartermaster Museum |first=K |last=Born |year=1998 |accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>

===Basic Parachutist Badge===
To be eligible for award of the basic Parachutist Badge, an individual must have completed the Basic Airborne Course of the Airborne School of the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia. To graduate, a student must complete the three-phase course consisting of a ground phase, a tower phase, and a jump phase. By the end of the course, a student will have completed five jumps in varying jump configurations, from a \"no load\" jump all the way to a full combat load jump at night.<ref name=\"AR600-8-22\"/>

===Senior Parachutist Badge===
To be eligible for the Senior Parachutist Badge, an individual must have been rated excellent in character and efficiency and have met the following requirements:
# Participated in a minimum of 30 jumps including fifteen jumps with combat equipment to consist of normal TOE equipment including individual weapon carried in combat whether the jump was in actual or simulated combat. In cases of simulated combat the equipment will include water, rations (actual or dummy), ammunition (actual or dummy), and other essential items necessary to sustain an individual in combat. Two night jumps must also be made during the hours of darkness (regardless of time of day with respect to sunset) one of which will be as jumpmaster of a stick. In addition, two mass tactical jumps which culminate in an airborne assault problem with either a unit equivalent to a battalion or larger; a separate company battery; or an organic staff of regimental size or larger.

Like the Army, the Air Force issues the same parachutist badges in the same three degrees (Basic, Senior, & Master) but have different criteria for the awarding of these badges. The level of degree is determined by the number of jumps the wearer has successfully completed, years of service on jump status, and other requirements as specified by AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges.<ref name=\"AFI 11-402\">[http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3_5/publication/afi11-402/afi11-402.pdf AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112010936/http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3_5/publication/afi11-402/afi11-402.pdf |date=12 January 2014 }}, U.S. Air Force Instructions, dated 13 December 2010, last accessed 11 January 2014</ref>

In 1956 the Air Force began issuing a unique Basic, Senior, and Master Parachutist Badges. These parachutist badges were modeled after the [[United States Air Force Medical Service|Air Force's Medical Badges]]. Due to popular demand, the Air Force decided to revert to issuing the Army style parachutist badges in 1963.<ref>[http://usafflagranks.com/usaf_obsolete_insignia.html Obsolete USAF Insignia], USAF Flag Ranks website, last accessed 1 June 2012</ref>

===Basic Parachutist Badge===
The Basic Parachutist Badge may be awarded following completion of basic parachute training through a designated Air Force Air-Ground Training Program. Air Force personnel generally earn the basic parachutist badge either through the Army's [[Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], or the [[United States Air Force Academy]]'s AM-490 freefall parachute training course taught by [[Air Education and Training Command|AETC]]'s [[98th Flying Training Squadron]].<ref name=\"AFI 11-402\"/>

===Senior Parachutist Badge===
The Senior Parachutist Badge consists of the Basic Parachutist Badge with a star atop the parachute. Awarded for 30 static line jumps with a minimum of 24 months of cumulative time on jump status. The 30 jumps must include: (1) Two jumps during the hours of darkness; (2) Fifteen jumps with operational equipment IAW AFI 11-410; (3) Actually perform one night jump as a Primary JM (PJM); and (4) Seven jumps performing as PJM.<ref name=\"static.e-publishing.af.mil\">http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3/publication/afi11-402/afi11-402.pdf#page=119</ref>

===Master Parachutist Badge===
The Master Parachutist Insignia consists of the Senior Parachutist Badge with a star centered within the wreath. Awarded for 65 static line jumps with a minimum of 36 months of cumulative time on jump status. The 65 jumps must include: (1) Four jumps during the hours of darkness; (2) Twenty-five jumps with operational equipment IAW AFI 11-410; (3) Two night jumps performing PJM duties; and (4) Fifteen jumps performing as PJM.<ref name=\"static.e-publishing.af.mil\"/>

Qualified Army and Air Force personnel may go on to earn the [[Military Freefall Parachutist Badge]] in special operations training for High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) jumps. HALO/HAHO training is conducted by the [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] of the [[US Army Special Operations Command]], on behalf of the [[US Special Operations Command]]. It is awarded in two degrees: Basic and Master. To earn the basic badge, the jumper must have graduated from Army Airborne School and the Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course.<ref name=\"MFFPC\">[http://www.soc.mil/SWCS/SWCS%20Courses/COURSE%20PDF/2nd%20Bn/Military%20Free-Fall%20Parachute%20Course%202E-S14X-ASI4X-011%20ASIW8.pdf MFFPC ATRRS Information Changes], U.S. Army Special Operations Center of Excellence, last accessed 22 April 2017</ref> To earn the master badge, jumpers must have graduated from Army Airborne School, Army Jumpmaster School, Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course, and the Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course.<ref name=\"MFFJMC\">[http://www.soc.mil/SWCS/SWCS%20Courses/COURSE%20PDF/2nd%20Bn/Military%20Free%20Jumpmaster%20Course%202E-F287011-F120%20(os-x).pdf Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course (MFFJMC)], U.S. Army Special Operations Center of Excellence, last accessed 22 April 2017</ref>

The United States Navy and Marine Corps issue parachutist insignia in two degrees: the U.S. Military Basic Parachutist Badge, also called the Basic Parachutist Insignia (the same badge that's awarded to all DoD military services), and the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia. Parachutist insignia is available to personnel who perform jumps as a:<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\">[http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/MCO%203120.11.pdf U.S. Marine Corps Order 3120.11, U.S. Marine Corps Parachuting Policy and Program Administration], dated 4 May 2009, last accessed 18 February 2013</ref>
* Static-Line Parachute Jumper,
* Military Free-Fall Parachute Jumper, and
* High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) Parachute Jumper (used for premeditated personnel parachute (P3) operations).

Training is accomplished by successful completion of the prescribed course of instruction while attending the:<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>
* [[United States Army Airborne School|U.S. Army Airborne School]],
* [[Military Freefall Parachutist Badge#Training|Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course]], or
* other training certified by Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET) or approved by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO).

===Basic Parachutist Insignia===
The right to wear the Basic Parachutist Insignia is based on the completion of prescribed training defined in MCO 3120.11.:<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

When an enlisted member initially qualifies as a static line parachutist, an entry shall be made on NAVPERS 1070/613 (commonly referred to as a \"Page 13\" entry) of the service record indicating the date of qualification, type(s) of aircraft in which qualified, and unit at which the training was received. Enlisted members are authorized the parachutist '''(PJ)''' [[List of United States Navy enlisted warfare designations|designator]] added to their rating.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

A qualified static-line parachute jumper who successfully completes the prescribed program of instruction while attending a formal, interservice training facility including a minimum of 10 military free-fall parachute jumps, at least 2 of which must have been conducted carrying full combat equipment (1 day/1 night), may qualify. Enlisted members are authorized the military free-fall parachutist '''(FPJ)''' designator added to their rating.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

When an officer initially qualifies as a static line parachutist, the [[United States military occupation codes#Commissioned Officer Designators|additional qualification designator]] (AQD) of BT1 will be entered into the officer's record by their detailer (NAVPERS). Free-fall qualification will result in an AQD of BT2.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

For both Static Line and Military Free Fall Parachutist qualified personnel, a service record entry shall also indicate whether or not the member is HALO-qualified.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

The Basic Parachutist Badge is a prerequisite for the [[Special Warfare Badge]] since parachutist training is an integral part of the Navy's [[United States Navy SEALs|Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL]] (BUD/S) program. SEAL personnel generally do not wear the Basic badge once they earn their [[Special Warfare insignia]], but will wear their Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Badge in addition to the Special Warfare Badge, the latter nicknamed the \"Budweiser\" badge. [[United States Navy EOD|Navy EOD]] technicians are generally also jump qualified with a number of them also being qualified in military free-fall ([[HALO jump|HALO/HAHO]]). Currently, due to a recent change, newly pinned Navy EOD technicians are required to attend the U.S. Army's Basic Airborne School upon graduation. As well, a number of [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen|SWCC]] personnel earn Basic Parachutist badges in conjunction with their assignment to a Special Boat Team detachment that uses the [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen#Maritime Craft Aerial Deployment System (MCADS)|Maritime Craft Air Delivery System (MCADS)]]. This enables them to drop small watercraft and their crews from [[C-130]] aircraft.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>

===Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia===
The Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia (originally issued as Navy Parachute Rigger wings) is a gold-colored embroidered or metal insignia depicting an open parachute with outstretched wings. It is authorized for officers and enlisted personnel who were awarded the Basic Parachutist Insignia and, under competent orders, have completed a minimum of five additional [[Static line|static-line]] or P3 jumps, to include: ''(1) combat equipment day jump, two (2) combat equipment night jumps, and employ at least two (2) different types of military aircraft.<ref name=\"MCO 3120.11\"/>''

The U.S Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist badge was originally known as the U.S. Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge and designed by American Insignia Company in 1942 for graduates of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School. During WWII, despite being against uniform regulations it became common for U.S. Marine Corps paratroopers who were issued the silver U.S. Army Basic Parachutist badge to wear the gold Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge because they believed the gold \"Rigger wings\" looked better on their uniform.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Chris|title=Paramarine!: Uniforms and Equipment of Marine Corps Parachute Units in World War II|date=2004|publisher=Schiffer Pub Ltd|isbn=9780764319242|pages=175–177}}</ref> This out of regulations wearing of the Parachute Rigger badge became so common that in July 1963, the Commander of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]] Bruce F. Meyers sent a request to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[George W. Anderson Jr.]] via Marine Corps [[Commandant]] General [[David M. Shoup]] requesting to officially make the Navy Parachute Rigger badge the parachutist badge for the Navy and Marine Corps. The request was approved by Admiral Anderson on July 12, 1963 per BuPers Notice 1020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evolution of Naval Wings|url=http://uscgaviationhistory.aoptero.org/images/APP20.pdf|website=Coast Guard Aviation History|publisher=THE U.S. COAST GUARD AVIATION ASSOCIATION}}</ref> Since 1963, being a graduate of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School is no longer a requirement to earn the badge. To be awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia did, however, require the parachutist to have completed the minimum five additional jumps in a jump billet.

Enquiry into the '''evolution of ageing''' aims to explain why survival, reproductive success, and functioning of almost all living organisms decline at old age. Leading hypotheses<ref name=\"williams\">{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=George C. |title=Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence |journal=Evolution |date=December 1957 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=398–411 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1957.tb02911.x |jstor=2406060 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kirkwood |first1=T.

This process is known as '''self-maintenance'''.

==Theories and hypotheses==

=== The beginning ===
[[August Weismann]] was responsible for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of [[Darwinian]] evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program to make room for the next generation in order to sustain the turnover that is necessary for evolution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Weismann A.|title=Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|year=1889}} Work that describes Weismann's theory about making room for the young.</ref>  The idea that the ageing characteristic was selected (an adaptation) because of its deleterious effect was largely discounted for much of the 20th century, but a theoretical model suggests that altruistic ageing could evolve if there is little migration among populations.<ref name=\"Yang_altruistic_aging\">{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jiang-Nan | name-list-format = vanc |year=2013|title=Viscous populations evolve altruistic programmed ageing in ability conflict in a changing environment |url=http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v15/2825.html |journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research |volume=15 |pages=527–543 }}</ref> Weismann later abandoned his theory and later followed up with his \"programmed death\" theory.

===Mutation accumulation===
The first modern theory of [[mammal]] ageing was formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952. This theory formed in the previous decade with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and his [[selection shadow]] concept. The development of human civilization has shifted the selective shadow as the conditions that humans now live in include improved quality of victuals, living conditions, and healthcare. This improved healthcare includes modern medicine such as antibiotics and new medical technology.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\">{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Partridge|first2=Linda|date=2018-08-20|title=Horizons in the evolution of aging|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|journal=BMC Biology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=93|doi=10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|issn=1741-7007|pmc=6100731|pmid=30124168}}</ref> Their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect, as nature is a highly competitive place. Almost all animals die in the wild from predators, disease, or accidents, which lowers the average age of death. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit for the long haul because [[selection pressure]] is low for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would have died anyway. Evolution has not had an opportunity to select against deadly diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Metabolic diseases come along due to the low demand for physical activity in modern civilization compared to times where humans had to forage in the wild for survival.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\"/> With the selective shadow now shifted, humans must deal with these new selective pressures.

Medawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation.'' This theory is based on the idea that random, germline mutations occur that are detrimental to overall health and survival later in life. Overall, senescence would occur through a summation of deleterious mutations, and would explain the overall phenotypic damage we associate with ageing.

===Antagonistic pleiotropy===
{{main|Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis}}
Medawar's theory was critiqued and later further developed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957. Williams noted that senescence may be causing many deaths even if animals are not 'dying of old age.'<ref name=\"williams\" /> He began his hypothesis with the idea that ageing can cause earlier senescence due to the competitive nature of life. Even a small amount of ageing can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care and ageing is not cost-free.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter AJ, Nguyen AQ | title = Antagonistic pleiotropy as a widespread mechanism for the maintenance of polymorphic disease alleles | journal = BMC Medical Genetics | volume = 12 | pages = 160 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22151998 | pmc = 3254080 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2350-12-160 }}</ref>

Williams eventually proposed his own hypothesis called antagonistic ''[[pleiotropy]]''. Pleiotropy, alone, means one mutation that cause multiple effects on [[phenotype]].<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/03374-X |chapter=Senescence: Genetic Theories |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences |pages=13897–902 |year=2001 |last1=Curtsinger |first1=J.W. |isbn=978-0-08-043076-8 }}</ref> Antagonistic pleiotropy on the other hand deals with one gene that creates two traits with one being beneficial and the other being detrimental. In essence, this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but accumulate a cost later on.<ref name=\"williams\" />

Although antagonistic pleiotropy is a prevailing theory today, this is largely by default, and has not been well verified. Research has shown that this is not true for all genes and may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but it cuts the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.

In breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their [[fertility]]. His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artifact.<ref name=\"pmid28564485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leroi AM, Chippindale AK, Rose MR | title = Long-term laboratory evolution of a genetic life-history tradeoff in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. 1.

===Disposable soma theory===
{{main|Disposable soma theory of aging}}
A third mainstream theory of ageing, the '[[Disposable soma theory of aging|'Disposable soma'' theory'']], proposed in 1977 by [[Tom Kirkwood|Thomas Kirkwood]], presumes that the body must budget the resources available to it. The body uses resources derived from the environment for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance, and the body must compromise when there is a finite supply of resources. The theory states that this compromise causes the body to reallocate energy to the repair function that causes the body to gradually deteriorate with age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirkwood TB | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = 5635 | pages = 301–4 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 593350 | doi = 10.1038/270301a0 | bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }} Origin of the disposable soma theory.</ref>

A caveat to this theory suggests that this reallocation of energy is based on time instead of limiting resources. This concept focuses on the evolutionary pressure to reproduce in a set, optimal time period that is dictated by age and ecological niche. The way that this is successful is through the allocation of time and energy in damage repair at the cellular level resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer [[gestation]]. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C | title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853–6 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22071624 | doi = 10.4161/cc.10.22.18302 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Heuvel J, English S, Uller T | title = Disposable Soma Theory and the Evolution of Maternal Effects on Ageing | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = e0145544 | date = 2016-01-11 | pmid = 26752635 | pmc = 4709080 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145544 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1145544V | veditors = Criscuolo F }}</ref>

<!-- This paragraph should just be removed. Effects of CR are completely in line with DST. -->
One opposing argument is based on [[caloric restriction]] (CR) effect, which has demonstrated an increase in life.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction| vauthors = Weindruch R, Walford IL |publisher=Thomas |year=1986 |location=Springfield, IL }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weindruch R | title = The retardation of aging by caloric restriction: studies in rodents and primates | journal = Toxicologic Pathology | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 742–5 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8994305 | doi = 10.1177/019262339602400618 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Masoro EJ | title = Overview of caloric restriction and ageing | journal = Mechanisms of Ageing and Development | volume = 126 | issue = 9 | pages = 913–22 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 15885745 | doi = 10.1016/j.mad.2005.03.012 }} Overview of caloric restriction and aging.</ref> But dietary restriction has not been shown to increase lifetime reproductive success (fitness), because when food availability is lower, reproductive output is also lower. Moreover, calories are not the only resource of possibly limited supply to an organism that could have an effect on multiple dimensions of fitness.

===DNA damage/error theory===
{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}

The [[DNA damage theory of aging]] postulates that DNA damage is ubiquitous in the biological world and is the primary cause of ageing.<ref name=\"pmid7031747\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gensler HL, Bernstein H | title = DNA damage as the primary cause of aging | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–303 | date = September 1981 | pmid = 7031747 | doi = 10.1086/412317 }}</ref> The theory is based off the idea that ageing occurs over time due to the damage of the DNA. As an example, studies of mammalian brain and muscle have shown that DNA repair capability is relatively high during early development when cells are dividing mitotically, but declines substantially as cells enter the post-mitotic state.<ref name=\"pmid7286098\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gensler HL | title = Low level of U.V.-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in postmitotic brain cells of hamsters: possible relevance to aging | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–207 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7286098 | doi = 10.1016/0531-5565(81)90046-2 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid559680\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Karran P, Moscona A, Strauss B | title = Developmental decline in DNA repair in neural retina cells of chick embryos.

This impairs gene [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and causes the progressive loss of cellular and tissue functions that define aging.

{{citation needed span|date=October 2019|text=Damage theories suggest that external/environmental factors cause damage to cells over time through a number of various methods.  One such theory is the free radical or rate of living theory which relies on the assumption that the speed at which an organism is able to metabolize oxygen is directly correlated to the release of destructive atoms which break down the cell.  The destructive atoms, known as free radicals, are released during oxygen basal metabolism and collide with healthy cells material causing breakdown, and eventual cell death.  All organisms have this oxygen basal metabolism, however it is the rate at which oxygen is broken down that determines the rate at which cells die.  For Instance, a fly has an incredible metabolic rate, so because of this they expend oxygen quickly causing cell hastened cell death which can explain their life span of only 2-3 weeks.

===Programmed maintenance theories===
Theories, such as Weismann's \"programmed death\" theory, suggest that deterioration and death due to ageing are a purposeful result of an organism's evolved design, and are referred to as theories of programmed ageing or adaptive ageing.

The programmed maintenance theory based on [[evolvability]]<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Goldsmith T |year=2009|title=Mammal aging: active and passive mechanisms |journal=Journal of Bioscience Hypotheses|volume=2|issue=2|pages=59–64|doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.12.002}} Article compares programmed and non-programmed maintenance theories of ageing in light of empirical evidence.</ref> suggests that the repair mechanisms are controlled by a common control mechanism capable of sensing conditions, such as caloric restriction, and may be responsible for lifespan in particular species. In this theory, the survival techniques are based on control mechanisms instead of individual maintenance mechanism, which you see in the non-programmed theory of mammal ageing.

A non-programmed theory of mammal ageing<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Holliday R | title = Aging is no longer an unsolved problem in biology | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1067 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16803964 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1354.002 | bibcode = 2006NYASA1067....1H }}</ref> states that different species possess different capabilities for maintenance and repair. Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative processes. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, have less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are a wide variety of ageing manifestations that appear to have very different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.

=== Selective Shadowing ===
Selective Shadowing is ideally one of the evolutionary theories of aging which reveals that selection of an individual generally decreases once they essentially pass the sexual mature phase. As a result, this forms a shadow without the account of sexual fitness, which is no longer considered as an individual ages. Essentially this supports the idea that the force of natural selection declines as a function of age, which was first introduced by Peter B. Medewar and J.B.S Haldane. \"The key conceptual insight that allowed Medawar, Williams, and others, to develop the evolutionary theory of aging is based on the notion that the force of natural selection, a measure of how effectively selection acts on survival rate or [[Fecundity selection|fecundity]] as a function of age, declines with progressive age.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=W.D.|date=1966-09|title=The moulding of senescence by natural selection|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-5193(66)90184-6|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=12–45|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(66)90184-6|issn=0022-5193}}</ref>

Medewar developed a model that highlights this, showing the decrease in the survival rate of a population as an individual ages, however the reproduction rate stays constant. The reproduction probability typically peaks during sexual maturity and decreases as an individual ages, while the rest of the population decreases with age as they enter the selection shadow. The model also supports Medewars' theory that due to dangerous and unpredicted conditions in the environment such as diseases, climate changes and predators, many individuals die not too long after sexual maturation. Consequently, the probability of an individual surviving and suffering from age related effects is relatively low. In the same way, many beneficial mutations are selected against if they have a positive effect on an individual later on in life. For instance if a beneficial or deleterious mutation occurs only after an individual's reproductive phase, then it will not affect fitness, which therefore can not be selected against. Subsequently, these later mutations and effects are considered to be in the \"shadow region\" of selection.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Schmidt|first2=Paul S.|date=2009-10|title=Integrating evolutionary and molecular genetics of aging|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects|volume=1790|issue=10|pages=951–962|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010|issn=0304-4165}}</ref>


== Natural selection ==

===Group selection===
{{Main|Group selection}}
Group selection is based on the idea that all members of a given group will either succeed or fail together depending on the circumstance. With this mechanism, genetic drift occurs collectively to all in the group and sets them apart from other groups of its own species. This is different than individual selection, as it focuses on the group rather than the individual.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mitteldorf, J.|year=2006|title=Chaotic population dynamics and the evolution of ageing: proposing a demographic theory of senescence|url=http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v08/1726.html |journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research |volume=8|pages=561–74}} On population dynamics as a mechanism for the evolution of ageing.</ref>

Often also postreproductive individuals make intergenerational transfers: [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[pilot whale]]s guard their grandchildren; there is cooperative breeding in some mammals, many insects and about 200 species of birds; sex differences in the survival of anthropoid primates tend to correlate with the care to offspring; or an [[Efe people|Efe]] infant is often attended by more than 10 people. Lee developed a formal theory integrating selection due to transfers (at all ages) with selection due to fertility.<ref name=\"pmid12878733\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee RD | title = Rethinking the evolutionary theory of aging: transfers, not births, shape senescence in social species | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 16 | pages = 9637–42 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12878733 | pmc = 170970 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1530303100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.9637L }}</ref>

===Evolvability===
{{Main|Evolvability}}
Evolvability is based on the idea that an organism adapts genetically to its present environment.

Skulachev (1997)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Skulachev VP | title = Aging is a specific biological function rather than the result of a disorder in complex living systems: biochemical evidence in support of Weismann's hypothesis | journal = Biochemistry. Biokhimiia | volume = 62 | issue = 11 | pages = 1191–5 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9467841 }}</ref> has suggested that programmed ageing assists the evolution process by providing a gradually increasing challenge or obstacle to survival and reproduction, and therefore enhancing the selection of beneficial characteristics.

Goldsmith (2008)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldsmith TC | title = Aging, evolvability, and the individual benefit requirement; medical implications of aging theory controversies | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 252 | issue = 4 | pages = 764–8 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18396295 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.02.035 }}</ref> proposed that though increasing the generation rate and evolution rate is beneficial for a species, it is also important to limit lifespan so older individuals will not dominate the [[gene pool]].

Yang (2013)'s model<ref name=\"Yang_altruistic_aging\" /> is also based on the idea that ageing accelerates the accumulation of novel adaptive genes in local populations. However, Yang changed the terminology of \"evolvability\" into \"genetic creativity\" throughout his paper to facilitate the understanding of how ageing can have a shorter-term benefit than the word \"evolvability\" would imply.

However, they proposed that even though the actual rate of aging can be an adaptation the aging itself is inevitable. In other words, evolution can change the speed of aging but some ageing no matter how slow will always occur.

=== Mortality ===
Mortality is the number of deaths in a particular group of people over a specific time period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|date=2011-02-02|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> There are two types of mortality: intrinsic and [[extrinsic mortality]]. Intrinsic mortality is thought to be a result of ageing from insider factors, whereas extrinsic is a direct result of environmental factors. An example would be that bats have fewer predators, and therefore have a low extrinsic mortality. Birds are warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5–10 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals, and have a lower extrinsic mortality.

When examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and they would have a lower intrinsic mortality.

==Biogerontology ==
{{Main|Gerontology}}
Theories of ageing affect efforts to understand and find treatments for age-related conditions:

*Those who believe in the idea that ageing is an unavoidable side effect of some necessary function (antagonistic pleiotropy or disposable soma theories) logically tend to believe that attempts to delay ageing would result in unacceptable side effects to the necessary functions. Altering ageing is therefore \"impossible\",<ref name=\"williams\"/> and study of ageing mechanisms is of only academic interest.
*Those believing in default theories of multiple maintenance mechanisms tend to believe that ways might be found to enhance the operation of some of those mechanisms. Perhaps they can be assisted by antioxidants or other agents.
*Those who believe in programmed ageing suppose that ways might be found to interfere with the operation of the part of the ageing mechanism that appears to be common to multiple symptoms, essentially \"slowing down the clock\" and delaying multiple manifestations. Such effect might be obtained by fooling a sense function. One such effort is an attempt to find a \"mimetic\" that would \"mime\" the anti-ageing effect of [[calorie restriction]] without having to actually radically restrict diet.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen D, Guarente L | title = SIR2: a potential target for calorie restriction mimetics | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 64–71 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17207661 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2006.12.004 }}</ref>

Enquiry into the '''evolution of ageing''' aims to explain why survival, reproductive success, and functioning of almost all living organisms decline at old age.

This process is known as '''self-maintenance'''.

==Theories and hypotheses==

=== The beginning ===
[[August Weismann]] was responsible for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of [[Darwinian]] evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program to make room for the next generation in order to sustain the turnover that is necessary for evolution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Weismann A.|title=Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|year=1889}} Work that describes Weismann's theory about making room for the young.</ref>  The idea that the ageing characteristic was selected (an adaptation) because of its deleterious effect was largely discounted for much of the 20th century, but a theoretical model suggests that altruistic ageing could evolve if there is little migration among populations.<ref name=\"Yang_altruistic_aging\">{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jiang-Nan | name-list-format = vanc |year=2013|title=Viscous populations evolve altruistic programmed ageing in ability conflict in a changing environment |url=http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v15/2825.html |journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research |volume=15 |pages=527–543 }}</ref> Weismann later abandoned his theory and later followed up with his \"programmed death\" theory.

===Mutation accumulation===
The first modern theory of [[mammal]] ageing was formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952. This theory formed in the previous decade with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and his [[selection shadow]] concept. The development of human civilization has shifted the selective shadow as the conditions that humans now live in include improved quality of victuals, living conditions, and healthcare. This improved healthcare includes modern medicine such as antibiotics and new medical technology.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\">{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Partridge|first2=Linda|date=2018-08-20|title=Horizons in the evolution of aging|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|journal=BMC Biology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=93|doi=10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|issn=1741-7007|pmc=6100731|pmid=30124168}}</ref> Their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect, as nature is a highly competitive place. Almost all animals die in the wild from predators, disease, or accidents, which lowers the average age of death. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit for the long haul because [[selection pressure]] is low for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would have died anyway. Evolution has not had an opportunity to select against deadly diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Metabolic diseases come along due to the low demand for physical activity in modern civilization compared to times where humans had to forage in the wild for survival.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\"/> With the selective shadow now shifted, humans must deal with these new selective pressures.

Medawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation.'' This theory is based on the idea that random, germline mutations occur that are detrimental to overall health and survival later in life. Overall, senescence would occur through a summation of deleterious mutations, and would explain the overall phenotypic damage we associate with ageing.

===Antagonistic pleiotropy===
{{main|Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis}}
Medawar's theory was critiqued and later further developed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957. Williams noted that senescence may be causing many deaths even if animals are not 'dying of old age.'<ref name=\"williams\" /> He began his hypothesis with the idea that ageing can cause earlier senescence due to the competitive nature of life. Even a small amount of ageing can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care and ageing is not cost-free.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter AJ, Nguyen AQ | title = Antagonistic pleiotropy as a widespread mechanism for the maintenance of polymorphic disease alleles | journal = BMC Medical Genetics | volume = 12 | pages = 160 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22151998 | pmc = 3254080 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2350-12-160 }}</ref>

Williams eventually proposed his own hypothesis called antagonistic ''[[pleiotropy]]''. Pleiotropy, alone, means one mutation that cause multiple effects on [[phenotype]].<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/03374-X |chapter=Senescence: Genetic Theories |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences |pages=13897–902 |year=2001 |last1=Curtsinger |first1=J.W. |isbn=978-0-08-043076-8 }}</ref> Antagonistic pleiotropy on the other hand deals with one gene that creates two traits with one being beneficial and the other being detrimental. In essence, this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but accumulate a cost later on.<ref name=\"williams\" />

Although antagonistic pleiotropy is a prevailing theory today, this is largely by default, and has not been well verified. Research has shown that this is not true for all genes and may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but it cuts the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.

In breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their [[fertility]]. His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artifact.<ref name=\"pmid28564485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leroi AM, Chippindale AK, Rose MR | title = Long-term laboratory evolution of a genetic life-history tradeoff in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. 1.

===Disposable soma theory===
{{main|Disposable soma theory of aging}}
A third mainstream theory of ageing, the '[[Disposable soma theory of aging|'Disposable soma'' theory'']], proposed in 1977 by [[Tom Kirkwood|Thomas Kirkwood]], presumes that the body must budget the resources available to it. The body uses resources derived from the environment for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance, and the body must compromise when there is a finite supply of resources. The theory states that this compromise causes the body to reallocate energy to the repair function that causes the body to gradually deteriorate with age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirkwood TB | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = 5635 | pages = 301–4 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 593350 | doi = 10.1038/270301a0 | bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }} Origin of the disposable soma theory.</ref>

A caveat to this theory suggests that this reallocation of energy is based on time instead of limiting resources. This concept focuses on the evolutionary pressure to reproduce in a set, optimal time period that is dictated by age and ecological niche. The way that this is successful is through the allocation of time and energy in damage repair at the cellular level resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer [[gestation]]. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C | title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853–6 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22071624 | doi = 10.4161/cc.10.22.18302 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Heuvel J, English S, Uller T | title = Disposable Soma Theory and the Evolution of Maternal Effects on Ageing | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = e0145544 | date = 2016-01-11 | pmid = 26752635 | pmc = 4709080 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145544 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1145544V | veditors = Criscuolo F }}</ref>

<!-- This paragraph should just be removed. Effects of CR are completely in line with DST. -->
One opposing argument is based on [[caloric restriction]] (CR) effect, which has demonstrated an increase in life.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction| vauthors = Weindruch R, Walford IL |publisher=Thomas |year=1986 |location=Springfield, IL }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weindruch R | title = The retardation of aging by caloric restriction: studies in rodents and primates | journal = Toxicologic Pathology | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 742–5 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8994305 | doi = 10.1177/019262339602400618 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Masoro EJ | title = Overview of caloric restriction and ageing | journal = Mechanisms of Ageing and Development | volume = 126 | issue = 9 | pages = 913–22 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 15885745 | doi = 10.1016/j.mad.2005.03.012 }} Overview of caloric restriction and aging.</ref> But dietary restriction has not been shown to increase lifetime reproductive success (fitness), because when food availability is lower, reproductive output is also lower. Moreover, calories are not the only resource of possibly limited supply to an organism that could have an effect on multiple dimensions of fitness.

===DNA damage/error theory===
{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}

The [[DNA damage theory of aging]] postulates that DNA damage is ubiquitous in the biological world and is the primary cause of ageing.<ref name=\"pmid7031747\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gensler HL, Bernstein H | title = DNA damage as the primary cause of aging | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–303 | date = September 1981 | pmid = 7031747 | doi = 10.1086/412317 }}</ref> The theory is based off the idea that ageing occurs over time due to the damage of the DNA. As an example, studies of mammalian brain and muscle have shown that DNA repair capability is relatively high during early development when cells are dividing mitotically, but declines substantially as cells enter the post-mitotic state.<ref name=\"pmid7286098\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gensler HL | title = Low level of U.V.-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in postmitotic brain cells of hamsters: possible relevance to aging | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–207 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7286098 | doi = 10.1016/0531-5565(81)90046-2 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid559680\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Karran P, Moscona A, Strauss B | title = Developmental decline in DNA repair in neural retina cells of chick embryos.

This impairs gene [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and causes the progressive loss of cellular and tissue functions that define aging.

{{citation needed span|date=October 2019|text=Damage theories suggest that external/environmental factors cause damage to cells over time through a number of various methods.  One such theory is the free radical or rate of living theory which relies on the assumption that the speed at which an organism is able to metabolize oxygen is directly correlated to the release of destructive atoms which break down the cell.  The destructive atoms, known as free radicals, are released during oxygen basal metabolism and collide with healthy cells material causing breakdown, and eventual cell death.  All organisms have this oxygen basal metabolism, however it is the rate at which oxygen is broken down that determines the rate at which cells die.  For Instance, a fly has an incredible metabolic rate, so because of this they expend oxygen quickly causing cell hastened cell death which can explain their life span of only 2-3 weeks.

Theories, such as Weismann's \"programmed death\" theory, suggest that deterioration and death due to ageing are a purposeful result of an organism's evolved design, and are referred to as theories of programmed ageing or adaptive ageing.

The programmed maintenance theory based on [[evolvability]]<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Goldsmith T |year=2009|title=Mammal aging: active and passive mechanisms |journal=Journal of Bioscience Hypotheses|volume=2|issue=2|pages=59–64|doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.12.002}} Article compares programmed and non-programmed maintenance theories of ageing in light of empirical evidence.</ref> suggests that the repair mechanisms are controlled by a common control mechanism capable of sensing conditions, such as caloric restriction, and may be responsible for lifespan in particular species. In this theory, the survival techniques are based on control mechanisms instead of individual maintenance mechanism, which you see in the non-programmed theory of mammal ageing.

A non-programmed theory of mammal ageing<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Holliday R | title = Aging is no longer an unsolved problem in biology | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1067 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16803964 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1354.002 | bibcode = 2006NYASA1067....1H }}</ref> states that different species possess different capabilities for maintenance and repair. Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative processes. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, have less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are a wide variety of ageing manifestations that appear to have very different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.

== Natural selection ==

===Group selection===
{{Main|Group selection}}
Group selection is based on the idea that all members of a given group will either succeed or fail together depending on the circumstance. With this mechanism, genetic drift occurs collectively to all in the group and sets them apart from other groups of its own species. This is different than individual selection, as it focuses on the group rather than the individual.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mitteldorf, J.|year=2006|title=Chaotic population dynamics and the evolution of ageing: proposing a demographic theory of senescence|url=http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v08/1726.html |journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research |volume=8|pages=561–74}} On population dynamics as a mechanism for the evolution of ageing.</ref>

Often also postreproductive individuals make intergenerational transfers: [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[pilot whale]]s guard their grandchildren; there is cooperative breeding in some mammals, many insects and about 200 species of birds; sex differences in the survival of anthropoid primates tend to correlate with the care to offspring; or an [[Efe people|Efe]] infant is often attended by more than 10 people. Lee developed a formal theory integrating selection due to transfers (at all ages) with selection due to fertility.<ref name=\"pmid12878733\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee RD | title = Rethinking the evolutionary theory of aging: transfers, not births, shape senescence in social species | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 16 | pages = 9637–42 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12878733 | pmc = 170970 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1530303100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.9637L }}</ref>

===Evolvability===
{{Main|Evolvability}}
Evolvability is based on the idea that an organism adapts genetically to its present environment.

Skulachev (1997)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Skulachev VP | title = Aging is a specific biological function rather than the result of a disorder in complex living systems: biochemical evidence in support of Weismann's hypothesis | journal = Biochemistry. Biokhimiia | volume = 62 | issue = 11 | pages = 1191–5 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9467841 }}</ref> has suggested that programmed ageing assists the evolution process by providing a gradually increasing challenge or obstacle to survival and reproduction, and therefore enhancing the selection of beneficial characteristics.

Goldsmith (2008)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldsmith TC | title = Aging, evolvability, and the individual benefit requirement; medical implications of aging theory controversies | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 252 | issue = 4 | pages = 764–8 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18396295 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.02.035 }}</ref> proposed that though increasing the generation rate and evolution rate is beneficial for a species, it is also important to limit lifespan so older individuals will not dominate the [[gene pool]].

Yang (2013)'s model<ref name=\"Yang_altruistic_aging\" /> is also based on the idea that ageing accelerates the accumulation of novel adaptive genes in local populations. However, Yang changed the terminology of \"evolvability\" into \"genetic creativity\" throughout his paper to facilitate the understanding of how ageing can have a shorter-term benefit than the word \"evolvability\" would imply.

Lenart and Vašku (2016) <ref name=\"LenartBienertová-Vašků2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenart P, Bienertová-Vašků J | title = Keeping up with the Red Queen: the pace of aging as an adaptation | journal = Biogerontology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 693–709 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28013399 | doi = 10.1007/s10522-016-9674-4 }}</ref> have also invoked evolvability as the main mechanism driving evolution of ageing. However, they proposed that even though the actual rate of aging can be an adaptation the aging itself is inevitable. In other words, evolution can change the speed of aging but some ageing no matter how slow will always occur.

=== Mortality ===
Mortality is the number of deaths in a particular group of people over a specific time period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|date=2011-02-02|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> There are two types of mortality: intrinsic and [[extrinsic mortality]]. Intrinsic mortality is thought to be a result of ageing from insider factors, whereas extrinsic is a direct result of environmental factors. An example would be that bats have fewer predators, and therefore have a low extrinsic mortality. Birds are warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5–10 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals, and have a lower extrinsic mortality.

When examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and they would have a lower intrinsic mortality.

==Diseases ==

=== Progeroid Syndromes ===
Progeroid syndromes are genetic diseases that are linked to premature aging. Progeroid syndromes are characterized by having features that resemble those of physiological aging such as hair loss and cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carrero|first=Dido|last2=Soria-Valles|first2=Clara|last3=López-Otín|first3=Carlos|date=2016-07-01|title=Hallmarks of progeroid syndromes: lessons from mice and reprogrammed cells|url=http://dmm.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/dmm.024711|journal=Disease Models & Mechanisms|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=719–735|doi=10.1242/dmm.024711|issn=1754-8403|pmc=4958309|pmid=27482812}}</ref>

==== Progeria ====
[[Progeria]] is a [[Genetic disorder#Single gene disorder|single-gene genetic disease]] that cause acceleration of many or most symptoms of ageing during childhood. It affects about 1 in 4-8 million births.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/children/progeria|title=Progeria|website=WebMD|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Those who have this disease are known for [[failure to thrive]] and have a series of symptoms that cause abnormalities in the joints, hair, skin, eyes, and face.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome|title=Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome|website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> Most who have the disease only live to about age 13.<ref>{{Cite book|last=King, Robert C.|title=A dictionary of genetics|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Mulligan, Pamela Khipple, 1953-, Stansfield, William D., 1930-|isbn=978-0-19-937686-5|edition= 8th|location=New York|oclc=871046520}}</ref> Although the term progeria applies strictly speaking to all diseases characterized by premature aging symptoms, and is often used as such, it is often applied specifically in reference to Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS).

Although progeria can cause physical abnormalities on a child, it does not impact their motor skills or intellectual advancement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome|title=Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Those who have HGPS are prone to suffer from neurological and cardiovascular disorders.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=McDonald, Roger B.,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1056201427|title=Biology of aging|isbn=978-0-8153-4567-1|edition= Second|location=Boca Raton|oclc=1056201427}}</ref>

==== Werner Syndrome ====
[[Werner syndrome]], also known as \"adult progeria\", is another single-gene genetic disease. it is caused by a mutation in the [[WRN (gene)|wrn gene]].<ref name=\":03\"/> It affects about 1 in 200,000 people in the United States.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/werner-syndrome|title=Werner syndrome|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> This syndrome starts to affect individuals during the teenage years, preventing teens from growing at puberty. There are four common traits of Werner's syndrome: [[cataracts]] in both eyes, changes in skin similar to [[scleroderma]], short stature, and early graying and loss of hair.<ref name=\":03\" /> Once the individual reaches the twenties, there is generally a change in hair color, skin, and voice. The average life expectancy of someone with this disease is around 46 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=K.|last2=Imakiire|first2=A.|last3=Miyagawa|first3=N.|last4=Kasahara|first4=T.|date=December 2003|title=A report of two cases of Werner's syndrome and review of the literature|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14676353|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery (Hong Kong)|volume=11|issue=2|pages=224–233|doi=10.1177/230949900301100222|issn=1022-5536|pmid=14676353}}</ref> This condition can also affect the weight distribution between the arms, legs, and torso.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Navarro CL, Cau P, Lévy N|date=October 2006|title=Molecular bases of progeroid syndromes|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=15|issue=suppl_2|pages=R151–61|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddl214|pmid=16987878}}</ref> Those who have Werner syndrome are at an increased risk for cataracts, [[type 2 diabetes]], different types of cancers, and [[atherosclerosis]].<ref name=\":12\" />

==Biogerontology ==
{{Main|Gerontology}}
Theories of ageing affect efforts to understand and find treatments for age-related conditions:

*Those who believe in the idea that ageing is an unavoidable side effect of some necessary function (antagonistic pleiotropy or disposable soma theories) logically tend to believe that attempts to delay ageing would result in unacceptable side effects to the necessary functions. Altering ageing is therefore \"impossible\",<ref name=\"williams\"/> and study of ageing mechanisms is of only academic interest.
*Those believing in default theories of multiple maintenance mechanisms tend to believe that ways might be found to enhance the operation of some of those mechanisms. Perhaps they can be assisted by antioxidants or other agents.
*Those who believe in programmed ageing suppose that ways might be found to interfere with the operation of the part of the ageing mechanism that appears to be common to multiple symptoms, essentially \"slowing down the clock\" and delaying multiple manifestations. Such effect might be obtained by fooling a sense function. One such effort is an attempt to find a \"mimetic\" that would \"mime\" the anti-ageing effect of [[calorie restriction]] without having to actually radically restrict diet.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen D, Guarente L | title = SIR2: a potential target for calorie restriction mimetics | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 64–71 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17207661 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2006.12.004 }}</ref>

'''Miguel Odalis Tejada''' (born '''Tejeda''',<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=chron /> May 25, 1974<!-- This has already been corrected. Tejada previously claimed to have been born in 1976, so 1974 is correct. Please do not change it to 1972 -->) is a Dominican former professional [[baseball]] [[shortstop]] who played 16 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He played for six different teams, most notably the [[Oakland Athletics]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]], before short stints with the [[Houston Astros]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[San Francisco Giants]], and [[Kansas City Royals]].

Tejada spent his first six seasons in MLB with the Athletics, where he began a streak of 1,152 [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]]s that ended with the Orioles on June 22, 2007. He is a six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and a two-time [[Silver Slugger Award]] winner. In 2002, he won the [[American League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award]], and was the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2005]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP]]. Tejada's nickname is \"La Guagua\", which means \"the bus\" in certain Spanish dialects, as Tejada was known for his ability to drive in runs.

On February 11, 2009, he pleaded guilty to one count of [[perjury]] for lying to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in his testimony on whether [[Rafael Palmeiro]] lied about his steroid use.<ref name=\"Schmidt\">{{cite news |first=Michael S. |last=Schmidt |title=The Tumult Continues: Tejada Pleads Guilty |curly= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/sports/baseball/12tejada.htm |agency= |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> On August 17, 2013, MLB suspended Tejada for 105 games for violating MLB drug policy.

==Early life==
Tejada grew up in extreme poverty in [[Baní]], a city approximately 40 miles (65&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Santo Domingo]], capital of the [[Dominican Republic]]. He grew up idolizing the Baltimore Orioles shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3079-2004Feb24.html |title=Tejada Looks to Build on Ripken Legacy |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-02-24 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref> 
Tejada's rise from the slums of Baní through the minors and into the Major Leagues is chronicled in the book ''Away Games: The Life and Times of a Latin Ballplayer'' by Marcos Breton and Jose Luis Villegas. ''Away Games'' describes the struggles of Dominican players in general and Tejada in particular as they arrive in the U.S. speaking very little English, often in small towns playing for minor league teams, with dreams of making it big.<ref>{{Cite book|title=page for Away Games |isbn = 978-0684849911|last1 = Bretón|first1 = Marcos|last2= Villegas|first2= José Luis|year=1999 }}</ref>

==Professional career==

===Oakland Athletics (1997–2003)===

====1997–2001====
Tejada developed quickly into a top-notch prospect, showing early signs of power. He reached the Majors towards the end of the [[1997 Major League Baseball season|1997 season]], joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A's saw potential in the 23-year-old Tejada. This was bolstered by his performance with the [[Edmonton Trappers]] (AAA) in the [[Pacific Coast League]] during the season, and returning to the minors to lead the Trappers to a PCL championship that year. He was rewarded with the starting shortstop job beginning in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]].

The A's, and Tejada, steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11 [[home run]]s and in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]] his average jumped to .251 with 21 home runs.

After a solid 87-win campaign in 1999, Tejada and a core of young players led their A's to their first [[American League Western Division]] title in eight years in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]]. Bolstered by an [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]]-winning performance by [[first baseman]] [[Jason Giambi]], and aided by Tejada's .275 average and 30 home runs, the A's won 91 games. The [[2000 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] faced the [[2000 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|first round of the postseason]], which was won by the Yankees 3-2.

In [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], Tejada had a comparable offensive year, hitting .267 with 31 homers. The [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] captured the American League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] with a 102-60 record. In the [[2001 American League Division Series|postseason]], however, the A's fell to the [[2001 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in five games, blowing an initial 2-0 series lead.

====2002====
Tejada's breakout year came in [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]]. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the [[New York Yankees]] during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger [[Jermaine Dye]], the A's lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 34 homers and led the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to their second Western Division title in three years. Their campaign included an American League record 20 game winning-streak. Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games of that run: a three-run homer off [[Minnesota Twins]] closer [[Eddie Guardado]] for a 7-5 victory and a bases-loaded single against [[2002 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] reliever [[Jason Grimsley]] to break a 6-6 tie. Tejada also showed modest speed on the basepaths with 18 steals over a two-year stretch. His performance was rewarded with the 2002 American League MVP award. For the third straight year, though, the A's fell in the fifth game of the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]], this time to the [[2002 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].

====2003====
The [[2003 Major League Baseball season|next year]], both the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] and Tejada got off to a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under [[Mendoza line|.200]] for the first month of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A's to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops.

[[File:M Tejada - Orioles v Yanks 2007-07-29.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada during his first tenure with the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles in 2007]]]]
In a [[2003 American League Division Series|tension-filled series]], the powerful offense of the [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] narrowly edged out the A's in the first round, once again in five games. Tejada was known for his public display of anger toward Boston starting pitcher [[Derek Lowe]] at the series' conclusion for what he perceived as obscene gestures. Lowe denied the accusation, claiming his fist pump was in celebration only.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christensen|first2=Roch|last2=Kubatko|first=Joe|title=Tejada, Lowe say ALDS feud is in past|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-04-07/sports/0404070346_1_mazzilli-tejada-derek-lowe|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=April 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AL: A's irate about Lowe's gesture|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/07/Sports/AL__A_s_irate_about_L.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=October 7, 2003}}</ref>

===Baltimore Orioles (2004–2007)===
By the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself as one of baseball's premier shortstops. The A's elected not to re-sign the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young [[Bobby Crosby]] coming through the system, so Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles during the offseason.

On arrival in Baltimore, Tejada was given uniform number 10, since 4, his number in Oakland, had been retired for former manager [[Earl Weaver]]. As an Oriole, Tejada followed in the footsteps of legendary Baltimore shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]. Like Ripken, Tejada was a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle infielder.

====2004–2005====
On July 12, 2004, Tejada won the [[Century 21 Real Estate|Century 21]] [[Home Run Derby]] in [[Houston]]. Tejada hit a (then) record 27 [[home run]]s in the contest, including a record 15 homers in the second round. He defeated [[Houston Astros]] outfielder [[Lance Berkman]] (who would later become his teammate) 5-4 in the final round of the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last=Antonen |first=Mel |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2004-07-12-homerun-derby_x.htm |title=Tejada blasts way to victory in Derby |work=USA Today |date=July 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> Both records were broken the following year in [[Detroit]] by [[Bobby Abreu]]. Tejada finished the 2004 season with 34 home runs and an MLB-leading 150 RBIs, and won his first career [[Silver Slugger Award]].

While Tejada did not participate in the Home Run Derby in 2005, he was an [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and starter for the [[American League|AL]]. In his first All-Star start, Tejada hit a solo [[home run]] against [[John Smoltz]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]], had a sacrifice RBI and was part of an all-Oriole double play with teammate [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]]. His efforts earned him the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP]], winning a [[Chevrolet Corvette]].

====2005–2006 offseason====
On December 8, 2005, it was widely reported by the [[Associated Press]] that Tejada asked the Orioles for a trade, citing unhappiness with the team's direction. Tejada challenged those statements in an interview with [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic|Comcast Sportsnet's]] Kelli Johnson, saying he only asked for a better team, referring to his hope that the Baltimore Orioles would improve after their eighth straight losing season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Several weeks later, Tejada reiterated his complaints with the Orioles' lack of action and demanded to be traded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Tejada stated that he wants a \"good group that helps me to win\" and commented briefly on his alleged non-involvement in Palmeiro's steroid scandal.  On January 7, 2006, Tejada stated his intent to remain with Baltimore for \"the rest of [his] career.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This statement was made to Orioles Vice President [[Jim Duquette]] in a meeting arranged by mutual friend and teammate [[Melvin Mora]]. It was reported that Tejada was claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] off trade waivers, but the two teams did not make a deal for Tejada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

====2006–2007====
Tejada played in his 1,000th [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]] on July 1, 2006.

Tejada's streak was at 1,151 games when he was hit on his left wrist by a pitch on June 20, 2007. The next day, he went up to bunt in the top of the first inning, bunted into a force play, and was replaced by a pinch runner. Following that game, it was announced that he had a broken wrist. On June 22 he was placed on the disabled list, ending his streak at 1,152 consecutive games, the fifth longest in Major League history, behind [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] (2,632), [[Lou Gehrig]] (2,130), [[Everett Scott]] (1,307), and [[Steve Garvey]] (1,217).<ref>{{cite news |first=Spencer |last=Fordin |title=Streak over: Tejada placed on DL |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070622&content_id=2042946&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |publisher=[[MLB.com]]|date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Miguel Tejada 2008.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada playing for the [[2008 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros in 2008]]]]

===Houston Astros (2008–2009)===
On December 12, 2007, Tejada was dealt to the [[Houston Astros]] for five players, including SP [[Troy Patton]], OF [[Luke Scott]], RP [[Dennis Sarfate]] and RP/SP [[Matt Albers]].<ref>{{cite news|author = |title = Tejada traded to Astros, Orioles to receive five players for former AL MVP|url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html|work=[[SI.com]]|date = December 12, 2007|accessdate = December 12, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214160439/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}</ref>

Tejada scored his 1,000th career run on July 7, 2008, at [[PNC Park]]. In the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2008 All-Star Game]] Tejada singled leading off the top of the eighth stole second with one out and advanced to third on a throwing error and scored on Padres' first baseman Adrian Gonzalez's sacrifice fly.

In the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]] he grounded into 32 double plays, the most in the major leagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-situational-batting.shtml |title=2008 Major League Baseball PH/HR/Situ Hitting |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref>

===Second stint with the Orioles (2010)===
On January 23, 2010, Tejada agreed to a one-year deal worth $6 million with the Orioles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zrebiec|first=Jeff|title=Orioles to bring back Tejada|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-01-23/sports/bal-miguel-tejada0123_1_oakland-athletics-teammate-orioles-astros-last-season|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=January 23, 2010}}</ref>

===San Diego Padres (2010)===
On July 29, the Orioles traded Tejada to the [[San Diego Padres]] for minor league pitcher [[Wynn Pelzer]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Roch Kubatko View Comments |url=http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2010/07/tejada-deal-now-official.html |title=School of Roch: Tejada deal now official (update) |publisher=Masnsports.com |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100729&content_id=12780258&vkey=tradedeadline2010&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Padres fortify infield by acquiring Tejada &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref> On September 22, Tejada hit his 300th career [[home run]] off [[Ted Lilly]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

===Kansas City Royals (2013)===
[[File:NCA 3894 Miguel Tejada.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|Tejada with the Royals in 2013]]
On December 31, 2012, Tejada signed a minor league contract with the [[Kansas City Royals]]. According to the Associated Press, he was to earn $1.1 million plus performance incentives worth an additional $400,000 if he made the Royals Major League 40-man roster for 2013.<ref name=\"AJ\"/>

On August 17, 2013, Tejada received a 105-game suspension from Major League Baseball following two positive drug tests for [[amphetamines]]. Tejada claimed to have been in the process of re-applying for a therapeutic use exemption as he used the drug to treat a medical condition, but he chose not to appeal the decision. Due to a calf injury suffered prior to the ban, Tejada was not likely to play in the remaining 41 games of the 2013 season anyway, though they will count toward his suspension. He also was not allowed to play in the first 64 games of the 2014 season.<ref name=\":0\" />

===Miami Marlins===
On May 16, 2014, Tejada signed a minor league contract with the [[Miami Marlins]]. Tejada was required to serve the remaining 64 games left on his suspension before being available to be called up by the Marlins.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rojas|first=Enrique|title=Miguel Tejada headed to minors|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10946793/miguel-tejada-signs-minor-league-deal-miami-marlins|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=May 17, 2014}}</ref> On August 2, Tejada was released by the Marlins.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://touch.sun-sentinel.com/#story/sfl-miami-marlins-miguel-tejada-blog-20140802/ | title=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>

Tejada was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5% of the vote and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot.

==Controversies==

===Steroid allegations and suspensions===
On September 22, 2005, [[ESPN]] reported that [[Rafael Palmeiro]], who had tested positive for steroids and was suspended for 10 games under Major League Baseball's steroid policy, implicated Tejada to baseball's arbitration panel, suggesting that a supplement given to him by Tejada was responsible for the steroid entering his system. Tejada denied the allegations,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2169007|title=Palmeiro named Tejada before panel|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=September 23, 2005|accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> saying that the only thing he gave Palmeiro was [[vitamin B-12]], a legal substance under MLB policy.

On September 24, 2005, the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' reported that \"''The Health Policy Advisory Committee, which oversees baseball's testing policy, issued a statement that exonerated Tejada and chastised the media for reporting that he might have distributed steroids to another player.''\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/baseball/bal-sp.palmeiro24sep24,1,3325405.story?coll=bal-home-headlines:Cite_Sources |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=baltimoresun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In [[José Canseco]]'s 2005 book, ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big]]'', he mentioned that he believed Tejada might have taken steroids. He claims to have spoken to him about them and the next season seeing him at spring training looking more defined. He never claims to have injected him with them, like he did with Palmeiro, McGwire, and other ballplayers.

On September 30, 2006, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that former relief pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]], during a June 6, 2006, federal raid, told federal agents investigating steroids in baseball named Tejada as a user of \"[[anabolic steroids]].\" The ''Times'' reported that Tejada was one of five names blacked out in an affidavit filed in federal court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/01/sports/sp-clemens1|title=Clemens Is Named in Drug Affidavit|last=Pugmire|first=Lance|accessdate=May 17, 2014|date=October 1, 2006|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>  However, on October 3, 2006, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that San Francisco United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the ''Los Angeles Times'' report contained \"significant inaccuracies.\"<ref name=WashingtonPost>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/02/AR2006100201054.html|title=U.S. Attorney Says Report Alleging Drug Use Contains 'Inaccuracies'|work=Washington Post|page=E02

On December 13, 2007, Tejada was mentioned in the [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]] in connection to [[Banned substances in baseball|steroids]]. In the report, Tejada is said to have received $1,500 worth of steroids.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?id=3357337 |title=ESPN – Why questions about age, name could pose problems for Tejada – MLB |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>

A report surfaced on January 15, 2008, stating that Rep. [[Henry Waxman]] had asked the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to investigate whether Tejada was truthful when speaking to the House committee when being interviewed in 2005 regarding possible connections to Rafael Palmeiro.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i3YSGVqmBcRKjK4HbkCTZG0bgB6gD8U6EFP01 The Associated Press: Congress Asks for Tejada Perjury Probe<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Peter Grier |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0116/p02s02-usgn.html |title=Pro baseball is urged to keep focus on antidrug policies |journal=Christian Science Monitor |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>

On August 17, 2013, Tejada was suspended 105 games for testing positive twice for [[amphetamines]], specifically the prescription medication [[adderall]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Miguel Tejada suspended 105 games|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9576752/miguel-tejada-kansas-city-royals-suspended-105-games|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=17 August 2013|date=2013-08-17}}</ref> Tejada claimed he had medical permission from MLB to use the drug to treat [[Attention deficit disorder|ADD]], but it expired on April 15, 2013, and he continued to use it without gaining a new permission from MLB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9576752/miguel-tejada-kansas-city-royals-suspended-105-games|title=Miguel Tejada suspended 105 games|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 17, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref> The suspension was the third-longest non-lifetime ban issued by MLB for a drug violation.

===Age===
On April 17, 2008, Tejada was confronted by an ESPN reporter during a sit-down interview with documentation revealing that Tejada had been lying about his age ever since he first signed a Major League Baseball contract in 1993. Tejada had claimed to have been born in 1976 when a Dominican birth certificate showed that he was born in 1974 as \"Miguel Tejeda.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=chron>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5708800.html |title=Tejada two years older than Astros thought |publisher=Chron.com |date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref> He struggled to take off his microphone and kept questioning who the interviewer was referring to. Tejada stormed off the set, ending the interview.

Before the interview was aired in April 22, 2008, he acknowledged this fact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3351418 |title=Tejada admits to being two years older |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>

'''Miguel Odalis Tejada''' (born '''Tejeda''',<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=chron /> May 25, 1974<!-- This has already been corrected. Tejada previously claimed to have been born in 1976, so 1974 is correct. Please do not change it to 1972 -->) is a Dominican former professional [[baseball]] [[shortstop]] who played 16 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He played for six different teams, most notably the [[Oakland Athletics]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]], before short stints with the [[Houston Astros]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[San Francisco Giants]], and [[Kansas City Royals]].

Tejada spent his first six seasons in MLB with the Athletics, where he began a streak of 1,152 [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]]s that ended with the Orioles on June 22, 2007. He is a six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and a two-time [[Silver Slugger Award]] winner. In 2002, he won the [[American League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award]], and was the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2005]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP]]. Tejada's nickname is \"La Guagua\", which means \"the bus\" in certain Spanish dialects, as Tejada was known for his ability to drive in runs.

On February 11, 2009, he pleaded guilty to one count of [[perjury]] for lying to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in his testimony on whether [[Rafael Palmeiro]] lied about his steroid use.<ref name=\"Schmidt\">{{cite news |first=Michael S. |last=Schmidt |title=The Tumult Continues: Tejada Pleads Guilty |curly= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/sports/baseball/12tejada.htm |agency= |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> On August 17, 2013, MLB suspended Tejada for 105 games for violating MLB drug policy.

==Early life==
Tejada grew up in extreme poverty in [[Baní]], a city approximately 40 miles (65&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Santo Domingo]], capital of the [[Dominican Republic]]. He grew up idolizing the Baltimore Orioles shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3079-2004Feb24.html |title=Tejada Looks to Build on Ripken Legacy |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-02-24 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref> 
Tejada's rise from the slums of Baní through the minors and into the Major Leagues is chronicled in the book ''Away Games: The Life and Times of a Latin Ballplayer'' by Marcos Breton and Jose Luis Villegas. ''Away Games'' describes the struggles of Dominican players in general and Tejada in particular as they arrive in the U.S. speaking very little English, often in small towns playing for minor league teams, with dreams of making it big.<ref>{{Cite book|title=page for Away Games |isbn = 978-0684849911|last1 = Bretón|first1 = Marcos|last2= Villegas|first2= José Luis|year=1999 }}</ref>

==Professional career==

===Oakland Athletics (1997–2003)===

====1997–2001====
Tejada developed quickly into a top-notch prospect, showing early signs of power. He reached the Majors towards the end of the [[1997 Major League Baseball season|1997 season]], joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A's saw potential in the 23-year-old Tejada. This was bolstered by his performance with the [[Edmonton Trappers]] (AAA) in the [[Pacific Coast League]] during the season, and returning to the minors to lead the Trappers to a PCL championship that year. He was rewarded with the starting shortstop job beginning in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]].

The A's, and Tejada, steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11 [[home run]]s and in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]] his average jumped to .251 with 21 home runs.

After a solid 87-win campaign in 1999, Tejada and a core of young players led their A's to their first [[American League Western Division]] title in eight years in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]]. Bolstered by an [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP]]-winning performance by [[first baseman]] [[Jason Giambi]], and aided by Tejada's .275 average and 30 home runs, the A's won 91 games. The [[2000 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] faced the [[2000 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[2000 American League Division Series|first round of the postseason]], which was won by the Yankees 3-2.

In [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], Tejada had a comparable offensive year, hitting .267 with 31 homers. The [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] captured the American League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] with a 102-60 record. In the [[2001 American League Division Series|postseason]], however, the A's fell to the [[2001 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in five games, blowing an initial 2-0 series lead.

====2002====
Tejada's breakout year came in [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]]. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the [[New York Yankees]] during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger [[Jermaine Dye]], the A's lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 34 homers and led the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to their second Western Division title in three years. Their campaign included an American League record 20 game winning-streak. Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games of that run: a three-run homer off [[Minnesota Twins]] closer [[Eddie Guardado]] for a 7-5 victory and a bases-loaded single against [[2002 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] reliever [[Jason Grimsley]] to break a 6-6 tie. Tejada also showed modest speed on the basepaths with 18 steals over a two-year stretch. His performance was rewarded with the 2002 American League MVP award. For the third straight year, though, the A's fell in the fifth game of the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]], this time to the [[2002 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].

====2003====
The [[2003 Major League Baseball season|next year]], both the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] and Tejada got off to a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under [[Mendoza line|.200]] for the first month of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A's to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops.

[[File:M Tejada - Orioles v Yanks 2007-07-29.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada during his first tenure with the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles in 2007]]]]
In a [[2003 American League Division Series|tension-filled series]], the powerful offense of the [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] narrowly edged out the A's in the first round, once again in five games. Tejada was known for his public display of anger toward Boston starting pitcher [[Derek Lowe]] at the series' conclusion for what he perceived as obscene gestures. Lowe denied the accusation, claiming his fist pump was in celebration only.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christensen|first2=Roch|last2=Kubatko|first=Joe|title=Tejada, Lowe say ALDS feud is in past|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-04-07/sports/0404070346_1_mazzilli-tejada-derek-lowe|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=April 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AL: A's irate about Lowe's gesture|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/07/Sports/AL__A_s_irate_about_L.shtml|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=October 7, 2003}}</ref>

===Baltimore Orioles (2004–2007)===
By the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself as one of baseball's premier shortstops. The A's elected not to re-sign the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young [[Bobby Crosby]] coming through the system, so Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles during the offseason.

On arrival in Baltimore, Tejada was given uniform number 10, since 4, his number in Oakland, had been retired for former manager [[Earl Weaver]]. As an Oriole, Tejada followed in the footsteps of legendary Baltimore shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]. Like Ripken, Tejada was a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle infielder.

====2004–2005====
On July 12, 2004, Tejada won the [[Century 21 Real Estate|Century 21]] [[Home Run Derby]] in [[Houston]]. Tejada hit a (then) record 27 [[home run]]s in the contest, including a record 15 homers in the second round. He defeated [[Houston Astros]] outfielder [[Lance Berkman]] (who would later become his teammate) 5-4 in the final round of the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last=Antonen |first=Mel |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2004-07-12-homerun-derby_x.htm |title=Tejada blasts way to victory in Derby |work=USA Today |date=July 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> Both records were broken the following year in [[Detroit]] by [[Bobby Abreu]]. Tejada finished the 2004 season with 34 home runs and an MLB-leading 150 RBIs, and won his first career [[Silver Slugger Award]].

While Tejada did not participate in the Home Run Derby in 2005, he was an [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and starter for the [[American League|AL]]. In his first All-Star start, Tejada hit a solo [[home run]] against [[John Smoltz]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]], had a sacrifice RBI and was part of an all-Oriole double play with teammate [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]]. His efforts earned him the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP]], winning a [[Chevrolet Corvette]].

====2005–2006 offseason====
On December 8, 2005, it was widely reported by the [[Associated Press]] that Tejada asked the Orioles for a trade, citing unhappiness with the team's direction. Tejada challenged those statements in an interview with [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic|Comcast Sportsnet's]] Kelli Johnson, saying he only asked for a better team, referring to his hope that the Baltimore Orioles would improve after their eighth straight losing season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Several weeks later, Tejada reiterated his complaints with the Orioles' lack of action and demanded to be traded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Tejada stated that he wants a \"good group that helps me to win\" and commented briefly on his alleged non-involvement in Palmeiro's steroid scandal.  On January 7, 2006, Tejada stated his intent to remain with Baltimore for \"the rest of [his] career.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This statement was made to Orioles Vice President [[Jim Duquette]] in a meeting arranged by mutual friend and teammate [[Melvin Mora]]. It was reported that Tejada was claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] off trade waivers, but the two teams did not make a deal for Tejada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

====2006–2007====
Tejada played in his 1,000th [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive game]] on July 1, 2006.

Tejada's streak was at 1,151 games when he was hit on his left wrist by a pitch on June 20, 2007. The next day, he went up to bunt in the top of the first inning, bunted into a force play, and was replaced by a pinch runner. Following that game, it was announced that he had a broken wrist. On June 22 he was placed on the disabled list, ending his streak at 1,152 consecutive games, the fifth longest in Major League history, behind [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] (2,632), [[Lou Gehrig]] (2,130), [[Everett Scott]] (1,307), and [[Steve Garvey]] (1,217).<ref>{{cite news |first=Spencer |last=Fordin |title=Streak over: Tejada placed on DL |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070622&content_id=2042946&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |publisher=[[MLB.com]]|date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Miguel Tejada 2008.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Tejada playing for the [[2008 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros in 2008]]]]

===Houston Astros (2008–2009)===
On December 12, 2007, Tejada was dealt to the [[Houston Astros]] for five players, including SP [[Troy Patton]], OF [[Luke Scott]], RP [[Dennis Sarfate]] and RP/SP [[Matt Albers]].<ref>{{cite news|author = |title = Tejada traded to Astros, Orioles to receive five players for former AL MVP|url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html|work=[[SI.com]]|date = December 12, 2007|accessdate = December 12, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214160439/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/12/12/tejada.trade.ap/index.html |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}</ref>

Tejada scored his 1,000th career run on July 7, 2008, at [[PNC Park]]. In the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2008 All-Star Game]] Tejada singled leading off the top of the eighth stole second with one out and advanced to third on a throwing error and scored on Padres' first baseman Adrian Gonzalez's sacrifice fly.

In the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]] he grounded into 32 double plays, the most in the major leagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-situational-batting.shtml |title=2008 Major League Baseball PH/HR/Situ Hitting |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref>

===Second stint with the Orioles (2010)===
On January 23, 2010, Tejada agreed to a one-year deal worth $6 million with the Orioles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zrebiec|first=Jeff|title=Orioles to bring back Tejada|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-01-23/sports/bal-miguel-tejada0123_1_oakland-athletics-teammate-orioles-astros-last-season|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=January 23, 2010}}</ref>

===San Diego Padres (2010)===
On July 29, the Orioles traded Tejada to the [[San Diego Padres]] for minor league pitcher [[Wynn Pelzer]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Roch Kubatko View Comments |url=http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2010/07/tejada-deal-now-official.html |title=School of Roch: Tejada deal now official (update) |publisher=Masnsports.com |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100729&content_id=12780258&vkey=tradedeadline2010&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Padres fortify infield by acquiring Tejada &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref> On September 22, Tejada hit his 300th career [[home run]] off [[Ted Lilly]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

===Kansas City Royals (2013)===
[[File:NCA 3894 Miguel Tejada.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|Tejada with the Royals in 2013]]
On December 31, 2012, Tejada signed a minor league contract with the [[Kansas City Royals]]. According to the Associated Press, he was to earn $1.1 million plus performance incentives worth an additional $400,000 if he made the Royals Major League 40-man roster for 2013.<ref name=\"AJ\"/>

On August 17, 2013, Tejada received a 105-game suspension from Major League Baseball following two positive drug tests for [[amphetamines]]. Tejada claimed to have been in the process of re-applying for a therapeutic use exemption as he used the drug to treat a medical condition, but he chose not to appeal the decision. Due to a calf injury suffered prior to the ban, Tejada was not likely to play in the remaining 41 games of the 2013 season anyway, though they will count toward his suspension. He also was not allowed to play in the first 64 games of the 2014 season.<ref name=\":0\" />

===Miami Marlins===
On May 16, 2014, Tejada signed a minor league contract with the [[Miami Marlins]]. Tejada was required to serve the remaining 64 games left on his suspension before being available to be called up by the Marlins.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rojas|first=Enrique|title=Miguel Tejada headed to minors|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10946793/miguel-tejada-signs-minor-league-deal-miami-marlins|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 18, 2014|date=May 17, 2014}}</ref> On August 2, Tejada was released by the Marlins.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://touch.sun-sentinel.com/#story/sfl-miami-marlins-miguel-tejada-blog-20140802/ | title=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>

Tejada was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5% of the vote and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot.

===Steroid allegations and suspensions===
On September 22, 2005, [[ESPN]] reported that [[Rafael Palmeiro]], who had tested positive for steroids and was suspended for 10 games under Major League Baseball's steroid policy, implicated Tejada to baseball's arbitration panel, suggesting that a supplement given to him by Tejada was responsible for the steroid entering his system. Tejada denied the allegations,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2169007|title=Palmeiro named Tejada before panel|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=September 23, 2005|accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> saying that the only thing he gave Palmeiro was [[vitamin B-12]], a legal substance under MLB policy.

On September 24, 2005, the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' reported that \"''The Health Policy Advisory Committee, which oversees baseball's testing policy, issued a statement that exonerated Tejada and chastised the media for reporting that he might have distributed steroids to another player.''\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/baseball/bal-sp.palmeiro24sep24,1,3325405.story?coll=bal-home-headlines:Cite_Sources |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=baltimoresun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In [[José Canseco]]'s 2005 book, ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big]]'', he mentioned that he believed Tejada might have taken steroids. He claims to have spoken to him about them and the next season seeing him at spring training looking more defined. He never claims to have injected him with them, like he did with Palmeiro, McGwire, and other ballplayers.

On September 30, 2006, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that former relief pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]], during a June 6, 2006, federal raid, told federal agents investigating steroids in baseball named Tejada as a user of \"[[anabolic steroids]].\" The ''Times'' reported that Tejada was one of five names blacked out in an affidavit filed in federal court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/01/sports/sp-clemens1|title=Clemens Is Named in Drug Affidavit|last=Pugmire|first=Lance|accessdate=May 17, 2014|date=October 1, 2006|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>  However, on October 3, 2006, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that San Francisco United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the ''Los Angeles Times'' report contained \"significant inaccuracies.\"<ref name=WashingtonPost>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/02/AR2006100201054.html|title=U.S. Attorney Says Report Alleging Drug Use Contains 'Inaccuracies'|work=Washington Post|page=E02

On December 13, 2007, Tejada was mentioned in the [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]] in connection to [[Banned substances in baseball|steroids]]. In the report, Tejada is said to have received $1,500 worth of steroids.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?id=3357337 |title=ESPN – Why questions about age, name could pose problems for Tejada – MLB |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>

A report surfaced on January 15, 2008, stating that Rep. [[Henry Waxman]] had asked the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to investigate whether Tejada was truthful when speaking to the House committee when being interviewed in 2005 regarding possible connections to Rafael Palmeiro.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i3YSGVqmBcRKjK4HbkCTZG0bgB6gD8U6EFP01 The Associated Press: Congress Asks for Tejada Perjury Probe<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Peter Grier |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0116/p02s02-usgn.html |title=Pro baseball is urged to keep focus on antidrug policies |journal=Christian Science Monitor |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>

===Age===
On April 17, 2008, Tejada was confronted by an ESPN reporter during a sit-down interview with documentation revealing that Tejada had been lying about his age ever since he first signed a Major League Baseball contract in 1993. Tejada had claimed to have been born in 1976 when a Dominican birth certificate showed that he was born in 1974 as \"Miguel Tejeda.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=chron>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5708800.html |title=Tejada two years older than Astros thought |publisher=Chron.com |date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref> He struggled to take off his microphone and kept questioning who the interviewer was referring to. Tejada stormed off the set, ending the interview.

Before the interview was aired in April 22, 2008, he acknowledged this fact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3351418 |title=Tejada admits to being two years older |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>

'''Brunette Coleman''' was a pseudonym used by the poet and writer [[Philip Larkin]]. In 1943, towards the end of his time as an undergraduate at [[St John's College, Oxford]], he wrote several works of fiction, verse and critical commentary under that name, including  [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] stories that parody the style of popular writers of contemporary girls' school fiction.

The Coleman oeuvre consists of a completed novella, ''Trouble at Willow Gables'', set in a girls' boarding school; an incomplete sequel, ''Michaelmas Term at St Brides'', set in a women's college at Oxford; seven short poems with a girls' school ambience; a fragment of pseudo-autobiography; and a critical essay purporting to be Coleman's literary apologia.  The manuscripts were stored in the [[Brynmor Jones Library]] at the [[University of Hull]], where Larkin was chief librarian between 1955 and 1985. Their existence was revealed to the public when Larkin's ''Selected Letters'' and [[Andrew Motion]]'s biography were published in 1992 and 1993 respectively. The Coleman works themselves were finally published, with other Larkin drafts and oddments, in 2002.

At Oxford Larkin underwent a period of confused sexuality and limited literary output. The adoption of a female persona appeared to release his creativity, as in the three years following the Coleman phase he published under his own name two novels and his first poetry collection. Thereafter, although he gradually established his reputation as a poet, his career as a prose writer declined, and despite several attempts he completed no further fiction. Critical reaction to the publication of the Coleman material was divided between those who saw no value in these [[juvenilia]], and those who considered that they cast useful light on the study of the mature Larkin.

==Origins==
[[File:St johns college oxford SP5106.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Facade of an ancient building, facing an expanse of grass. At ground floor level the building presents a long colonnade of arches, above which are rows of windows up to a crenellated roof line.|The quadrangle, St John's College, Oxford]]
In October 1940 Philip Larkin began studying English at [[St John's College, Oxford]].<ref>Motion, p. 72</ref> A prolific writer since childhood, his primary ambition as an undergraduate was to be a novelist rather than a poet.<ref>Booth, p. vii</ref> As well publishing articles and poems  in ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' and ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', he wrote additional unpublished material that included fragments of semi-autobiographical stories exploring homosexual relationships among groups of undergraduates. According to Larkin's biographer [[Andrew Motion]] these writings, while of no literary value, give an indication of Larkin's confused sexuality at that time, and his growing distaste for what he terms \"this buggery business\".<ref>Motion, pp. 64–65</ref>

From 1942 the character of much of Larkin's private writing changed, as a result of his friendship with a fellow undergraduate from St John's, [[Kingsley Amis]], who arrived at the university that summer.<ref>Motion, pp. 53–54</ref> Amis, a much more confident and assertive character than Larkin, disguised his serious concerns behind a facade of jokes and comic ironies. Larkin soon adopted that style as his own, joining with Amis in composing obscene rhymes and parodies of the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]] they were required to study.<ref>Motion, p. 58</ref> In time they extended their efforts to soft-porn fantasies in which, typically, \"girls roll[ed] around together twanging elastic and straps\".<ref name= M86>Motion, pp. 86–87</ref> After Amis's departure for the army in early 1943, Larkin made his first attempt at writing from a specifically feminine perspective in a story called \"An Incident in the English Camp\", which he subtitled \"A Thoroughly Unhealthy Story\". Lacking any salacious content despite its subtitle, the work is written in a pastiche of sentimental women's magazine prose. It depicts an undergraduate girl's parting from her soldier lover, and ends: \"She walked in exaltation through the black streets, her heart glowing like a coal with deep love\".<ref name= Bviii>Booth, pp. viii–ix</ref>

==Writing==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seniorprefect titlepage.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Details of title, author and publisher are displayed on a page with a heavily decorated border.|Title page of ''The Senior Prefect'', by [[Dorita Fairlie Bruce]] whose work provided a model for Brunette Coleman]] -->
From his general reading, Larkin had acquired a considerable knowledge of girls' school fiction, and had formed definite views on the authors of such works: \"stupid women without a grain of humour in their minds\", who lacked \"erotic sensibility\" and treated the lesbian perspective \"too casually\".<ref name= Bxii>Booth, pp. xii–xiii</ref> His intention to write in this genre is expressed in a letter to his friend Norman Iles, dated 5 June 1943, just before Larkin sat his degree [[Final examination|Finals]]: \"I am spending my time doing an obscene Lesbian novel in the form of a school story\".<ref>Thwaite, p. 58</ref> The novel was ''Trouble at Willow Gables'', a school adventure story in the manner of [[Dorita Fairlie Bruce]] or [[Dorothy Vicary]], which Larkin completed at home while awaiting his Finals results. That was the prelude to a busy summer's writing: \"Leaving Oxford was like taking a cork out of a bottle. Writing flooded out of me\", Larkin later told his biographer.<ref>Motion, p. 106</ref>

Larkin's letter to Iles does not mention a female pseudonym, although the idea of using one had been in his mind for months. The previous March he had begun writing the imagined autobiography of a supposed lady novelist, \"Brunette Coleman\", adapting the name of a well-known contemporary female jazz musician, [[Blanche Coleman]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Soester|first= Jeffrey|title= Obituary: Blanche Coleman|url= https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/may/02/3|journal= [[The Guardian]]|date= 2 May 2008}}</ref>
Larkin tentatively titled the autobiography \"Ante Meridian\"; he soon abandoned it, but held on to the Coleman name. According to James Booth, who prepared the Coleman texts for publication in 2002, the adoption of a female persona was in line with the pose of \"girlish [[narcissism]]\" that Larkin was affecting in the summer of 1943: \"I am dressed in red trousers, shirt and white pullover, and look very beautiful\".<ref>Booth, p. xii</ref> In his letters to Amis, Larkin maintained a straight-faced pretence that Coleman was a real person. Thus in one letter he wrote \"Brunette is very thrilled\" with a poem written in her name, and in another, \"Brunette can stand healthy criticism\".<ref>Thwaite, pp. 66 and 69</ref>

As he waited for offers of employment through the summer and autumn of 1943, Larkin added more works to the Coleman oeuvre. He began a sequel to ''Trouble at Willow Gables'', set in a women's college at Oxford and entitled ''Michaelmas Term at St Bride's'', but did not finish it: \"All literary inspiration has deserted me\", he informed Amis on 13 August.<ref>Thwaite, p. 62</ref> Nevertheless, a week later he told Amis that Brunette was helping him to write a novel, provisionally entitled ''Jill'', about \"a young man who invents an imaginary sister, and falls in love with her\". With this letter Larkin sent a Coleman poem, \"Bliss\", the first of seven written in the girls' school idiom.<ref>Thwaite, p. 63</ref>  As late as 19 October he reported to Amis that \"Brunette is working on a little monograph about girls' school stories\".<ref>Thwaite, p. 80</ref> This is a reference to the putative literary manifesto \"What Are We Writing For\", which became the final Coleman work. Thereafter, Motion records, she disappeared, \"to be mentioned only fleetingly in later accounts of his university life&nbsp;... She ended up as an occasional comic reminder of lost youth\".<ref name= M101>Motion, p. 101</ref>

==Works==
The works which Larkin attributed to Brunette Coleman comprise a short piece of supposed autobiography, a complete short novel, an incomplete second novel, a collection of poems and a literary essay.

===\"Ante Meridian\"===
This fragment of spoof autobiography is distinct from the rest of the Coleman oeuvre in having no relation to girls' school fiction. It records Brunette's early life as the daughter of an eccentric priest, brought up in a tumbledown Cornish cliff-top house.<ref name= M86/> Apart from descriptions of the house and its contents (some of which may be drawn from Larkin's own childhood home in Coventry),<ref name=B52>Bradford, pp. 52–55</ref> much of the narrative is taken up with a comical description of an attempt to launch the local lifeboat. Larkin's biographer Richard Bradford is struck by the distinctive tone in the fragment, different from anything else written under Coleman's name.<ref name= B52/> The text breaks off suddenly; Motion surmises that Larkin abandoned it because he was eager to begin work on the first Coleman novel.<ref name= M86/> Booth describes the prose as \"a mix of [[Daphne du Maurier]] nostalgia and surreal farce\".<ref name= Bviii/>

===Novel: ''Trouble at Willow Gables''===

====Synopsis====
[[File:Then Somehow Marjorie Found Herself Blurting Out the Entire Story by Balliol Salmon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt= Two young women face each other, one (right) seated in a chair, the other sitting on the floor. They are lookng intently at each other; the one on the right has placed her right arm on the other's left shoulder.|Emotional friendships between girls are characteristic of Brunette Coleman's school fiction.]]
Marie Moore, a junior pupil at Willow Gables, receives a birthday present of £5 from an aunt. After the banknote is retained for safe keeping by the headmistress, Miss Holden, Marie slyly recovers it but is quickly found out, and is coerced by Miss Holden into giving the money to the school's gymnasium fund. When later the banknote goes missing from the fund's collection box, Marie is suspected, but protests her innocence despite a savage beating from Miss Holden with assistance from two burly [[Prefect#Academic|school prefects]]. Only her friend Myfanwy believes her. Confined in the school's punishment room, Marie manages to escape with the help of a domestic servant, and runs away.

Hilary Russell, a prefect and predatory lesbian, lusts after Mary Beech, the school's cricket captain. On a night expedition in pursuit of Mary, Hilary catches Margaret Tattenham, a junior, in the act of replacing the £5 note in Miss Holden's room. Margaret says she originally took the money as a prank; Hilary agrees not to report her to Miss Holden in return for sexual favours, to which Margaret reluctantly consents. The following morning, Hilary denounces her anyway; Margaret responds by revealing Hilary's sexual harassment but is not believed, and is taken to the punishment room where Marie's absence is revealed.

Hilary is sent with a search party to find the missing girl. Meanwhile, Margaret makes a daring escape via the window, and rides off on the school horse.  She finds Marie, who is miserable and frightened and wants to return to the school whatever the consequences. Margaret confesses that she  borrowed  the £5 to bet on a horse, and has won £100. She means to leave Willow Gables for good, and apologises to Marie for the trouble she has caused her. This conversation is overheard by Hilary's search party, and after a scuffle the truants are captured. On the way back to school they hear cries from the river; it is Myfanwy, who has got into difficulties while swimming. Margaret frees herself from her captors' clutches, dives in and saves her drowning friend.

Back at the school, Miss Holden overlooks the theft in view of Margaret's heroism, although she confiscates the £100 winnings and donates the money to a new swimming pool fund. Marie is exonerated, and her £5 is returned. Mary Beech comes forward to corroborate Margaret's accusations against Hilary, who is summarily expelled. Marie and Myfanwy enjoy an emotional reunion in the school sickroom, as life at the school returns to normal, with friendship and forgiveness all round.

====Commentary====
The typescript begins with a dedication page \"To Jacinth\" (Brunette Coleman's imagined secretary). There follows an untitled poem which later appears, slightly altered, as \"The School in August\" in ''Sugar and Spice'', the Coleman poetry collection. In the story the surnames of the headmistress and principal girls have been altered in ink throughout the typescript; some of the original names belonged to Larkin's real-life acquaintances at Oxford. The presence of a publisher's inkstamp on the wallet containing the typescript indicates that the story may have been submitted by Larkin for publication.<ref>Booth, pp. 3–5</ref>

Booth argues that, whatever Larkin's motive in writing it, the story follows the parameters of schoolgirl fiction with some fidelity. Its main characters all have models within the genre; Marie has much in common with Dorita Fairlie Bruce's recurrent character [[Dimsie Goes to School|\"Dimsie\"]], while Hilary is likewise based on Dorothy Vicary's villainous \"Una Vickers\" in ''Niece of the Headmistress''. The usual themes of friendships, rivalries and injustices are explored, and the ending in reconciliation and future hope is entirely true to type.<ref name= Bxii/> Some scenes—the savage beating endured by Marie, the lingering descriptions of girls dressing and undressing, Hilary's smouldering sexuality—may, Booth asserts, be written with \"the lusts of the male heterosexual gaze\" in mind but, he continues, the reader looking for explicit pornography will be disappointed.<ref>Booth, p. xvi</ref> Bradford notes three prose styles combining in the narrative: \"cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism&nbsp;... and&nbsp;... its writer's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement\".<ref>Bradford, p. 51</ref> Motion finds the tone of the prose frivolous on the surface, yet fundamentally cold and cruel: \"Once its women have been arraigned for pleasure they are dismissed; once they have been enjoyed they are treated with indifference\".<ref>Motion, p. 92</ref>

===Novel: ''Michaelmas Term at St Bride's''===

====Synopsis====
[[File:Somerville College.jpg|thumb|alt= A large brick building is shown, left, with long upper windows above which is classical pediment which includes a round window. In front of the building is an area of grass and trees.|[[Somerville College, Oxford]], the recognisable model for St Bride's]]
In this incomplete story Mary, Marie, Margaret and Myfanwy, friends from Willow Gables, are new undergraduates at St Bride's College, Oxford.  Mary is disconcerted to find that she is sharing her rooms with Hilary, her old adversary from the school. However, although Hilary still has a roving lesbian eye, she has lost most of her predatory instincts  and the two become friends. Mary falls foul of Mary de Putron, the aggressive and authoritarian college games captain;  in the hockey trials de Putron makes Mary play out of her normal position, so that performs badly.  Hilary subsequently avenges Mary's humiliation by seducing de Putron's boyfriend, a gauche [[Royal Air Force]] officer called Clive, whom she then dumps unceremoniously.

Of Myfanwy's doings we learn relatively little. Margaret, still fascinated with horse-racing, sets up her own bookmaking business. Marie discovers psychoanalysis  and tries to cure her sister  Philippa's leather belt fetish. After various efforts prove unsuccessful, the sisters seek solace in alcohol. The later stages of the story introduce Larkin's real-life friend, Diana Gollancz, and recount her preparations for a fashionable party. In the final scenes the narrative becomes surreal, as on their alcoholic quest Marie and Philippa are confronted by the knowledge that they are characters in a story, while \"real life\" is going on in the next room. Marie takes a peep at real life, and decides she would rather stay in the story, which breaks off at this point with a few pencil notes indicating possible ways in which it might have continued.

====Commentary====
Only the first dozen pages of the manuscript are typed; the remainder is handwritten. The surnames of the characters, which were changed in ''Trouble at Willow Gables'', are unaltered. The script carries a dedication to \"Miriam and Diana\": Miriam was an acquaintance with whom Larkin had discussed lesbian relationships, while Diana Gollancz (\"Diana G.\" in the story), the daughter of the publisher [[Victor Gollancz]], supplied him with many anecdotes from her schooldays.<ref>Booth, pp. 129–30</ref><ref>Motion, p. 88</ref> According to Motion, \"St Bride's\" is recognisably based on [[Somerville College, Oxford]].<ref name= M93>Motion, pp. 93–96</ref>

In his analysis of the Coleman fiction, Stephen Cooper notes that, as with ''Willow Gables'', the narrative voice switches from character to character so that different thoughts, attitudes and perspectives can be expressed.<ref>Cooper, pp. 23–25</ref> Cooper argues that as the narrative progresses, Larkin's concerns (in his Coleman voice) move beyond sexual titillation; he is no longer interested in describing lesbian encounters in voyeuristic detail.<ref>Cooper, p. 28</ref> Hilary emerges as saviour rather than seducer, as a campaigner against male oppression, and as a figure who \"deviates from the cultural norms [yet] can triumph over those who adopt conventional attitudes\".<ref>Cooper, p. 30</ref> The scenes with sexual content or innuendo are largely confined to the earlier parts of the story. The later parts, which introduce the male characters \"Clive\" and Hilary's other admirer, the contemptible \"Creature\" are, according to Motion, overlaid with male self-disgust, a theme apparent in Larkin's two published novels and in his later poetry. Motion suggests that the loss of erotic impetus, and Larkin's apparent fading of interest, are the main reasons why the story peters out.<ref name= M93/>

===''Sugar and Spice: A Sheaf of Poems''===
The typescript of ''Sugar and Spice'' consists of six poems, which in sequence are:
 1.\"The False Friend\", 
 2. \"Bliss\", 
 3. \"Femmes Damnées\",
 4. \"Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis\", 
 5. \"Holidays\" and
 6. \"The School in August\".

A seventh poem in pencil, \"Fourth Form Loquitur\" has been loosely inserted into the typescript.<ref>Booth, pp. 241–52</ref> \"Femmes Damnées\", which was printed by John Fuller at the Sycamore Press, Oxford, in 1978, is the only Coleman work published in Larkin's lifetime.<ref>Motion, p.98</ref> This poem, and \"The School in August\", were included in Larkin's ''Collected Poems'' published in 1988;<ref>Motion, p. 97</ref> \"The School in August\" was omitted from the 2003 revised edition of the collection although, according to Amis, it is the poem that best gives the flavour of the Coleman pastiche.<ref>Amis, p. 55</ref> \"Bliss\" was included in Larkin's ''Selected Letters'' (1992), as part of a letter to Amis.<ref>Thwaite, p. 64</ref>

Motion describes the Coleman poems as \"a world of comfortless jealousies, breathless bike-rides and deathless crushes\", mixing elements from writers and poets such as [[Angela Brazil]], [[Richmal Crompton]], [[John Betjeman]] and [[W.H. Auden]]. Larkin's own attitude to these poems appears equivocal. He expresses pleasure that his friend [[Edmund Crispin|Bruce Montgomery]] liked them, especially \"The School in August\".<ref>Thwaite, p. 69</ref> However, to Amis he writes: \"I think all wrong-thinking people ought to like them. I used to write them whenever I'd seen any particularly ripe schoolgirl&nbsp;... Writing about grown women is less perverse and therefore less satisfying\".<ref>Thwaite, p. 70</ref> Booth finds the poems the most impressive of all the Coleman works, in their evidence of Larkin's early ability to create striking and moving images from conventional school story clichés. They are an early demonstration of Larkin's talent for finding depths in ordinariness, an ability that characterised many of his later poems. Booth draws specific attention to the elegiac quality of the final lines of \"The School in August\": \"And even swimming groups can fade / Games mistresses turn grey\". In Booth's view the Coleman poems are among the best Larkin wrote in the 1940s, well beyond anything in his first published selection ''The North Ship'' (1945).<ref>Booth, p. xvii</ref>

===\"What Are We Writing For\"===
The typescript of the essay is headed by an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]], attributed to ''The Upbringing of Daughters'' by Catherine Durning Whethem. It reads: \"The chief justification of reading books of any sort is the enlargement of experience that should accrue therefrom\".<ref>Booth, p. 253</ref> The text which follows is, in Motion's words, \"a homily on how and how not to write for children\".<ref name= M101-102>Motion, pp. 101–02</ref> It argues for the need for well-drawn heroines, and for unrepentant villainesses: \"To be tenacious in evil is the duty of every villain&nbsp;... Let her hate the heroine wholeheartedly, and refuse, yes, even on the last page, to take her hand in forgiveness\". The story should not be about schoolgirls, but about a school with girls in it. The school must be English; foreign settings or trips abroad are disparaged. Larkin, in Coleman's voice, pleads for \"[[Classical unities|the Classic Unities]]\": Unity of Place, which is the school and its inhabitants; Unity of Time, normally the term in which the action occurs; and Unity of Action, whereby every recorded incident contributes in some way to the telling of the story. The essay is laden with quotations from many writers of the genre, among them Joy Francis, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, [[Elsie J. Oxenham]], [[Elinor Brent-Dyer]] and Nancy Breary.<ref>Booth, pp. 255–73</ref>

Motion argues that aside from the sometimes facetious tone, the opinions expressed by Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild [[xenophobia]] that enters the essay, foreshadow his own mature prejudices.<ref name= M101/> Bradford believes that the essay reads as a serious, well-researched paper on the genre of early twentieth century boarding school literature, worthy of inclusion in [[F. W. Bateson]]'s ''Essays and Criticism'' had that journal existed in 1943.<ref name= B52/>

==Critical reception==
[[File:Andrew Motion, April 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A tall man wearing a suit and holding a sheaf of papers stands, slightly stooping, in front of a microphone. A seated woman, and the crossed legs of another, are visible behind him.|Andrew Motion, Larkin's biographer, who made public the existence of the \"Brunette Coleman\" works]]
Shortly before his death in 1985 Larkin instructed his companion [[Relationships that influenced Philip Larkin#Monica Jones|Monica Jones]] to burn his diaries. His instructions did not cover other writings, therefore the Coleman material remained in the archives of the [[Brynmor Jones Library]] at the [[University of Hull]], where Larkin had worked as chief librarian since 1955.<ref name= indy>{{cite journal|last= Canning|first= Richard|title= Trouble at Willow Gables and Other Fictions, Philip Larkin (edited by James Booth)|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/trouble-at-willow-gables-and-other-fictions-philip-larkin-edited-by-james-booth-9234191.html |journal= [[The Independent]]|date= 16 May 2002}}</ref> The existence of these papers was first made public in 1992, when Larkin's ''Selected Letters'' was published. In the following year extensive extracts from the Coleman works appeared in Motion's biography of Larkin, and became the subject of literary analysis by M. W. Rowe, in his 1999 essay \"Unreal Girls: Lesbian Fantasy in Early Larkin\". Rowe saw Larkin's adoption of a female persona as an outlet, compensating for his sexual awkwardness and lack of success with Oxford women.<ref>Rowe (2000), pp. 82–85</ref> The punishment scenes, in which women punish women, were a means of subduing Larkin's feelings of anger and frustration with his personal sexual failures.<ref>Rowe (2000), p. 86</ref>  More significantly, according to Rowe, Larkin's invention of Coleman was the catalyst which broke the writing block that had afflicted him for most of his Oxford years.<ref>Rowe (2000), p. 80</ref> The few months of her creative life in 1943 were, Larkin later acknowledged, the prelude to \"the intensest time of my life\"; in the three subsequent years his poetry collection ''[[The North Ship]]'' and his novels ''[[Jill (novel)|Jill]]'' and ''[[A Girl in Winter]]'' were published.<ref name= Rowe2001>{{cite journal|last= Rowe|first= M.W.|title= On being Brunette: Larkin's schoolgirl fiction|doi=10.1111/1467-8705.00387|journal= [[Critical Quarterly]]|volume= 43|issue= 4|pages=42–58|date= December 2001}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

The complete Coleman material, in a collection edited by James Booth, was finally published in 2002.  Booth thought that the material would probably cause \"a huge amount of confusion and smoke because the politically correct brigade will jump on it\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Woolcock|first= Nicola|title= Poet Larkin's lesbian tales 'reveal desire to be female'|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1317050/Poet-Larkins-lesbian-tales-reveal-desire-to-be-female.html|journal= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= 23 April 2001}}</ref> Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in ''[[The Observer]]'' doubted the literary value of the works, citing Motion's view that the stories were \"little more than mild pornography\" which the mature poet would never have wished to see published.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Hartley|first1= Emma|last2= Thorpe|first2= Vanessa|title= How the young Philip Larkin courted Trouble at Willow Gables|url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/22/books.humanities|journal= [[The Observer]]|date= 22 April 2001}}</ref> On publication, Booth's collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s critic [[Jenny Diski]], whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as \"drivel\" and \"sad ramblings\", unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: \"Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned.\" Unlike serious pornographers, \"Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger\". Diski mocks Booth's reverential descriptions of the typescripts \"as though they were slivers of the True Cross\", and concludes: \"Let this be a lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn't got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties.\"<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Jenny Diski|last= Diski|first= Jenny|title= Gym slips and hockey sticks: Philip Larkin's schoolgirl stories|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/16/philiplarkin|journal= [[The Guardian]]|date= 16 May 2002}}</ref>

Other critics were more positive. The ''[[New Statesman]]''{{'}}s Robert Potts found the stories \"entertaining and intriguing for readers familiar with their background and with the genre\", and for the most part charmingly innocent, \"especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life\".  The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic.<ref name= NS>{{cite journal|last= Potts|first= Robert|title= Schoolgirl capers|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/node/155573 |journal= [[New Statesman]]|date= 13 May 2002}}</ref> In a similar vein, Richard Canning in ''[[The Independent]]'' found the ''Willow Gables'' fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's \"sly Sapphic spin\".<ref name= indy/> In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal ''Daedalus'', disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, \"the Brunette phase speaks volumes about the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'—modern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Castle|first= Terry|title= The lesbianism of Philip Larkin|jstor=  20028113 |journal= Daedalus|date= 22 March 2007}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

==Influences==
The effects of Larkin's Coleman phase are clearly evident in his first novel, ''Jill'', in which he makes copious use of ''Willow Gables'' material.<ref>Bradford, p. 57</ref> The novelist's protagonist, a shy Oxford undergraduate called John Kemp, invents a schoolgirl sister called Jill, initially to impress his arrogant and dismissive room-mate, Christopher Warner. Although Warner displays little interest, the non-existent \"Jill\" comes to obsess Kemp. He imagines her at Willow Gables School, and writes long letters to her there. In the form of a short story he details her life at the school—now located in Derbyshire rather than Wiltshire as it had been in the Coleman works.{{refn|The initial page of the St Brides story gives the Willow Gables address as \"near Mallerton, Wilts\".<ref>Booth, p. 131</ref>|group= n}} The girls' names are different, but their speech and attitudes closely reflect those of the earlier stories. A lesbian element is introduced through Jill's fascination with the cool, detached senior girl Minerva Strachey. Kemp's fantasy is disturbed when he meets a real-life Jill, or Gillian; his attempts to match his flight of fancy to reality end in embarrassment and humiliation.<ref>Motion, pp. 154–56</ref>{{refn|The Willow Gables material in ''Jill'' is included between pages 116 and 152 of the 1975 Faber and Faber paperback edition, {{ISBN|0-571-10691-9}}|group= n}}

Reviewing the published Coleman material, ''[[The Independent]]''{{'s}} Richard Canning suggests that the influence of these early works is often discernible in Larkin's poetry.<ref name= indy/> Likewise Stephen Cooper, in his 2004 book ''Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer'', argues that the stylistic and thematic influences of ''Trouble at Willow Gables'' and ''Michaelmas Term at St Brides'' anticipate the poetry's recurrent concern with rebellion and conformity.<ref>Cooper, p. 6</ref> Among examples, Cooper cites Marie's refusal in ''Willow Gables'' to compromise with an unjust authority as reflecting the sentiments expressed in Larkin's poem \"Places, Loved Ones\" (1954).<ref>Cooper, p. 10</ref> The reader, says Cooper, \"is invited to identify with Marie's plight in a manner that foreshadows the empathy felt for the rape victim in 'Deception{{'\"}} (1950).<ref>Cooper, p. 14</ref> When Marie, having escaped from the school, discovers that her freedom is an illusion, she longs to return to the familiar paths. These sentiments are present in poems such as \"Poetry of Departures\" (1954), \"Here\" (1961), and \"High Windows\" (1967).<ref>Cooper, p. 23</ref>

The spirit though not the name of Brunette was briefly revived during 1945–46, when Larkin renewed his friendship with Amis. Among the stillborn projects planned by the pair was a story about two beautiful jazz-loving lesbian undergraduates. According to Booth, the \"feeble plot [was] merely the excuse for lesbian scenes&nbsp;... far indeed from the originality of Larkin's Brunette works of 1943\".<ref>Booth, pp. xxx–xxxi</ref> ''Jill'', completed in 1944, was finally published in October 1946 by The Fortune Press, whose eccentric proprietor [[Reginald Caton]] reportedly accepted the book without reading it.<ref>Motion, p. 132</ref> Larkin was disappointed by the book's critical reception,<ref>Motion, pp. 158–59</ref> but by this time his second novel, ''A Girl in Winter'', had been accepted by [[Faber and Faber]], and was duly published in February 1947. It received better reviews than ''Jill'', and achieved moderately good sales;<ref>Motion, p. 164</ref> Booth calls it Larkin's \"most original and adventurous experiment in fiction\". It is written from the viewpoint of its main female character, Katherine, but otherwise is unrelated to the Coleman phase.  Over the following years Larkin began but failed to finish several more novels, in the last of which, ''A New World Symphony'', he returned once again to the device of a female protagonist-narrator. The novel was finally abandoned around 1954.<ref>Booth, pp. xxxvi and xli–xlii</ref>

'''Brunette Coleman''' was a pseudonym used by the poet and writer [[Philip Larkin]]. In 1943, towards the end of his time as an undergraduate at [[St John's College, Oxford]], he wrote several works of fiction, verse and critical commentary under that name, including  [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] stories that parody the style of popular writers of contemporary girls' school fiction.

The Coleman oeuvre consists of a completed novella, ''Trouble at Willow Gables'', set in a girls' boarding school; an incomplete sequel, ''Michaelmas Term at St Brides'', set in a women's college at Oxford; seven short poems with a girls' school ambience; a fragment of pseudo-autobiography; and a critical essay purporting to be Coleman's literary apologia.  The manuscripts were stored in the [[Brynmor Jones Library]] at the [[University of Hull]], where Larkin was chief librarian between 1955 and 1985. Their existence was revealed to the public when Larkin's ''Selected Letters'' and [[Andrew Motion]]'s biography were published in 1992 and 1993 respectively. The Coleman works themselves were finally published, with other Larkin drafts and oddments, in 2002.

At Oxford Larkin underwent a period of confused sexuality and limited literary output. The adoption of a female persona appeared to release his creativity, as in the three years following the Coleman phase he published under his own name two novels and his first poetry collection. Thereafter, although he gradually established his reputation as a poet, his career as a prose writer declined, and despite several attempts he completed no further fiction. Critical reaction to the publication of the Coleman material was divided between those who saw no value in these [[juvenilia]], and those who considered that they cast useful light on the study of the mature Larkin.

==Origins==
[[File:St johns college oxford SP5106.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Facade of an ancient building, facing an expanse of grass. At ground floor level the building presents a long colonnade of arches, above which are rows of windows up to a crenellated roof line.|The quadrangle, St John's College, Oxford]]
In October 1940 Philip Larkin began studying English at [[St John's College, Oxford]].<ref>Motion, p. 72</ref> A prolific writer since childhood, his primary ambition as an undergraduate was to be a novelist rather than a poet.<ref>Booth, p. vii</ref> As well publishing articles and poems  in ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' and ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', he wrote additional unpublished material that included fragments of semi-autobiographical stories exploring homosexual relationships among groups of undergraduates. According to Larkin's biographer [[Andrew Motion]] these writings, while of no literary value, give an indication of Larkin's confused sexuality at that time, and his growing distaste for what he terms \"this buggery business\".<ref>Motion, pp. 64–65</ref>

From 1942 the character of much of Larkin's private writing changed, as a result of his friendship with a fellow undergraduate from St John's, [[Kingsley Amis]], who arrived at the university that summer.<ref>Motion, pp. 53–54</ref> Amis, a much more confident and assertive character than Larkin, disguised his serious concerns behind a facade of jokes and comic ironies. Larkin soon adopted that style as his own, joining with Amis in composing obscene rhymes and parodies of the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]] they were required to study.<ref>Motion, p. 58</ref> In time they extended their efforts to soft-porn fantasies in which, typically, \"girls roll[ed] around together twanging elastic and straps\".<ref name= M86>Motion, pp. 86–87</ref> After Amis's departure for the army in early 1943, Larkin made his first attempt at writing from a specifically feminine perspective in a story called \"An Incident in the English Camp\", which he subtitled \"A Thoroughly Unhealthy Story\". Lacking any salacious content despite its subtitle, the work is written in a pastiche of sentimental women's magazine prose. It depicts an undergraduate girl's parting from her soldier lover, and ends: \"She walked in exaltation through the black streets, her heart glowing like a coal with deep love\".<ref name= Bviii>Booth, pp. viii–ix</ref>

==Writing==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seniorprefect titlepage.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Details of title, author and publisher are displayed on a page with a heavily decorated border.|Title page of ''The Senior Prefect'', by [[Dorita Fairlie Bruce]] whose work provided a model for Brunette Coleman]] -->
From his general reading, Larkin had acquired a considerable knowledge of girls' school fiction, and had formed definite views on the authors of such works: \"stupid women without a grain of humour in their minds\", who lacked \"erotic sensibility\" and treated the lesbian perspective \"too casually\".<ref name= Bxii>Booth, pp. xii–xiii</ref> His intention to write in this genre is expressed in a letter to his friend Norman Iles, dated 5 June 1943, just before Larkin sat his degree [[Final examination|Finals]]: \"I am spending my time doing an obscene Lesbian novel in the form of a school story\".<ref>Thwaite, p. 58</ref> The novel was ''Trouble at Willow Gables'', a school adventure story in the manner of [[Dorita Fairlie Bruce]] or [[Dorothy Vicary]], which Larkin completed at home while awaiting his Finals results. That was the prelude to a busy summer's writing: \"Leaving Oxford was like taking a cork out of a bottle. Writing flooded out of me\", Larkin later told his biographer.<ref>Motion, p. 106</ref>

Larkin's letter to Iles does not mention a female pseudonym, although the idea of using one had been in his mind for months. The previous March he had begun writing the imagined autobiography of a supposed lady novelist, \"Brunette Coleman\", adapting the name of a well-known contemporary female jazz musician, [[Blanche Coleman]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Soester|first= Jeffrey|title= Obituary: Blanche Coleman|url= https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/may/02/3|journal= [[The Guardian]]|date= 2 May 2008}}</ref>
Larkin tentatively titled the autobiography \"Ante Meridian\"; he soon abandoned it, but held on to the Coleman name. According to James Booth, who prepared the Coleman texts for publication in 2002, the adoption of a female persona was in line with the pose of \"girlish [[narcissism]]\" that Larkin was affecting in the summer of 1943: \"I am dressed in red trousers, shirt and white pullover, and look very beautiful\".<ref>Booth, p. xii</ref> In his letters to Amis, Larkin maintained a straight-faced pretence that Coleman was a real person. Thus in one letter he wrote \"Brunette is very thrilled\" with a poem written in her name, and in another, \"Brunette can stand healthy criticism\".<ref>Thwaite, pp. 66 and 69</ref>

As he waited for offers of employment through the summer and autumn of 1943, Larkin added more works to the Coleman oeuvre. He began a sequel to ''Trouble at Willow Gables'', set in a women's college at Oxford and entitled ''Michaelmas Term at St Bride's'', but did not finish it: \"All literary inspiration has deserted me\", he informed Amis on 13 August.<ref>Thwaite, p. 62</ref> Nevertheless, a week later he told Amis that Brunette was helping him to write a novel, provisionally entitled ''Jill'', about \"a young man who invents an imaginary sister, and falls in love with her\". With this letter Larkin sent a Coleman poem, \"Bliss\", the first of seven written in the girls' school idiom.<ref>Thwaite, p. 63</ref>  As late as 19 October he reported to Amis that \"Brunette is working on a little monograph about girls' school stories\".<ref>Thwaite, p. 80</ref> This is a reference to the putative literary manifesto \"What Are We Writing For\", which became the final Coleman work. Thereafter, Motion records, she disappeared, \"to be mentioned only fleetingly in later accounts of his university life&nbsp;... She ended up as an occasional comic reminder of lost youth\".<ref name= M101>Motion, p. 101</ref>

==Works==
The works which Larkin attributed to Brunette Coleman comprise a short piece of supposed autobiography, a complete short novel, an incomplete second novel, a collection of poems and a literary essay.

===\"Ante Meridian\"===
This fragment of spoof autobiography is distinct from the rest of the Coleman oeuvre in having no relation to girls' school fiction. It records Brunette's early life as the daughter of an eccentric priest, brought up in a tumbledown Cornish cliff-top house.<ref name= M86/> Apart from descriptions of the house and its contents (some of which may be drawn from Larkin's own childhood home in Coventry),<ref name=B52>Bradford, pp. 52–55</ref> much of the narrative is taken up with a comical description of an attempt to launch the local lifeboat. Larkin's biographer Richard Bradford is struck by the distinctive tone in the fragment, different from anything else written under Coleman's name.<ref name= B52/> The text breaks off suddenly; Motion surmises that Larkin abandoned it because he was eager to begin work on the first Coleman novel.<ref name= M86/> Booth describes the prose as \"a mix of [[Daphne du Maurier]] nostalgia and surreal farce\".<ref name= Bviii/>

===Novel: ''Trouble at Willow Gables''===

====Synopsis====
[[File:Then Somehow Marjorie Found Herself Blurting Out the Entire Story by Balliol Salmon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt= Two young women face each other, one (right) seated in a chair, the other sitting on the floor. They are lookng intently at each other; the one on the right has placed her right arm on the other's left shoulder.|Emotional friendships between girls are characteristic of Brunette Coleman's school fiction.]]
Marie Moore, a junior pupil at Willow Gables, receives a birthday present of £5 from an aunt. After the banknote is retained for safe keeping by the headmistress, Miss Holden, Marie slyly recovers it but is quickly found out, and is coerced by Miss Holden into giving the money to the school's gymnasium fund. When later the banknote goes missing from the fund's collection box, Marie is suspected, but protests her innocence despite a savage beating from Miss Holden with assistance from two burly [[Prefect#Academic|school prefects]]. Only her friend Myfanwy believes her. Confined in the school's punishment room, Marie manages to escape with the help of a domestic servant, and runs away.

Hilary Russell, a prefect and predatory lesbian, lusts after Mary Beech, the school's cricket captain. On a night expedition in pursuit of Mary, Hilary catches Margaret Tattenham, a junior, in the act of replacing the £5 note in Miss Holden's room. Margaret says she originally took the money as a prank; Hilary agrees not to report her to Miss Holden in return for sexual favours, to which Margaret reluctantly consents. The following morning, Hilary denounces her anyway; Margaret responds by revealing Hilary's sexual harassment but is not believed, and is taken to the punishment room where Marie's absence is revealed.

Hilary is sent with a search party to find the missing girl. Meanwhile, Margaret makes a daring escape via the window, and rides off on the school horse.  She finds Marie, who is miserable and frightened and wants to return to the school whatever the consequences. Margaret confesses that she  borrowed  the £5 to bet on a horse, and has won £100. She means to leave Willow Gables for good, and apologises to Marie for the trouble she has caused her. This conversation is overheard by Hilary's search party, and after a scuffle the truants are captured. On the way back to school they hear cries from the river; it is Myfanwy, who has got into difficulties while swimming. Margaret frees herself from her captors' clutches, dives in and saves her drowning friend.

Back at the school, Miss Holden overlooks the theft in view of Margaret's heroism, although she confiscates the £100 winnings and donates the money to a new swimming pool fund. Marie is exonerated, and her £5 is returned. Mary Beech comes forward to corroborate Margaret's accusations against Hilary, who is summarily expelled. Marie and Myfanwy enjoy an emotional reunion in the school sickroom, as life at the school returns to normal, with friendship and forgiveness all round.

====Commentary====
The typescript begins with a dedication page \"To Jacinth\" (Brunette Coleman's imagined secretary). There follows an untitled poem which later appears, slightly altered, as \"The School in August\" in ''Sugar and Spice'', the Coleman poetry collection. In the story the surnames of the headmistress and principal girls have been altered in ink throughout the typescript; some of the original names belonged to Larkin's real-life acquaintances at Oxford. The presence of a publisher's inkstamp on the wallet containing the typescript indicates that the story may have been submitted by Larkin for publication.<ref>Booth, pp. 3–5</ref>

Booth argues that, whatever Larkin's motive in writing it, the story follows the parameters of schoolgirl fiction with some fidelity. Its main characters all have models within the genre; Marie has much in common with Dorita Fairlie Bruce's recurrent character [[Dimsie Goes to School|\"Dimsie\"]], while Hilary is likewise based on Dorothy Vicary's villainous \"Una Vickers\" in ''Niece of the Headmistress''. The usual themes of friendships, rivalries and injustices are explored, and the ending in reconciliation and future hope is entirely true to type.<ref name= Bxii/> Some scenes—the savage beating endured by Marie, the lingering descriptions of girls dressing and undressing, Hilary's smouldering sexuality—may, Booth asserts, be written with \"the lusts of the male heterosexual gaze\" in mind but, he continues, the reader looking for explicit pornography will be disappointed.<ref>Booth, p. xvi</ref> Bradford notes three prose styles combining in the narrative: \"cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism&nbsp;... and&nbsp;... its writer's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement\".<ref>Bradford, p. 51</ref> Motion finds the tone of the prose frivolous on the surface, yet fundamentally cold and cruel: \"Once its women have been arraigned for pleasure they are dismissed; once they have been enjoyed they are treated with indifference\".<ref>Motion, p. 92</ref>

===Novel: ''Michaelmas Term at St Bride's''===

====Synopsis====
[[File:Somerville College.jpg|thumb|alt= A large brick building is shown, left, with long upper windows above which is classical pediment which includes a round window. In front of the building is an area of grass and trees.|[[Somerville College, Oxford]], the recognisable model for St Bride's]]
In this incomplete story Mary, Marie, Margaret and Myfanwy, friends from Willow Gables, are new undergraduates at St Bride's College, Oxford.  Mary is disconcerted to find that she is sharing her rooms with Hilary, her old adversary from the school. However, although Hilary still has a roving lesbian eye, she has lost most of her predatory instincts  and the two become friends. Mary falls foul of Mary de Putron, the aggressive and authoritarian college games captain;  in the hockey trials de Putron makes Mary play out of her normal position, so that performs badly.  Hilary subsequently avenges Mary's humiliation by seducing de Putron's boyfriend, a gauche [[Royal Air Force]] officer called Clive, whom she then dumps unceremoniously.

Of Myfanwy's doings we learn relatively little. Margaret, still fascinated with horse-racing, sets up her own bookmaking business. Marie discovers psychoanalysis  and tries to cure her sister  Philippa's leather belt fetish. After various efforts prove unsuccessful, the sisters seek solace in alcohol. The later stages of the story introduce Larkin's real-life friend, Diana Gollancz, and recount her preparations for a fashionable party. In the final scenes the narrative becomes surreal, as on their alcoholic quest Marie and Philippa are confronted by the knowledge that they are characters in a story, while \"real life\" is going on in the next room. Marie takes a peep at real life, and decides she would rather stay in the story, which breaks off at this point with a few pencil notes indicating possible ways in which it might have continued.

====Commentary====
Only the first dozen pages of the manuscript are typed; the remainder is handwritten. The surnames of the characters, which were changed in ''Trouble at Willow Gables'', are unaltered. The script carries a dedication to \"Miriam and Diana\": Miriam was an acquaintance with whom Larkin had discussed lesbian relationships, while Diana Gollancz (\"Diana G.\" in the story), the daughter of the publisher [[Victor Gollancz]], supplied him with many anecdotes from her schooldays.<ref>Booth, pp. 129–30</ref><ref>Motion, p. 88</ref> According to Motion, \"St Bride's\" is recognisably based on [[Somerville College, Oxford]].<ref name= M93>Motion, pp. 93–96</ref>

In his analysis of the Coleman fiction, Stephen Cooper notes that, as with ''Willow Gables'', the narrative voice switches from character to character so that different thoughts, attitudes and perspectives can be expressed.<ref>Cooper, pp. 23–25</ref> Cooper argues that as the narrative progresses, Larkin's concerns (in his Coleman voice) move beyond sexual titillation; he is no longer interested in describing lesbian encounters in voyeuristic detail.<ref>Cooper, p. 28</ref> Hilary emerges as saviour rather than seducer, as a campaigner against male oppression, and as a figure who \"deviates from the cultural norms [yet] can triumph over those who adopt conventional attitudes\".<ref>Cooper, p. 30</ref> The scenes with sexual content or innuendo are largely confined to the earlier parts of the story. The later parts, which introduce the male characters \"Clive\" and Hilary's other admirer, the contemptible \"Creature\" are, according to Motion, overlaid with male self-disgust, a theme apparent in Larkin's two published novels and in his later poetry. Motion suggests that the loss of erotic impetus, and Larkin's apparent fading of interest, are the main reasons why the story peters out.<ref name= M93/>

===''Sugar and Spice: A Sheaf of Poems''===
The typescript of ''Sugar and Spice'' consists of six poems, which in sequence are:
 1.\"The False Friend\", 
 2. \"Bliss\", 
 3. \"Femmes Damnées\",
 4. \"Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis\", 
 5. \"Holidays\" and
 6. \"The School in August\". 


A seventh poem in pencil, \"Fourth Form Loquitur\" has been loosely inserted into the typescript.<ref>Booth, pp. 241–52</ref> \"Femmes Damnées\", which was printed by John Fuller at the Sycamore Press, Oxford, in 1978, is the only Coleman work published in Larkin's lifetime.<ref>Motion, p.98</ref> This poem, and \"The School in August\", were included in Larkin's ''Collected Poems'' published in 1988;<ref>Motion, p. 97</ref> \"The School in August\" was omitted from the 2003 revised edition of the collection although, according to Amis, it is the poem that best gives the flavour of the Coleman pastiche.<ref>Amis, p. 55</ref> \"Bliss\" was included in Larkin's ''Selected Letters'' (1992), as part of a letter to Amis.<ref>Thwaite, p. 64</ref>

Motion describes the Coleman poems as \"a world of comfortless jealousies, breathless bike-rides and deathless crushes\", mixing elements from writers and poets such as [[Angela Brazil]], [[Richmal Crompton]], [[John Betjeman]] and [[W.H. Auden]]. Larkin's own attitude to these poems appears equivocal. He expresses pleasure that his friend [[Edmund Crispin|Bruce Montgomery]] liked them, especially \"The School in August\".<ref>Thwaite, p. 69</ref> However, to Amis he writes: \"I think all wrong-thinking people ought to like them. I used to write them whenever I'd seen any particularly ripe schoolgirl&nbsp;... Writing about grown women is less perverse and therefore less satisfying\".<ref>Thwaite, p. 70</ref> Booth finds the poems the most impressive of all the Coleman works, in their evidence of Larkin's early ability to create striking and moving images from conventional school story clichés. They are an early demonstration of Larkin's talent for finding depths in ordinariness, an ability that characterised many of his later poems. Booth draws specific attention to the elegiac quality of the final lines of \"The School in August\": \"And even swimming groups can fade / Games mistresses turn grey\". In Booth's view the Coleman poems are among the best Larkin wrote in the 1940s, well beyond anything in his first published selection ''The North Ship'' (1945).<ref>Booth, p. xvii</ref>

===\"What Are We Writing For\"===
The typescript of the essay is headed by an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]], attributed to ''The Upbringing of Daughters'' by Catherine Durning Whethem. It reads: \"The chief justification of reading books of any sort is the enlargement of experience that should accrue therefrom\".<ref>Booth, p. 253</ref> The text which follows is, in Motion's words, \"a homily on how and how not to write for children\".<ref name= M101-102>Motion, pp. 101–02</ref> It argues for the need for well-drawn heroines, and for unrepentant villainesses: \"To be tenacious in evil is the duty of every villain&nbsp;... Let her hate the heroine wholeheartedly, and refuse, yes, even on the last page, to take her hand in forgiveness\". The story should not be about schoolgirls, but about a school with girls in it. The school must be English; foreign settings or trips abroad are disparaged. Larkin, in Coleman's voice, pleads for \"[[Classical unities|the Classic Unities]]\": Unity of Place, which is the school and its inhabitants; Unity of Time, normally the term in which the action occurs; and Unity of Action, whereby every recorded incident contributes in some way to the telling of the story. The essay is laden with quotations from many writers of the genre, among them Joy Francis, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, [[Elsie J. Oxenham]], [[Elinor Brent-Dyer]] and Nancy Breary.<ref>Booth, pp. 255–73</ref>

Motion argues that aside from the sometimes facetious tone, the opinions expressed by Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild [[xenophobia]] that enters the essay, foreshadow his own mature prejudices.<ref name= M101/> Bradford believes that the essay reads as a serious, well-researched paper on the genre of early twentieth century boarding school literature, worthy of inclusion in [[F. W. Bateson]]'s ''Essays and Criticism'' had that journal existed in 1943.<ref name= B52/>

==Critical reception==
[[File:Andrew Motion, April 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A tall man wearing a suit and holding a sheaf of papers stands, slightly stooping, in front of a microphone. A seated woman, and the crossed legs of another, are visible behind him.|Andrew Motion, Larkin's biographer, who made public the existence of the \"Brunette Coleman\" works]]
Shortly before his death in 1985 Larkin instructed his companion [[Relationships that influenced Philip Larkin#Monica Jones|Monica Jones]] to burn his diaries. His instructions did not cover other writings, therefore the Coleman material remained in the archives of the [[Brynmor Jones Library]] at the [[University of Hull]], where Larkin had worked as chief librarian since 1955.<ref name= indy>{{cite journal|last= Canning|first= Richard|title= Trouble at Willow Gables and Other Fictions, Philip Larkin (edited by James Booth)|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/trouble-at-willow-gables-and-other-fictions-philip-larkin-edited-by-james-booth-9234191.html |journal= [[The Independent]]|date= 16 May 2002}}</ref> The existence of these papers was first made public in 1992, when Larkin's ''Selected Letters'' was published. In the following year extensive extracts from the Coleman works appeared in Motion's biography of Larkin, and became the subject of literary analysis by M. W. Rowe, in his 1999 essay \"Unreal Girls: Lesbian Fantasy in Early Larkin\". Rowe saw Larkin's adoption of a female persona as an outlet, compensating for his sexual awkwardness and lack of success with Oxford women.<ref>Rowe (2000), pp. 82–85</ref> The punishment scenes, in which women punish women, were a means of subduing Larkin's feelings of anger and frustration with his personal sexual failures.<ref>Rowe (2000), p. 86</ref>  More significantly, according to Rowe, Larkin's invention of Coleman was the catalyst which broke the writing block that had afflicted him for most of his Oxford years.<ref>Rowe (2000), p. 80</ref> The few months of her creative life in 1943 were, Larkin later acknowledged, the prelude to \"the intensest time of my life\"; in the three subsequent years his poetry collection ''[[The North Ship]]'' and his novels ''[[Jill (novel)|Jill]]'' and ''[[A Girl in Winter]]'' were published.<ref name= Rowe2001>{{cite journal|last= Rowe|first= M.W.|title= On being Brunette: Larkin's schoolgirl fiction|doi=10.1111/1467-8705.00387|journal= [[Critical Quarterly]]|volume= 43|issue= 4|pages=42–58|date= December 2001}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

The complete Coleman material, in a collection edited by James Booth, was finally published in 2002.  Booth thought that the material would probably cause \"a huge amount of confusion and smoke because the politically correct brigade will jump on it\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Woolcock|first= Nicola|title= Poet Larkin's lesbian tales 'reveal desire to be female'|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1317050/Poet-Larkins-lesbian-tales-reveal-desire-to-be-female.html|journal= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= 23 April 2001}}</ref> Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in ''[[The Observer]]'' doubted the literary value of the works, citing Motion's view that the stories were \"little more than mild pornography\" which the mature poet would never have wished to see published.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Hartley|first1= Emma|last2= Thorpe|first2= Vanessa|title= How the young Philip Larkin courted Trouble at Willow Gables|url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/22/books.humanities|journal= [[The Observer]]|date= 22 April 2001}}</ref> On publication, Booth's collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s critic [[Jenny Diski]], whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as \"drivel\" and \"sad ramblings\", unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: \"Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned.\" Unlike serious pornographers, \"Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger\". Diski mocks Booth's reverential descriptions of the typescripts \"as though they were slivers of the True Cross\", and concludes: \"Let this be a lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn't got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties.\"<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Jenny Diski|last= Diski|first= Jenny|title= Gym slips and hockey sticks: Philip Larkin's schoolgirl stories|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/16/philiplarkin|journal= [[The Guardian]]|date= 16 May 2002}}</ref>

Other critics were more positive. The ''[[New Statesman]]''{{'}}s Robert Potts found the stories \"entertaining and intriguing for readers familiar with their background and with the genre\", and for the most part charmingly innocent, \"especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life\".  The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic.<ref name= NS>{{cite journal|last= Potts|first= Robert|title= Schoolgirl capers|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/node/155573 |journal= [[New Statesman]]|date= 13 May 2002}}</ref> In a similar vein, Richard Canning in ''[[The Independent]]'' found the ''Willow Gables'' fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's \"sly Sapphic spin\".<ref name= indy/> In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal ''Daedalus'', disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, \"the Brunette phase speaks volumes about the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'—modern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Castle|first= Terry|title= The lesbianism of Philip Larkin|jstor=  20028113 |journal= Daedalus|date= 22 March 2007}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

==Influences==
The effects of Larkin's Coleman phase are clearly evident in his first novel, ''Jill'', in which he makes copious use of ''Willow Gables'' material.<ref>Bradford, p. 57</ref> The novelist's protagonist, a shy Oxford undergraduate called John Kemp, invents a schoolgirl sister called Jill, initially to impress his arrogant and dismissive room-mate, Christopher Warner. Although Warner displays little interest, the non-existent \"Jill\" comes to obsess Kemp. He imagines her at Willow Gables School, and writes long letters to her there. In the form of a short story he details her life at the school—now located in Derbyshire rather than Wiltshire as it had been in the Coleman works.{{refn|The initial page of the St Brides story gives the Willow Gables address as \"near Mallerton, Wilts\".<ref>Booth, p. 131</ref>|group= n}} The girls' names are different, but their speech and attitudes closely reflect those of the earlier stories. A lesbian element is introduced through Jill's fascination with the cool, detached senior girl Minerva Strachey. Kemp's fantasy is disturbed when he meets a real-life Jill, or Gillian; his attempts to match his flight of fancy to reality end in embarrassment and humiliation.<ref>Motion, pp. 154–56</ref>{{refn|The Willow Gables material in ''Jill'' is included between pages 116 and 152 of the 1975 Faber and Faber paperback edition, {{ISBN|0-571-10691-9}}|group= n}}

Reviewing the published Coleman material, ''[[The Independent]]''{{'s}} Richard Canning suggests that the influence of these early works is often discernible in Larkin's poetry.<ref name= indy/> Likewise Stephen Cooper, in his 2004 book ''Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer'', argues that the stylistic and thematic influences of ''Trouble at Willow Gables'' and ''Michaelmas Term at St Brides'' anticipate the poetry's recurrent concern with rebellion and conformity.<ref>Cooper, p. 6</ref> Among examples, Cooper cites Marie's refusal in ''Willow Gables'' to compromise with an unjust authority as reflecting the sentiments expressed in Larkin's poem \"Places, Loved Ones\" (1954).<ref>Cooper, p. 10</ref> The reader, says Cooper, \"is invited to identify with Marie's plight in a manner that foreshadows the empathy felt for the rape victim in 'Deception{{'\"}} (1950).<ref>Cooper, p. 14</ref> When Marie, having escaped from the school, discovers that her freedom is an illusion, she longs to return to the familiar paths. These sentiments are present in poems such as \"Poetry of Departures\" (1954), \"Here\" (1961), and \"High Windows\" (1967).<ref>Cooper, p. 23</ref>

The spirit though not the name of Brunette was briefly revived during 1945–46, when Larkin renewed his friendship with Amis. Among the stillborn projects planned by the pair was a story about two beautiful jazz-loving lesbian undergraduates. According to Booth, the \"feeble plot [was] merely the excuse for lesbian scenes&nbsp;... far indeed from the originality of Larkin's Brunette works of 1943\".<ref>Booth, pp. xxx–xxxi</ref> ''Jill'', completed in 1944, was finally published in October 1946 by The Fortune Press, whose eccentric proprietor [[Reginald Caton]] reportedly accepted the book without reading it.<ref>Motion, p. 132</ref> Larkin was disappointed by the book's critical reception,<ref>Motion, pp. 158–59</ref> but by this time his second novel, ''A Girl in Winter'', had been accepted by [[Faber and Faber]], and was duly published in February 1947. It received better reviews than ''Jill'', and achieved moderately good sales;<ref>Motion, p. 164</ref> Booth calls it Larkin's \"most original and adventurous experiment in fiction\". It is written from the viewpoint of its main female character, Katherine, but otherwise is unrelated to the Coleman phase.  Over the following years Larkin began but failed to finish several more novels, in the last of which, ''A New World Symphony'', he returned once again to the device of a female protagonist-narrator. The novel was finally abandoned around 1954.<ref>Booth, pp. xxxvi and xli–xlii</ref>

The '''Siege of Saïo''' or '''Battle of Saïo''' took place during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. Belgo-Congolese troops, British Commonwealth forces and local resistance fighters besieged the fort at the market town of [[Dembidolo|Saïo]] in south-western [[Ethiopia]] in 1941. The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender.

In the first months of 1941, British and [[Force Publique|Belgian colonial forces]] attacked [[Italian East Africa]] from the colony of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. By the end of March, they had seized the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Saïo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]] and later General [[Pietro Gazzera]]. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Saïo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the [[South African Air Force]] put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.

At the end of the month General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] took charge of the Belgian force. He was instructed by the British to attack when an opportunity presented itself. On 3 July, he assaulted the base of Saïo Mountain and in the afternoon Gazzera sued for peace. On 6 July, the Belgians formally accepted the surrender of Gazzera, eight of his generals and over {{nowrap|6,000 Italian}} soldiers.

===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===

{{see also|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)|l1=Order of Battle, East African Campaign|First Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}

On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the colony of ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian victory in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], fought 3 October 1935 – May 1936) and the existing Italian possessions of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]].{{efn|The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during World War II but the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=6–7, 69}}}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=38–40}}

==Prelude==

===''Regio Esercito''===

{{see also|Regio Esercito}}

[[File:Ethiopia shaded relief map 1999, CIA.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Ethiopia}}]]
[[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], was appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor-General]] of Italian East Africa in November 1937, with a headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]], the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of the ''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana'' (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and ''Generale d'Armata Aerea'' (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 locally recruited}} and Italian-born army, naval and air force personnel, available. By 1 August, mobilisation in Italian East Africa had increased that number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=93}} On 10 June, the ''Regio Esercito'' (Italian Royal Army) was organised in four commands, with the military forces in Ethiopia led by General [[Pietro Gazzera]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}

Aosta had the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division ''Cacciatori d'Africa'']] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] from Italy, a battalion of ''[[Alpini]]'' (elite mountain troops), a ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' battalion of motorised infantry, several {{lang|it|Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale}} (MSVN [[MVSN Colonial Militia|''Camicie Nere'']] [Blackshirt]) battalions and an assortment of smaller units; about 70 percent of the Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in Italian East Africa and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}

===British plans===

In August 1939, Wavell ordered a plan covertly to encourage a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of [[Gojjam]], which the Italians had never been able entirely to repress after the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|Daniel Sandford]] arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. [[Gideon Force|Mission 101]] was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots). In June 1940, [[Haile Selassie]] arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of [[Lake Tana]], to [[Dangila]], Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the ''Arbegnoch''. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=403}}

The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from émigré volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and £1 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma–Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=404–405}}

===Belgian plans===
{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}

[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Force Publique'' soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa]]
At the conclusion of the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (\"Public Force\" i.e. the colonial army) of the [[Belgian Congo]] in Central Africa. It thus made up the bulk of the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Consisting of 15,000 native ranks and Belgian officers, it was well equipped, well disciplined and dispersed throughout the colony.<ref name= Veranneman83>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=83}}</ref> Through the year, the ''Force Publique'''s defence obligations were considered too important for it to be spared for any offensive operations. The Allies were uncertain of German intentions toward [[Portuguese Angola]], the Congo's neighbour to the south, and the extent of [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] influence in [[French Equatorial Africa]] to the north.<ref name= weller4>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=4}}</ref> Belgian members of the ''Force Publique'' grew impatient with the colonial administration's perceived inaction and the garrison of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] mutinied in protest. Governor-General [[Pierre Ryckmans (governor-general)|Pierre Ryckmans]] was forced to send a senior member of his staff to calm them down and explain the importance of the Congo's economic contribution to the war.<ref name= Veranneman83/>

[[File:Force Publique trek 1941.jpg|thumb|Map of the Belgo-Congolese expedition to Ethiopia|left]]
Meanwhile, Ryckmans and Lieutenant General [[Paul Ermens]] discussed the possibility of sending an expedition to Italian East Africa with the South African and British military missions in [[Léopoldville]].<ref name= weller4/> There were two problems with such an undertaking: Italian territory was thousands of kilometres away and Belgium was not at war with Italy. The [[Belgian government in exile]] was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940.<ref name= Veranneman84>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=84}}</ref> Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo.<ref name= weller5>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=5}}</ref>

[[Free French Forces]] consolidated their control over Equatorial Africa at the [[Battle of Gabon]] and more German involvement in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] (begun by Italy in 1939) made the possibility of intervention in Portugal remote.<ref name= weller4/> The staff of the ''Force Publique'' and the Belgian government then resolved to assemble an expedition to fight in Italian East Africa.<ref name= weller5/> Plans were coordinated with the British and in February 1941, after an extended period of preparation, the first group of 8,000 troops and porters set out from the Congo for Ethiopia.<ref name= Veranneman84/> Starting in [[Stanley Pool]], they rode a dozen {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} barges and a tugboat up the [[Congo River]] to [[Aketi (town)|Aketi]]. The expeditionary force took the [[Vicicongo line]] (a narrow-gauge railway) from Aketi to [[Mungbere]] and drove by lorry to [[Juba]] in Sudan where they took to the [[White Nile]].<ref name= weller8>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=8}}</ref> After five days' travel, the first Belgo-Congolese battalion reached [[Malakal]] and marched to the border town of [[Kurmuk]] before entering Ethiopia.<ref name= weller6>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=6}}</ref>

===East African Campaign===

[[File:Force Publique Commander-in-Chief crossing the Baro River near Gambela.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|{{centre|Belgo-Congolese forces crossing the Baro River near Gambela}}]]
Following the declaration of war against France and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] on 10 June 1940, the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] began as military forces of the [[British Empire]] engaged the Italian East African Armed Forces Command (''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale'') in Italian East Africa. After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a [[salient (geography)|salient]] formed around the [[Baro River]]. In March 1941, the Italian forces began to withdraw from the salient under increasing pressure.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> On 8 March the first battalion of the Belgo-Congolese expeditionary force marched from Kurmuk towards the Italian-held town of Asosa. They attacked three days later in conjunction with troops of the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR), forcing the garrison to retreat to [[Gidami]].<ref name=weller6/> Next, the Belgians and Congolese began attacking the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] directly from the west while two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of the 2/6 KAR under Captain J. W. E. Mackenzie were sent to outflank it and cut off its link with the Italian headquarters at [[Dembidolo|Saïo]]<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533>{{harvnb|Moyse-Bartlett|2012|p=533}}</ref> under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]].<ref name= orpen274>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=274}}</ref> The Belgians were concerned that the Italians might attempt an offensive over the weakly defended Sudanese border; by taking Gambela they could force Gazzera's forces in western Ethiopia into a defensive position.<ref name= weller10>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=10}}</ref><ref name= weller12>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=12}}</ref>{{efn|It was later revealed that General Pietro Gazzera had planned such an attack but had been vetoed by [[Viceroy]] [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta|Amedeo]] on political grounds.<ref name= weller24>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=24}}</ref>}} On 22 March, the KAR companies attacked but withdrew to the south when a planned Belgian assault failed to materialise. The Italians were nevertheless surprised by the flanking manoeuvre and retreated to Saïo.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/>

== Siege ==

On 25 March, the Belgo-Congolese battalion and the two companies of the 2/6 KAR occupied Gambela.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> Exhausted by their journey from the Congo and suffering from dysentery and a lack of artillery, the 1,000 Belgians and Congolese could undertake no further offensive action.<ref name= weller14>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=14}}</ref> Instead they made moves to contain the Italian forces around Saïo from the west, while British troops under General [[Alan Cunningham]] conducted operations in Somalia and eastern Ethiopia.<ref name= Playfair311>{{harvnb|Playfair|1956|p=311}}</ref> The ''Arbegnoch'' also threatened the Italian positions.<ref name= orpen274/> In April, Italian forces burned the [[Pennisetum purpureum|elephant grass]] along the Saïo Plateau to ensure an unobstructed field of fire.<ref name= weller19>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=19}}</ref> That same month the troops of the 2/6th KAR were withdrawn to the [[Dabus River]] to link up with the rest of their unit<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> to contain the Italian garrison in [[Mendi, Ethiopia|Mendi]].<ref name= platt3552/>

=== Actions at Bortai Brook ===
[[File:Saïo terrain.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Saïo Mountain, occupied by the Italians}}]]
The Italians [[Land mine|mined]] the {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}}-long Saïo–Gambela road that led to the Saïo Plateau {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding area. The Belgians began slowly advancing but encountered Italians at the Bortai Brook, which ran perpendicular to the road.<ref name= weller15>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=15}}</ref> The Belgians were strengthened by the arrival of a [[Stokes mortar]] company and another battalion. Numbering at 1,600 soldiers and 600 non-combatant [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], they lacked the strength to seize the plateau. With the Italians receiving reinforcements of troops retreating from the east, the Belgians decided to keep the initiative to disguise their small numbers.<ref name= weller16>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=16}}</ref>

Three days of cold weather and rain preceded the offensive.<ref name= weller21>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=21}}</ref> On 15 April, Lieutenant Colonel Edmond van der Meersch led an attack on the brook. A Belgian lieutenant scouting in [[no man's land]] was ambushed and killed. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by [[sniper]]s concealed in [[the bush]]. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were killed. Three Italians and an estimated 40 [[Eritrean Ascari]] were killed, with approximately 70 Ascari wounded.<ref name= weller16/>

During the ensuring stalemate, the Belgians studied the Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and artillery spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their [[artillery barrage]]s were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue up to an hour after they withdrew.<ref name= weller16/> On 21 April, the Italians launched a large [[counterattack]]. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by [[Oromo people|Galla]] snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks.<ref name= weller16/> With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.<ref name= weller21/><ref name= weller17>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=17}}</ref>

=== Belgian supply difficulties ===

[[File:Belgian truck on rough Ethiopian terrain.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Congolese struggle to move a truck across rough Ethiopian terrain}}]]
By May, Belgian numbers had risen to 2,500 men, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens. The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their communications and supplies. The Baro and [[Sobat River|Sobat]] rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by [[airdrop]], forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations.<ref name= weller17/> Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Sudan, but died of fatigue and undernourishment. Some of the officers resorted to stripping the [[camouflage]] netting from their trucks and [[Seine fishing|seining]] the Baro River for fish amid frequent outbreaks of [[Beriberi]].<ref name= weller18>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=18}}</ref> The Italians, encamped on fertile soil and well supplied, faced no such problems.<ref name= weller17/> The Belgians were also subject to regular air attack.<ref name= platt3552>{{harvnb|Platt|1946|p=3552}}</ref>

=== Renewed Belgian offensives ===

[[File:Italian trench captured by Belgian troops.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian trench captured by Belgian troops}}]]
The Belgo-Congolese situation remained difficult until early June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to reach them. They then decided to try to sever the Italian supply line between Saïo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack.<ref name= weller18/> It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Saïo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered by the arrival of a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Saïo was being supplied.<ref name= weller19/>

At the regular front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to increase their patrol activities upon the Saïo Plateau, to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces.<ref name= weller19/> They used [[shoot-and-scoot]] tactics, avoiding [[counter-battery fire]] and leaving the Italians with the impression that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison and the Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF) committed three [[Hawker Hart]] biplanes to regularly bomb the Saïo fortress and [[strafe]] the surrounding roads.<ref name= weller20>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=20}}</ref> In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in [[Jimma]] in mid June and withdraw to Saïo.<ref name= Playfair310>{{harvnb|Playfair|1956|p=310}}</ref> The 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and headed southeast to cut the Saïo–[[Yubdo (woreda)|Yubdo]] road.<ref name= platt3552/> By the end of the month, the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the [[Didessa River]]. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo, to make their final stand at Saïo. Heavy rain, actions of the ''Arbegnoch'' and the raids from the SAAF added to their problems.<ref name= Playfair311/><ref name= orpen320>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=320}}</ref>

=== Final assault and Italian surrender ===

[[File:Aerial view of Saïo fortress.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|{{centre|Aerial view of Saïo fortress}}]]
Major General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] arrived from the Congo before the end of the month.<ref name= weller20/> On 27 June General [[William Platt]], advancing with British forces from Sudan, ordered the Belgians to attack the Italian positions if an opportunity presented itself and Gilliaert immediately undertook preparations for an offensive.<ref name= Playfair311/> The plans for taking Mogi were abandoned and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Saïo, so all but 50 of the soldiers besieging Mogi were redeployed.<ref name= weller20/><ref name= weller22>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=22}}</ref>

{{quote|I based our chances of success upon continuously keeping aggressive activity along Bortai Brook against Mogi and applying [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s maxim that you can try anything against an enemy who refuses to budge himself.|Gilliaert<ref name= weller21/>}}

[[File:Belgian officers in Saio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|{{centre|General Auguste Gilliaert and Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens at the Italian headquarters in Saïo}}]]
Believing the British pursuit to be closer than it actually was, Gazzera ordered the bridge over the Indina River {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Saïo to be blown, thereby trapping his forces. Though still outnumbered, the Belgians decided to carry on with their offensive.<ref name= weller21/> On 2 July, they forced their way over Bortai Brook.<ref name= platt3552/> At dawn the next day, the Belgian advance posts opened fire on Saïo and half an hour later, the Belgian artillery went into action. The Italians responded with heavy counter-battery fire.<ref name= weller21/> A Belgian battalion advanced upon Italian machine gun nests on the two hills that had been occupied since April. The reserve battalion covered their left flank and Gilliaert dispatched the third battalion under Van der Meersch to the right flank down a goat path that had been mapped by patrols over a [[fortnight]].<ref name= weller21/> Two artillery batteries gave them covering fire.<ref name= Veranneman85>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=85}}</ref> The Belgians captured the hills and the Italians, being flanked on their left side by Van der Meersch's troops, were unable to make it back to their fortifications atop Saïo mountain. With the Saïo-Gambela road under artillery fire, they retired to the plains to their right.<ref name= weller21/> Meanwhile, the 2/6th KAR launched an attack on the Saïo-Yubdo road, continuing throughout the next day with success.<ref name= platt3552/>

The Italians were under the impression that they were facing three Belgian divisions with South African reinforcements.<ref name= weller22/> They also only had about two months' provisions left.<ref name= weller24/> Gazzera radioed to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Addis Abeba]] his intentions to negotiate a surrender with the Belgians.<ref name= Playfair311/> The Belgians were preparing for another assault when at 13:40 two staff cars bearing white flags drove down the mountain. In them were eight Italian generals, a Catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them a short distance away from Bortai Brook near Gambela.<ref name= weller21/> They requested that all hostilities south of the [[Blue Nile]] cease and that their army be granted the [[honours of war]].<ref name= Playfair311/> Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Saïo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.<ref name= orpen321>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=321}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==

[[File:Assossa-Gambela-Saio.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Congolese memorial to the actions at Asosa, Gambela and Saïo in Faradje}}]]
The Belgo-Congolese force lost 462 men during the conflict, 80 percent of them to disease. It was estimated that the Italians lost about three times as many men. A total of 6,454 Italian troops were taken prisoner, including Gazzera, eight other generals and 3,500 Askari, along with the seizure of 20 artillery pieces, 200 machine guns, 250 trucks and 500 mules.<ref name= Veranneman85/> With Gazzera's surrender, [[Gondar]] became the only area in Ethiopia that remained under Italian control.{{sfn|MOI|1941|p=136}} The market in Saïo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Saïo-Gambela road.<ref name= weller22/><ref name= weller24/>

Though only numbering about 3,000 soldiers and 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners in the former [[Galla-Sidamo Governorate]] after the campaign.<ref name= weller22/> At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean Askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps in the east and sent Congolese guards to protect them from Ethiopian retaliation.<ref name= weller23>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=23}}</ref> The Belgian force quickly returned to the Congo with their [[War looting|spoils of war]].<ref name= weller24/> The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.<ref name= Veranneman85/>

=== Commemoration ===

In 1943, a three-sided pyramid was erected in [[Faradje]], Belgian Congo to commemorate the actions of the Congolese in Ethiopia. Each face of the pyramid was inscribed with the name of each major location of fighting, including Saïo. Many locations throughout the country—presently the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]—are named for the battle.{{sfn|Boneza|2014|nopp=y}}

The '''Siege of Saïo''' or '''Battle of Saïo''' took place during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. Belgo-Congolese troops, British Commonwealth forces and local resistance fighters besieged the fort at the market town of [[Dembidolo|Saïo]] in south-western [[Ethiopia]] in 1941. The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender.

In the first months of 1941, British and [[Force Publique|Belgian colonial forces]] attacked [[Italian East Africa]] from the colony of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. By the end of March, they had seized the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Saïo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]] and later General [[Pietro Gazzera]]. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Saïo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the [[South African Air Force]] put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.

At the end of the month General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] took charge of the Belgian force. He was instructed by the British to attack when an opportunity presented itself. On 3 July, he assaulted the base of Saïo Mountain and in the afternoon Gazzera sued for peace. On 6 July, the Belgians formally accepted the surrender of Gazzera, eight of his generals and over {{nowrap|6,000 Italian}} soldiers.

On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the colony of ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian victory in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], fought 3 October 1935 – May 1936) and the existing Italian possessions of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]].{{efn|The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during World War II but the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=6–7, 69}}}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=38–40}}

[[File:Ethiopia shaded relief map 1999, CIA.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Ethiopia}}]]
[[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], was appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor-General]] of Italian East Africa in November 1937, with a headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]], the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of the ''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana'' (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and ''Generale d'Armata Aerea'' (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 locally recruited}} and Italian-born army, naval and air force personnel, available. By 1 August, mobilisation in Italian East Africa had increased that number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=93}} On 10 June, the ''Regio Esercito'' (Italian Royal Army) was organised in four commands, with the military forces in Ethiopia led by General [[Pietro Gazzera]].{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}

Aosta had the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division ''Cacciatori d'Africa'']] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']] from Italy, a battalion of ''[[Alpini]]'' (elite mountain troops), a ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' battalion of motorised infantry, several {{lang|it|Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale}} (MSVN [[MVSN Colonial Militia|''Camicie Nere'']] [Blackshirt]) battalions and an assortment of smaller units; about 70 percent of the Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in Italian East Africa and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=166}}

===British plans===

In August 1939, Wavell ordered a plan covertly to encourage a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of [[Gojjam]], which the Italians had never been able entirely to repress after the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|Daniel Sandford]] arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. [[Gideon Force|Mission 101]] was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots). In June 1940, [[Haile Selassie]] arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of [[Lake Tana]], to [[Dangila]], Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the ''Arbegnoch''. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=403}}

The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from émigré volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and £1 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma–Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=404–405}}

===Belgian plans===
{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}

[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Force Publique'' soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa]]
At the conclusion of the [[Battle of Belgium]] in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (\"Public Force\" i.e. the colonial army) of the [[Belgian Congo]] in Central Africa. It thus made up the bulk of the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Consisting of 15,000 native ranks and Belgian officers, it was well equipped, well disciplined and dispersed throughout the colony.<ref name= Veranneman83>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=83}}</ref> Through the year, the ''Force Publique'''s defence obligations were considered too important for it to be spared for any offensive operations. The Allies were uncertain of German intentions toward [[Portuguese Angola]], the Congo's neighbour to the south, and the extent of [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] influence in [[French Equatorial Africa]] to the north.<ref name= weller4>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=4}}</ref> Belgian members of the ''Force Publique'' grew impatient with the colonial administration's perceived inaction and the garrison of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] mutinied in protest. Governor-General [[Pierre Ryckmans (governor-general)|Pierre Ryckmans]] was forced to send a senior member of his staff to calm them down and explain the importance of the Congo's economic contribution to the war.<ref name= Veranneman83/>

[[File:Force Publique trek 1941.jpg|thumb|Map of the Belgo-Congolese expedition to Ethiopia|left]]
Meanwhile, Ryckmans and Lieutenant General [[Paul Ermens]] discussed the possibility of sending an expedition to Italian East Africa with the South African and British military missions in [[Léopoldville]].<ref name= weller4/> There were two problems with such an undertaking: Italian territory was thousands of kilometres away and Belgium was not at war with Italy. The [[Belgian government in exile]] was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940.<ref name= Veranneman84>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=84}}</ref> Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo.<ref name= weller5>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=5}}</ref>

[[Free French Forces]] consolidated their control over Equatorial Africa at the [[Battle of Gabon]] and more German involvement in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] (begun by Italy in 1939) made the possibility of intervention in Portugal remote.<ref name= weller4/> The staff of the ''Force Publique'' and the Belgian government then resolved to assemble an expedition to fight in Italian East Africa.<ref name= weller5/> Plans were coordinated with the British and in February 1941, after an extended period of preparation, the first group of 8,000 troops and porters set out from the Congo for Ethiopia.<ref name= Veranneman84/> Starting in [[Stanley Pool]], they rode a dozen {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} barges and a tugboat up the [[Congo River]] to [[Aketi (town)|Aketi]]. The expeditionary force took the [[Vicicongo line]] (a narrow-gauge railway) from Aketi to [[Mungbere]] and drove by lorry to [[Juba]] in Sudan where they took to the [[White Nile]].<ref name= weller8>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=8}}</ref> After five days' travel, the first Belgo-Congolese battalion reached [[Malakal]] and marched to the border town of [[Kurmuk]] before entering Ethiopia.<ref name= weller6>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=6}}</ref>

===East African Campaign===

[[File:Force Publique Commander-in-Chief crossing the Baro River near Gambela.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|{{centre|Belgo-Congolese forces crossing the Baro River near Gambela}}]]
Following the declaration of war against France and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] on 10 June 1940, the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] began as military forces of the [[British Empire]] engaged the Italian East African Armed Forces Command (''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale'') in Italian East Africa. After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a [[salient (geography)|salient]] formed around the [[Baro River]]. In March 1941, the Italian forces began to withdraw from the salient under increasing pressure.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> On 8 March the first battalion of the Belgo-Congolese expeditionary force marched from Kurmuk towards the Italian-held town of Asosa. They attacked three days later in conjunction with troops of the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR), forcing the garrison to retreat to [[Gidami]].<ref name=weller6/> Next, the Belgians and Congolese began attacking the town of [[Gambela, Ethiopia|Gambela]] directly from the west while two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of the 2/6 KAR under Captain J. W. E. Mackenzie were sent to outflank it and cut off its link with the Italian headquarters at [[Dembidolo|Saïo]]<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533>{{harvnb|Moyse-Bartlett|2012|p=533}}</ref> under the command of General [[Carlo De Simone]].<ref name= orpen274>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=274}}</ref> The Belgians were concerned that the Italians might attempt an offensive over the weakly defended Sudanese border; by taking Gambela they could force Gazzera's forces in western Ethiopia into a defensive position.<ref name= weller10>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=10}}</ref><ref name= weller12>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=12}}</ref>{{efn|It was later revealed that General Pietro Gazzera had planned such an attack but had been vetoed by [[Viceroy]] [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta|Amedeo]] on political grounds.<ref name= weller24>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=24}}</ref>}} On 22 March, the KAR companies attacked but withdrew to the south when a planned Belgian assault failed to materialise. The Italians were nevertheless surprised by the flanking manoeuvre and retreated to Saïo.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/>

== Siege ==

On 25 March, the Belgo-Congolese battalion and the two companies of the 2/6 KAR occupied Gambela.<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> Exhausted by their journey from the Congo and suffering from dysentery and a lack of artillery, the 1,000 Belgians and Congolese could undertake no further offensive action.<ref name= weller14>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=14}}</ref> Instead they made moves to contain the Italian forces around Saïo from the west, while British troops under General [[Alan Cunningham]] conducted operations in Somalia and eastern Ethiopia.<ref name= Playfair311>{{harvnb|Playfair|1956|p=311}}</ref> The ''Arbegnoch'' also threatened the Italian positions.<ref name= orpen274/> In April, Italian forces burned the [[Pennisetum purpureum|elephant grass]] along the Saïo Plateau to ensure an unobstructed field of fire.<ref name= weller19>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=19}}</ref> That same month the troops of the 2/6th KAR were withdrawn to the [[Dabus River]] to link up with the rest of their unit<ref name= Moyse-Bartlett533/> to contain the Italian garrison in [[Mendi, Ethiopia|Mendi]].<ref name= platt3552/>

=== Actions at Bortai Brook ===
[[File:Saïo terrain.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Saïo Mountain, occupied by the Italians}}]]
The Italians [[Land mine|mined]] the {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}}-long Saïo–Gambela road that led to the Saïo Plateau {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding area. The Belgians began slowly advancing but encountered Italians at the Bortai Brook, which ran perpendicular to the road.<ref name= weller15>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=15}}</ref> The Belgians were strengthened by the arrival of a [[Stokes mortar]] company and another battalion. Numbering at 1,600 soldiers and 600 non-combatant [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], they lacked the strength to seize the plateau. With the Italians receiving reinforcements of troops retreating from the east, the Belgians decided to keep the initiative to disguise their small numbers.<ref name= weller16>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=16}}</ref>

Three days of cold weather and rain preceded the offensive.<ref name= weller21>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=21}}</ref> On 15 April, Lieutenant Colonel Edmond van der Meersch led an attack on the brook. A Belgian lieutenant scouting in [[no man's land]] was ambushed and killed. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by [[sniper]]s concealed in [[the bush]]. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were killed. Three Italians and an estimated 40 [[Eritrean Ascari]] were killed, with approximately 70 Ascari wounded.<ref name= weller16/>

During the ensuring stalemate, the Belgians studied the Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and artillery spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their [[artillery barrage]]s were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue up to an hour after they withdrew.<ref name= weller16/> On 21 April, the Italians launched a large [[counterattack]]. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by [[Oromo people|Galla]] snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks.<ref name= weller16/> With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.<ref name= weller21/><ref name= weller17>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=17}}</ref>

=== Belgian supply difficulties ===

[[File:Belgian truck on rough Ethiopian terrain.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Congolese struggle to move a truck across rough Ethiopian terrain}}]]
By May, Belgian numbers had risen to 2,500 men, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens. The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their communications and supplies. The Baro and [[Sobat River|Sobat]] rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by [[airdrop]], forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations.<ref name= weller17/> Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Sudan, but died of fatigue and undernourishment. Some of the officers resorted to stripping the [[camouflage]] netting from their trucks and [[Seine fishing|seining]] the Baro River for fish amid frequent outbreaks of [[Beriberi]].<ref name= weller18>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=18}}</ref> The Italians, encamped on fertile soil and well supplied, faced no such problems.<ref name= weller17/> The Belgians were also subject to regular air attack.<ref name= platt3552>{{harvnb|Platt|1946|p=3552}}</ref>

=== Renewed Belgian offensives ===

[[File:Italian trench captured by Belgian troops.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian trench captured by Belgian troops}}]]
The Belgo-Congolese situation remained difficult until early June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to reach them. They then decided to try to sever the Italian supply line between Saïo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack.<ref name= weller18/> It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Saïo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered by the arrival of a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Saïo was being supplied.<ref name= weller19/>

At the regular front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to increase their patrol activities upon the Saïo Plateau, to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces.<ref name= weller19/> They used [[shoot-and-scoot]] tactics, avoiding [[counter-battery fire]] and leaving the Italians with the impression that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison and the Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF) committed three [[Hawker Hart]] biplanes to regularly bomb the Saïo fortress and [[strafe]] the surrounding roads.<ref name= weller20>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=20}}</ref> In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in [[Jimma]] in mid June and withdraw to Saïo.<ref name= Playfair310>{{harvnb|Playfair|1956|p=310}}</ref> The 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and headed southeast to cut the Saïo–[[Yubdo (woreda)|Yubdo]] road.<ref name= platt3552/> By the end of the month, the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the [[Didessa River]]. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo, to make their final stand at Saïo. Heavy rain, actions of the ''Arbegnoch'' and the raids from the SAAF added to their problems.<ref name= Playfair311/><ref name= orpen320>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=320}}</ref>

=== Final assault and Italian surrender ===

[[File:Aerial view of Saïo fortress.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|{{centre|Aerial view of Saïo fortress}}]]
Major General [[Auguste Gilliaert]] arrived from the Congo before the end of the month.<ref name= weller20/> On 27 June General [[William Platt]], advancing with British forces from Sudan, ordered the Belgians to attack the Italian positions if an opportunity presented itself and Gilliaert immediately undertook preparations for an offensive.<ref name= Playfair311/> The plans for taking Mogi were abandoned and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Saïo, so all but 50 of the soldiers besieging Mogi were redeployed.<ref name= weller20/><ref name= weller22>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=22}}</ref>

{{quote|I based our chances of success upon continuously keeping aggressive activity along Bortai Brook against Mogi and applying [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s maxim that you can try anything against an enemy who refuses to budge himself.|Gilliaert<ref name= weller21/>}}

[[File:Belgian officers in Saio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|{{centre|General Auguste Gilliaert and Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens at the Italian headquarters in Saïo}}]]
Believing the British pursuit to be closer than it actually was, Gazzera ordered the bridge over the Indina River {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Saïo to be blown, thereby trapping his forces. Though still outnumbered, the Belgians decided to carry on with their offensive.<ref name= weller21/> On 2 July, they forced their way over Bortai Brook.<ref name= platt3552/> At dawn the next day, the Belgian advance posts opened fire on Saïo and half an hour later, the Belgian artillery went into action. The Italians responded with heavy counter-battery fire.<ref name= weller21/> A Belgian battalion advanced upon Italian machine gun nests on the two hills that had been occupied since April. The reserve battalion covered their left flank and Gilliaert dispatched the third battalion under Van der Meersch to the right flank down a goat path that had been mapped by patrols over a [[fortnight]].<ref name= weller21/> Two artillery batteries gave them covering fire.<ref name= Veranneman85>{{harvnb|Veranneman|2014|p=85}}</ref> The Belgians captured the hills and the Italians, being flanked on their left side by Van der Meersch's troops, were unable to make it back to their fortifications atop Saïo mountain. With the Saïo-Gambela road under artillery fire, they retired to the plains to their right.<ref name= weller21/> Meanwhile, the 2/6th KAR launched an attack on the Saïo-Yubdo road, continuing throughout the next day with success.<ref name= platt3552/>

The Italians were under the impression that they were facing three Belgian divisions with South African reinforcements.<ref name= weller22/> They also only had about two months' provisions left.<ref name= weller24/> Gazzera radioed to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Addis Abeba]] his intentions to negotiate a surrender with the Belgians.<ref name= Playfair311/> The Belgians were preparing for another assault when at 13:40 two staff cars bearing white flags drove down the mountain. In them were eight Italian generals, a Catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them a short distance away from Bortai Brook near Gambela.<ref name= weller21/> They requested that all hostilities south of the [[Blue Nile]] cease and that their army be granted the [[honours of war]].<ref name= Playfair311/> Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Saïo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.<ref name= orpen321>{{harvnb|Orpen|1968|p=321}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==

[[File:Assossa-Gambela-Saio.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Congolese memorial to the actions at Asosa, Gambela and Saïo in Faradje}}]]
The Belgo-Congolese force lost 462 men during the conflict, 80 percent of them to disease. It was estimated that the Italians lost about three times as many men. A total of 6,454 Italian troops were taken prisoner, including Gazzera, eight other generals and 3,500 Askari, along with the seizure of 20 artillery pieces, 200 machine guns, 250 trucks and 500 mules.<ref name= Veranneman85/> With Gazzera's surrender, [[Gondar]] became the only area in Ethiopia that remained under Italian control.{{sfn|MOI|1941|p=136}} The market in Saïo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Saïo-Gambela road.<ref name= weller22/><ref name= weller24/>

Though only numbering about 3,000 soldiers and 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners in the former [[Galla-Sidamo Governorate]] after the campaign.<ref name= weller22/> At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean Askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps in the east and sent Congolese guards to protect them from Ethiopian retaliation.<ref name= weller23>{{harvnb|Weller|1942|p=23}}</ref> The Belgian force quickly returned to the Congo with their [[War looting|spoils of war]].<ref name= weller24/> The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.<ref name= Veranneman85/>

=== Commemoration ===

In 1943, a three-sided pyramid was erected in [[Faradje]], Belgian Congo to commemorate the actions of the Congolese in Ethiopia. Each face of the pyramid was inscribed with the name of each major location of fighting, including Saïo. Many locations throughout the country—presently the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]—are named for the battle.{{sfn|Boneza|2014|nopp=y}}

==''Common Sense''==
{{Original research section|small=yes|date=October 2015}}
''Common Sense'' began in 2005.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Common Sense'' is similar in scope to several Carlin-hosted radio programs that aired between 1994 and 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyemerald.com/2003/01/06/kugns-un-savage-broadcasting/|title=KUGN's un-Savage broadcasting|last=Archives|first=Daily Emerald|website=Emerald Media|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref> He has described his political philosophy as \"Neoprudentist\", taking a skeptical approach to evaluation of the current political trends and forces. He fosters discussion by developing and presenting self-deprecating (\"Martian\") thought experiments on solutions to current problems.  The podcasts are said to be broadcast \"almost live from the end of runway two here at the Emerald International Airport.\"

''Common Sense'' was nominated for a Podcast Award in the Politics/News category in 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The People's Choice Podcast Awards |url=http://podcastawards.com/ |website=The Podcast Award |publisher=PodcastAwards.com |accessdate=5 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106083424/http://podcastawards.com/ |archivedate=6 January 2010 }}</ref> The podcast, as of 2016, was generating about 700,000 downloads per episode.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Common Sense'' went through an almost two year hiatus beginning in May 2018 and ending on April 1, 2020, with episode 319 - \"A Recipe for Caesar.\"

|quote = <br />Carlin's podcasts are hardly reminiscent of the dry history lectures you might remember from school.

Carlin’s voice was used in The Twilight Zone episode “Nightmare at 30,000 Feet”.

==Criticism==
Though often complimenting Carlin for his attempt to teach an \"ill-informed citizenry\" about history, some historians critique his approach as too simplistic. Carlin's typical response is that he is a \"fan of History, not a historian\" and focuses on popularizing history and trying to communicate very complex ideas as simply as possible. Additionally, Carlin’s renowned history-telling has been widely recognized as overcoming any such shortcomings<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dan-carlin-hardcore-history_us_5643b5b5e4b08cda34875511|title=America's Best History Teacher Doesn't Work At A School|last=Hart|first=Benjamin|date=2015-11-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US}}</ref>

==''Common Sense''==
{{Original research section|small=yes|date=October 2015}}
''Common Sense'' began in 2005.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Common Sense'' is similar in scope to several Carlin-hosted radio programs that aired between 1994 and 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyemerald.com/2003/01/06/kugns-un-savage-broadcasting/|title=KUGN's un-Savage broadcasting|last=Archives|first=Daily Emerald|website=Emerald Media|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref> He has described his political philosophy as \"Neoprudentist\", taking a skeptical approach to evaluation of the current political trends and forces. He fosters discussion by developing and presenting self-deprecating (\"Martian\") thought experiments on solutions to current problems.  The podcasts are said to be broadcast \"almost live from the end of runway two here at the Emerald International Airport.\"

''Common Sense'' was nominated for a Podcast Award in the Politics/News category in 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The People's Choice Podcast Awards |url=http://podcastawards.com/ |website=The Podcast Award |publisher=PodcastAwards.com |accessdate=5 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106083424/http://podcastawards.com/ |archivedate=6 January 2010 }}</ref> The podcast, as of 2016, was generating about 700,000 downloads per episode.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Common Sense'' is on indefinite hiatus.

Carlin ended the hiatus on April 1, 2020, with episode 319 - \"A Recipe for Caesar.\"

Carlin’s voice was used in The Twilight Zone episode “Nightmare at 30,000 Feet”.

==Criticism==
Though often complimenting Carlin for his attempt to teach an \"ill-informed citizenry\" about history, some historians critique his approach as too simplistic. Carlin's typical response is that he is a \"fan of History, not a historian\" and focuses on popularizing history and trying to communicate very complex ideas as simply as possible. Additionally, Carlin’s renowned history-telling has been widely recognized as overcoming any such shortcomings<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dan-carlin-hardcore-history_us_5643b5b5e4b08cda34875511|title=America's Best History Teacher Doesn't Work At A School|last=Hart|first=Benjamin|date=2015-11-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Club career==

===Tbilisi and Trabzonspor===
Arveladze played at [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], [[Trabzonspor]], and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], and finished at least one season as the top goal scorer at all three. In 1993, he scored an effective first [[UEFA competitions#For clubs|Euro Tournament]] goal in the history of independent [[Football in Georgia|Georgian Football]] in the match against [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], [[Northern Ireland]]. When he led [[Trabzonspor]] in goals in [[1995–96 1.Lig|1995–96]], he also led the [[Süper Lig]], making him the second non-[[Turkey|Turk]] to date to lead that [[Süper Lig|league]] in goals after [[Tarik Hodžić]] [[1983–84 1.Lig|1983–84]]. He is recorded as ''\"most loved foreign player\"'' for [[Trabzonspor#Support|Trabzonspor supporters]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Ajax Amsterdam===
In summer 1997, Arveladze signed for [[Ajax Amsterdam]].<ref name=\"Shoti1\">{{cite book |last=Arveladze |first=Shota |authorlink=Arveladze |date=2012 |title=Yesterday (My Autobiography) |edition=1st |url=http://www.sportall.ge/fexburti/qarthuli-fekhburthi/skhvadaskhva/34055-fragmentebi-shotha-arveladzis-avtobiografiuli-tsignidan-qgushinq.html |access-date=31 May 2017}}</ref> Later, he declared that he was so nervous during his first training session, that he even forgot to take [[football boot]]s with him.<ref name=\"Shoti1\" /> He became a close friend to [[Ronald de Boer]] during his spell in [[Amsterdam]].<ref name=\"Shoti1\" /> His first game at [[Amsterdam Arena]] was a special day for the Georgian player. On 15 August 1997, [[Ajax Amsterdam]] faced Brazilian side [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] in a friendly game. Arveladze scored a goal, while his wife Tamuna gave birth to their first child, Giorgi hours before the game.<ref name=\"Shoti1\" />

Arveladze made a debut for Ajax against [[Vitesse Arnhem]], where he replaced [[Gerald Sibon]] and scored the fourth goal for the club.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldfootball.net/report/eredivisie-1997-1998-afc-ajax-vitesse/ | title = Ajax 5-0 Vitesse (Match Report) | website = worldfootball.net | date = 19 August 1997 | access-date = 31 May 2017}}</ref> During his first season, he scored three [[hat-trick]]s in [[1997–98 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] and total 25 goals in 31 appearances. The manager of the Amsterdam-based club [[Morten Olsen]] was very pleased with the performance of the young striker.<ref name=\"Shoti2\">{{cite book |last=Arveladze |first=Shota |authorlink=Arveladze |date=2012 |title=Yesterday (My Autobiography) |edition=1st |url=http://www.sportall.ge/fexburti/qarthuli-fekhburthi/skhvadaskhva/34181-fragmentebi-shotha-arveladzis-avtobiografiuli-tsignidan-qgushinq.html |access-date=31 May 2017}}</ref> Arveladze was a key figure for the club during [[1997–98 UEFA Cup]] as well. He scored 7 goals in 8 games for the club, including [[hat-trick]] against [[NK Maribor]].<ref name=\"Shoti2\" /> Ajax were eliminated in quarter-finals, against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]. Arveladze scored the club's single goal in a tie.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldfootball.net/report/europa-league-1997-1998-viertelfinale-afc-ajax-spartak-moskva/ | title = Ajax 1-3 Spartak Moscow (Match Report) | website = worldfootball.net | date = 3 March 1998 | access-date = 31 May 2017}}</ref> During his first season, he faced twice [[NAC Breda]], where his twin brother [[Archil Arveladze|Archil]] played. This remains as one of the most memorable facts in Shota's career.<ref name=\"Shoti2\" />

In summer 1998, Ajax signed Arveladze's close friend [[Giorgi Kinkladze]] from [[Manchester City]] for £5 million.<ref name=\"Complete Record\">{{cite book |title=Manchester City – The Complete Record |first=Gary |last=James |publisher=Breedon Books Publishing |year=2006 |location=Derby |pages=224–5 |isbn=1-85983-512-0 }}</ref> They had been friends since their childhood and that looked like a dream move for both.<ref name=\"Shoti2\" /> However, Kinkladze's spell at Ajax proved unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Ajax_agony\">{{cite news |title=Kinky: Jim saved me from Ajax agony |first=Dave |last=Smith |newspaper=[[The Sunday Mirror]] |date=5 December 1999}}</ref>

===Rangers===
Arveladze joined [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] from [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] for £3m in 2001.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/1515958.stm | title = Arveladze ready for Ibrox fight | website = BBC.co.uk | date = 29 August 2001 | access-date = 19 April 2017}}</ref> He agreed a four-year deal with the club. It was obvious that the Georgian would face a fierce competitions for the starting place in the Rangers' strikeforce from the players like [[Tore Andre Flo]], [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Michael Mols]], [[Kenny Miller]], [[Billy Dodds]], [[Ronald de Boer]] and [[Russell Latapy]].

During the first season with [[Glasgow]]-based club, Arveladze scored 17 goals overall, including 11 in [[2001–02 Scottish Premier League|Scottish Premier League]]. He only managed to take part in 30 games, after being injured in February in the quarterfinal of the [[2001–02 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]] against [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=18343.html | title = Arveladze out with ankle injury | website = UEFA.com | date = 28 February 2002 | access-date = 2 May 2017}}</ref> an injury which meant he missed the [[2002 Scottish League Cup Final]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/scotland/news/2002/0318/20020318rfcslaurels.html |title=Rangers cannot afford to rest on their laurels |publisher=ESPN |date=18 March 2002 |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> However, he scored six goals for his club, which managed to win the [[2002 Scottish Cup Final|title]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3027153/Scottish-Cup-Final-Celtic-undone-by-Lovenkrands.html | title = Scottish Cup Final: Celtic undone by Lovenkrands | website = The Telegraph | date = 5 May 2002 | access-date = 2 May 2017}}</ref> Arveladze played in the [[2002 Scottish Cup Final|final]], replacing [[Claudio Caniggia]].

==Plot==

The film begins with the death of an official from the Endowments Department, who goes to Subramaniapuram to research more about the popular Subramanya Swamy temple in the village. Soon, we are told that anyone who either talks about the temple or even tries to know more about it is killed by a snake bite. And slowly, this fear turns into a legend which keeps everyone away from the temple for almost a year. Elsewhere, Karthik (Nikhil), a medical student who does not believe in super natural powers, falls in love with Valli (Swati); however, she keeps avoiding him every time he tries to get closer to her because of his father's reputation in Village. Meanwhile, Karthik and his friends are asked to go set up a medical camp in Subramaniapuram and Karthik is surprised to see that Valli is also part of the same camp as her Hometown. Soon, he gets entangled in the ongoing conspiracy surrounding the temple and rest of the story is about how he unravels the secret behind the series of mysterious deaths.

Elsewhere, Karthik (Nikhil), a medical student who does not believe in super natural powers, falls in love with Valli (Swati); however, she keeps avoiding him every time he tries to get closer to her because of his father's reputation in Village. Meanwhile, Karthik and his friends are asked to go set up a medical camp in Subramaniapuram and Karthik is surprised to see that Valli is also part of the same camp as her Hometown.

'''José Alexander Cora''' (born October 18, 1975) is a Puerto Rican former [[infielder]] and [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He most recently served as the manager of the [[Boston Red Sox]], and led the team to the [[2018 World Series]] championship in his first season, becoming the fifth manager to do so in MLB history and the first as a Puerto Rican manager.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.com/|title=ESPN: The Worldwide Leader in Sports|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}</ref>

Cora played [[college baseball]] for the [[Miami Hurricanes baseball|Miami Hurricanes]] before starting a [[professional baseball]] career. He played in MLB from 1998 through 2011, for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Cleveland Indians]], Boston Red Sox, [[New York Mets]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and [[Washington Nationals]]. Cora was then a baseball analyst for [[ESPN]] before becoming a coach and manager.

In November 2019, Cora was implicated in a [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal|sign-stealing scandal]] during his time as a coach with the [[Houston Astros]].<ref name=carobeltran/> Amid an investigation to determine if he took part in another such scandal during his time managing the Red Sox,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2870185-mlbs-war-on-sign-stealing-shifts-to-alex-cora-and-the-boston-red-sox |title=MLB's War on Sign-Stealing Shifts to Alex Cora and the Boston Red Sox |first=Zachary D. |last=Rymer |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=January 8, 2020 |accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref> Cora and the Red Sox mutually agreed to part ways in January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/redsox/2020/01/14/alex-cora-out-red-sox-manager/SHuDNO9tab46sz6wVeqvxH/story.html|title=Alex Cora out as Red Sox manager - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com|language=en-US|date=2020-01-14|access-date=2020-01-15|url-access=limited}}</ref>

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Cora was drafted in the 12th round of the [[1993 Major League Baseball draft]] by the [[Minnesota Twins]], but did not sign a contract and decided instead to play collegiate baseball at the [[University of Miami]]. While there, Cora was named to the [[College World Series]] all-tournament team in both 1995 and 1996. He led the team to the title game in [[1996 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|1996]], a game they lost to [[Louisiana State University]].

Cora was rated by ''[[Baseball America]]'' as the best collegiate defensive player going into the [[1996 Major League Baseball draft|1996 draft]]. Cora was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the third round, and played 61 games of the 1996 season with the [[Minor League Baseball#Class A-Advanced|Class A-Advanced]] [[Vero Beach Dodgers]], batting .257 with no home runs and 26 RBIs. He played the 1997 season with the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[San Antonio Missions]]; in 127 games he batted .234 with 3 home runs and 48 RBIs. Cora spent parts of the 1998, 1999, and 2000 seasons with the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Albuquerque Dukes]], hitting .264 in 81 games, .308 in 80 games, and .373 in 30 games, respectively.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Cora made his major league debut on June 7, 1998, with the Dodgers against the [[Seattle Mariners]]; his brother [[Joey Cora]] was Seattle's starting second baseman in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1998/B06070SEA1998.htm |title=Los Angeles Dodgers 7, Seattle Mariners 4 |website=[[Retrosheet]] |date=June 7, 1998}}</ref> Alex Cora spent the next seven years in Los Angeles, appearing in a total of 684 games while batting .246 with 27 home runs and 173 RBIs. During his time with the Dodgers, he played at second base and shortstop. During the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Cora mostly played shortstop as the Dodgers moved the aging [[Mark Grudzielanek]] to second base.  With the emergence of [[César Izturis]] in 2002, and the trade of Grudzielanek to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in December of the same year, Cora spent the rest of his stint with the Dodgers as their primary second baseman.

Cora played in one postseason series with the Dodgers, the [[2004 National League Division Series|2004 NLDS]], which the Dodgers lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Cora was the Dodgers' second baseman in all four games, batting 2-for-15 (.133) during the series.

===Cleveland Indians===
In January 2005, Cora signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]], where he appeared in 49 games, with 22 starts at shortstop and 14 at second base; he batted .205 with a home run and 8 RBIs. On July 7,2005, Cora was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for infielder [[Ramón Vázquez]].

===Boston Red Sox===
[[File:Alexcora.jpg|280px|thumb|Cora with the Red Sox, turning a double-play against the [[Los Angeles Angels]] at [[Fenway Park]] on April 16, 2007]]
Cora made his Red Sox debut on July 7, 2005, and through the end of the regular season appeared in a total of 47 games for Boston, batting .269 with 2 home runs and 16 RBIs. In the [[2005 American League Division Series|2005 ALDS]], which Boston lost to the [[Chicago White Sox]] in a three-game sweep, Cora played in one game as a defensive replacement, without a [[plate appearance]].

Cora was originally intended to back up shortstop [[Édgar Rentería]]. With the trade of Rentería to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in December 2005, Cora was being eyed to take the position of starting shortstop, until the Red Sox acquired [[Álex González (infielder, born 1977)|Álex González]] in February 2006. For the 2006 season, Cora appeared in 96 games, batting .238 with one home run and 18 RBIs.

Cora was a member of the Red Sox team that won the [[2007 World Series]]. During the regular season, he appeared in 83 games and batted .246 with 3 home runs and 18 RBIs. In the postseason, he appeared as a late-innings defensive replacement in two games of the [[2007 American League Championship Series|2007 ALCS]] and two games of the World Series. He had one [[plate appearance]], a [[sacrifice bunt]] in [[2007 World Series#Game 3|World Series game 3]].

For the 2008 regular season, Cora played in 75 games, batting .270 with no home runs and 9 RBIs. He appeared in four postseason games; two games of the [[2008 American League Division Series|2008 ALDS]], which Boston won, and two games of the [[2008 American League Championship Series|2008 ALCS]], which Boston lost. He batted 4-for-26 (.154) with no home runs and one RBI. These games were the final postseason appearances for Cora as a player.

On October 30, 2008, Cora became a free agent. In his four seasons with Boston, he appeared in 301 regular season games, batting .252 with 6 home runs and 61 RBIs.

===New York Mets===
On January 22, 2009, Cora signed a one-year deal with the [[New York Mets]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090122&content_id=3764362&vkey=pr_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym |title=Mets sign Alex Cora to a one-year contract |website=[[MLB.com]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=October 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021003548/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090122&content_id=3764362&vkey=pr_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym |archive-date=October 21, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> During the 2009 season, he appeared in 82 games, batting .251 with one home run and 18 RBIs.

===Notable games===
With the Dodgers on May 12, 2004, Cora had an 18-pitch at-bat against Chicago Cubs starting pitcher [[Matt Clement]]. Facing a 2–1 count, Cora fouled off 14 straight pitches before finally hitting a home run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4JuBmzjNsE |title=Alex Cora - MLB Record - May 12, 2004 |via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=October 21, 2017}}</ref> It is the third longest documented at-bat since baseball statisticians began keeping track of pitch counts in the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/1469823/ |title=Mastering art of the prolonged at-bat |first=Tom |last=Singer |website=[[MLB.com]] |date=May 26, 2006 |accessdate=October 21, 2017}}</ref> So much time elapsed that Cora's brother Joey joked that he and a friend were watching the game at a restaurant, ordering their first beer during the first pitch, and by the time Cora homered they were \"so drunk that we had to call a cab to take us home.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/07/16/an_at_bat_for_the_ages/ |title=An at-bat for the ages  |first=Amalie |last=Benjamin |website=[[Boston.com]] |date=July 16, 2005 |accessdate=August 26, 2006 |url-access=limited}}</ref>

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Cora made his major league debut on June 7, 1998, with the Dodgers against the [[Seattle Mariners]]; his brother [[Joey Cora]] was Seattle's starting second baseman in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1998/B06070SEA1998.htm |title=Los Angeles Dodgers 7, Seattle Mariners 4 |website=[[Retrosheet]] |date=June 7, 1998}}</ref> Alex Cora spent the next seven years in Los Angeles, appearing in a total of 684 games while batting .246 with 27 home runs and 173 RBIs. During his time with the Dodgers, he played at second base and shortstop. During the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Cora mostly played shortstop as the Dodgers moved the aging [[Mark Grudzielanek]] to second base.  With the emergence of [[César Izturis]] in 2002, and the trade of Grudzielanek to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in December of the same year, Cora spent the rest of his stint with the Dodgers as their primary second baseman.

Cora played in one postseason series with the Dodgers, the [[2004 National League Division Series|2004 NLDS]], which the Dodgers lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Cora was the Dodgers' second baseman in all four games, batting 2-for-15 (.133) during the series.

In the [[2005 American League Division Series|2005 ALDS]], which Boston lost to the [[Chicago White Sox]] in a three-game sweep, Cora played in one game as a defensive replacement, without a [[plate appearance]].

Cora was originally intended to back up shortstop [[Édgar Rentería]]. With the trade of Rentería to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in December 2005, Cora was being eyed to take the position of starting shortstop, until the Red Sox acquired [[Álex González (infielder, born 1977)|Álex González]] in February 2006.

'''Blonde stereotypes''' are [[stereotype]]s of [[Blond|blond-hair]]ed women. Sub-types include the \"[[Bombshell (slang)|blonde bombshell]]\" and the \"'''dumb blonde'''\". Blondes are differently stereotyped from [[brown hair|brunettes]] as more desirable and less intelligent. There are many [[blonde joke]]s made on these premises. Although chiefly aimed at women, jokes of this style have also been aimed at similar stereotypes associated with men, such as the \"[[Jock (stereotype)|dumb jock]]\" and the \"[[surfer]] dude\". 

==Background==
There are several aspects to the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] perception of [[blonde]]-[[hair]]ed women.<ref name=\"Post\">Hornaday, Ann (May 4, 2014) \"In Praise of the Dumb Blonde\" ''The Washington Post'', page E14. Retrieved May 4, 2014 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-praise-of-the-dumb-blonde-an-archetype-in-need-of-saving/2014/05/01/4fdf67b4-cfbe-11e3-a6b1-45c4dffb85a6_story.html]</ref> On one hand, over history, blonde hair in women has often been considered attractive and desirable.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Hair, p. 255\">''Encyclopedia of Hair'', p. 255</ref> Blonde hair has been considered attractive for long periods of time in various European cultures, particularly when coupled with blue eyes. This perception is exploited in culture and advertising.<ref name=eh149>''Encyclopedia of Hair',' [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher/page/274 <!-- quote=dumb. --> pp. 149-151]</ref>

In contemporary popular culture, it is often stereotyped that men find blonde women more attractive than women with other hair colors.<ref name=sherrow>Victoria Sherrow. ''Encyclopedia of hair: a cultural history''. [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher/page/149 Page 149]</ref> For example, [[Anita Loos]] popularized this idea in her 1925 novel ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]''.<ref name=sherrow/> Blondes are often assumed to have more fun; for example, in a [[Clairol]] commercial for hair colorant, they use the phrase \"Is it true blondes have more fun?\"<ref name=sherrow/> Some women have reported they feel other people expect them to be more fun-loving after having lightened their hair.<ref name=sherrow/> In much of the Americas, such as in North America, the blonde stereotype is also associated with being less serious or less intelligent.<ref name=sherrow/> However, an analysis of [[IQ]] data carried out by the [[National Longitudinal Surveys]] on a survey database of American \"[[baby boomers]]\" (NLSY79 data), the natural blonde women in this population category (excluding  African American and Hispanic persons) have a slightly higher mean IQ than brunettes, black and red haired women.<ref> Jay L. Zagorsky, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305222263_Are_Blondes_Really_Dumb \"Are Blondes Really Dumb?\"], Economics Bulletin 36(1):401-410 · March 2016</ref><ref>[https://theconversation.com/are-blondes-actually-dumb-56560 \"Are blondes actually dumb?\"] by Jay L. Zagorsky</ref>

On the other hand, a blonde woman is often perceived as making little use of [[intelligence]] and as a \"woman who relies on her looks rather than on intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Hair, p. 255\"/> At the same time, people tend to presume that blondes are less serious-minded and less intelligent than [[brunette]]s, as reflected in \"blonde jokes\".<ref name=eh149/> The roots of this notion may be traced to Europe, with the \"dumb blonde\" in question being a French [[courtesan]] named [[Rosalie Duthé]], satirised in a 1775 play ''Les Curiosités de la Foire'' for her habit of pausing a long time before speaking, appearing not only stupid but literally [[muteness|dumb]] (in the sense of mute).<ref name=eh149/> The latter stereotype of \"dumb blonde\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Regenberg |first=Nina |year=2007 |title=Are Blondes Really Dumb? |journal= |issue= |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/2612795/Are-Blonds-Really-Dumb}}</ref> is exploited in [[blonde joke]]s. In Brazil, this extends to blonde women being looked down upon, as reflected in sexist jokes, as also sexually licentious.<ref name=giselemaria>Revista Anagrama, Universidade de São Paulo, [http://www.revistas.usp.br/anagrama/article/view/35305 Stereotypes of women in blonde jokes pp. 6-8], version 1, edition 2, 2007</ref>

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] preferred to cast blonde women for major roles in his films as he believed that the audience would suspect them the least, comparing them to \"virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints\", hence the term \"Hitchcock blonde\".<ref name=Allen>{{cite book|author=Allen, Richard|title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-231-13574-0}}</ref> This stereotype has become so ingrained it has spawned counter-narratives, such as in the 2001 film ''[[Legally Blonde]]'', in which [[Reese Witherspoon]] succeeds at Harvard despite biases against her beauty and blonde hair,<ref name=sherrow/> and terms such as cookie-cutter blonde (CCB), implying standardized blonde looks and standard perceived social and intelligence characteristics of a blonde. Many actors and actresses in [[Latin America]] and [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic United States]] have blonde hair and [[blue eyes]] and/or pale skin,<ref>

{{for|the Avril Lavigne song|Dumb Blonde (song)}}
:''\"...We got the bubble-headed bleached-blonde, comes on at five; she can tell you 'bout the plane crash with a gleam in her eye....\"''
::— lyrics from ''\"[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]\"'', [[Don Henley]], 1982

The notion of \"dumb blonde\" has been a topic of academic research reported in scholarly articles and university symposia, which tend to confirm that many people hold to the perception that light-haired women are less intelligent than women with dark hair.<ref name=eh149/> While there is no evidence that suggests that blondes are less intelligent than other people, it has been suggested that the state of being blond creates opportunities that do not require investing in education and training.<ref name=frank>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/business/07scene.html \"Despite the Dumb Jokes, Stereotypes May Reflect Some Smart Choices\"]</ref> It is believed the first recorded \"dumb blonde\" was an 18th-century blonde French courtesan named [[Rosalie Duthé]] whose reputation of being beautiful and dumb, even in the literal sense of not talking much, inspired a play about her called ''Les Curiosités de la Foire'' (Paris 1775).<ref name=\"sherrow\"/>

A possible explanation is that attractive women have less pressing incentives to cultivate and demonstrate their intellect in order to ensure their future, since attractiveness is an asset, or correlatively that intelligent women have less pressing incentives to dye their hair to a presumed attractive color. The validity of this explanation is corroborated by its applicability to a similar pervasiveness of the \"[[dumb athlete]]\" stereotype.<ref name=\"frank\"/> The dumb blonde stereotype (and the associated [[cognitive bias]]) may have some negative consequences and it can also damage a blonde person's career prospects.<ref>{{citation| last=The Observer| date=29 July 2001| title=The new blonde bombshell| url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jul/29/featuresreview.review| location=London| newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' (1925) by [[Anita Loos]] originated as a comic novel and explores the appeal of blonde women. It spawned a [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|musical]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and two films released in [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1928 lost film)|1928]] and [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|1953]].

French magazine ''[[Le Monde]]'' believes that the rivalry is more prevalent in the United States.

One theory forwards, as an explanation, the concept the feminization of blond hair, which can be seen by the overwhelming association of the dumb blond persona with females. This idea draws on the stereotype that females have a lower psychometric intelligence than males.<ref>

==Counter representation==
At the same time, there are many examples where the stereotype is exploited only to combat it.<ref name=eh149/> The film ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' starring [[Reese Witherspoon]] featured the stereotype as a centerpiece of its plot. However, the protagonist turns out to be very intelligent and is shown to have been underachieving due to society's low expectations of her.

[[Country music]] entertainer [[Dolly Parton]], aware of this occasional characterization of her, addressed it in her 1967 hit \"[[Hello, I'm Dolly|Dumb Blonde]]\". Parton's lyrics challenged the stereotype, stating \"just because I'm blonde, don't think I'm dumb 'cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool\".

'''Blonde stereotypes''' are [[stereotype]]s of [[Blond|blond-hair]]ed women. Sub-types include the \"[[Bombshell (slang)|blonde bombshell]]\" and the \"'''dumb blonde'''\". Blondes are differently stereotyped from [[brown hair|brunettes]] as more desirable and less intelligent. There are many [[blonde joke]]s made on these premises. Although chiefly aimed at women, jokes of this style have also been aimed at similar stereotypes associated with men, such as the \"[[Jock (stereotype)|dumb jock]]\" and the \"[[surfer]] dude\". 

==Background==
There are several aspects to the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] perception of [[blonde]]-[[hair]]ed women.<ref name=\"Post\">Hornaday, Ann (May 4, 2014) \"In Praise of the Dumb Blonde\" ''The Washington Post'', page E14. Retrieved May 4, 2014 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-praise-of-the-dumb-blonde-an-archetype-in-need-of-saving/2014/05/01/4fdf67b4-cfbe-11e3-a6b1-45c4dffb85a6_story.html]</ref> On one hand, over history, blonde hair in women has often been considered attractive and desirable.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Hair, p. 255\">''Encyclopedia of Hair'', p. 255</ref> Blonde hair has been considered attractive for long periods of time in various European cultures, particularly when coupled with blue eyes. This perception is exploited in culture and advertising.<ref name=eh149>''Encyclopedia of Hair',' [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher/page/274 <!-- quote=dumb. --> pp. 149-151]</ref>

In contemporary popular culture, it is often stereotyped that men find blonde women more attractive than women with other hair colors.<ref name=sherrow>Victoria Sherrow. ''Encyclopedia of hair: a cultural history''. [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher/page/149 Page 149]</ref> For example, [[Anita Loos]] popularized this idea in her 1925 novel ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]''.<ref name=sherrow/> Blondes are often assumed to have more fun; for example, in a [[Clairol]] commercial for hair colorant, they use the phrase \"Is it true blondes have more fun?\"<ref name=sherrow/> Some women have reported they feel other people expect them to be more fun-loving after having lightened their hair.<ref name=sherrow/> In much of the Americas, such as in North America, the blonde stereotype is also associated with being less serious or less intelligent.<ref name=sherrow/> However, an analysis of [[IQ]] data carried out by the [[National Longitudinal Surveys]] on a survey database of American \"[[baby boomers]]\" (NLSY79 data), the natural blonde women in this population category (excluding  African American and Hispanic persons) have a slightly higher mean IQ than brunettes, black and red haired women.<ref> Jay L. Zagorsky, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305222263_Are_Blondes_Really_Dumb \"Are Blondes Really Dumb?\"], Economics Bulletin 36(1):401-410 · March 2016</ref><ref>[https://theconversation.com/are-blondes-actually-dumb-56560 \"Are blondes actually dumb?\"] by Jay L. Zagorsky</ref>

On the other hand, a blonde woman is often perceived as making little use of [[intelligence]] and as a \"woman who relies on her looks rather than on intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Hair, p. 255\"/> At the same time, people tend to presume that blondes are less serious-minded and less intelligent than [[brunette]]s, as reflected in \"blonde jokes\".<ref name=eh149/> The roots of this notion may be traced to Europe, with the \"dumb blonde\" in question being a French [[courtesan]] named [[Rosalie Duthé]], satirised in a 1775 play ''Les Curiosités de la Foire'' for her habit of pausing a long time before speaking, appearing not only stupid but literally [[muteness|dumb]] (in the sense of mute).<ref name=eh149/> The latter stereotype of \"dumb blonde\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Regenberg |first=Nina |year=2007 |title=Are Blondes Really Dumb? |journal= |issue= |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/2612795/Are-Blonds-Really-Dumb}}</ref> is exploited in [[blonde joke]]s. In Brazil, this extends to blonde women being looked down upon, as reflected in sexist jokes, as also sexually licentious.<ref name=giselemaria>Revista Anagrama, Universidade de São Paulo, [http://www.revistas.usp.br/anagrama/article/view/35305 Stereotypes of women in blonde jokes pp. 6-8], version 1, edition 2, 2007</ref>

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] preferred to cast blonde women for major roles in his films as he believed that the audience would suspect them the least, comparing them to \"virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints\", hence the term \"Hitchcock blonde\".<ref name=Allen>{{cite book|author=Allen, Richard|title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-231-13574-0}}</ref> This stereotype has become so ingrained it has spawned counter-narratives, such as in the 2001 film ''[[Legally Blonde]]'', in which [[Reese Witherspoon]] succeeds at Harvard despite biases against her beauty and blonde hair,<ref name=sherrow/> and terms such as cookie-cutter blonde (CCB), implying standardized blonde looks and standard perceived social and intelligence characteristics of a blonde.

* The \"blonde bombshell\": Kuhn defined it as \"a blonde with explosive sexuality and is available to men at a price\". She provided [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[Mae West]], [[Barbara Eden]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Diana Dors]] as examples.
* The \"dumb blonde\": Kuhn defined it as \"a blonde with an overt and natural sexuality and a profound manifestation of ignorance\". She provided [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Marion Davies]], [[Alice White]], [[Marie Wilson (American actress)|Marie Wilson]], and [[Mamie Van Doren]] as examples.

===\"Dumb blonde\"===
{{for|the Avril Lavigne song|Dumb Blonde (song)}}
:''\"...We got the bubble-headed bleached-blonde, comes on at five; she can tell you 'bout the plane crash with a gleam in her eye....\"''
::— lyrics from ''\"[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]\"'', [[Don Henley]], 1982

The notion of \"dumb blonde\" has been a topic of academic research reported in scholarly articles and university symposia, which tend to confirm that many people hold to the perception that light-haired women are less intelligent than women with dark hair.<ref name=eh149/> While there is no evidence that suggests that blondes are less intelligent than other people, it has been suggested that the state of being blond creates opportunities that do not require investing in education and training.<ref name=frank>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/business/07scene.html \"Despite the Dumb Jokes, Stereotypes May Reflect Some Smart Choices\"]</ref> It is believed the first recorded \"dumb blonde\" was an 18th-century blonde French courtesan named [[Rosalie Duthé]] whose reputation of being beautiful and dumb, even in the literal sense of not talking much, inspired a play about her called ''Les Curiosités de la Foire'' (Paris 1775).<ref name=\"sherrow\"/>

A possible explanation is that attractive women have less pressing incentives to cultivate and demonstrate their intellect in order to ensure their future, since attractiveness is an asset, or correlatively that intelligent women have less pressing incentives to dye their hair to a presumed attractive color. The validity of this explanation is corroborated by its applicability to a similar pervasiveness of the \"[[dumb athlete]]\" stereotype.<ref name=\"frank\"/> The dumb blonde stereotype (and the associated [[cognitive bias]]) may have some negative consequences and it can also damage a blonde person's career prospects.<ref>{{citation| last=The Observer| date=29 July 2001| title=The new blonde bombshell| url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jul/29/featuresreview.review| location=London| newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' (1925) by [[Anita Loos]] originated as a comic novel and explores the appeal of blonde women. It spawned a [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|musical]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and two films released in [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1928 lost film)|1928]] and [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|1953]]. The ''Encyclopedia of Hair'' describes [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s blonde role in the second film as that of \"a fragile woman who relied on her looks rather than on intelligence&mdash;what some people refer to as 'dumb blonde'.\"<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Hair, p. 255\"/> At the same time, in the film she demonstrates a certain amount of wit regarding her life position expressed in the song<ref>\"Decade by Decade 1940s: Ten Years of Popular Hits\", {{ISBN|0-7390-5176-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZeogUGx1OMC&pg=PA32&dq=%22Diamonds+is+the+girl's+best+friend%22&hl=en&ei=UmJfTKq1AYzEsAP9g_CpCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 32]</ref> \"[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]\".

French magazine ''[[Le Monde]]'' believes that the rivalry is more prevalent in the United States.

One theory forwards, as an explanation, the concept the feminization of blond hair, which can be seen by the overwhelming association of the dumb blond persona with females. This idea draws on the stereotype that females have a lower psychometric intelligence than males.<ref>

==Counter representation==
At the same time, there are many examples where the stereotype is exploited only to combat it.<ref name=eh149/> The film ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' starring [[Reese Witherspoon]] featured the stereotype as a centerpiece of its plot. However, the protagonist turns out to be very intelligent and is shown to have been underachieving due to society's low expectations of her.

[[Country music]] entertainer [[Dolly Parton]], aware of this occasional characterization of her, addressed it in her 1967 hit \"[[Hello, I'm Dolly|Dumb Blonde]]\". Parton's lyrics challenged the stereotype, stating \"just because I'm blonde, don't think I'm dumb 'cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool\". Parton has said she was not offended by \"all the dumb-[[blonde jokes]] because I know I'm not dumb. I'm also not blonde.\"<ref>Karen Thomas.

===Birth{{anchor|farrowing}}===
[[File:Piglets Nursing in a Farrowing Crate.jpg|thumb|Nursing sow in a farrowing crate]]

A few days before giving birth, sows are moved to [[farrowing crates]], which are slightly wider so they can lie down to nurse.  Crates have 18-in. (46-cm) \"troughs\" on each side where the piglets can safely lie without being in danger of sow overlay (when the sow lies down on top of a piglet).

Piglet survival also depends on selection pressure.  Groups of piglets bred for higher survival showed no difference in mortality when weaned in farrowing crates and outdoor systems.<ref>E. M. Baxter, et al., \"Breeding for improved pre-weaning piglet survival in alternative farrowing systems,\" Proceedings of the 41st congress of the International Society for Applied Ethology (F. Galindo and L. Alvarez, eds.), 2007, Merida, Mexico.</ref>

====Piglet Mortality====
Although farrowing crates have been used based on the assumption that they reduce piglet mortality rates, there is little published evidence in support of this claim. The most comprehensive publication to date on this subject concluded that there is no significant effect of housing on overall piglet mortality, the authors stating that “Despite the fact that the crate system has been considered to reduce piglet mortality mainly through a reduction of crushing, there is not much scientific evidence for this when considering the few large surveys that compare the mortality rate in commercial herds“. The review goes on to describe several large studies dating from as early as 1983, the majority of which found no difference in piglet mortality rates between loose and crated sows. The review also details an argument as to why piglet mortality rates have been reported to be somewhat higher in a comparably small number of studies, citing methodological flaws.<ref name=Pedersen>L.J.

==Limitations on usage==

=== European Union ===
In the European Union, the crates must not be used after the fourth week of pregnancy following a 2013 EU Directive. They are illegal at all times in the United Kingdom and Sweden. However,<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/> Denmark<ref name=\"LF\">[https://lf.dk/viden-om/landbrugsproduktion/husdyr/svin Produktion af grise i Danmark] (from the Danish agricultural trade organisation 'Landbrug & Fødevarer).

Accessed 2019-20-06.)</ref> are some of the countries where gestation crates are still used in conventional pig farming operations.

===New Zealand===
The use of gestation crates following mating will be phased out in New Zealand by 2015. However the crates are still legal for up to 4 weeks after farrowing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10691325|title=Sow crates to be phased out by 2015 - National - NZ Herald News|date=1 December 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=NZPA|accessdate=1 December 2010}}</ref> A review lead by the Ministry for Primary Industries, in 2016, found that \"The current code of welfare allows for up to 5% of sows to be retained in crates for a further week (following the 4 week maximum in crates post-farrowing) as nurse sows. This
practice enables slowly growing or poorly performing piglets to be properly weaned. It has
been noted that industry does not accept or comply with this requirement and some
producers are exceeding both the maximum 5% of sows allowed to be retained for this
purpose and the amount of time that they are being retained (i.e. greater than the one
week maximum as stated in the code).\" And \"The current code requires that sows in any farrowing system constructed after 3 December 2010, must be provided with material that can be manipulated until farrowing (to allow
the sow to perform nesting behaviour which she is extremely motivated to do). It has been
noted by NAWAC during this review that industry disagrees with this requirement and
does not comply with this minimum standard.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.mpi.govt.nz/document-vault/11959|title=NAWAC review of the use of Farrowing Crates for Pigs in New Zealand|date=14 March 2016|work=[[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]]|publisher=MPI|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref>

===Corporate policies===
Over 60 major food companies have policies to eliminate their use.<ref>http://cratefreefuture.com/pdf/Gestation%20Crate%20Elimination%20Policies.pdf</ref>

[[Smithfield Foods]], the largest pork producer in the United States, said in January 2007 that it will phase out gestation crates from its 187 piggeries over the next ten years because of concerns from its customers. In 2009 the company stated it would no longer be able to phase them out in ten years due to recent low sales,<ref name=Kaufmann1/> but reversed the decision in 2011 after intense pressure from the [[Humane Society of the United States]].<ref name=\"smithfield_recommit\">{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2011/12/smithfield-end-use-gestation-crates-2017|title=Smithfield to end use of gestation crates by 2017|author=Walzer, Philip|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

In February 2012 [[McDonald's]] announced that it would begin working with suppliers to phase out the use of gestation crates in response to pressure from the Humane Society of the United States and other animal advocates. McDonald's purchases around one percent of all pork in the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/business/mcdonalds-vows-to-help-end-use-of-sow-crates.html | work=The New York Times | first=Stephanie | last=Strom | title=McDonald's Vows to Help End Use of Sow Crates | date=13 February 2012}}</ref>

==Welfare issues==
[[File:Gestation crates 5.jpg|thumb|Gestation crates 5|thumbnail|A [[Pig|sow]] will stay in a gestation crate for the four-month period of her pregnancy.]]
Animal welfare advocates regard the use of gestation crates as one of the most inhumane features of intensive animal production.<ref name=\"Kaufmann1\"/> [[Temple Grandin]] of [[Colorado State University]]'s Department of Animal Science said in 2007: \"... basically you’re asking a sow to live in an airline seat.\"<ref name=Shapiro>Shapiro, Paul. [http://www.globegazette.com/articles/2007/01/10/opinion/doc45a44853758c8203994884.txt Pork industry should phase out gestation crates (Guest View)], ''Globe Gazette'', 10 January 2007.</ref>

Pork producers argue that gestation crates are needed because sows that are housed together in pens will fight, injuring or killing their fellow penmates. The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weaver | first1 = SA | last2 = Morris | first2 = MC | year = 2003 | title = Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 51–66 }}</ref>  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.  These include trickle feeding systems, individual feeding stalls, and electronic sow feeding equipment, all of which resolve feed competition among pigs.<ref>Gonyou HW. 2003. Group housing: alternative systems, alternative management. Advances in Pork Production 14:101-7.</ref>

Early veterinary studies seemed to support the use of gestation crates. According to the [[U.S. National Pork Producers Council]], which promotes pork as a food product and is a leading proponent of gestation crates, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] \"recognize[s] gestation stalls and group housing systems as appropriate for providing for the well-being of sows during pregnancy.\"<ref name=Kaufmann1/> While the practice of immobilizing the animals in crates limits fighting, it subsequently increases the animals' stress levels, causing other health problems. The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, \"Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered.\"<ref>\"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing.\" Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref>

{{farming}}
''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a “free access” maternity pen configuration in which sows are in individual pens for the first four weeks of pregnancy but can “unlock” the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time.<ref name=\"Salek-Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Salek-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=Individual pens for sows' safety|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/09/30/individual-pens-for-sows-safety/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=30 September 2012}}</ref>

However, other veterinary studies contradict those earlier studies. A 1997 report of the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Union, where a gestation crate ban went into effect in 2013, noted that because \"overall welfare appears to be better when sows are not confined throughout gestation, sows should be preferably be kept in groups.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">Tim Carman, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/pork-industry-gives-sows-room-to-move/2012/05/25/gJQAISlxyU_story.html \"Pork industry gives sows room to move\"], ''The Washington Post'', 29 May 2012.</ref> Likewise in 2008, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, after 2.5 years of research, recommended \"the phase-out, within 10 years, of all intensive confinement systems that restrict natural movement and normal behaviors, including swine gestation crates.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>

Many studies have shown that sows in crates exhibit behavior such as bar-biting, head weaving, and tongue rolling, indicating chronic frustration. When given the choice, pigs will relieve themselves far away from where they sleep and eat.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare on a request from the Commission related to welfare of weaners and rearing pigs: effects of different space allowances and floor types |publisher=The EFSA Journal |date=2005 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2005.268 |doi-access=free |volume=3 |journal=EFSA Journal |page=268 }}</ref> Sows in crates bite the bars, chew even when they have no food, and press their water bottles obsessively, all reportedly signs of boredom.

Hence their development indicates that the animal is having difficulty in coping and its welfare is poor.\"<ref name=Kaufmann2/> This behavior, such as bar-biting and other stereotypic behavior can also lead to other physical trauma, such as sores from frequent contact with the metal bars, and mouth sores from sham-chewing and bar-biting.<ref>Mendl MT. 1991.

Paul Sundberg, a veterinarian and vice president of the U.S. National Pork Board, a leading proponent of gestation crates, told ''[[The Washington Post]]'': \"Farmers treat their animals well because that's just good business. The key to sow welfare isn't whether they are kept in individual crates or group housing, but whether the system used is well managed.\" Sundberg said: \"[S]cience tells us that she [a sow] doesn't even seem to know that she can't turn ... She wants to eat and feel safe, and she can do that very well in individual stalls.\"<ref name=Kaufmann2/>

===Birth{{anchor|farrowing}}===
[[File:Piglets Nursing in a Farrowing Crate.jpg|thumb|Nursing sow in a farrowing crate]]

A few days before giving birth, sows are moved to [[farrowing crates]], which are slightly wider so they can lie down to nurse.  Crates have 18-in. (46-cm) \"troughs\" on each side where the piglets can safely lie without being in danger of sow overlay (when the sow lies down on top of a piglet).

Piglet survival also depends on selection pressure.  Groups of piglets bred for higher survival showed no difference in mortality when weaned in farrowing crates and outdoor systems.<ref>E. M. Baxter, et al., \"Breeding for improved pre-weaning piglet survival in alternative farrowing systems,\" Proceedings of the 41st congress of the International Society for Applied Ethology (F. Galindo and L. Alvarez, eds.), 2007, Merida, Mexico.</ref>

====Piglet Mortality====
Although farrowing crates have been used based on the assumption that they reduce piglet mortality rates, there is little published evidence in support of this claim. The most comprehensive publication to date on this subject concluded that there is no significant effect of housing on overall piglet mortality, the authors stating that “Despite the fact that the crate system has been considered to reduce piglet mortality mainly through a reduction of crushing, there is not much scientific evidence for this when considering the few large surveys that compare the mortality rate in commercial herds“. The review goes on to describe several large studies dating from as early as 1983, the majority of which found no difference in piglet mortality rates between loose and crated sows. The review also details an argument as to why piglet mortality rates have been reported to be somewhat higher in a comparably small number of studies, citing methodological flaws.<ref name=Pedersen>L.J. Pedersen, http://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/pdf/10.3920/978-90-8686-771-4_05 \"Housing of sows during farrowing: a review on pen design,
welfare and productivity\", retrieved January 2017.</ref>

==Limitations on usage==

=== European Union ===
In the European Union, the crates must not be used after the fourth week of pregnancy following a 2013 EU Directive. They are illegal at all times in the United Kingdom and Sweden. However, <ref name=\"theguardian1\"/> Denmark<ref name=\"LF\">[https://lf.dk/viden-om/landbrugsproduktion/husdyr/svin Produktion af grise i Danmark] (from the Danish agricultural trade organisation 'Landbrug & Fødevarer). Accessed 2019-20-06.)</ref> and Norway<ref name=\"NRK\">[https://tv.nrk.no/serie/brennpunkt/2019/MDDP11000519 Brennpunkt] (NRK Documentary on animal welfare of conventional pigs in Norway). Accessed 2019-20-06.)</ref> are some of the countries where gestation crates are still used in conventional pig farming operations.

===New Zealand===
The use of gestation crates following mating will be phased out in New Zealand by 2015. However the crates are still legal for up to 4 weeks after farrowing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10691325|title=Sow crates to be phased out by 2015 - National - NZ Herald News|date=1 December 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=NZPA|accessdate=1 December 2010}}</ref> A review lead by the Ministry for Primary Industries, in 2016, found that \"The current code of welfare allows for up to 5% of sows to be retained in crates for a further week (following the 4 week maximum in crates post-farrowing) as nurse sows. This
practice enables slowly growing or poorly performing piglets to be properly weaned. It has
been noted that industry does not accept or comply with this requirement and some
producers are exceeding both the maximum 5% of sows allowed to be retained for this
purpose and the amount of time that they are being retained (i.e. greater than the one
week maximum as stated in the code).\" And \"The current code requires that sows in any farrowing system constructed after 3 December 2010, must be provided with material that can be manipulated until farrowing (to allow
the sow to perform nesting behaviour which she is extremely motivated to do). It has been
noted by NAWAC during this review that industry disagrees with this requirement and
does not comply with this minimum standard.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.mpi.govt.nz/document-vault/11959|title=NAWAC review of the use of Farrowing Crates for Pigs in New Zealand|date=14 March 2016|work=[[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]]|publisher=MPI|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref>

===Corporate policies===
Over 60 major food companies have policies to eliminate their use.<ref>http://cratefreefuture.com/pdf/Gestation%20Crate%20Elimination%20Policies.pdf</ref>

[[Smithfield Foods]], the largest pork producer in the United States, said in January 2007 that it will phase out gestation crates from its 187 piggeries over the next ten years because of concerns from its customers. In 2009 the company stated it would no longer be able to phase them out in ten years due to recent low sales,<ref name=Kaufmann1/> but reversed the decision in 2011 after intense pressure from the [[Humane Society of the United States]].<ref name=\"smithfield_recommit\">{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2011/12/smithfield-end-use-gestation-crates-2017|title=Smithfield to end use of gestation crates by 2017|author=Walzer, Philip|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

In February 2012 [[McDonald's]] announced that it would begin working with suppliers to phase out the use of gestation crates in response to pressure from the Humane Society of the United States and other animal advocates. McDonald's purchases around one percent of all pork in the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/business/mcdonalds-vows-to-help-end-use-of-sow-crates.html | work=The New York Times | first=Stephanie | last=Strom | title=McDonald's Vows to Help End Use of Sow Crates | date=13 February 2012}}</ref>

==Welfare issues==
[[File:Gestation crates 5.jpg|thumb|Gestation crates 5|thumbnail|A [[Pig|sow]] will stay in a gestation crate for the four-month period of her pregnancy.]]
Animal welfare advocates regard the use of gestation crates as one of the most inhumane features of intensive animal production.<ref name=\"Kaufmann1\"/> [[Temple Grandin]] of [[Colorado State University]]'s Department of Animal Science said in 2007: \"... basically you’re asking a sow to live in an airline seat.\"<ref name=Shapiro>Shapiro, Paul. [http://www.globegazette.com/articles/2007/01/10/opinion/doc45a44853758c8203994884.txt Pork industry should phase out gestation crates (Guest View)], ''Globe Gazette'', 10 January 2007.</ref>

Pork producers argue that gestation crates are needed because sows that are housed together in pens will fight, injuring or killing their fellow penmates. The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.<ref>SA Weaver and MC Morris, \"Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls,\" ''Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics'' 17 (2003), 51–66.</ref>  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.  These include trickle feeding systems, individual feeding stalls, and electronic sow feeding equipment, all of which resolve feed competition among pigs.<ref>Gonyou HW. 2003. Group housing: alternative systems, alternative management. Advances in Pork Production 14:101-7.</ref>

Early veterinary studies seemed to support the use of gestation crates. According to the [[U.S. National Pork Producers Council]], which promotes pork as a food product and is a leading proponent of gestation crates, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] \"recognize[s] gestation stalls and group housing systems as appropriate for providing for the well-being of sows during pregnancy.\"<ref name=Kaufmann1/> While the practice of immobilizing the animals in crates limits fighting, it subsequently increases the animals' stress levels, causing other health problems. The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, \"Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered.\"<ref>\"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing.\" Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref>

{{farming}}
''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a “free access” maternity pen configuration in which sows are in individual pens for the first four weeks of pregnancy but can “unlock” the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time.<ref name=\"Salek-Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Salek-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=Individual pens for sows' safety|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/09/30/individual-pens-for-sows-safety/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=30 September 2012}}</ref>  

However, other veterinary studies contradict those earlier studies. A 1997 report of the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Union, where a gestation crate ban went into effect in 2013, noted that because \"overall welfare appears to be better when sows are not confined throughout gestation, sows should be preferably be kept in groups.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">Tim Carman, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/pork-industry-gives-sows-room-to-move/2012/05/25/gJQAISlxyU_story.html \"Pork industry gives sows room to move\"], ''The Washington Post'', 29 May 2012.</ref> Likewise in 2008, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, after 2.5 years of research, recommended \"the phase-out, within 10 years, of all intensive confinement systems that restrict natural movement and normal behaviors, including swine gestation crates.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>

Many studies have shown that sows in crates exhibit behavior such as bar-biting, head weaving, and tongue rolling, indicating chronic frustration. When given the choice, pigs will relieve themselves far away from where they sleep and eat.<ref> {{cite journal |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare on a request from the Commission related to welfare of weaners and rearing pigs: effects of different space allowances and floor types |publisher=The EFSA Journal |date=2005 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2005.268 |doi-access=free }} </ref> Sows in crates bite the bars, chew even when they have no food, and press their water bottles obsessively, all reportedly signs of boredom. The ''Post'' (uncited reference) writes that a report by veterinarians for the [[European Union]] concluded that abnormal behavior in sows \"develop[s] when the animal is severely or chronically frustrated.

Paul Sundberg, a veterinarian and vice president of the U.S. National Pork Board, a leading proponent of gestation crates, told ''[[The Washington Post]]'': \"Farmers treat their animals well because that's just good business. The key to sow welfare isn't whether they are kept in individual crates or group housing, but whether the system used is well managed.\" Sundberg said: \"[S]cience tells us that she [a sow] doesn't even seem to know that she can't turn ... She wants to eat and feel safe, and she can do that very well in individual stalls.\"<ref name=Kaufmann2/>

'''Thomas Michael''' \"'''Tim'''\" '''Scanlon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|æ|n|l|ən}}; born 1940), usually cited as '''T. M. Scanlon''', is an American philosopher.  At the time of his retirement in 2016, he was the Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy, and Civil Polity<ref name=Alford>\"The Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy, and Civil Polity is among the oldest endowed chairs at Harvard University, having been first established in 1789.

==Life and career==

Born June 28, 1940, Scanlon grew up in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]; obtained his undergraduate degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1962;  earned his [[PhD]] in philosophy from Harvard under [[Burton Dreben]]; studied for a year at [[Oxford University]] on a [[Fulbright Scholarship]]; and returned to Princeton University, where he taught from 1966 until 1984.<ref name=harvard_bio>{{Cite web | url=http://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/people/thomas-m-scanlon | title=Thomas M. Scanlon}}</ref> He was made a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellow]] in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/172/|title=Thomas M. Scanlon - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}</ref>

His teaching in the department has included courses on theories of justice, equality, and recent ethical theory. His book, ''What We Owe to Each Other'', was published by [[Harvard University Press]] in 1998; a collection of papers on political theory, ''The Difficulty of Tolerance'', was published by Cambridge University Press in 2003.

Scanlon is the father-in-law of philosopher and scholar of [[African-American studies]] [[Tommie Shelby]].

==Philosophical work==

His dissertation and some of his first papers were in [[mathematical logic]], where his main concern was in [[proof theory]], but he turned to [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], where he developed a version of [[contractualism]] in the line of [[John Rawls]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].  Scanlon has also published important work on [[freedom of speech]], equality, [[toleration|tolerance]], foundations of [[contract law]], [[human rights]], conceptions of [[welfare]], theories of justice, as well as on foundational questions in moral theory.

=== Contractualism ===
{{essay|date=July 2019}}
Contractualism is an attempt at providing a unified account of the subject matter of a central part of morality which Scanlon calls \"what we owe to each other\". The normative domain of what we owe to each other is meant to encompass those duties to other people which we bear in virtue of their standing as rational creatures. A broader conception of morality includes whatever else we may owe to specific people, such as the special obligations we bear in relations with friends and family, or whatever else morality may require of us, such as the way in which we treat ourselves or nature. Scanlon believes that what we owe to each other, or what we could loosely call \"the morality of right and wrong\", is distinct from this broader conception of morality in that contractualism provides a unified account of its content.<ref>Scanlon, T.&nbsp;M., 1998, ''What We Owe to Each Other'', pp. 6–7</ref>

In Scanlon's contractualism, judgements about right and wrong, unlike [[empirical]] judgements, are not theoretical claims about the nature of the [[spatiotemporal]] world but rather practical claims about what we have reason to do.<ref>Scanlon 2</ref> Further, they are a particularly important class of practical claims in that the judgement that an action is wrong is taken to provide reasons to not do that action which are most often considered to be decisive against competing reasons.<ref>Scanlon 1</ref> Following this point, Scanlon takes questions about the reason-giving force of moral judgements to be prior to questions about the subject matter of the morality of right and wrong.<ref>Scanlon 3</ref> More explicitly, he thinks that if we provide an account of the extraordinary reason-giving force of moral judgements then this account could largely form the basis for a characterisation of the subject matter of what we owe to each other.

Scanlon grounds the reason-giving force of judgements about right and wrong in \"the positive value of a way of living with others\".<ref>Scanlon 162</ref> A way of living with others which is typified by an ideal of mutual recognition between rational agents, where mutual recognition demands that moral agents acknowledge the value of human life and respond to this value in the right ways.

On the question of how ought we to value human, or rational, life, Scanlon argues that different valuable things require different ways of valuing. In contrast to [[teleological]] accounts of value, often to take something to be of value is not only to see reason to bring about a maximal amount of that thing.<ref>Scanlon 78–100</ref> This is especially true when considering the value of human life. When we value human life, he writes, we do not see this as a reason to create as much human life as we can. Rather, we tend to see reason to respect other human beings, to protect them from death and other forms of harm and, in general, to want their lives to go well. More important for Scanlon, to value rational life is to recognize the features which distinguish rational life from other valuable things, specifically, the ability of rational creatures to assess reasons and judgements, and to govern their lives in accordance with these assessments. Scanlon asserts that the proper response to the recognition of these distinctive features is to treat rational creatures in terms of principles which they could not reasonably reject.<ref>Scanlon 105–106</ref>

From this point, Scanlon's account of the value of rational life provides a focus around which his account of the reason-giving force of moral judgements dovetails quite neatly with a characterization of the method of reasoning which we use to arrive at judgements of right and wrong, a method, moreover, which seems to be phenomenologically plausible. The reason-giving force of moral judgements is grounded in an ideal of mutual recognition which requires treating others in accordance with principles that they could not reasonably reject. Because mutual recognition requires that these other people are also appropriately motivated, this entails Scanlon's formulation of wrongness: \"An act is wrong if and only if any principle that permitted it would be one that could reasonably be rejected by people moved to find principles for the general regulation of behaviour that others, similarly motivated, could not reasonably reject\".<ref>Scanlon 4</ref> I will call this the contractualist formulation. An act is right, quite simply, if a principle permitting it could not reasonably be rejected in terms of the aforementioned formulation.

Regarding how moral principles are derived from the contractualist formulation, when considering whether a principle can be rejected we must take into account the consequences, in general, of its being accepted, not only the consequences of the particular actions that it allows.<ref>Scanlon 203–204</ref> Because we cannot be sure about who will be affected by a principle, and how they will be affected, we must draw on our experience of life and consider the \"generic reasons\" which individuals are likely to have, as a result of their general circumstances, to reject a principle.<ref>Scanlon 204–205</ref> In order to determine whether a principle is reasonably rejectable, we must impartially weigh these generic reasons against each other,<ref>Scanlon 195</ref> and exercising our judgement, draw a conclusion about what the weight of reasons support.<ref>Scanlon 218</ref> Given the motivation of finding principles for the general regulation of society that no-one could reasonably reject, if the weight of reasons support a certain conclusion then it would be unreasonable to reject that conclusion.<ref>Scanlon 192</ref> Importantly, principles can only be rejected by individuals; aggregation of reasons across individuals is not allowed.<ref>Scanlon 229–230</ref> So if the generic reasons of an individual carry more weight than any other individual's generic reasons, then his generic reasons are (for the most part) decisive in determining principles.

The generic reasons which are open to consideration under the contractualist formulation are any reasons which we judge as relevant to reasonable rejectability. This requires that we exercise our judgement in determining whether such reasons would be suitable grounds for mutual recognition.<ref>Scanlon 194</ref> Therefore, that a principle would negatively affect a person's well-being is not the only kind of reason which may be brought against a principle. Other considerations, such as how a burden would be imposed by a principle, can serve as reasonable grounds for rejection.

While contractualism only provides an account of that central part of morality which deals with what we owe to each other, Scanlon writes that this part of morality is related to the broader realm of morality in complex ways. There is pressure for the morality of what we owe to each other to acknowledge the values included in the broader realm of morality insofar as principles which don't make room for these values could be reasonably rejected. In turn, these values must accommodate the dictates of what we owe to each other to the extent that they involve relations with others, who have separate moral standing.<ref>Scanlon 174</ref>

==In popular culture==
Scanlon's ''What We Owe to Each Other'' is referenced multiple times in the American television series ''[[The Good Place]]'', serving as the initial text used to instruct a woman who has apparently ended up in a [[Heaven]] by mistake.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Emily|title=Dystopia in 'The Good Place'|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/06/dystopia-in-the-good-place|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=5 February 2018|ref=Nussbaum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Woojin|title=Asking Philosopher T.

Scanlon's ideas play a prominent role in the series finale, in which protagonist Eleanor finally finishes reading Scanlon's book, and uses the principles of contractualism to explain a crucial decision that she makes.

'''Thomas Michael''' \"'''Tim'''\" '''Scanlon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|æ|n|l|ən}}; born 1940), usually cited as '''T. M. Scanlon''', is an American philosopher.  At the time of his retirement in 2016, he was the Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy, and Civil Polity<ref name=Alford>\"The Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy, and Civil Polity is among the oldest endowed chairs at Harvard University, having been first established in 1789. Past holders of the chair include Josiah Royce, Gerge Herbert Palmer, William Ernest Hocking, and Roderick Firth.\" [https://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/news/selim-berker-appointed-alford-professor]</ref> in [[Harvard University]]'s Department of [[Philosophy]], where he had taught since 1984.<ref name=harvard_bio /><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/event/celebration-philosophy-and-teaching-tm-scanlon |title = Celebration of the Philosophy and Teaching of T.M.

==Life and career==

Born June 28, 1940, Scanlon grew up in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]; obtained his undergraduate degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1962;  earned his [[PhD]] in philosophy from Harvard under [[Burton Dreben]]; studied for a year at [[Oxford University]] on a [[Fulbright Scholarship]]; and returned to Princeton University, where he taught from 1966 until 1984.<ref name=harvard_bio>{{Cite web | url=http://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/people/thomas-m-scanlon | title=Thomas M. Scanlon}}</ref> He was made a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellow]] in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/172/|title=Thomas M. Scanlon - MacArthur Foundation|website=www.macfound.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}</ref>

His teaching in the department has included courses on theories of justice, equality, and recent ethical theory. His book, ''What We Owe to Each Other'', was published by [[Harvard University Press]] in 1998; a collection of papers on political theory, ''The Difficulty of Tolerance'', was published by Cambridge University Press in 2003.

Scanlon is the father-in-law of philosopher and scholar of [[African-American studies]] [[Tommie Shelby]].

==Philosophical work==

His dissertation and some of his first papers were in [[mathematical logic]], where his main concern was in [[proof theory]], but he turned to [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]], where he developed a version of [[contractualism]] in the line of [[John Rawls]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].  Scanlon has also published important work on [[freedom of speech]], equality, [[toleration|tolerance]], foundations of [[contract law]], [[human rights]], conceptions of [[welfare]], theories of justice, as well as on foundational questions in moral theory.

=== Contractualism ===
{{essay|date=July 2019}}
Contractualism is an attempt at providing a unified account of the subject matter of a central part of morality which Scanlon calls \"what we owe to each other\". The normative domain of what we owe to each other is meant to encompass those duties to other people which we bear in virtue of their standing as rational creatures. A broader conception of morality includes whatever else we may owe to specific people, such as the special obligations we bear in relations with friends and family, or whatever else morality may require of us, such as the way in which we treat ourselves or nature. Scanlon believes that what we owe to each other, or what we could loosely call \"the morality of right and wrong\", is distinct from this broader conception of morality in that contractualism provides a unified account of its content.<ref>Scanlon, T.&nbsp;M., 1998, ''What We Owe to Each Other'', pp. 6–7</ref>

In Scanlon's contractualism, judgements about right and wrong, unlike [[empirical]] judgements, are not theoretical claims about the nature of the [[spatiotemporal]] world but rather practical claims about what we have reason to do.<ref>Scanlon 2</ref> Further, they are a particularly important class of practical claims in that the judgement that an action is wrong is taken to provide reasons to not do that action which are most often considered to be decisive against competing reasons.<ref>Scanlon 1</ref> Following this point, Scanlon takes questions about the reason-giving force of moral judgements to be prior to questions about the subject matter of the morality of right and wrong.<ref>Scanlon 3</ref> More explicitly, he thinks that if we provide an account of the extraordinary reason-giving force of moral judgements then this account could largely form the basis for a characterisation of the subject matter of what we owe to each other.

Scanlon grounds the reason-giving force of judgements about right and wrong in \"the positive value of a way of living with others\".<ref>Scanlon 162</ref> A way of living with others which is typified by an ideal of mutual recognition between rational agents, where mutual recognition demands that moral agents acknowledge the value of human life and respond to this value in the right ways.

On the question of how ought we to value human, or rational, life, Scanlon argues that different valuable things require different ways of valuing. In contrast to [[teleological]] accounts of value, often to take something to be of value is not only to see reason to bring about a maximal amount of that thing.<ref>Scanlon 78–100</ref> This is especially true when considering the value of human life. When we value human life, he writes, we do not see this as a reason to create as much human life as we can. Rather, we tend to see reason to respect other human beings, to protect them from death and other forms of harm and, in general, to want their lives to go well. More important for Scanlon, to value rational life is to recognize the features which distinguish rational life from other valuable things, specifically, the ability of rational creatures to assess reasons and judgements, and to govern their lives in accordance with these assessments. Scanlon asserts that the proper response to the recognition of these distinctive features is to treat rational creatures in terms of principles which they could not reasonably reject.<ref>Scanlon 105–106</ref>

From this point, Scanlon's account of the value of rational life provides a focus around which his account of the reason-giving force of moral judgements dovetails quite neatly with a characterization of the method of reasoning which we use to arrive at judgements of right and wrong, a method, moreover, which seems to be phenomenologically plausible. The reason-giving force of moral judgements is grounded in an ideal of mutual recognition which requires treating others in accordance with principles that they could not reasonably reject. Because mutual recognition requires that these other people are also appropriately motivated, this entails Scanlon's formulation of wrongness: \"An act is wrong if and only if any principle that permitted it would be one that could reasonably be rejected by people moved to find principles for the general regulation of behaviour that others, similarly motivated, could not reasonably reject\".<ref>Scanlon 4</ref> I will call this the contractualist formulation. An act is right, quite simply, if a principle permitting it could not reasonably be rejected in terms of the aforementioned formulation.

Regarding how moral principles are derived from the contractualist formulation, when considering whether a principle can be rejected we must take into account the consequences, in general, of its being accepted, not only the consequences of the particular actions that it allows.<ref>Scanlon 203–204</ref> Because we cannot be sure about who will be affected by a principle, and how they will be affected, we must draw on our experience of life and consider the \"generic reasons\" which individuals are likely to have, as a result of their general circumstances, to reject a principle.<ref>Scanlon 204–205</ref> In order to determine whether a principle is reasonably rejectable, we must impartially weigh these generic reasons against each other,<ref>Scanlon 195</ref> and exercising our judgement, draw a conclusion about what the weight of reasons support.<ref>Scanlon 218</ref> Given the motivation of finding principles for the general regulation of society that no-one could reasonably reject, if the weight of reasons support a certain conclusion then it would be unreasonable to reject that conclusion.<ref>Scanlon 192</ref> Importantly, principles can only be rejected by individuals; aggregation of reasons across individuals is not allowed.<ref>Scanlon 229–230</ref> So if the generic reasons of an individual carry more weight than any other individual's generic reasons, then his generic reasons are (for the most part) decisive in determining principles.

The generic reasons which are open to consideration under the contractualist formulation are any reasons which we judge as relevant to reasonable rejectability. This requires that we exercise our judgement in determining whether such reasons would be suitable grounds for mutual recognition.<ref>Scanlon 194</ref> Therefore, that a principle would negatively affect a person's well-being is not the only kind of reason which may be brought against a principle. Other considerations, such as how a burden would be imposed by a principle, can serve as reasonable grounds for rejection.

While contractualism only provides an account of that central part of morality which deals with what we owe to each other, Scanlon writes that this part of morality is related to the broader realm of morality in complex ways. There is pressure for the morality of what we owe to each other to acknowledge the values included in the broader realm of morality insofar as principles which don't make room for these values could be reasonably rejected. In turn, these values must accommodate the dictates of what we owe to each other to the extent that they involve relations with others, who have separate moral standing.<ref>Scanlon 174</ref>

==In popular culture==
Scanlon's ''What We Owe to Each Other'' is referenced multiple times in the American television series ''[[The Good Place]]'', serving as the initial text used to instruct a woman who has apparently ended up in a [[Heaven]] by mistake.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Emily|title=Dystopia in 'The Good Place'|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/06/dystopia-in-the-good-place|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=5 February 2018|ref=Nussbaum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Woojin|title=Asking Philosopher T.

|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/10/scanlon-and-the-good-place/|website=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=11 October 2019|ref=Lim}}</ref> The phrase \"What We Owe to Each Other\" is used as the title of the sixth episode of the first season, and that episode features a summary of Scanlon's ideas, as does the season two [[Season finale|finale]]. Scanlon's ideas play a prominent role in the series finale, in which protagonist Eleanor finally finishes reading Scanlon's book, and uses the principles of contractualism to explain a crucial decision that she makes.
